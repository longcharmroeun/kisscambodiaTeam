1
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:28,312
It's not that wonderful
to be tortured together.

2
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,460
What I have is torture.

3
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:37,594
Goodbye.

4
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:39,664
Chan Seong.

5
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:45,805
She's gone.

6
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:54,524
(Episode 9)

7
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:20,905
Hey.

8
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,375
Can you see that?

9
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,174
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

10
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:28,875
Let's go.

11
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:32,723
I didn't know a place like
this existed in Myeong-dong.

12
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,761
- Me neither.
- Let's go.

13
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:07,097
Mr. Ku must feel very flustered.

14
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,243
He worked with us for quite some time.

15
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:11,738
Shouldn't you at least leave him a text?

16
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,933
Instead of leaving him a text,
I gave him something else.

17
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:17,444
I gave him a severance pay
and a dismissal notice.

18
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,009
I guess you just think of him...

19
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:28,429
as the 99th human that worked for you.

20
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:32,594
No, Chan Seong is special.

21
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,752
I don't want to become weak-hearted.

22
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,856
I'm trying to be stronger.

23
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:43,903
I haven't heard such sentimental
words from you in...

24
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:48,524
No, this is the first time in 500 years.

25
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,524
500 years?

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,047
Has it been that long since you died?

27
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,023
What are you still doing
here for 500 years?

28
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:58,092
I shouldn't be hearing that from a ghost...

29
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,192
who's been here twice as long.

30
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:03,162
I can't go because I'm
tied to the Moon Tree.

31
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:04,863
I can't go because I still have...

32
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:07,316
shame to clear up in this world.

33
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,663
I can't face my ancestors
in the afterlife like this.

34
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:14,169
Even if you go to the afterlife
you won't meet your ancestors.

35
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,525
They must have reincarnated
couple of times already.

36
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:18,554
There's no need for you to worry.

37
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,042
I can remain at the hotel...

38
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:22,882
and continue to worry.

39
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:24,973
But will you be all right like this?

40
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,882
Will you be all right
giving up your chance...

41
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:30,447
to go to the afterlife through Mr. Ku?

42
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:35,379
I won't give up the chance easily.

43
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:39,716
In the future, try to speed up...

44
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,062
and take care of your
shame left in this life.

45
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,678
There won't be much time.

46
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,009
If you can't solve it, take the bus
to the afterlife without regrets.

47
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:51,542
What about the guests? Did
you send them off properly?

48
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,693
We moved them with the help
from the death guides.

49
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,408
Although there was some confusion
due to the sudden move.

50
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:00,412
Those of you who have no regrets...

51
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:02,752
and can leave right now.

52
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:04,469
Please take the bus on this side.

53
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,292
Those of you who can't leave
because of your resentments.

54
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,863
Please standby here.

55
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:10,062
(To this life, to the afterlife)

56
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:11,346
You must not get confused.

57
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:14,594
Once you get on the bus,
you can't turn back.

58
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,233
Are you going to the afterlife?

59
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,556
My older child went to college
and is doing well now.

60
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,286
I will leave now.

61
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:27,512
You went to wake up your son
in his dreams every morning.

62
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:28,897
I'm glad he finally went to college.

63
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:30,123
Have a good trip.

64
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:35,183
(To the afterlife)

65
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:39,471
(To this life, to the afterlife)

66
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:43,147
You must choose a line.

67
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:47,071
I can't decide whether to go
to the afterlife or stay here.

68
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,757
Did you finish the novel
you were working on?

69
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,666
No. I couldn't finish it when I was alive.

70
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,458
I guess I can't finish it when I'm dead.

71
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:57,315
I had better go.

72
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:01,866
(To this life, to the afterlife)

73
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:04,927
Should I stay and write it?

74
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,974
This guest can't make up his mind.

75
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:13,504
He won't be able to leave.

76
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,623
He doesn't need to finish his novel.

77
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:19,319
He can only leave when he
gives up what he can't do.

78
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:21,985
This bus goes to the afterlife.

79
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:24,202
You must be careful to
choose the right line.

80
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,747
You can't go back.

81
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:29,202
A few of the staffers went
on the bus to the afterlife.

82
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:31,031
We will be shorthanded for a while.

83
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:35,122
Encourage the staffers to
go to the afterlife also.

84
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,783
Why are you acting as if
you'll close down the hotel?

85
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:41,155
We've moved to a new place so we
need to find a human manager.

86
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,534
No need.

87
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:44,735
We have Yu Na.

88
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,993
Did they move all my things?

89
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:50,093
Smart Ms. Fourth Choice
called a moving company...

90
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,516
and took care of all your things.

91
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,358
Hey. You have to drive.

92
00:05:57,202 --> 00:06:00,131
I've ridden a horse, but I
have yet to drive a car.

93
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:03,973
You haven't even learned to
drive a car for 500 years?

94
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:07,446
You're the weird ghost
who drives around a car.

95
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,295
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,596
Darn.

97
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:27,363
Why are you laughing?

98
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,382
It's funny to see a ghost
putting on the seatbelt.

99
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:34,173
I like that this is an open car.

100
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,233
This is my first time after
riding in your Pony 2.

101
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:39,432
It seems you like this pretentious thing.

102
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:41,399
Get in and let's take this for a run.

103
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,858
Giddy-up!

104
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:46,376
"Giddy-up"? What a fool.

105
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,745
The new place is in country side?

106
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:59,190
This is nice. It's like going on a picnic.

107
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:00,704
What?

108
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,962
I'm talking on the phone.

109
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:04,891
Just follow the navigation.

110
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,145
Okay.

111
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:10,207
I'd better get the driver
license to get to work.

112
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,543
Just concentrate on your school.

113
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,633
Summer holiday has started, stupid.

114
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,661
Also I will graduate soon.

115
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:19,486
Her parents said they'll get
me a car if I go to college.

116
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,147
I have an apartment under my name too.

117
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:25,178
I'll get my own place
as soon as I graduate.

118
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:32,628
It's difficult to live
with her parents, right?

119
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:38,137
I'm just paying a very high price.

120
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:45,798
This is strong. Do you want a sip?

121
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:47,894
What?

122
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,356
Would you?

123
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:50,755
I'm fine.

124
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,215
What's wrong?

125
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:17,292
There's a woman in the car in front of us.

126
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,811
Don't look. She can mean danger for you.

127
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,263
Help me.

128
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:30,095
Help me.

129
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:31,767
Help me.

130
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:34,790
Help me.

131
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,333
There are many spirits in this life.

132
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,645
Don't be too concerned about them.

133
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,232
I'm meant to be the manager
of Hotel Del Luna.

134
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:46,258
Let's take that spirit as our guest.

135
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,383
Sir.

136
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:50,772
A grey car just passed by us.

137
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,912
Can you go after it?

138
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:54,012
- What?
- I'll pay you extra money.

139
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:55,658
- Can you go faster?
- Okay.

140
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,727
You'll get in trouble with Ms. Jang.

141
00:08:57,782 --> 00:09:00,034
You're not even a hotel manager.

142
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:01,294
Faster, please.

143
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,409
(Pharmacy)

144
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:20,888
Are you looking for Hotel Del Luna?

145
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:24,330
Did you know that the hotel moved?

146
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:27,166
You must know where it moved.

147
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:30,271
If I do, will you go looking for it again?

148
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,336
You nearly died because of Man Weol.

149
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:40,234
I heard you embraced that potent curse.

150
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:45,075
If you hadn't unraveled that,
your soul would've been wounded.

151
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:52,190
Chan Seong, let it go.

152
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:56,092
Man Weol protected me.

153
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,584
I'm fine.

154
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:00,136
Man Weol is fine thanks to you.

155
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,798
You are the one who protected her.

156
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:06,217
My sister chose the right person.

157
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:08,602
So keep on doing your good work.

158
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:12,917
Was I sent to that hotel for that purpose?

159
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:16,888
When the terrible fate comes
to her from the past,

160
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:19,892
am I supposed to block her from it?

161
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:23,367
You successfully carried out your mission.
Why are you angry?

162
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,529
Do you feel pity for Man Weol
who you saw in your dreams?

163
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:29,163
Yes, I do.

164
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:33,545
I feel angry that you praise
me for not taking sides.

165
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,506
She discarded me because I got in her way.

166
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:38,796
Are you telling me...

167
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,353
to keep on getting in her way?

168
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:43,575
It's cool to take sides.

169
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,276
Getting in the way is not cool.

170
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:50,701
Everyone wants...

171
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,709
the role of embracing and consoling her.

172
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:57,169
The shabby role of getting in the
way, holding on, and begging...

173
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,555
can only be done by a good person.

174
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:02,820
Don't overestimate me.

175
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,538
I don't want to take the
role that nobody wants.

176
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:07,026
I'm not such a good person.

177
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:10,238
Really? Then you can quit.

178
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:14,696
Just eat this.

179
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:23,474
What is this?

180
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:27,026
That medicine will take away
your ability to see ghosts.

181
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,630
You won't see the dead spirits
and Hotel Del Luna...

182
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,924
any longer.

183
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,627
You mean, I won't be
able to see all of them?

184
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:42,335
She abandoned you too.

185
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,712
I have to give you the
chance to discard her too.

186
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:51,524
Sometimes, we can be very fair.

187
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,983
I came here for a way to find her.

188
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,554
But you give the way to never go back.

189
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:03,285
The results are not given by the deities.

190
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,518
It's made by humans.

191
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:08,623
It's always the same.

192
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,287
Thank you for giving me this chance.

193
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:17,236
Wait. Will you take it now?

194
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:19,213
You will not even think about it?

195
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,071
Did you think I won't take
it after thinking about it?

196
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,735
Because I was a good person?

197
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:25,764
I told you.

198
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:29,391
I'm not good enough to volunteer
only to take shabby roles.

199
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:32,847
I still hesitate...

200
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,251
only because she is in my heart.

201
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:47,134
Hugging and comforting her
is nowhere enough for her.

202
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:49,556
She's an awful woman.

203
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:53,101
She abandoned me because I got in her way.

204
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:56,700
Even if I went back, she
wouldn't welcome me.

205
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,986
And you never know when she'll
do something dangerous again.

206
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:12,531
But I will think about
if I like her so much...

207
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:15,188
that I can run back and
beg her to accept me.

208
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:36,063
If it's old, it should
at least look antique.

209
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:38,557
If it's tiny, it should at least be cute.

210
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:44,132
No matter how much I look at this,
it looks absolutely hideous.

211
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:48,302
This was the only piece of land we
could buy with such small fund.

212
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:51,675
But there is a cemetery
over the hills over there.

213
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,012
The land is dark and damp, so it's great.

214
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:57,542
And this place has great water,
so it's famous for rice wine too.

215
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,213
Back when you were poor and
starving as you ran Man Weol Inn,

216
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:03,123
you always had rice wine with
radish kimchi, remember?

217
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,496
That rice wine was made here.

218
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,945
Stop talking about that time.

219
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:09,162
The building looks awfully ugly enough.

220
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,041
I'm starting to feel like I'm
as poor as I was back then.

221
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,162
Anyway, the air is really fresh.
There's no fine dust here.

222
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:19,837
Fine dust? If it was around,
could you breathe it in?

223
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:23,336
I can't believe a ghost is talking
about fresh water and air.

224
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:29,269
Fine, I can just ignore the outside.

225
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:32,272
It's all the same once I'm inside.

226
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,134
Hurry up and come.

227
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:07,946
The lobby looks a bit
smaller, don't you think?

228
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:11,392
It's just your imagination.
It looks the same.

229
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:14,796
People that you quickly sent over
to the afterlife complained.

230
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:16,863
We couldn't bloom enough
flowers in the garden,

231
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:18,882
so of course, we became poorer.

232
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,063
It'll be the middle of the month,
so we'll have more guests.

233
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:24,617
We have a great location.

234
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,203
I'm thirsty.

235
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,703
I'll be in the garden looking at
the Moon Tree. Bring champagne.

236
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:34,107
Your stuff isn't here yet,
so we have no champagne.

237
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,293
What?

238
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:39,105
Why aren't they here yet?

239
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:41,745
Are they slacking off somewhere else?

240
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:45,282
Why don't we grab some rice wine for once?

241
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,967
Let's think of our old times.

242
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:53,018
I just said I didn't want
to talk about that time.

243
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:56,985
You forgot what I just said.

244
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,585
Mr. Kim.

245
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:03,597
Maybe it's because you forgot...

246
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:06,536
what your grudge of 500 years is,

247
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,658
like a goldfish.

248
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,194
A goldfish?

249
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:14,512
I'm a scholar who passed a state exam.

250
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:17,983
I could be an elegant
crane, not a goldfish.

251
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,133
A crane?

252
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:22,912
Both a crane and a goldfish are stupid.

253
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:33,901
What? "Stupid"?

254
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:37,302
I can't believe that mean and crude woman.

255
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:38,485
Hold yourself back.

256
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,343
The outside of this hotel looks
ugly, so she's a bit ticked off.

257
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:44,483
Jang Man Weol only looks
okay on the outside.

258
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,270
She's definitely evil on the inside.

259
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,052
She fired Mr. Ku,

260
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,182
and she even called in a human
to do something suspicious.

261
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:54,758
Don't you think she sacked Mr. Ku
because of what happened back then?

262
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:58,761
She said she cut him off because she
was afraid she'd become weaker.

263
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,633
I'm afraid she might do
something dangerous again.

264
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,580
There is no human to stop her anymore.

265
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,432
So Mr. Ku can't see spirits anymore?

266
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,202
Ms. Jang said so.

267
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:12,808
I guess she threw a huge
crude fit at Ma Go.

268
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,795
A goldfish?

269
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:31,840
Hey, I thought they would all
fall off after our move,

270
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:33,650
but they're still there.

271
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,972
Did you make sure that Ku Chan
Seong can't see spirits anymore?

272
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,245
I gave him the medicine.

273
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:43,195
If he takes it, he won't
see spirits any longer.

274
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:45,884
Okay.

275
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,854
Good.

276
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:53,831
I let you have your way because you
asked nicely for the first time.

277
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,448
But it's up to him to decide...

278
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:58,808
to take the medicine or not.

279
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,538
What would he do?

280
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:04,476
Are you having fun?

281
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,363
While I'm nice, let me
ask for another favor.

282
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:09,383
Can you turn back these blue things?

283
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,553
I can't do anything about those.

284
00:18:12,702 --> 00:18:15,065
That's how you feel.

285
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:19,486
It's up to you to bloom these flowers.

286
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,714
The buds look so pretty.

287
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:31,094
I would feel so bad for them if
they can't bloom the flowers.

288
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:35,088
Don't look forward to it.
You won't see any flowers.

289
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:37,991
Do not dream of seeing any flower here.

290
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,400
Nothing changes even in the night.

291
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:09,057
Take the medicine.
Then you won't have to...

292
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,505
see any spirits or Hotel Del Luna anymore.

293
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:13,544
Is this horrific?

294
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,922
Then run away, Chan Seong.

295
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:57,129
Are you looking for a hotel?

296
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:01,204
Hotel Del Luna is not here anymore.

297
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:04,997
I'd love to take you there,

298
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:06,924
but I am...

299
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:10,697
not going there anymore.

300
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:12,803
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:49,604
Are you a human?

302
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,607
Do I look like a ghost?

303
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:54,675
Who are you?

304
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,214
What about you?

305
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,187
I'm with the real estate office.

306
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:04,101
I came to take pictures to upload
this place for sale on our website.

307
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:05,924
For sale?

308
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:07,990
They'll sell this place?

309
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:11,482
Yes, is there a problem?

310
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,240
Yes, there are a lot of
problems in this place.

311
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,162
- Yes.
- Let's see.

312
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:24,593
- Yes.
- I have nothing to wear.

313
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:25,743
All right.

314
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:30,033
Ms. Jang, I got a call from
the real estate agent.

315
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:31,952
He asked if you paid the inheritance tax.

316
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:35,343
- What tax?
- If you didn't pay that,

317
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,702
there could be a problem
with the transfer tax.

318
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:40,703
I'm not really sure what he's saying.

319
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,294
How would I know?

320
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,133
Should I call Mr. Ku?

321
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:48,907
No. You can't call him.

322
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:55,247
Is there any ghost who would
know a thing about this?

323
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:59,132
He used to work for the biggest law
firm in Korea, Jang and Young.

324
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:00,863
Then he died from overworking.

325
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,763
He said he used to be a
very competent lawyer.

326
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:04,914
Really?

327
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:09,103
Mr. Jang and Young. So what's the problem?

328
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:11,373
What's the deal with the inheritance tax?

329
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,013
The late Mr. No Jun Seok...

330
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:16,043
left the building to you, Ms. Jang.

331
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,314
And he prepared all the paperwork
for you to pay the inheritance tax.

332
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:20,865
You can just turn it in.

333
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:22,563
With what?

334
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:24,623
Didn't you prepare anything?

335
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,123
No idea. The guy who
prepared that isn't here.

336
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:29,143
I have no idea how and
what the guy prepared.

337
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:34,632
You're planning to sell your
land to pay those taxes.

338
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:36,178
And you have to pay the inheritance
tax, the security loan...

339
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:38,921
and the transfer tax...

340
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:40,616
Let's see.

341
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:47,290
You won't be left with much
after selling the place.

342
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:49,699
Why not? It's my land.

343
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:51,412
I was told the place is very expensive.

344
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,573
If I sold it, why don't I
have any money left over?

345
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,099
That's how it works with taxes.

346
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,123
You should pay the inheritance tax...

347
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,214
and just hold onto it.

348
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:10,591
Mr. Jang and Young.

349
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:12,819
What are you doing? You
have to take care of this.

350
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:16,013
Mr. Jang and Young.

351
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,402
Mr. Jang and Young.

352
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:21,543
He died from working too much.

353
00:23:21,543 --> 00:23:24,209
He faints if he reads anything
for more than five minutes.

354
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:32,824
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

355
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,165
Darn it.

356
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,524
Sure thing. Please give me a call, then.

357
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:41,864
By the way, how did you know
about the inheritance tax?

358
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,418
I came to see the building,

359
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,435
and I ran into someone by
the name Ku Chan Seong.

360
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:49,629
He's here with me right now.

361
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:52,724
Right now?

362
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:57,168
Could I speak to him?

363
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:59,616
Is this Korean?

364
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:04,685
Ms. Jang, why don't you
speak to him directly?

365
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,954
I have no clue what he's talking about.

366
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:08,816
And do you think I'd know?

367
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,900
Hey, Mr. Realtor. Give it
to me short and simple.

368
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,485
How much will I get out of it?

369
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,313
Don't try to swindle me.

370
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:22,112
I have a talented employee...

371
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,728
who got his MBA from Harvard.

372
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,494
But you fired me.

373
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,483
Ku Chan Seong?

374
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:30,823
You don't know anything about
the inheritance tax...

375
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,236
or the transfer tax, do you?

376
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:34,644
Why did you fire your talented employee?

377
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,377
Why are you over there?

378
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:40,655
Did you get hired by a realtor?

379
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,256
I came here because I was flustered
after getting fired overnight.

380
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:44,876
You must be regretting firing me.

381
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:51,364
If you just ask me to come back,

382
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:53,188
I can be there immediately.

383
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:59,700
Tell this to the realtor.

384
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:01,770
He should kick out anyone that's unrelated,

385
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:03,799
and lock up the place well.

386
00:25:07,493 --> 00:25:09,685
Okay. I got it.

387
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:22,733
Was Mr. Ku over there?

388
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:26,942
He must have been searching
for us all night long.

389
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,682
(General Manager Ku Chan Seong)

390
00:25:28,682 --> 00:25:31,471
Even if he calls back, tell him
to call us when he's dead.

391
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:36,238
Darn that Hyun Joong and Yu Na!

392
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,443
Check if they're on their way.

393
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:41,234
Okay.

394
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,805
If you don't like those, where these.

395
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:15,048
No. They're not my style.

396
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,554
Wear your those tacky brown shoes...

397
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,668
and go work at a normal hotel.

398
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:32,685
Okay, Chan Seong?

399
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,797
I have to lock up, so please leave.

400
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,170
Hey, where are we?

401
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,301
We got lost while chasing the other car.

402
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,659
Even the GPS can't find this road.

403
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:47,979
Where on earth are we?

404
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:52,170
(Standard Packaged Moving)

405
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:56,919
What's the matter?

406
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,147
I saw someone on the road.

407
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,013
I don't see anyone.

408
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:06,445
There.

409
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,384
Gosh.

410
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:16,295
I'm sorry.

411
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,295
The car is not cooperating.

412
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,025
No.

413
00:28:21,652 --> 00:28:23,238
I think you came to the right place.

414
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:28,316
I'll go out to a bigger road to
meet with the insurance company.

415
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:30,073
See you later.

416
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,076
Darn it.

417
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:36,876
It was a man just now, wasn't it?

418
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:39,391
The person in the car earlier was a woman.

419
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,151
- Let's go and see.
- Yu Na.

420
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,515
I think it'll be too dangerous.

421
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:47,498
You're a ghost too. I
used to be one as well.

422
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:49,663
It's not that. Did you see the driver...

423
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:51,596
of that car?

424
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,285
It was a young man wearing sunglasses.

425
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:00,517
There was a dead spirit in that man's car,

426
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:03,145
and when we chased after him,
we found another spirit.

427
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,222
It feels a little...

428
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:09,475
Do you think they were killed by that man?

429
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:11,654
Humans can be more dangerous than ghosts.

430
00:29:11,702 --> 00:29:14,560
If they died wrongfully,
I can't just leave.

431
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:17,991
I died wrongfully too.

432
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:21,425
I'll be careful.

433
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:25,641
Then you have to promise to run
to the car if you see a human.

434
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,627
- Okay?
- Okay.

435
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,689
Usually, it's people who fear ghosts.

436
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:34,639
But we, ghosts are scared of humans.

437
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,705
You're right.

438
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:39,453
He looked like an ordinary person.

439
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:19,533
This is our signature cocktail...

440
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:22,401
the guests at the bar like the most.

441
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,986
"Tears".

442
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,868
- Did you make this?
- I did.

443
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:31,834
They dream of life here while being drunk.

444
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:33,912
These might be the last drops of tears...

445
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,801
while they dream their lives away.

446
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:40,819
Why would you name it in English
when you were a Confucian scholar?

447
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:42,763
You're trying too hard to look cool.

448
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:44,763
I don't think someone who
named this hotel with...

449
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:47,560
a pretentious name like "Hotel
Del Luna" can criticize.

450
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:55,244
Cocktails made by ghosts are so disgusting.

451
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,562
I heard rice wine is
famous in this village.

452
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,157
Don't you have any rice wine?

453
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:04,513
You're the one who told
me to never bring it up.

454
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:05,513
Did you forget?

455
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:08,381
Since when were you so
obedient to my orders?

456
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,680
I lost my appetite because
of this cocktail.

457
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,063
She can't go shopping when she's bored,

458
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:21,608
so she's being temperamental with me.

459
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,047
It's delicious to me.

460
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:32,762
(Main Building)

461
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,027
(Boram Rice Wine)

462
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,204
It's delicious.

463
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:05,155
What's this?

464
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:12,901
Who drank all this?

465
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:25,619
This place makes amazing rice wine.

466
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:29,890
I wonder if there's anything to snack on.

467
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:32,221
Is there a radish field around here?

468
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,974
This will taste great with some radish.

469
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:42,427
Let's see. Where's the radish field?

470
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:55,054
No wonder the rice wine tasted so nice.

471
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:19,342
Are you the big tree beyond
that hill over there?

472
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:21,894
Yes.

473
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:24,970
I noticed that you've
built a very nice house.

474
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:27,592
That place must be the
Guest House of the Moon,

475
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:29,208
the place where spirits come
to stay before they leave.

476
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:30,773
Yes.

477
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:33,111
I'm the owner of that place.

478
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:35,963
I'm the Spirit of the Well of this village.

479
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,074
(Spirit of the Well: A deity
that protects the village well)

480
00:33:37,503 --> 00:33:40,072
The village has a deity
that protects its well.

481
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:41,790
No wonder the water in this
village tasted so nice.

482
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:45,202
I was able to have some
nice wine thanks to you.

483
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:07,863
You got fired? Did you
get fired because of me?

484
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,333
What in the world did you do...

485
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,554
to cause so much trouble
at Chan Seong's hotel?

486
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:13,985
I can't remember.

487
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:16,302
I remember feeling really happy
because the hotel was so nice.

488
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,090
But I can't remember
anything else after that.

489
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:20,156
And when I woke up,

490
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,490
I was drunk in a cab.

491
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,356
I can't remember if I drank.

492
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:26,583
You probably did. You love alcohol.

493
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,383
You probably got drunk and caused trouble.

494
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,383
You often tend to do that. I've
seen you a couple of times.

495
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,595
It wasn't because of Mi Ra.

496
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:33,804
I just got fired...

497
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:37,183
because she thought I was a nuisance.

498
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:42,180
I should find a way to go back.

499
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:49,993
I guess Man Weol dumped Chan Seong.

500
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:52,397
But it's not like they
went out with each other.

501
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,328
Chan Seong liked her.

502
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,313
Man Weol left him with a
really expensive painting...

503
00:34:56,313 --> 00:34:58,060
so he'd leave her alone.

504
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,583
I've seen a few members
from my yacht club...

505
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:00,983
do the same thing.

506
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:02,182
But I never thought Man Wol
would do that as well.

507
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:03,383
She's so mean.

508
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:06,827
Are you saying that huge
painting of the mountain...

509
00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:08,952
is worth a lot of money?

510
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:11,762
Did she really have to give him
a painting of Mount Baekdu?

511
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:15,125
He's going to feel sad every time
he listens to the national anthem.

512
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:22,240
Until that day when Mount Baekdu

513
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:33,564
Sir.

514
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:37,589
I guess you have the ability
to see dead people.

515
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:43,250
I saw on the news that you passed away.

516
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:45,340
I'm sorry I didn't get to visit you.

517
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:51,105
I wanted to see this painting
one last time before I leave.

518
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:54,702
Is the tiger inside this painting?

519
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:56,823
The tiger spent a comfortable time
at the hotel I used to work at,

520
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,915
and it eventually left to its afterlife.

521
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:00,443
A hotel?

522
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:04,180
Only dead people like you
can visit that hotel.

523
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:07,614
You're working at a very interesting hotel.

524
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:10,045
I'd like to go there too.

525
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:12,834
You can go there.

526
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:16,018
You'll be able to see it very well.

527
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:22,603
Are you going somewhere?

528
00:36:23,162 --> 00:36:24,981
Yes, I'm going to the hotel.

529
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,585
I thought you can't go there anymore.

530
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:27,946
I found a way.

531
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:30,953
Let's go.

532
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,282
Chan Seong has a lot of pride.

533
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,403
I wonder if he's going
there to cling onto her.

534
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,094
What a surprise.

535
00:36:43,483 --> 00:36:45,604
You're really weird too.

536
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,492
Why aren't you stopping him?

537
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:49,523
You came all the way here
because of Chan Seong.

538
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,623
You kept interrupting their date.
Why are you just letting him go?

539
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:53,944
I just...

540
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,932
decided to give up.

541
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:56,963
What?

542
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:59,699
I wanted to make Chan Seong
come back to me,

543
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,559
but I figured I should just give up...

544
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:04,972
once I met Jang Man Wol.

545
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,113
Why? Because she's rich?
Or because she's pretty?

546
00:37:08,113 --> 00:37:10,668
I make good money, and I'm pretty too.

547
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:16,187
But I had a feeling that
I'm no match for her.

548
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:18,998
I wonder what's wrong with me.

549
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,072
Do I owe her something
from my previous life?

550
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,442
That's possible.

551
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:26,011
You owe a lot of money
in this life as well.

552
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:29,003
I'm going to pay everything back.

553
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:33,110
Plus, I hold our alumni
reunion at your restaurant.

554
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:35,449
I should check the group chat.

555
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,012
I'm also a member of that group chat,

556
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:41,372
and I'm the one who gathers everyone.

557
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,938
Why is she acting like
she does all the work?

558
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:00,478
Are you coming back from somewhere?

559
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:01,874
Yes.

560
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:05,202
Where are all my stuff?
They're not here yet?

561
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,532
Hyun Joong and the intern ran
into ghosts on their way here.

562
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:10,360
They wish to bring them here as a guest.

563
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:13,472
I knew it.

564
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:15,331
They got sidetracked.

565
00:38:15,372 --> 00:38:18,877
Hyun Joong must've learned
that from Mr. Ku.

566
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:24,122
After what happened to
our guest in Room 13,

567
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:27,627
he could never be indifferent
to a wandering spirit.

568
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:32,334
Yes, you're right.

569
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:44,967
I brought her from the public restroom.

570
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:48,305
Do you want the red toilet paper
or the blue toilet paper?

571
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:51,313
Do you want the red toilet paper
or the blue toilet paper?

572
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:53,807
Gosh, how long have you been saying this?

573
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,731
I feel like I heard it when I was young.

574
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,643
Come with me. You should take some rest.

575
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:03,928
Do you want the red toilet paper
or the blue toilet paper?

576
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:13,326
He was hovering by the crosswalk,
so I brought him here.

577
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,995
It's not that way. It's this way.

578
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:23,313
Baby Shark

579
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:25,342
It's cute

580
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:26,999
It lives under the sea

581
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:28,265
Baby Shark

582
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,368
Don't laugh, Ms. Jang.

583
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:34,945
This song helped me bring her here.

584
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:39,563
Mommy Shark

585
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:41,693
It's pretty

586
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,202
It lives under the sea

587
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:44,545
Mommy Shark

588
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,385
My gosh.

589
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,017
He's a coward...

590
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:53,793
with such a fragile heart.

591
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:14,075
Chan Seong?

592
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,842
The late chairman came to my house.

593
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:32,357
So I brought him here.

594
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:34,912
He told me that he started
working for a hotel...

595
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,622
that's much more magnificent than mine.

596
00:40:36,622 --> 00:40:38,370
So I thought I'd pay a visit.

597
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:42,939
This place is amazing.

598
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,133
You're here as our guest,

599
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:52,051
so we'll do our best to
make you feel comfortable.

600
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,514
Ms. Choi

601
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,592
Let me take you to your room.

602
00:40:57,072 --> 00:40:58,183
Please follow me.

603
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,096
Chan Seong.

604
00:41:07,313 --> 00:41:09,313
You really played it smart.

605
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,847
You coaxed him to find our
hotel and followed him here?

606
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:13,235
I did follow him here.

607
00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:15,438
But it wasn't so I could come here.

608
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,392
I met him for another reason.

609
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,635
What reason?

610
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:21,005
Mr. Ku.

611
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:25,631
Call my secretary to settle
things regarding the painting.

612
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:28,659
They're planning to make
a memorial hall for me.

613
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,923
They'll pay you for the painting.

614
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:34,884
Yes, sir.

615
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:40,825
What painting?

616
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:43,322
The painting of the Mount
Baekdu that you got rid of...

617
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:44,767
because you thought it
kept getting in your way.

618
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:46,333
You told me...

619
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:49,092
that you couldn't sell it for even
a quarter of the price I want!

620
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:50,477
I just didn't sell it,

621
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:53,763
since the price of it would get
higher when Chairman died.

622
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:56,662
You should've told me then!
Then I wouldn't have...

623
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:57,946
You wouldn't have gotten rid of it.

624
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:01,720
Thanks for the severance pay.

625
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:06,966
- You thief.
- I didn't lie to you.

626
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:10,843
I didn't expect you to abandon...

627
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:12,496
both the painting...

628
00:42:14,853 --> 00:42:15,994
as well as me.

629
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,463
- Let's split the money.
- No thanks.

630
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:29,391
You greedy thief from Harvard!

631
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:36,133
Okay, give me a quarter of the price.

632
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,354
No.

633
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,265
I'm not selling it unless I
get the full price to myself.

634
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:45,143
You had no idea how expensive
it was when you gave it to me.

635
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:51,496
You must have gone broke.

636
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:53,835
You're drinking rice wine.

637
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:55,873
Whatever. Get out!

638
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:09,228
I'll sell the painting and bring some cash.

639
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:11,422
Money is the best way to get her.

640
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:29,605
Welcome.

641
00:43:30,863 --> 00:43:33,619
May I come in?

642
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:35,244
Of course.

643
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:39,244
Please come in.

644
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:42,847
What a friendly man.

645
00:43:43,842 --> 00:43:45,015
Thank you.

646
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:43,899
Conglomerates must have...

647
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,747
secret funds that nobody knows about.

648
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:47,468
Since they're filthy rich,

649
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:50,339
they often have money that they
forget to tell people about...

650
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:51,752
before they die.

651
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:55,837
Perhaps it could be a Swiss bank account,

652
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:59,135
a secret account in Virginia Island,

653
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:04,118
or maybe even just a safe
filled with money...

654
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,350
buried in a sunflower field or something.
You got any?

655
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,170
I don't know.

656
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,658
Think carefully.

657
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:54,781
This is water.

658
00:45:57,238 --> 00:45:58,985
Ms. Jang, we're in trouble.

659
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:03,306
Something that shouldn't be
inside the hotel is in here now.

660
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:20,710
The hotel is flooded with water.

661
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:22,875
What's in here?

662
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:26,647
It passed by me when it came in.

663
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,444
It wasn't a soul of the human.

664
00:46:29,428 --> 00:46:32,469
It was a spirit disguised
in the body of a young man.

665
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:34,850
A spirit?

666
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:42,591
I know what it is.

667
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:44,534
How did it get in here?

668
00:46:45,718 --> 00:46:48,243
This area is controlled by Ma Go.

669
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:51,817
Other deities can't get
inside without permission.

670
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:06,485
Perhaps someone let it in.

671
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:16,029
I honestly thought it was
just a regular guest.

672
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:17,432
Who is it anyway?

673
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:19,599
It's the spirit that takes care
of the well in this village.

674
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:21,161
A spirit?

675
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:24,289
You mean like the mountain spirit
in the folktale about golden axes?

676
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:27,560
Exactly. He is the Spirit of the Well.

677
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,849
How could you let such a thing in?

678
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,828
I had no idea. I've never
seen a spirit before,

679
00:47:33,828 --> 00:47:36,394
how was I supposed to know that
he wasn't just a regular ghost?

680
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,357
It's all because our
hotel just relocated...

681
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:44,363
and because Hyun Joong is absent.

682
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,724
It's all your fault!

683
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:50,173
Yes, let's just say that
everything is my fault.

684
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:53,378
What should we do now? Do I
just tell him to get out?

685
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,436
You can't chase spirits away.

686
00:47:57,819 --> 00:48:00,758
We can't tell him to get out since
we're the ones that let him in.

687
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:04,047
We have no choice but to serve him.

688
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:06,754
Why did the spirit leave his
well and come all the way here?

689
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:09,020
Something must've bothered him.

690
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:14,978
It must be a disaster out there,
without the spirit in his place.

691
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:17,593
Goodness.

692
00:48:19,308 --> 00:48:22,249
Please work diligently as it's
going to get busy from next month.

693
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:23,419
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

694
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:24,678
It's quite hot outside today.

695
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:26,669
Boss, the water taps aren't working.

696
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:29,109
What? What do you mean?

697
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:34,178
- Why isn't water coming out?
- Exactly.

698
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:35,670
This is bad.

699
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:45,794
- The well is dry.
- What do we do?

700
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:49,039
- What happened?
- How can this happen?

701
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:50,339
What's going on?

702
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,834
- It's all dry.
- How can this happen?

703
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,158
The well is the main water source
of the area, so if it dries up,

704
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,218
so will the rice wine.

705
00:49:16,269 --> 00:49:17,899
Why are we flooded with the water...

706
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:20,020
that should've been used
to make my rice wine?

707
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:23,907
My beautifully-painted
walls will all get wet.

708
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,594
My walls are going to get mold.

709
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,224
They might even rot.

710
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:34,285
Ms. Choi is checking to see
what room he's staying in.

711
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,618
We can't shoo him away,

712
00:49:35,618 --> 00:49:38,385
but maybe we can convince him to walk out.

713
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,629
I'll go and talk to him
when we know where he is.

714
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:43,158
Do you have any idea how
scary angry spirits are?

715
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:46,198
Back in the days, we even had to
give human sacrifices to calm them.

716
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:47,582
Maybe spirits didn't ask humans to do that,

717
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:50,261
but people just did that in fear.

718
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,359
Mr. Ku, why are you back here?

719
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:55,154
Didn't you meet Ma Go?

720
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:01,390
I found him.

721
00:50:02,408 --> 00:50:04,196
He's staying in the room at the end
of the hallway on the eighth floor.

722
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:07,419
Prepare drinks and some food
to make him feel better.

723
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:09,218
He said that he doesn't need anything...

724
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:10,501
except for one.

725
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:14,587
He wants Mr. Ku to come up to his room.

726
00:50:16,189 --> 00:50:17,472
Why does he want Chan Seong?

727
00:50:18,158 --> 00:50:19,441
I'm the owner. I'm going up.

728
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:23,367
No, he wants a living human.

729
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:29,331
Is he actually expecting a human sacrifice?

730
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:44,170
Where are you going?

731
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:45,488
To catch humans.

732
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:46,630
What?

733
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:50,654
He's probably angry because
of the humans in this town.

734
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:53,698
I'll catch a few of them, send
them, and make them apologize.

735
00:50:57,269 --> 00:50:59,420
- It's too dangerous.
- I don't care.

736
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,552
I won't send you in there.

737
00:51:10,149 --> 00:51:11,835
I opened the door for him.

738
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:15,079
He thanked me. I'm sure
he didn't mean to be bad.

739
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:18,531
I'll see him.

740
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:28,083
I had a question for you.

741
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:30,040
I'll ask.

742
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:32,722
Don't people usually ask, "May I ask?"

743
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:36,943
Who's that old woman that
we saw at the hospital?

744
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,494
You knew her, didn't you?

745
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:51,386
Yes, she's my younger sister.

746
00:51:51,419 --> 00:51:54,863
What? Younger sister? That old woman?

747
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:59,067
She may have grown old, but
she's still my cute sister...

748
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:00,613
who said, "Hyun Joong" when she called me.

749
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:03,141
"Hyun Joong"?

750
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:04,698
What's her name?

751
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:08,273
Hyun Mi. Ji Hyun Joong's
sister, Ji Hyun Mi.

752
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:12,844
Hyun Mi. I should visit her...

753
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:15,373
and ask if she remembers Hyun Joong.

754
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:17,261
No.

755
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:19,149
Don't do it.

756
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:21,714
Don't visit her. I mean it.

757
00:52:22,888 --> 00:52:26,689
Hey, do you think I'll say
something bad to your sister?

758
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:28,001
I like you.

759
00:52:36,328 --> 00:52:38,590
Darn it, this is awful.

760
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:41,669
Why did I say that in this
mountain full of ghosts?

761
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:42,952
Whatever!

762
00:52:43,908 --> 00:52:45,251
Be careful.

763
00:52:46,238 --> 00:52:47,460
Are you okay?

764
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:10,781
Hyun Joong.

765
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:14,251
I found him.

766
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,128
- Yu Na.
- Yes?

767
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:20,499
I don't think he's alone.

768
00:53:21,479 --> 00:53:22,721
Look.

769
00:53:46,238 --> 00:53:47,854
This is a thick fog.

770
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:53,308
If you wanted to look bold but
actually wanted me to stop you,

771
00:53:53,308 --> 00:53:54,621
I'll stop you this once.

772
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:57,603
Chan Seong, do not go inside. Go back.

773
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:01,848
I look kind of cool now
that you try to stop me.

774
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:05,222
Forget it. You're a coward.
You can hardly look cool.

775
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:06,689
Just run away.

776
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:09,051
I did you a favor and let you go.
Why did you come back?

777
00:54:09,428 --> 00:54:11,247
You gave me your time again.

778
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:15,129
It was 1, 2, 3.

779
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:17,511
Three seconds.

780
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:23,738
If you just ask me to come back,

781
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:25,526
I can be there immediately.

782
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:42,292
For a short moment, you
wanted me to return.

783
00:54:42,528 --> 00:54:43,973
This time, for three whole seconds.

784
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,554
How can I not come?

785
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,797
Do not smile. You're making me angry.

786
00:54:59,439 --> 00:55:01,569
You aren't angry. You're worried.

787
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:06,632
Don't worry.

788
00:55:07,689 --> 00:55:10,459
In my experience, I could tell
that the deities like me.

789
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:11,903
It must be because I'm weak-hearted.

790
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:18,731
Chan Seong!

791
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:43,120
Chan Seong.

792
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:45,600
Answer me. Chan Seong!

793
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:23,007
Goodness, what is this?

794
00:57:29,828 --> 00:57:31,112
Are you here?

795
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:34,216
The Spirit of the Well, are you in here?

796
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:38,638
Yes, you let me in here,

797
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:40,587
so I am very delighted.

798
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:45,273
I'm sorry, but this place isn't for you.

799
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:47,023
Please return to your place.

800
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:50,193
I do not wish to return.

801
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,649
What made you so furious?

802
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:56,952
If you tell me, I will try
my best to resolve it.

803
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:01,025
I do not wish to go back.
I do not wish to go.

804
00:58:01,459 --> 00:58:02,802
What did you say?

805
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:05,716
I ran away from there.

806
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:08,483
I am scared.

807
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:27,252
I am scared of getting abandoned.

808
00:58:29,388 --> 00:58:31,641
I've never dried up...

809
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:34,311
and gave the people fresh water.

810
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:39,223
No matter how much they took,
I was filled up again.

811
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:42,799
I gave them water to make alcohol
and let them make money.

812
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:47,073
Please let our rice wine
business become a success.

813
00:58:47,968 --> 00:58:50,867
However, I can no longer fill up...

814
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:53,635
as much water as they want.

815
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,898
I am continuously getting dried up.

816
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:04,988
Before I dry up completely and get
abandoned like an empty pond,

817
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:06,372
I ran away.

818
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:10,616
I chose to abandon them first...

819
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:13,276
while they could still miss me.

820
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:04,586
What is it like to be at the
ugly bottom of my spirit?

821
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:07,460
I am saddened.

822
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:10,946
I am sorry that I'm in a place
where I am not welcome.

823
01:00:11,618 --> 01:00:13,639
But I have nowhere else to go.

824
01:00:26,968 --> 01:00:28,454
Please help me.

825
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:54,870
I'm a lowly diety, but I'll
return the favor for the help.

826
01:00:58,598 --> 01:01:00,619
Since you saw my fears already,

827
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:03,566
I'll show you yours.

828
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:06,300
This will help you resolve your concerns.

829
01:01:46,749 --> 01:01:48,000
Is that the moon?

830
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:52,401
Chan Seong.

831
01:01:53,058 --> 01:01:54,371
Are you okay?

832
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,711
I'm okay.

833
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,283
I found a way.

834
01:02:52,078 --> 01:02:53,795
We found another one, sir!

835
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:10,910
Move out of the way.

836
01:03:16,569 --> 01:03:18,839
Today, five bodies that
were buried in secret...

837
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,829
were found on a hill.

838
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:23,508
The police believe there
might be more bodies buried,

839
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,178
and are continuing their search.

840
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:27,249
According to the police,
they believe it'll take...

841
01:03:27,249 --> 01:03:28,618
- Here.
- a few more days...

842
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:30,388
to identify the bodies,

843
01:03:30,388 --> 01:03:32,618
and it'll take over a week...

844
01:03:32,618 --> 01:03:35,158
to find the causes of deaths.

845
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:38,693
There were serial murders.
They found five bodies.

846
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:41,249
Really? Gosh.

847
01:03:41,598 --> 01:03:42,709
Bye.

848
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:50,364
Wait a minute. How did they find out?

849
01:04:01,689 --> 01:04:04,688
We brought some guests.

850
01:04:16,868 --> 01:04:19,061
- Drink up, drink up.
- Here.

851
01:04:19,138 --> 01:04:20,754
- Dig in.
- It's been a while.

852
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:21,939
It's delicious.

853
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:23,738
- This is expensive.
- You didn't change at all.

854
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:24,879
- Do you think so?
- Here.

855
01:04:24,879 --> 01:04:26,008
Mi Ra is a regular here.

856
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:27,351
I know I look young.

857
01:04:27,379 --> 01:04:29,149
- Right?
- It's nice.

858
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:31,278
- Mi Ra, you can drink orange juice.
- Why?

859
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:33,197
- You're too young.
- Watch it.

860
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,988
Hey, guys.

861
01:04:35,988 --> 01:04:37,230
Hello, Ji Won.

862
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:38,801
Hey, Ji Won!

863
01:04:38,888 --> 01:04:40,158
- It's been a while.
- Hey.

864
01:04:40,158 --> 01:04:41,805
- It's been so long.
- Hello.

865
01:04:43,058 --> 01:04:45,399
- It's been so long.
- Seol Ji Won!

866
01:04:45,399 --> 01:04:47,459
- What is going on?
- You're still the same.

867
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:49,084
How did he know about this place?

868
01:04:49,129 --> 01:04:50,928
What? I contact him...

869
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,383
since he wasn't on the invitee list.

870
01:04:54,468 --> 01:04:55,579
Ji Won, sit here.

871
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:02,826
It's nice to see you.

872
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:07,164
Long time no see, Sanchez.

873
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:08,701
Yes.

874
01:05:09,419 --> 01:05:11,175
I didn't know you'd show up.

875
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:16,080
There's someone I wanted to see.

876
01:05:16,689 --> 01:05:19,152
I heard Chan Seong is back in Korea too.

877
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:21,442
Yes, he's back.

878
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:24,353
I didn't know you and
Chan Seong were close.

879
01:05:24,939 --> 01:05:27,121
Of course we are. I know him well.

880
01:05:28,138 --> 01:05:31,542
He's a smart guy who's good at everything.

881
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:37,305
Is he still the same? I want to see him.

882
01:05:58,598 --> 01:06:00,558
A chairman I was closed to...

883
01:06:00,899 --> 01:06:03,433
was nice enough to provide a
small spring in his villa.

884
01:06:03,939 --> 01:06:05,524
You'll be at peace here.

885
01:06:57,028 --> 01:06:59,523
The rice wine in that village
will taste different now.

886
01:07:01,169 --> 01:07:02,885
They'll find a different source of water.

887
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:05,996
Even if the water's taste changes,
not many will notice it...

888
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:08,086
as long as the label doesn't change.

889
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:12,265
Their rice wine used to be so good.

890
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:16,447
It's upsetting and sad to think I
won't ever get to taste it again.

891
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:18,694
He was sad too.

892
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:24,799
He dried up the well as a
punishment because he was cross.

893
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:26,229
He doesn't deserve to be sad.

894
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:29,345
He told me he wasn't cross.

895
01:07:29,658 --> 01:07:31,528
If he wanted to punish them,

896
01:07:31,528 --> 01:07:33,358
he would've called on you
since you're stronger.

897
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:35,348
Why would he call on a weak human like me?

898
01:07:41,738 --> 01:07:45,374
What did you see at the bottom of the well?

899
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:50,622
Fear.

900
01:07:51,578 --> 01:07:52,791
"Fear"?

901
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:54,938
For seeing his weakness,

902
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,237
he showed me...

903
01:07:57,858 --> 01:07:59,172
what I fear,

904
01:08:00,188 --> 01:08:01,774
what I want to avoid...

905
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:03,840
and run away from right now.

906
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:10,240
It was...

907
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:13,310
very scary.

908
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:49,789
Like how I could look into your dreams,

909
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:51,180
you were able...

910
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:54,058
to see my fears, weren't you?

911
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:58,278
Just like how I helped
Spirit of the Well...

912
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,622
relocate to a safe place,

913
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:01,390
you were only trying...

914
01:10:02,009 --> 01:10:04,028
to put me in a safe place too.

915
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:13,371
You know what this is, don't you?

916
01:10:14,959 --> 01:10:16,129
It looks like a medicine.

917
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,481
I thought it was strange why Ma Go
would suddenly give this to me.

918
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:21,345
You're the one who asked her
to give it to me, right?

919
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:23,587
Think the way you want.

920
01:10:25,938 --> 01:10:27,049
Chan Seong.

921
01:10:28,169 --> 01:10:29,855
I'll pray for your safety.

922
01:10:35,978 --> 01:10:37,220
No.

923
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:44,151
I will get in danger to make
you feel uncomfortable.

924
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:46,769
What?

925
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,231
Chan Seong! Do you know
how precious that is?

926
01:10:55,368 --> 01:10:57,828
Do you know how much I
had to beg to get that?

927
01:10:57,828 --> 01:10:59,081
Ms. Jang!

928
01:11:00,198 --> 01:11:02,188
No place is safe for me anymore.

929
01:11:04,809 --> 01:11:07,339
I will keep getting on your
nerves and get in danger.

930
01:11:07,339 --> 01:11:08,590
You must...

931
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,762
keep protecting me.

932
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:10,907
(Hotel Del Luna)

933
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:16,688
I actually hoped that you would come back.

934
01:12:17,278 --> 01:12:19,399
I won't let you disappear.

935
01:12:19,549 --> 01:12:20,791
Trust me.

936
01:12:22,349 --> 01:12:25,894
You brought that woman and Yeon Woo to me.

937
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:28,608
Thank you, Chan Seong.

938
01:12:28,988 --> 01:12:31,629
If Chan Seong didn't take the medicine,

939
01:12:31,629 --> 01:12:33,999
then he can probably see the
relationships that were cut off.

940
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:37,130
This is my hidden past.
Please destroy that.

941
01:12:37,469 --> 01:12:40,498
I brought such a relationship to you again.
