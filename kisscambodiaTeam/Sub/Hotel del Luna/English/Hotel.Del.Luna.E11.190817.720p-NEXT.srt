00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:13,636
(Episode 11)

2
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:37,286
I wonder...

3
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:39,556
if Ko Chung Myung...

4
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,366
was there to meet her.

5
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,696
Chan Seong! Chan Seong, come here!

6
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:52,676
This came for you.

7
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:55,447
It's from Man Weol.

8
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,707
- It's from Ms. Jang?
- Yes.

9
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:04,316
(Thank you.)

10
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,056
"Thank you"?

11
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,426
Don't run away.

12
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:12,156
Even if I go berserk, do crazy things,

13
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,466
and vanish one day,

14
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,197
please stay by my side.

15
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,906
I won't let you vanish.

16
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:26,876
Trust me.

17
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:30,646
She fired a competent guy like you,

18
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:32,646
but she eventually ended
up reinstating you.

19
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,276
I guess she wants to be nice to you now.

20
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,246
My sincerity touched her heart.

21
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:49,567
My gosh, what's this? Is
this a tiger print suit?

22
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,336
Make sure you get a good price for this.

23
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:57,707
Then as a reward, I'll get you a
suit with matching tiger prints.

24
00:02:58,037 --> 00:02:59,977
My gosh, she's unbelievable.

25
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:03,576
This is a luxury brand. It's really sexy.

26
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,376
You should try it on. It'll look funny.

27
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:08,047
My gosh, forget it. Who
wears tiger print suits?

28
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:11,687
But if you don't wear it,
Man Weol will feel upset.

29
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,156
It looks really expensive.

30
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,186
And it'll upset me as well.

31
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:16,857
I want to see how it looks on you.

32
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,526
I didn't give her the money I
got from selling the painting.

33
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,996
Where did she get the money to buy this?

34
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,037
She wouldn't go to a
luxury shopping center...

35
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:30,737
just to get a suit for me.

36
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,336
Hey, this is actually really nice.

37
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:35,046
Veronica's visiting Korea next week.

38
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:36,447
Should I get one and wear
it on the day I meet her?

39
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:39,417
It might make me look
really wild and different.

40
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,346
No, don't do that. You
don't want to shock her.

41
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:45,656
You know nothing about
being in a relationship.

42
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:48,486
It's necessary to surprise
your partner once in a while.

43
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:49,526
Whatever.

44
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:51,996
Man Weol said she's going to shop at
a department store when we last met.

45
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,426
I guess that's when she got this.

46
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,197
You met Ms. Jang?

47
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:57,596
Yes, a few days ago.

48
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,796
She asked me to help her sell something...

49
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:01,406
she inherited from her grandfather.

50
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:04,067
What? "Something she inherited
from her grandfather"?

51
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:11,176
They're a couple of purebred
Arabian horses on a farm in Qatar.

52
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:14,047
I heard even the royal family
wants to have those horses.

53
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,746
Do you think you can help me sell them?

54
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:20,216
Sanchez, are you close to
Mansour by any chance?

55
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:21,356
"Mansour"?

56
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:25,057
No, I'm not. But purebred
horses are very rare.

57
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,067
So someone from our equestrian
club will want to buy it.

58
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:29,896
That's great news.

59
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:32,767
If you help me sell those
horses at an expensive price,

60
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:37,507
I'll get you a white
suit just like this one.

61
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:40,236
But why are you asking me for
help instead of Chan Seong?

62
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,276
I can't trust him.

63
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,646
Why not?

64
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:48,046
He just got reinstated,
so he's really busy.

65
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,416
Please do me a favor, Sanchez.

66
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:54,787
If you ever happen to come
to our hotel in the future,

67
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,127
I promise that I'll treat you well.

68
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,927
Oh, really?

69
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:00,596
Of course.

70
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,726
My gosh.

71
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:08,906
The chairman.

72
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:16,707
I sold the horses for your sake.

73
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,346
By the way, those horses costed a fortune.

74
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:22,286
She got those horses in return for
letting him make a phone call.

75
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,117
I should never be off my guard.

76
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:26,887
I should always make sure
to tighten the reins.

77
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:41,967
Mr. Ku. All the guests are
requesting the special service.

78
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:45,227
They heard of this because of the chairman,

79
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:48,056
so many of them wish to make a
dream call to the living world.

80
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,956
This is a service...

81
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,927
that Ms. Jang only offered in top secret...

82
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:55,096
to the guests that paid special fees.
What should we do?

83
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,636
We should be fair in providing our service.

84
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:58,936
I'll manage this.

85
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,116
Okay.

86
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:21,957
You're here.

87
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:26,567
What? Why didn't you put it on?

88
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:29,467
I was looking forward to seeing
you dressed in tiger print.

89
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,896
This is my workplace.

90
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:33,567
If the owner said it's
fine, then it's fine.

91
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,077
See? I bought this to match you
just in case you come dressed...

92
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:39,277
like a tiger.

93
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:42,616
That's a horse print. A zebra.

94
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:45,047
What do you think? Pretty, isn't it?

95
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:46,486
It's a nuisance.

96
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,286
You don't like it?

97
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,387
You're so picky.

98
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:54,186
Fine, if you don't like a
tiger print or zebra print,

99
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:57,326
then let's go. I'll get you
something that you'll love.

100
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:58,596
We have no time to do that.

101
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:03,067
We have a lot of special
requests from our guests.

102
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,397
You need to take care of this.

103
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:14,007
A dream call is only offered to
those who pay a special price.

104
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,017
You already got paid.

105
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,846
The horses. You took the horses.

106
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:20,587
Darn you, Sanchez.

107
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:23,487
I won't meddle with your money,

108
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,986
but you have to help the other guests.

109
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,227
Chan Seong, do you think...

110
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,767
the dead will only say nice things
when they appear in a dream?

111
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,996
"I died because of you.
You have to die with me."

112
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,936
What if they resent and curse the living?

113
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,436
Resentment and cursing.

114
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,746
That's why I look into each and
every one of their cases...

115
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:50,876
and take a special price only when
the circumstances look right.

116
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,387
It's not just about money!

117
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:56,957
You're right.

118
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,926
I had the wrong idea about you.

119
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,827
It wasn't because of money.

120
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:03,197
You were concerned.

121
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:06,797
Yes. It's all for my guests' sake.

122
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:09,267
I only do it for those
who can pull this off.

123
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,967
What do you take me for?

124
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:13,836
In that case,

125
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,306
I will make some rules to single
out those who can do this.

126
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,877
My gosh!

127
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:28,817
I'm the one who took the horses.
Why is he flexing?

128
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:34,627
I'll tell you the secret
to our cold noodle stock.

129
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:37,657
It's because you were the most
diligent one among my staff.

130
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:39,497
Listen up.

131
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:42,597
Cold noodles?

132
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,267
I love cold noodles too.

133
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,706
The secret is...

134
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,507
My gosh.

135
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,076
Is that you?

136
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,216
Thank you so much for everything.

137
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:02,816
Your team's music gave me much
comfort to my last breath.

138
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,357
- "Your team"?
- They must be a team.

139
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,956
I knew your music and dance...

140
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:10,826
would end up touching
the heart of the world.

141
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,696
That's not for someone she actually knew.

142
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:13,767
Look, it says...

143
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:14,866
(I must tell something to my
beloved who gave me much comfort.)

144
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,736
I love you!

145
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,607
I'll love you forever to the other world!

146
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,007
I'm so sorry but it's fake love

147
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,347
Fake love, fake love

148
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:37,357
Having fun?

149
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,627
Stay on top of everything, will you?

150
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:42,426
Yes.

151
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,137
He's leaving today,

152
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:54,507
and he wishes to talk to
his wife before he leaves.

153
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:57,777
Am I allowed to make only one call?

154
00:09:57,907 --> 00:09:59,546
Yes, just one call.

155
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:04,147
In that case, I wish to call someone else.

156
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:09,157
I got into a car accident with my son.

157
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,897
I wish to talk to the man
who hit us with the truck.

158
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:20,196
You cannot make a call to
blame or curse someone.

159
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,366
Please leave.

160
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,666
It's not that I wish to blame or curse him.

161
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:27,107
I wish to apologize.

162
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:38,247
I'm glad you only ended up
getting put on probation.

163
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,786
Glad? Two people died
because of my driving.

164
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,257
(Letter of resignation)

165
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:53,196
I can't do this job anymore.

166
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,767
If you quit driving now, how
will you make a living?

167
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:15,117
You... You are the two people I killed.

168
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:20,727
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,097
I'm so sorry.

170
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,897
I can't be forgiven for what I have done.

171
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:30,767
We're sorry.

172
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:36,936
It's our fault for suddenly
jumping onto the street.

173
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:39,576
It was a mistake.

174
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,477
We had bad luck,

175
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:45,586
but we gave you too much pain.

176
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:46,946
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,157
I hope...

178
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:59,267
your life doesn't get ruined because of us.

179
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,267
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,137
Thank you.

181
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,586
I feel much better now.

182
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:24,117
My son, shall we go?

183
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,456
Thank you.

184
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:47,507
Should we call it a day?

185
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:53,216
We only have a few people left.
Let's finish up today.

186
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:54,716
Tell them to come in.

187
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,627
The flowers are in full bloom.

188
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,737
Let's not be too worried.

189
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,066
The flowers have finally bloomed.

190
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:15,107
It might stay pretty like
this for a long time.

191
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,446
Ma Go is trying to take Ms. Jang.

192
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:22,417
Flowers bloom only to wilt.

193
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:26,086
We have to go before Ms. Jang does,

194
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,987
so let's get ready.

195
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,336
Gosh, I'm so tired.

196
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:51,607
Do you know how tiring it is to
let people talk to the living?

197
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:57,076
But thanks to you,
many people will smile...

198
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:58,786
when they wake up from their dreams today.

199
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,357
You've done well, so
I'll make you smile too.

200
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,517
What?

201
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:05,786
How?

202
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:08,186
Are you going to put on
the tiger print suit?

203
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,696
I knew it. You sent that to me
to make me look ridiculous.

204
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,966
Hey, if I put in that much
money to have a good laugh,

205
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,366
it means I tried very hard.

206
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:19,107
I tried very hard to make you laugh too.

207
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,836
I made a reservation at the
rice cake soup place...

208
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:25,247
where you failed to eat, and
came back angry many times.

209
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:27,007
Let's go.

210
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:28,377
What?

211
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,647
They don't take reservations, and I
have to wait for over two hours.

212
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:34,247
I used my connection from Harvard.

213
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:35,887
Can you major in making
rice cake soup at Harvard?

214
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,487
The son of that restaurant is an alumnus.

215
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:42,796
I borrowed out the entire
place before they close.

216
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:45,497
Let us hurry.

217
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,367
Hey, wait.

218
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:51,596
You should get changed into an
outfit that fits rice cake soup.

219
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:55,107
This isn't any old rice cake soup.
It's made with bead-shaped cakes.

220
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,436
I'll put on something special.

221
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:37,827
Look here.

222
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,567
I'm okay.

223
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,907
Sanchez is only three years older than me.

224
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,236
If I eat three bowls of
rice cake soup today,

225
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:49,376
can I talk informally to
you like Sanchez does?

226
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,077
What?

227
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,817
Sanchez calls you by your name.

228
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,216
You want to talk in an
informal way with me?

229
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:05,057
Okay, just eat 1,300g of rice cake soup.

230
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,756
Even Kim Joon Hyun can't eat that much.

231
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:09,626
Don't underestimate Joon Hyun.

232
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:11,766
I'll give you a break.

233
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,567
1 rice cake will be worth 1 year.

234
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,937
No, 1 rice cake for 100 years.

235
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:21,136
You Harvard fraud. You're trying
to get years for nothing.

236
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,807
After I eat 13 rice cakes,

237
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,616
I'll start calling you, Man Weol.

238
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:28,847
Do as you please.

239
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:32,157
When a human ages 1,300 years, he dies.

240
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:35,256
Challenge. I'll take 200 years first.

241
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:39,797
It tastes better because
it's worth 200 years.

242
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,866
Being on a roll, I add 300 years more.

243
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,236
It's so pretty now.

244
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:53,407
Why does it have to fall?

245
00:16:55,577 --> 00:16:56,777
It's sad.

246
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:34,976
There are only 300 years left.

247
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:36,687
Are you nervous?

248
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:38,916
Then, I just to eat 500 years more.

249
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,087
Are you stupid?

250
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:43,357
I will eat faster.

251
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:45,127
I now have 100 years left.

252
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:46,597
Add 200 years for me.

253
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:48,666
I had a reputation at Harvard
for being a fast eater.

254
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,267
I'm already 3,500 years old.

255
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,297
- 600 years old.
- 3,600 years old.

256
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:54,496
You can't beat me. Just acknowledge it.

257
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,107
I'll eat all the rice cake
soup and also those earrings.

258
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:57,266
Nonsense.

259
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,367
I've found the motive for the murder.

260
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,736
It's this website called "Helllo".

261
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,777
"Helllo"? Is it some social club?

262
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:49,446
It's "Hell" and "lo", meaning to "Hell".

263
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,147
The name is a play on words.

264
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:54,576
"Helllo" What is the website for?

265
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:57,686
It's an old community with more
than 100 thousand members.

266
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:00,017
At first they shared their
problems at the site.

267
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:03,226
Now it has become a
website like a fiery pit.

268
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:06,626
Now, the post curses and
slanders on people.

269
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,466
Now it's like an emotional trash can.

270
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:11,697
- So?
- The suspect posted...

271
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,537
several slanders on his wife.

272
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:17,567
He wrote comments on slanders
on six others who were killed.

273
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:19,576
The slanders about the victims...

274
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,736
had a high number of views and comments.

275
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,116
Now you're looking at the
post and comments...

276
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,547
criticizing one of the victims.

277
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:30,347
(Kill, kill!)

278
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:32,817
If one uploads a slandering post
on someone those they hate,

279
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:36,126
the others curse them together.
That's what they do on the website.

280
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:39,196
What about the suspect? Did
he carry out the curse?

281
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:41,896
Is he some kind of executioner?

282
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:44,527
Except for Lee Do Yeon, the wife of
the suspect, the other victims...

283
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:47,637
were killed by someone
who they had never met.

284
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:49,567
They didn't even know why.

285
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,877
So this man is not the killer, right?

286
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:58,977
I told you. I was right.

287
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:01,077
The owner of that car is the killer.

288
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,686
There was a ghost in that car too.

289
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:06,956
You can't report that you saw
a ghost without any evidence.

290
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:10,426
There's the composite sketch.

291
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:13,297
That thing you always see in
criminal investigation dramas.

292
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:14,857
Let's do that.

293
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,067
I'm good at drawing.

294
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:23,736
You'll get into trouble if Ms. Jang
finds out about you doing this.

295
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,606
Tell me everything you remember about him.

296
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:28,706
Tell me anything.

297
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:46,226
I didn't meet the Ku Chan Seong guy.

298
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:47,757
I moved the stuff with a high school girl.

299
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:51,466
I really had a hard time
because my car broke down.

300
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,866
Do you know the girl's
name or her phone number?

301
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,636
I don't know her phone number.

302
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:59,176
She used the company website to contact us.

303
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,607
Do you really work at an
entertainment agency?

304
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:05,007
Are you a casting director?

305
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,176
I guess.

306
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,886
She is quite attractive
and I want to meet her.

307
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:11,846
She can't be in show business.
She is really weird.

308
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:13,557
What's weird about her?

309
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,457
She is weird in the head.

310
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,426
She is not crazy. She sees ghosts.

311
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:18,657
That's right.

312
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:20,326
"Ghosts"?

313
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:22,256
Yes, she sees ghosts.

314
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,266
Everyone in our schools knows.

315
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:28,336
You can't call her weird
for things like that.

316
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:31,136
I'm telling the truth.
She talks to herself.

317
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,476
She follows someone when there is nobody.

318
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:37,276
She follows ghosts?

319
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:43,686
That's interesting.

320
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:57,926
Mr. Kim, I looked at the new menu.

321
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:00,467
You changed the name of our
signature cocktail "Tears"...

322
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:01,967
to "Tear Wine".

323
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,936
Ms. Jang said it was too showy.

324
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:07,037
Why? It was a good name.

325
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:09,947
"Tears" and cheers.

326
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:12,106
It rhymes perfectly.

327
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:15,276
A Harvard graduate like you
think it's not bad, right?

328
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,586
Ms. Jang was finding fault for no reason.

329
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,186
It's the representative of our bar,
so I think you should work on it.

330
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:24,257
"Angel's Tears", "Devil's Tears".
Like that.

331
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:27,127
You think so? "Angel" and "Devil"?

332
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,597
I will make a note and give it to you.

333
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:33,766
Harvard knows how to teach
their students properly.

334
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:42,577
What are the guests doing
in the middle of the day?

335
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:45,876
They are those who were buried secretly.

336
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,476
I heard we had those guests.

337
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,547
I heard the killer was caught.

338
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,517
That's what I heard too.

339
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:55,016
But Ms. Fourth Choice keeps
saying something is not right.

340
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:04,167
I don't think the man the
police caught is the culprit.

341
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:07,137
There was a ghost in this car too.

342
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:09,807
The owner of this car is suspicious.

343
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:14,807
(81G0963)

344
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:20,547
Yu Na, you're still too young.

345
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,487
You shouldn't get involved in
a violent crime like this.

346
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,587
I agree. You should concentrate on school.

347
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:29,627
I'll just finish the
sketch I've been drawing.

348
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,926
I'll show it to you when I finish.

349
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:34,126
I'll look into it if
there are any problems.

350
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:35,557
So you have to tell me.

351
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,696
Okay.

352
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,236
(Request for Special Service)

353
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,736
There are the additional service
requests we have received today.

354
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:47,377
Oh, dear.

355
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:51,147
It's such a bother.

356
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,017
You must have seen the flowers.
Why don't you say anything?

357
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:03,327
Have you all decided to get
on the bus to the afterlife?

358
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:06,357
We are bracing ourselves for it.

359
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:07,726
I...

360
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:12,637
will leave after I see that
family is all destroyed.

361
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,337
You told me your daughter had to die...

362
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:23,107
to carry on that family's line.

363
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,976
No matter how impatient you feel,

364
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:32,587
you must not do what you did 42 years ago.

365
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:39,196
If you become an evil
spirit and cease to exist,

366
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,456
your 200 years of working here...

367
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,926
would be wasted.

368
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:51,706
My resentment is too big to
find those years a waste.

369
00:24:59,277 --> 00:25:01,246
There will be a lunar eclipse soon.

370
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:02,747
Yes.

371
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:06,117
I hear the moon will be covered
for quite a while thIs time.

372
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:08,357
I'll prepare for it.

373
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:26,877
Sir.

374
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:29,946
Do you need anything?

375
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,047
I'm thirsty.

376
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:34,847
I'll bring something to your room.

377
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:36,387
This way.

378
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,397
A long lunar eclipse...

379
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:38,907
Mr. Ku Chan Seong, we
need you to come with us.

380
00:26:58,297 --> 00:26:59,496
We brought him.

381
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,367
Come closer.

382
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,547
Who are you to look for me?

383
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,657
Do you recognize me?

384
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,456
I saw you even on today's morning paper.

385
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,597
I've been admiring you.

386
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:34,996
But why did you call for me?

387
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:37,506
I hear you're working at a hotel...

388
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,837
that was registered with Jung-gu Office.

389
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:45,176
Yes, that's right.

390
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:49,147
Will you take me to that hotel?

391
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,647
I'd like to meet with the owner.

392
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:54,486
Do you know...

393
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,026
my boss?

394
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,627
Hotel Del Luna's Ms. Jang Man Weol.

395
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,996
I used to be...

396
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:10,067
a general manager who served Ms. Jang.

397
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,057
Didn't you get off work early today?

398
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,486
I brought a pleasant guest.

399
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:39,696
Ji Hyun Joong,

400
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:42,137
do you still skip work and leave
the front desk unattended?

401
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:44,536
Ms. Hwang!

402
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:48,206
Goodness.

403
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:50,347
What brings you here?

404
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,877
You're not dead, are you?

405
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,446
Do you still have trouble deciphering?
I'm alive.

406
00:28:58,086 --> 00:28:59,186
You scared me.

407
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:03,657
By the way, should I call
you President Hwang now?

408
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:05,286
I'm only a candidate for now.

409
00:29:06,197 --> 00:29:07,297
Let's go.

410
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,696
Mr. Kim. Ms. Choi.

411
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:13,597
Ms. Hwang is here.

412
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:17,206
My goodness. You two are still here.

413
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:18,536
Ms. Hwang.

414
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,776
It's been a long time.

415
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:22,577
It's been a while.

416
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,807
Has it been over 30 years
since we last met?

417
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:26,276
You've gotten old.

418
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:28,117
You still make such
straightforward comments.

419
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:33,786
Do you have a lot of guests
at the hotel right now?

420
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,487
I can't see anyone else...

421
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,157
other than the hotel's employees now.

422
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:41,897
There are a few.

423
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,827
There's Ms. Jang.

424
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,486
Your hotel has become so big.

425
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,286
It's all thanks to you, Moon Sook.

426
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,426
Thanks to the money you invested for us,

427
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:13,896
we moved to Myeong-dong...

428
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,196
which allowed the hotel to grow.

429
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,367
It looks like you're big too.

430
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:19,936
I saw you a lot on the phone.

431
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,907
I hear you'll become a president
of somewhere big soon.

432
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,137
I'm a candidate for now.

433
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,607
I'm thankful you let me free.

434
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,647
Do you think I let you
go because I wanted to?

435
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,646
Ma Go thought someone talented like you...

436
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,876
shouldn't be tied up to a place like this.

437
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,846
She gave you the medicine behind my back...

438
00:30:37,846 --> 00:30:39,457
so you wouldn't see ghosts anymore.
Your eyes were ruined,

439
00:30:39,457 --> 00:30:40,917
so I had no choice but to let you go.

440
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:44,527
I wish you had stayed
back a few more years...

441
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:45,857
to earn me money.

442
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:48,827
I'd have a few plots of
land in Gangnam right now.

443
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:51,827
Thanks to the experience here,

444
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,997
The way I see the world...

445
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:56,867
has changed greatly.

446
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,877
Sure. It seems like you are
doing a lot of good work.

447
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,246
Why are you here anyway?

448
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:06,547
I have a favor to ask you.

449
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,216
A favor?

450
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:13,756
Of course.

451
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:16,557
I know there's nothing to miss here.

452
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:18,926
You must be here because
you want something.

453
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:25,696
I brought a present that
might suit you well.

454
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:29,067
Gosh.

455
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:32,206
You shouldn't have brought such a thing.

456
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:38,676
Oh my gosh.

457
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,877
Okay. What's the favor you want?

458
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:45,786
It's something trivial, but very important.

459
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:51,657
We're getting another big
lunar eclipse after 39 years.

460
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:58,966
This country was seeing
an economic revival.

461
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,567
Thanks to Moon Sook's appearance,

462
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:03,436
we were able to settle our
days of poor business.

463
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:05,636
We were able to build the foundation...

464
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,577
to enjoy the luxury we have now.

465
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:10,246
She worked here for about 7 to 8 years.

466
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:12,576
I never imagined such a person...

467
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:13,877
would have worked here
as a general manager.

468
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:17,786
Because Ms. Jang doesn't
leave any traces...

469
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,817
of the human general managers
who used to be here.

470
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,726
But...

471
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:25,686
I wonder...

472
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:27,857
why she came here when she has
such a big event happening soon.

473
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:31,426
Did you say we'll take human guests?
Is that possible?

474
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,996
Yes, because the lunar eclipse is coming.

475
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:36,097
Are things different
with the lunar eclipse?

476
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,907
When the moon's covered by the eclipse,

477
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,877
Guest House of the Moon's
presence will be exposed.

478
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:44,347
That's why we get quite a few
human guests during the eclipses.

479
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:46,777
Even humans will be able
to see our guests...

480
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:48,377
when they come into our hotel.

481
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,986
Will we accept human guests on
the day of the lunar eclipse?

482
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,157
Of course, our front desk
will turn them away.

483
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:54,686
But...

484
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:57,686
did that happen in 1981?

485
00:32:57,957 --> 00:33:00,526
When Moon Soon was here
during a lunar eclipse,

486
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:03,216
some newlyweds stayed at our hotel.

487
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:08,317
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it's past the curfew.

488
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,886
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Is it this way?

489
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:12,017
Yes. That way.

490
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:14,286
(Hotel Del Luna)

491
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,026
I think this is a hotel.

492
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:21,827
The lunar eclipse better end soon.

493
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:27,736
- Excuse me.
- Do you have a room?

494
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:33,877
Newlyweds?

495
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:35,906
They came to Seoul on their honeymoon,

496
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:37,216
and now it's past curfew.

497
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:38,747
If we turn them away now,

498
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,147
they'll have to spend their first
night at the police station.

499
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:42,417
I feel bad for them.

500
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,926
Let them in, then.

501
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,807
This is your room.

502
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,077
Please go in.

503
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:11,917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

504
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:13,287
Thank you very much.

505
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:24,827
The couple spent their
first night at our hotel.

506
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,526
That room made our human
guests of this ghost hotel...

507
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:30,636
conceive a baby.

508
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:37,437
And that baby grew up to be Korea's
most talented soccer player.

509
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,856
Really?

510
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,586
He got conceived here?

511
00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:58,057
Yes, apparently. I also got shocked
when I heard about it earlier.

512
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:03,196
Anyway, he's going to become
Moon Sook's son-in-law.

513
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:05,236
- Really?
- She met the newlywed couple...

514
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,466
on the day she met her
daughter's soon-to-be in-laws,

515
00:35:06,466 --> 00:35:08,367
and they were all startled.

516
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,937
What an interesting coincidence.

517
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:15,676
But then again, this place is
full of unimaginable things.

518
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,576
I guess it's natural that the baby
turned out to be someone special.

519
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,787
She wants us to let her daughter
and future son-in-law...

520
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,917
stay here for one night so they can
also experience the same thing.

521
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:30,357
Then are we going to let them stay
in the room that the King stayed in?

522
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:32,997
No, they're humans.

523
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,696
They should stay in Room 404.

524
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:36,836
Room 404?

525
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:47,077
But no one can check out of that room.

526
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,547
The only way you can check
out of our hotel...

527
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,216
is to head to your afterlife.

528
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:54,347
Then how are they supposed
to check out of Room 404?

529
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:58,856
Are you worried about the guests
that are going to stay there?

530
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:05,156
Then why don't you go in there
and check for yourself?

531
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,136
On the night of this year's lunar eclipse,

532
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,307
we'll be welcoming human guests.

533
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:00,287
They're newlyweds. It'll
be their honeymoon.

534
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:07,227
They made an official
reservation this time around,

535
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:08,656
so get ready to treat them well.

536
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:09,856
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

537
00:37:14,627 --> 00:37:18,736
We need to get food and decorations
that are fit for humans.

538
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,866
I'm excited to hear that we'll
be getting human guests.

539
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,136
But where's our general manager?

540
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:24,636
He went inside Room 404.

541
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:28,546
Then I guess he won't be returning tonight.

542
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:32,216
Whatever the case, I'm really excited.

543
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:45,526
Veronica.

544
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:47,966
Are you in Waitan, Shanghai?

545
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,966
Yes, I was in a meeting, but
I came out to eat lunch.

546
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:54,906
- Sanchez, I'm so upset at you.
- Why? Why are you upset?

547
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:57,676
I miss you so much.

548
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:02,176
You really make it hard
for me to focus on work.

549
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,917
I'm going to scold you.

550
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:07,546
Veronica, I can't wait to
meet you so you can scold me.

551
00:38:10,317 --> 00:38:11,457
Veronica.

552
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:15,786
I found a way to get scolded by you
forever. You can look forward to it.

553
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:19,997
Gosh, what are you going to
startle me with this time?

554
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:23,736
I can't tell you. You can come
here and check for yourself.

555
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,367
Chan Seong's here.

556
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:27,636
Say hello.

557
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,106
Hey, Chan Seong.

558
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:31,807
Hi, Veronica.

559
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,006
Veronica, I'll call you later.

560
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,446
I love you. Goodbye, my love.

561
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:40,347
Bye.

562
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:43,356
- Is Veronica coming to Korea?
- Yes.

563
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,687
She's in Shanghai right now.
She's going to come in two days.

564
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:48,227
So I've been thinking...

565
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:55,966
I'm planning to do something
really important.

566
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,296
And I'm thinking about
doing it at your hotel.

567
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:00,906
Our hotel?

568
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:03,236
Veronica's been to all kinds
of hotels all over the world.

569
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:05,406
And when I told her that you
work at a really special hotel,

570
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:07,747
she wanted to take a look.
I'm also quite curious.

571
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,347
No, you can't do it at our hotel.

572
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:14,347
Chan Seong, you're not exactly
working at a decent hotel, are you?

573
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:16,317
- What?
- You had to invite someone...

574
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:17,817
to our house so you could sell a painting.

575
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:19,816
And Man Weol even asked me to sell horses.

576
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:21,926
Are you guys struggling financially?

577
00:39:24,426 --> 00:39:25,556
Yes, it's pretty bad.

578
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:27,867
My goodness.

579
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,336
Chan Seong, let me know if
you're having a hard time.

580
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:35,636
You can't just endure everything with love.

581
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,377
Okay?

582
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,506
Okay.

583
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,106
Fine, let's break up.

584
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:43,917
My gosh.

585
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:46,176
Mi Ra's fighting all the time.

586
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,116
She must've been enemies with
that cop in her past life.

587
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:49,317
They fight all the time.

588
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:51,287
But it's funny how she
always goes out to meet him.

589
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:54,156
What? You're not the only one who's busy.

590
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,026
I'm busy too.

591
00:39:56,756 --> 00:39:58,527
You talk as if your job
is to save the world.

592
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:00,397
Are you the son of hero
movies or something?

593
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:02,497
What?

594
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:05,836
They were enemies in their past lives.

595
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,506
Sanchez, let's all eat together
when Veronica comes to Korea.

596
00:40:12,736 --> 00:40:14,307
- She's coming in two days, right?
- Yes.

597
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:16,406
There's going to be a
lunar eclipse that night.

598
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:17,417
Yes, I know.

599
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:20,946
I was planning on watching
the lunar eclipse...

600
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,917
at the Sky Bar in your hotel
that you always bragged about.

601
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,417
Oh, well.

602
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:27,287
I'm sorry.

603
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,596
They could get startled if they
run into our hotel guests.

604
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,497
So we should empty the adjacent rooms.

605
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:37,567
We already informed the
guests on the fourth floor.

606
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,867
We're moving them to other rooms.

607
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,647
You really are well-prepared.

608
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:55,046
The dinner menu is great.

609
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:57,816
What kind of drinks are you going to...

610
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,557
Are you going to serve them these drinks?

611
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:04,397
I took in your advice and
created my own signature menu.

612
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:05,957
It's Angel and devil.

613
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:08,727
It's incredible.

614
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:12,596
But I'm not sure if humans will like it.

615
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,736
Can you see how it tastes?

616
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:15,106
Sure.

617
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,656
Put half of them on the dinner table
and the other half in their room.

618
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,787
Okay.

619
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,227
It's a bee.

620
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:44,366
I guess the bee came along
with the real flowers.

621
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:46,667
The flowers here aren't real.

622
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:49,267
I guess that's why there aren't any
bugs such as bees or butterflies.

623
00:41:58,277 --> 00:41:59,446
By any chance,

624
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:03,716
are there also bug ghosts
that look like fireflies?

625
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:06,216
I've never heard of anything
called a bug ghost.

626
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,727
Oh, I see.

627
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:11,526
Then what was that?

628
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:14,167
Should I put this bouquet in their room?

629
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:15,327
Yes, sure.

630
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,097
That one looks more romantic.

631
00:42:18,267 --> 00:42:19,397
Wait.

632
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:30,106
I'd like to put one in my office.

633
00:42:31,977 --> 00:42:33,117
Please follow me.

634
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:53,167
I'm so tired.

635
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,977
You got a lot of special requests
again today, didn't you?

636
00:43:05,977 --> 00:43:08,687
You're all so excited
about those human guests.

637
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:11,586
I'm the only one who's taking
care of our actual guests.

638
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:16,727
My gosh, the day feels so long.

639
00:43:17,256 --> 00:43:19,627
My goodness, I'm so tired.

640
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,767
Then here's something to wake you up.

641
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:30,736
This is a real flower, so it smells nice.

642
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:35,377
We have tons of flowers in our garden.

643
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,617
None of them are real.

644
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:40,917
No, wait. Your flowers are real.

645
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:46,056
That tree of yours is filled
with beautiful flowers.

646
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,557
What's wrong with you?

647
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,457
Are you showing off?

648
00:43:49,457 --> 00:43:50,627
It's totally worth showing off.

649
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:52,597
The flowers bloomed the
moment I hugged you.

650
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:55,426
If I knew this was going to
happen, I should've hugged you...

651
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:57,196
instead of buying you champagne.

652
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:02,167
What are you doing?

653
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:03,937
I never asked you to hug me.

654
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,836
Are you crazy?

655
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,546
I was asking for the phone.

656
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:14,086
Here. I'll give you a hug.

657
00:44:17,256 --> 00:44:18,917
Forget it.

658
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:21,827
You arrogant, greedy, and
fraudulent Harvard graduate...

659
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,926
You look so pretty.

660
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:31,497
We got some more special requests,
and I put them on your desk.

661
00:44:31,696 --> 00:44:34,906
You should get back to work
once you get some rest.

662
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:56,227
Goodness.

663
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:06,897
I won't let you vanish.

664
00:45:08,006 --> 00:45:09,136
Trust me.

665
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:29,026
It's real.

666
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,296
You,

667
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:34,066
I'm only letting you off the
hook because you're weak.

668
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:22,082
The lunar eclipse has begun.

669
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:26,212
There will be a special guest coming today.

670
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:29,922
Please work together to
get ready for the guest.

671
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:40,832
Everyone seems quite excited.

672
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:42,452
As the sun covers over the moon,

673
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:45,753
they can feel our hotel getting
recognized by the world.

674
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:48,793
And human guests are coming as well.

675
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:53,293
That makes them feel like
they're alive again.

676
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:07,643
Welcome.

677
00:47:08,412 --> 00:47:10,143
You made a reservation, right?

678
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:11,912
How long has it been since you passed away?

679
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:18,052
I mean, how long has it
been since you got married?

680
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:25,492
Right, you got married today!

681
00:47:26,062 --> 00:47:27,233
Congratulations.

682
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:29,092
Please follow me this way.

683
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:42,273
We'll take your luggage to your room.

684
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,143
You can enjoy your meals first.

685
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:50,153
This cocktail, Tears, is our
hotel's signature cocktail.

686
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:54,052
This comes from the tears
of beautiful angels.

687
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:58,862
This comes from the tears of raging devils.

688
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:18,543
Why are you so happy?

689
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:23,112
I hated looking at the full moon.

690
00:48:23,213 --> 00:48:25,452
But look, it's all gone now.

691
00:48:26,352 --> 00:48:27,653
It feels so good watching that.

692
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:31,623
This is my favorite moment ever.

693
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:37,733
The whole moon is covered now.

694
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:41,233
It'll be a new moon by
the time it's uncovered.

695
00:48:41,403 --> 00:48:43,932
Perhaps a moon that knows how
to be kinder and how to save.

696
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:48,912
Once our guests are upstairs in their room,

697
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:51,412
would you like to go out and
see the new, kind moon?

698
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:52,842
You evil moon.

699
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:56,253
Do you want to die, Chan Seong?

700
00:48:56,512 --> 00:48:57,753
I'll take that as a yes.

701
00:48:57,952 --> 00:48:59,382
This is why I love my name.

702
00:48:59,423 --> 00:49:01,653
I love how it means "yes", so it's
as if everyone agrees with me.

703
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:03,923
It's perfect.

704
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:06,322
At the top of all priorities,

705
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:08,833
Ku Chan Seong.

706
00:49:10,162 --> 00:49:13,432
Sure, Mr. Top of the World,

707
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:15,603
your name is Mr. Okay Ku now.

708
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:18,043
What do you mean?

709
00:49:18,202 --> 00:49:20,273
My English name is Andrew.

710
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:23,872
Chan Seong isn't just okay,
it means "agreement".

711
00:49:23,872 --> 00:49:26,543
Agree, Andrew, whatever.

712
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:29,053
You're just Mr. Okay Ku to me.

713
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,153
Okay?

714
00:49:33,582 --> 00:49:35,893
Okay Ku, the lunar eclipse
is finally complete.

715
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,032
You're right.

716
00:49:59,282 --> 00:50:01,983
This signifies that it's yours, right?

717
00:50:03,352 --> 00:50:04,523
Yes.

718
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:23,273
I wonder if he was waiting for her.

719
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:34,912
Ms. Jang.

720
00:50:36,713 --> 00:50:40,083
Our guests would like to
head to their room now.

721
00:50:41,423 --> 00:50:43,693
Okay, the lunar eclipse is complete.

722
00:50:43,693 --> 00:50:46,463
It's perfect. Take them to Room 404.

723
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:48,032
Yes.

724
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:04,912
When you go inside,

725
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:08,052
please don't come out of the
room until you check out.

726
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,552
I've heard about this room
from my parents already.

727
00:51:11,883 --> 00:51:13,853
Have a good night then.

728
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,582
A world-famous soccer player was conceived,

729
00:51:38,582 --> 00:51:39,843
I wonder what kind of a
person will be next.

730
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:41,012
Someone like you, who has been a kid

731
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:42,153
for the past 70 years, wouldn't know,

732
00:51:42,153 --> 00:51:44,382
but things like this doesn't
happen just overnight.

733
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:47,353
I know that it doesn't
happen just overnight.

734
00:51:52,762 --> 00:51:54,693
Why are you laughing?

735
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:00,702
I know it all.

736
00:52:00,972 --> 00:52:02,103
Really?

737
00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:05,373
Don't you just assume
that I don't know things.

738
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:06,972
We're talking about lives here.

739
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:08,713
It's not a conversation where you,
the Grip Ripper, could jump in.

740
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:14,383
I hope...

741
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:16,583
that a great scholar is
conceived this time.

742
00:52:16,852 --> 00:52:18,952
I hope the child will receive a
Nobel Prize or something one day.

743
00:52:18,952 --> 00:52:21,253
I hope that it'll be triplets,

744
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:23,123
so that they'd earn three Nobel Prizes.

745
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:25,323
I bet all the guests and employees
at the hotel right now...

746
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:27,492
would be all cheering for Room 404.

747
00:52:29,892 --> 00:52:31,503
Veronica hasn't arrived yet?

748
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:35,003
I've been waiting for her, thinking
that her flight was delayed,

749
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:36,833
but it turns out that a
flight was never delayed.

750
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,143
She's not even picking up her phone.

751
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,842
Chan Seong,

752
00:52:44,312 --> 00:52:47,282
do you think Veronica is avoiding me,

753
00:52:47,613 --> 00:52:49,452
being aware of my plan to propose to her?

754
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:52,222
Veronica loves you more than you love her.

755
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:55,322
No, I love her so much more.

756
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,362
Veronica has never broken
any promises with me.

757
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:05,633
I just got a text.
It must be from Veronica.

758
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:07,032
I'll call you later.

759
00:53:41,332 --> 00:53:42,472
Sanchez.

760
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:44,943
Sanchez!

761
00:53:46,202 --> 00:53:47,342
Sanchez!

762
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,512
What do you mean, an accident?

763
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:52,643
Veronica got hurt. I think...

764
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:54,552
she got into a car accident in Shanghai.

765
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:56,883
I have to go now.

766
00:53:56,883 --> 00:53:58,352
How badly is she hurt?

767
00:53:58,352 --> 00:54:00,452
I have to go and see.

768
00:54:01,093 --> 00:54:03,023
- I'm sure she'll be fine.
- Yes.

769
00:54:03,693 --> 00:54:06,892
Hey, I have to stay there
until she gets better.

770
00:54:06,892 --> 00:54:08,333
Okay.

771
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:12,302
Where's my car key?

772
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,342
I have to go.

773
00:54:31,122 --> 00:54:32,452
Even if you go there,

774
00:54:35,253 --> 00:54:36,393
you won't be able to see her.

775
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:40,523
Hey, don't say that.

776
00:54:41,332 --> 00:54:42,793
You won't be able to see her.

777
00:54:47,903 --> 00:54:49,132
It's too late.

778
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:52,342
What's with you?

779
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:54,972
I'm not too late!

780
00:54:55,512 --> 00:54:57,072
If I go now, I can see her.

781
00:55:11,122 --> 00:55:12,262
Sanchez.

782
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:15,032
I'll let you see her.

783
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:16,833
What?

784
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:18,802
If you come to our hotel now,

785
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,132
you can meet her.

786
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:26,273
Hey. What in the world are you saying?

787
00:55:26,773 --> 00:55:29,543
Do you trust me? We don't have much time.

788
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:31,483
You won't be able to see
her if you're late.

789
00:55:58,742 --> 00:55:59,842
Mr. Ku.

790
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:02,742
There is a lady guest who'll
come in right after us.

791
00:56:03,012 --> 00:56:05,483
We'll be waiting for her at the Sky Lounge.

792
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:07,882
Please bring her over...

793
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,112
in a way that will not
shock my friend here.

794
00:56:10,153 --> 00:56:11,282
Sure.

795
00:56:44,312 --> 00:56:45,423
Let go of me.

796
00:56:46,282 --> 00:56:48,193
What are you going to do here?

797
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:49,722
You'll see once you go out there.

798
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:51,393
I'll tell you after you see this.

799
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,173
Hey, how can this be?

800
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:11,242
This is a very special hotel.

801
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:13,483
It's a hotel for the dead.

802
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:15,213
What?

803
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:21,222
I have no time to explain.

804
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:24,722
You can also see the dead only
before the eclipse is over.

805
00:57:25,023 --> 00:57:26,123
So...

806
00:57:27,793 --> 00:57:29,463
you'll have only a little time...

807
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:31,833
to say goodbye to Veronica.

808
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:35,873
What?

809
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:39,043
Stop joking around.
How could she come here?

810
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:43,072
Because she's dead.

811
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,992
She is now here.

812
00:57:57,863 --> 00:57:59,592
Sanchez, Veronica is dead.

813
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:02,552
I'm sorry...

814
00:59:04,722 --> 00:59:06,793
I surprised you like this.

815
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:41,092
Don't cry too much...

816
00:59:43,963 --> 00:59:46,032
for me.

817
00:59:49,903 --> 00:59:51,003
I lived...

818
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:54,742
a happy life thanks to you.

819
01:00:24,742 --> 01:00:27,702
My awfully handsome love.

820
01:00:31,613 --> 01:00:32,782
Goodbye.

821
01:01:51,593 --> 01:01:53,362
Mr. Ku's friend...

822
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:55,992
had to say goodbye to his love.

823
01:01:56,832 --> 01:02:00,403
Such sudden death leaves
those who are left behind...

824
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,472
in great sorrow.

825
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:07,943
I only see those who are dead,

826
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:12,643
so it has been a while
since I saw the sorrow...

827
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:15,483
of the living.

828
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:13,673
Yes, come in.

829
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:26,423
Did you have a great stay?

830
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:29,892
We won't be able to forget
the time we spent...

831
01:03:29,892 --> 01:03:32,023
in this hotel.

832
01:03:32,193 --> 01:03:35,092
Thank you. Take care.

833
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:56,253
It's exactly like what my parents told me.

834
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:58,923
It's a hotel you can never find again.

835
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:01,923
When we have a baby later,

836
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,593
let's have the baby look for that hotel...

837
01:04:04,962 --> 01:04:06,593
and go on their honeymoon there too.

838
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:09,032
I'd like that.

839
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:51,702
Veronica's funeral will be held in Italy.

840
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:54,372
Sanchez will stay there for a while.

841
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:56,642
I feel so sorry for Sanchez.

842
01:04:57,573 --> 01:05:00,213
He couldn't even see his
girlfriend's last moments.

843
01:05:01,182 --> 01:05:02,512
He didn't get to say goodbye.

844
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:05,523
He saw her. He got to say goodbye too.

845
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:09,323
He learned that death isn't the end,

846
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:12,523
so I'm sure Sanchez will
be able to get through it.

847
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:15,733
So he got to say goodbye.

848
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:20,133
But how did he see her?

849
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:22,932
Didn't she die in Shanghai?

850
01:05:25,973 --> 01:05:28,642
Gosh, this coffee smells so good.
You should have another.

851
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:59,043
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

852
01:06:43,182 --> 01:06:44,612
She's really tailing me.

853
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:54,223
Why would such a cute student follow me?

854
01:06:58,092 --> 01:06:59,332
I better ask.

855
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:06,872
I heard that my children
enjoyed their stay.

856
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:08,673
I'm thankful.

857
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:15,213
If you end up quitting your job at
Hotel Del Luna, come look for me.

858
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:19,522
Ms. Jang told me that
you're quite competent...

859
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:21,423
and recommended you to me.

860
01:07:22,823 --> 01:07:24,753
I don't think I'll be quitting.

861
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:29,593
According to Ms. Jang, she
says you'll be leaving soon.

862
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:36,772
There's a guest Chan Seong
will have to see out.

863
01:07:37,573 --> 01:07:39,202
Once he sees that guest out,

864
01:07:41,102 --> 01:07:42,742
he'll be leaving this place.

865
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:48,242
Did she say that?

866
01:07:48,812 --> 01:07:51,683
Did they come up with a new rule
for the hotel's general manager?

867
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:56,492
Who is the last guest
you'll be sending off?

868
01:08:02,092 --> 01:08:03,963
It's someone...

869
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:07,332
I like a lot.

870
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,173
It'll be difficult for you.

871
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,213
I think so.

872
01:08:28,153 --> 01:08:30,952
It's too hard for me to comfort myself...

873
01:08:35,132 --> 01:08:36,633
by saying I know it's coming.

874
01:09:20,443 --> 01:09:22,673
What are you doing? Were you sleeping?

875
01:09:25,783 --> 01:09:26,912
I'm awake.

876
01:09:27,743 --> 01:09:28,952
I'm looking at the moon.

877
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:32,383
The moon?

878
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:35,082
How can you see the moon during the day?

879
01:09:36,392 --> 01:09:37,492
I don't know.

880
01:09:41,463 --> 01:09:43,133
It's going to be a little hard...

881
01:09:44,262 --> 01:09:45,463
if I can't see it but want to.

882
01:09:57,873 --> 01:09:59,043
Where are you?

883
01:10:01,382 --> 01:10:02,813
I'm on my way home.

884
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:06,982
Wait there. I'll come to see you.

885
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:26,973
What is it, Yu Na?

886
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:30,673
(81G0963)

887
01:10:31,073 --> 01:10:33,912
I've found that car.

888
01:10:39,722 --> 01:10:42,122
Where are you right now? Where?

889
01:10:42,522 --> 01:10:43,822
Don't move and stay right there.

890
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:49,253
Why did she follow me all the way here?

891
01:11:58,262 --> 01:11:59,402
Yu Na!

892
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:04,433
The man in the sketch...

893
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,872
and the owner of that car look alike.

894
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:10,813
Could it be the culprit?

895
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:20,522
What's the matter?

896
01:12:21,052 --> 01:12:22,353
He looks a lot like...

897
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,253
someone I know.

898
01:12:35,632 --> 01:12:38,433
I'll look into it now. You should go home.

899
01:12:38,842 --> 01:12:39,942
Okay.

900
01:13:14,672 --> 01:13:17,343
I told him to wait,
but he's making me wait.

901
01:13:27,852 --> 01:13:29,022
Anyone here?

902
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:45,973
Is anybody here?

903
01:15:04,052 --> 01:15:05,522
The one I've been waiting for hasn't come,

904
01:15:05,522 --> 01:15:07,753
but the dreaded Ma Go is here.

905
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:09,723
Why not?

906
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:13,362
Why am I not the deity you desire to see...

907
01:15:13,522 --> 01:15:14,862
the most?

908
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:22,603
You didn't care for reincarnation,
healing, and connections.

909
01:15:23,972 --> 01:15:26,742
You only wished to see
me and cease to exist.

910
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:31,013
So what? Are you here to do that for me?

911
01:15:33,182 --> 01:15:34,782
I heard the flowers bloomed.

912
01:15:36,113 --> 01:15:37,612
You finally have...

913
01:15:38,312 --> 01:15:40,282
something to lose too.

914
01:15:41,823 --> 01:15:44,822
Do you think I'm afraid
to see the flowers wilt?

915
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:46,862
What about the one that
helped you bloom the flowers?

916
01:15:48,222 --> 01:15:50,593
What if you lose him?

917
01:16:02,113 --> 01:16:03,543
Long time no see, Chan Seong.

918
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:17,452
Man Weol, you conceited and foolish thing.

919
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:20,522
Did you say you aren't afraid
to see the flowers wilt?

920
01:16:21,163 --> 01:16:22,263
No.

921
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:25,562
Your flowers will begin to wilt...

922
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:27,763
when you become afraid.

923
01:17:45,613 --> 01:17:49,353
(Hotel Del Luna)

924
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:54,052
The price Ku Chan Seong will pay...

925
01:17:54,052 --> 01:17:55,652
won't be fair nor reasonable.

926
01:17:56,653 --> 01:17:59,193
You can brush my hair in your room...

927
01:17:59,193 --> 01:18:01,022
to help me fall asleep.

928
01:18:01,022 --> 01:18:02,732
What's with you? You're too naughty.

929
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:04,093
You were really surprised.

930
01:18:04,932 --> 01:18:07,663
I don't want to make you pay the price,

931
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:10,803
so I'll do everything I can
do clean up after you.

932
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,003
Don't be afraid when you
have to leave me behind.

933
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:15,743
This is the love I've fallen in...

934
01:18:15,743 --> 01:18:18,912
as a weak human with my entire heart.
