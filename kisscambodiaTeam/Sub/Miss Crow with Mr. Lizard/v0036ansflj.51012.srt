21

Here.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,440
Yan Yan, something happened to Gu Chuan!

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,520
You're awake.

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,800
Why did you bring her here?

25
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,520
I've told her everything.

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,040
You swore

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,160
you wouldn't tell anyone.

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,800
Yes.

29
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
I did say

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
that if I were to tell anyone,

31
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
I would be struck by lightning.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
But Yan Yan isn't anyone.

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,000
She's my wife.

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,800
Right?

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,640
Don't worry.

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,320
I won't tell anyone.

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,600
Also,

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
I wanted to visit you as well.

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,040
Did you get me here?

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
Yes, there is a low battery alarm.

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,560
Did you forget to charge again?

42
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
If you keep doing this,

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
that'll be suicide.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
It was my negligence.

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,600
Earlier,

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,360
I thought

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,560
my time was up

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
and that I was going to die.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,120
for making it here timely and saving me.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Knock it off.

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
It's good to have you.

53
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
Gu Chuan, I'm sorry.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
I misunderstood you.

55
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
I kept telling Xiao Ning

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,320
that you were a jerk

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,640
to treat her that way.

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,480
But after hearing your condition from
Xu Cheng Ran,

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
what you did for Xiao Ning

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
was really noble.

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,360
In this world,

62
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
you're the man who loves Xiao Ning the most.

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I apologize to you.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,880
Thank you

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
for using your own way

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,840
to love Xiao Ning.

67
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,040
Here's your wedding gift.

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,240
What is it?

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
It's a painting.

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,440
I painted it a long time ago.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
But I didn't have the chance to give it to you.

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,520
Thank you, Xiao Ning.

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,960
Wen Wen.

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,960
How long will you be there this time?

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,080
I think I'll be there for quite some time.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,880
Otherwise,

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I wouldn't have asked you out

78
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
to say goodbye to you.

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,840
After we're married,

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,480
we don't intend to settle down in one place.

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
So we plan to travel first

82
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
and think about where to live later on.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm so envious of you. Such a perfect couple.

84
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
What's there to envy?

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,840
There are different

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,840
types of happiness in life.

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Speaking of which,

88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,160
you don't look so great.

89
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,880
Are you too exhausted?

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,080
Do I?

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,800
There are things

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,800
that haven't been taken care of.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
How are you and Gu Chuan?

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,400
Mr. Xu said he went on a vacation.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
I haven't seen him for quite some time.

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,280
This is my own business.

97
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,560
You can just leave me alone.

98
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
I know.

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm being meddlesome.

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,440
I just hope you and Jiang Xiao Ning

101
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
can be happy.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,240
If you just let her pass you by like this,

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,680
I will feel sad for you.

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm the one who feels the saddest.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,880
Do you know

106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
about his mechanical heart?

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,320
He told me.

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
And he saved me in the car accident

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,720
ten years ago.

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,760
I didn't know you two

111
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
had such a story.

112
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,800
Xiao Ning.

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,720
I can't comment

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,400
on your relationship.

115
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,760
But I think

116
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
Gu Chuan is the kind of person

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,880
who keeps

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,120
everything to himself.

119
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
So if you don't want

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,320
to give up on him just yet,

121
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,640
I think

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
you need to try a little harder.

123
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,440
Don't just believe what you hear

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,480
and what you see.

125
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
Feel with your heart.

126
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
Whatever your decision is,

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,280
I'll have your back.

128
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,640
All the best.

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,440

Hi, doctor.

180
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,360
Hi.

181
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,000
Why did you give me a refund?

182
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,160
Didn't you bring the cat

to the vet the other day?

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,080
You have paid for

185
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,760
the euthanasia drug.

186
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,720

we have to get you the refund.

190
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,680
That's right.

191
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,520
Didn't he sign

192
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,560
the consent form?

193
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
Didn't he tell you?

194
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,080
He did sign the form.

195
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,600
But he couldn't bear to do it.

196
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600
After much deliberation,

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
he changed his mind.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,760
Here is the money.

199
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,840
Please put it in the car.

200
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,560
Thank you.

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,440
All right.

202
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,080
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Sir, the cement's here.

203
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,560
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Okay.

204
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,680
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Speed up.

205
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,240
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Thank you.

206
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,840
(Xiao Ning, what's the matter?)

207
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,960
Do you remember

208
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
what I told you about Ice Cream?

209
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,400
I thought Gu Chuan

210
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
signed the consent form for euthanasia.

211
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,200
But today the pet hospital called

212
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,840
and told me to get the refund.

213
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,200
The vet told me that Gu Chuan changed his mind

214
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,000
about the euthanasia injection

215
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,640
and took Ice Cream back.

216
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,200
I wanted to ask him

217
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,480
what actually happened.

218
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,400
But I called him twice

219
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,280
and there was no answer.

220
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,960
Could you ask Mr. Xu for me

221
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,800
if he knew

222
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,000
where Gu Chuan had gone to?

223
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
I didn't hear him talk about it.

224
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,360
Sister Yan Yan.

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm so confused now.

226
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
I can't help thinking

227
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,640
like things aren't that simple.

228
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000
Could you ask Mr. Xu for me

229
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,400
if he knew

230
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
where Gu Chuan had gone to?

231
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,160
Do you really want to know?

232
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,520
Of course.

233
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,920
Sister Yan Yan.

234
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Do you know something?

235
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,720
Tell me, please.

236
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,200
Gu Chuan took Ice Cream back

237
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
and accompanied Ice Cream

238
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,280
during its final hours.

239
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,080
He didn't tell you

240
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,480
because he was afraid

241
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,720
the pain would be too much to you.

242
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,000
(Xiao Ning, Gu Chuan was trying to protect you.)

243
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,480
What do you mean?

244
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
Did he tell you these

245
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,080
or it was just a wild guess?

246
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
Xiao Ning, stop asking questions.

247
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,600
Did it cross your mind

248
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,160
Gu Chuan's current situation

249
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
is similar

250
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,600
to Ice Cream's?

251
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,680
What are you talking about?

252
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,560
What is similar?

253
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,200
Sister Yan Yan, just tell me, please.

254
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,080
(Xiao Ning, ask no more.)

255
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,280
Think about your wish.

256
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,520
Think with your heart.

257
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,680
You'll know where he is.

258
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,720
(Sorry, the number you have dialed)

259
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
(cannot be reached temporarily.)

260
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,839
Gu Chuan.

261
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,200
You shouldn't be here.

262
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,480
So you hiding here and rebuilding my family house

263
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,400
is what you should do?

264
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
I just want to help you

265
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,880
rebuild your family home.

266
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,440
Who are you to help me?

267
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,480
You don't even want me.

268
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,160
What's the point

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,320
of you fulfilling my dream?

270
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm such a fool.

271
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
I was with you all the time.

272
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,680
I should have known

273
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,000
you weren't feeling well.

274
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,520
I should have known

275
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,920
that you were lying to me.

276
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,120
Regardless,

277
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,560
we can't be together anymore.

278
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,280
Why?

279
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,760
I don't want

280
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,080
to tie you down with me.

281
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,800
You can have a better future.

282
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
I don't want you to regret it in the future.

283
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:33,044
That's right.

284
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,640
Gu Chuan.

285
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,240
I have no right

286
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,560
to tell you how to live your life.

287
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,040
And you can't dictate

288
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
how my life will be.

289
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,560
Did you think

290
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,840
breaking up was doing me any good?

291
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,400
Have you forgotten

292
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,960
what we've been through together ten years ago?

293
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
I met you again ten years later

294
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
and I fell for you.

295
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,600
I fell in love with you.

296
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
Even if you left me

297
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,200
or refused to see me now,

298
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,440
did you think I could forget you?

299
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,280
It doesn't matter when you leave me.

300
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,920
To me,

301
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,800
it still hurts as much.

302
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,120
It doesn't make it any less painful.

303
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,120
But...

304
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,000
if you are willing to be with me,

305
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,960
no matter how long we can go,

306
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
every single day in the future

307
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,920
will be a blessing to me.

308
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,760
All you're trying to do now

309
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
is just

310
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,560
to fulfill my dream

311
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,040
so that

312
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,280
I could live a good life.

313
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,120
If so,

314
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,800
why can't you do it in a simpler way?

315
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,520
We can do these things

316
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
together.

317
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
As you already know,

318
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,440
I don't have

319
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
much time left.

320
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,440
What would you do

321
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
if you were me?

322
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,000
If one day, I'm gone

323
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
all of a sudden,

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,120
how are you going to face it?

325
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,160
Ten years ago,

326
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,760
you held my hand

327
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,320
and encouraged me to persevere.

328
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Why wouldn't I have the courage

329
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,480
to face it?

330
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,480
Gu Chuan.

331
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,240
If you were to leave now,

332
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,840
would I not have any regrets?

333
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,840
I respect your decision about your life.

334
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,800
But you, too,

335
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,120
have to respect mine.

336
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
Even if there's no tomorrow,

337
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
I still want to be with you.

It puts me on edge.

351
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,200
I'm nervous.

352
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,840
So am I.

353
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
Look who's talking.

354
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,000
It's all because

355
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,920
you told her.

356
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,480
I thought I was the worse

357
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,680
secret keeper ever.

358
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
You're even worse than me.

359
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't tell me if you have the guts!

360
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,000
Besides,

361
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,960
I didn't say anything.

362
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,480
I merely

363
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,560
gave her some hint.

364
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,440
Hint?

365
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,680
The only thing you didn't do

366
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,520
was to send her the location.

367
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,360
What now?

368
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,200
What do you think

369
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,280
the two of them

370
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
will talk about when they meet?

371
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,240
What will happen?

372
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,920
Will Gu Chuan pass out

373
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,760
if he gets agitated?

374
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
His heart is...

375
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,080
Call her now.

376
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,240
No.

377
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,040
You call her if you want.

378
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,320
There's no warning alert on my phone.

379
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,160
But the index is fluctuating.

380
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,600
I think it should be fine.

381
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,000
Perhaps,

382
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,920
they've made up already.

383
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,840
But if the two of them

384
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,080
get back together,

385
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,440
we are the ones who make it happen.

386
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,000
That's a good thing, Wifey.

387
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,360
How about going into our room

388
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,280
and celebrating it?

389
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,600
I'll take a shower first.

390
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
I didn't even know

391
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,840
there was a nice hotel

392
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
around here.

393
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,400
Once our resort project

394
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,040
is completed,

395
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,680
it will be the best hotel in town.

396
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,760
Of course.

397
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
No one's design

398
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,240
can beat my boss's.

399
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,160
They should know their place.

400
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,320
Being a bootlicker again.

401
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
Our reporting relationship

402
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,720
can only last

403
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,360
because of that, right?

404
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,720
Is that so?

405
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,120
I always thought

406
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
it was your intelligence and talents.

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,960
Flattering my boss

408
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
is part of my job too.

409
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,800
Fine.

410
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,720
I'm going to get the key card.

411
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,680
No.

412
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,640
I won't run away.

413
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,760
Who knows?

414
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
Please swipe the card.

415
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,440
Thank you.

416
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,360
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

417
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,600
A moment, please.

418
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,280
Our system

419
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,400
is rebooting.

420
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,160
All right.

421
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,960
In the past two days,

422
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,960
the power system's

423
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,840
been a little unstable.

424
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,600
The breaker trips

425
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,760
occasionally.

426
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,640
We have upgraded the system.

427
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,520
If there's any problem,

428
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,840
feel free to contact us.

429
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,680
Sorry about that.

430
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,640
Thank you.

431
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't worry. It's our mistake.

432
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,920
It's done.

433
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,680
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,680
Does the lady

435
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,480
want to check in as well?

436
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,320
Are you sharing the room?

437
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,640
Yes, thank you.

438
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,560
Are we not?

439
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,800
Don't waste your money.

440
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,720
I can sleep on the floor.

441
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,200
Please give me another room.

442
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,120
No.

443
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,960
I'll take the bed and you take the floor then.

444
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
My ID. Thank you.

445
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,400
Let's go.

446
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,680
I never thought we would check in to a hotel

447
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,960
under such circumstances.

448
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,760
You called this checking-in to a hotel?

449
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,040
Instead of going home, we stay in the hotel.

450
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
What else could it be if it's not
checking-in to a hotel?

451
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
You're right.

452
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,840
By the way,

453
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,360
did you tell your aunt you are not
going home tonight?

454
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,600
I...

455
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,040
Get on the bed.

456
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,640
It feels a little far to talk like that.

457
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
Get on the bed?

458
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,040
Do you feel unsafe with me?

459
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,120
How is that

460
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,160
even possible?

461
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,400
Come on then.

462
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,880
Here.

463
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,960
I will definitely

464
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,760
control myself.

465
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,120
What were you saying?

466
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,720
I was saying

467
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,600
did you tell your aunt that you are staying out?

468
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,520
I lied to her and said that I am working overtime.

469
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,680
Oh, no.

470
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,080
She'll not spare me.

471
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,400
If she knew

472
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,280
that you didn't want me,

473
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,720
she wouldn't spare you for sure.

474
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,120
Did you tell your aunt

475
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,440
everything?

476
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, no.

477
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,000
But I had to keep it a secret and it was so hard.

478
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Actually, after the accident,

479
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,920
I tried looking for you.

480
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,440
My parents' deaths

481
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,760
were a huge blow to me.

482
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
But I remember everything.

483
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,440
I told my aunt that I wanted to find you

484
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,720
and say thanks to you.

485
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,040
What then?

486
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,440
Then,

487
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
my aunt said she couldn't find you.

488
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,280
To me,

489
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,600
you're my life savior.

490
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,080
But to you,

491
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,520
they weren't good memories.

492
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,280
My aunt told me

493
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,000
not to live in the past

494
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
and that I had to step out of it and start afresh.

495
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,000
I never thought

496
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,040
we ended up meeting each other again.

497
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,280
Actually, I kind of regret it.

498
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,800
If you didn't meet me again,

499
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,120
your heart

500
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,440
wouldn't have had frequent glitches.

501
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,000
You could continue

502
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,000
living your life based on

503
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,892
your previous lifestyle

504
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,000
and live all the way to 80 years old.

505
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,760
And you wouldn't have so much worry

506
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,760
and trouble.

507
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,240
If I didn't meet you again,

508
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,440
I would have left this world

509
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,400
after winning the award.

510
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,200
I never regret meeting you,

511
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
Jiang Xiao Ning.

512
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,920
Forget it.

513
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Forget it.

514
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,200
If we get too intimate,

515
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,800
your heart rate

516
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,040
will keep rising.

517
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,960
I don't want to send you

518
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,800
to the emergency room

519
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,560
while we're dating.

520
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,200
We are the most special couple

521
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,200
in the world.

522
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,560
I should just sleep on the floor.

523
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,080
It's too cold on the floor.

524
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,520
I should go instead.

525
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,200
Hold on.

526
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,080
I've thought about it.

527
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,360
We need to set our own rules

528
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,200
of getting along together.

529
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,760
Ensure it's strictly enforced.

530
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,800
And we should keep your heart rate

531
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,680
within a safe range.

532
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,440
Not only will it

533
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,160
be good for your heart,

534
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
but also make us

535
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,720
less alienated.

536
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,200
This is not something

537
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,640
within my abilities.

538
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
I'll leave it to you.

539
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,280
All right.

540
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,520
Go to bed.

541
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
I'll do the thinking.

542
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,600
Go on and sleep.

543
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,080
We can share the same bed.

544
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,280
But we can't kiss.

545
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,480
We can hug each other.

546
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,680
But that depends.

547
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,120
Is this okay for you?

548
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,760
Whatever you say.

549
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,040
Good night.

550
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,280
Good night.

551
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,840
Good night.

552
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,148
(I can kiss him on the cheek when he's asleep.)

553
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,326
(We can look into each other's eyes,
but have to keep it short.)

554
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,830
(When he's angry, I can behave
in a coquette-ish manner.)

555
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,580
(I can help dry his hair. Wear matching couple
T-shirts and exchange roles for one day.)

556
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,880
Jia Jia, here's your coffee.

557
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,840
What's wrong?

558
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,239
What's on your mind?

559
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I don't know.

560
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,080
My mind is blank.

561
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,199
Look, even the office is empty.

562
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,719
It's so desolate.

563
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,040
You have me.

564
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,560
Knock it off.

565
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,080
Su Man Lin is gone.

566
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,679
I don't really like her,

567
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,719
but listening to her bossing me around

568
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,920
actually livened up the place

569
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,920
a little.

570
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
And now, Jiang Xiao Ning is gone too.

571
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,040
She used to jump around the place

572
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,080
like a rabbit,

573
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,880
always helping us out with a smile on her face.

574
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,199
But now that I don't see her.

575
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
The office

576
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,280
seems so lifeless.

577
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,120
Have a cup of coffee.

578
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,880
It helps improve your mood.

579
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,440
Jia Jia.

580
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,480
Here are the materials that you asked for.

581
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,120
Thank you, Dong Dong.

582
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,920
Now, it feels like

583
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,840
the atmosphere here

584
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,560
is much better now.

585
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,200
Was the atmosphere bad?

586
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,040
I was so down before you came back.

587
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,200
You should avoid

588
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,160
going out so often.

589
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,240
If not,

590
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,720
I'll have no one

591
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,000
to talk to in the office.

592
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,640
Sure. No problem.

593
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,080
Go now. Get back to your work.

594
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,680
Why are you still laughing?

595
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,000
Hello?

596
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,480
Were you laughing earlier?

597
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,680
No.

598
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,560
You...

599
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,480
Just now,

600
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,280
you were pulling a long face.

601
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,960
But

602
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,920
you were all smiles

603
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,520
as soon as you saw him.

604
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,840
You rolled your eyes at me.

605
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,560
Are you...

606
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,960
What are you talking about?

607
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
You...

608
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm saying...

609
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,600
Oh, no.

610
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,880
This is bad.

611
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,080
What happened?

612
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,640
The landmark project.

613
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,240
Mr. Gu's previous plan

614
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,960
was not detailed enough.

615
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,960
So during this time,

616
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,520
we've been making adjustments

617
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,480
based on the opinions

618
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,280
of the project expert group.

619
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,120
Here comes the final feedback.

620
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,640
There are many things that require amendments.

621
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,480
But Mr. Gu isn't around. What do we do?

622
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm sure all of you are aware of the amendments

623
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,160
needed for the project, right?

624
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,240
Mr. Xu, we were just talking about it.

625
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,760
Mr. Xu, what do we do?

626
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,800
Cheng Dong, why don't you go?

627
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,880
You have experience in it after all.

628
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,040
Brother Kai, you need to be mindful.

629
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,200
How could you randomly assign

630
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,000
someone to deal with it?

631
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
Su Man Lin was the first assistant director.

632
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,840
It'll not be a problem if she's around.

633
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,000
And she's familiar with Mr. Gu's style.

634
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,440
But you expect me to take over at the last moment.

635
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,960
Aren't you ruining

636
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,400
the previous design concept?

637
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,280
We should wait for Mr. Gu to come back.

638
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,240
Mr. Gu hasn't been here

639
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,920
for so long.

640
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,680
He should be back soon.

641
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,360
No.

642
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,240
Definitely not.

643
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
No one is allowed to contact Gu Chuan.

644
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,840
You hear me?

645
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,720
If anyone dares to breathe a word of this

646
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,520
to Gu Chuan,

647
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,880
I won't go easy on you.

648
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,240
Mr. Xu.

649
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,400
How do we solve this then?

650
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,080
I'm here, aren't I?

651
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,520
Wait to hear from me.

652
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,600
It's been a while.

653
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
Not really. Does it feel that long?

654
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,080
Perhaps I've been missing you.

655
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,000
That's why

656
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
it felt like it's been a while.

657
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,520
Knock it off. I know you.

658
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,640
Stop beating around the bush.

659
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,440
Just put your cards on the table.

660
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,760
There's been a minor problem with the design

661
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,920
for the landmark project.

662
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,440
It requires some amendments.

663
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,360
Gu Chuan got something to deal with

664
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,680
and he couldn't take time off.

665
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,640
You're the only one I can think of.

666
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,400
Are you asking me

667
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,240
to go back and amend the design?

668
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:50,624
After all, you were the first assistant director

669
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,560
of this project.

670
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
No one's a better candidate.

671
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,920
But do you think

672
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,560
I could still bring myself to go back there again?

673
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,280
Everyone in the company

674
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,760
must hate me to the core.

675
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
I don't know what they think

676
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,400
and I don't care.

677
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
All I know is that

678
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,440
you have put a lot of effort

679
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,280
into this project too.

680
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,200
You can't just let it

681
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,520
fall apart.

682
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,120
I would love to help.

683
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,520
But I've booked

684
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,480
a flight ticket for tomorrow.

685
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,800
Where to?

686
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,160
I applied for a position

687
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,200
at a foreign design company

688
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,320
and I'm going to report to work.

689
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,040
So this city's

690
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,000
iconic architectural design plan

691
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,680
and the control and guide...

692
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,320
Actually...

693
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,920
Hey, are you guys

694
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,800
even listening?

695
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,200
Cheng Dong, they think

696
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
your proposal

697
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,680
doesn't match Mr. Gu's style.

698
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,560
This makes no difference at all.

699
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,880
What can I do?

700
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,960
Mr. Gu isn't here.

701
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,120
I can only voice out my opinion

702
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,400
and discuss it with you guys!

703
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,680
What's the point of asking all of you here?

704
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,200
Calm down. Let's discuss it.

705
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,640
We'll find a way.

706
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,600
Hear me out.

707
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,080
There have been some changes in the project.

708
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,920
So I've invited Su Man Lin

709
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,440
to help us out.

710
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,160
She was supposed

711
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,960
to report to work at a

712
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,560
design company in Italy.

713
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,600
But I managed to persuade her

714
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,520
to stay and help us out.

715
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,280
She'll leave after completing the project.

716
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,680
Welcome back.

717
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,920
Aren't you going to welcome her?

718
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,400
Save it.

719
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,720
Our top priority is the design.

720
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,760
Nothing else matters.

721
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,640
Cheng Dong.

722
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,080
Tell me the feedback.

723
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,160
What are the problems?

724
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,520
This is the report from the project team.

725
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,240
Take a look.

726
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,120
Sister Man Lin.

727
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,160
It's the previous design.

Welcome back.

742
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,240
The studio is having some difficulties

743
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,360
and Gu Chuan isn't around.

744
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,960
I need to come back.

745
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,720
Thank you.

746
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Less sugar.

747
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,960
Thank you.
