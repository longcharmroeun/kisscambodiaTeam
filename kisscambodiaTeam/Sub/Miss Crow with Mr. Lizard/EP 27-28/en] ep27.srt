Why didn't you bring...

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,480
Wasn't the meeting for business?

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
Why did you drink this much?

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll get you a glass of water.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,160
Drink some water first.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm telling you.

Don't play drunk on me.

Yan Yan,

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,640
I have something to tell you.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,480
I don't want to listen.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,480
You have to.

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Xu Cheng Ran,

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,000
you'll regret this tomorrow.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,320
I have to tell you

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,920
even if I'll regret it.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
I want to ask you,

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,600
when will I be able to

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,520
get closer to you?

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
When will I be able to

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
hold a place in your heart?

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't you know

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,840
clearly about what type of person

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,200
I, Xu Cheng Ran, am

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,880
and how I treat you?

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,960
I've never treated any relationship

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
as seriously as this one.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,480
I have never treated

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,160

try this with me?

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
Do you dare?

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Xu Cheng Ran,

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,280
say it one more time.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,640
Xu Cheng Ran,

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,600
how dare you lying on my bed?

Let me sleep a little longer.

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,720
Wake up and look at me.

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,800
There's nothing to look at.

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
Sleep!

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,320
Good morning.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,280
Why am I here?

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,880
Stop acting.

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,280
No...

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,360
I think I drank too much last night.

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,800
How come I can't

97
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
remember anything?

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you remember

99
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,080
what you said?

100
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,800
Yan Yan,

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
no matter what I said yesterday,

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,520
it was all nonsense,

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,360
definitely not telling the truth when drunk.

104
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,040
Don't take it to heart.

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
Xu Cheng Ran.

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
Xu Cheng Ran.

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,040
Are you making a fool of me?

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,600
I really don't remember.

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,520
Do I look that easy to fool?

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Xu Cheng Ran.

111
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,320
Yan Yan, I really...

112
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
I really don't remember

113
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,360
what I said.

114
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,480
Yan Yan.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,520
Yan Yan.

116
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,560
I dare to.

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
What do you dare to do?

118
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,040
I dare to try it with you.

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,440
What do you want to try?

120
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,320
Whatever you say.

121
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Yan Yan.

122
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
Yan Yan, what do you want to try?

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,480
I can't recall

124
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,480
what I said yesterday.

125
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Dumb.

126
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,040
An unusual person

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
has shown up.

128
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
A rare sight.

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
I think you already know

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
in your heart.

131
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,920
But I still think that

132
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,760
I should tell you myself.

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,000
I won.

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,600
You came here

135
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,560
for

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,560
the sole purpose of

137
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,240
showing me your presence?

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,720
It seems you still look down on me.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm still

140
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,240
not as good as your godson.

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,480
You like him better.

142
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,880
I shouldn't have come.

143
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
You can't

144
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,280
talk like that, brat.

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,159
Let me tell you.

146
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,480
You have to show me that

147
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,600
you can do it by going back to Reindeer Group.

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,080
And you have to show me that you're better than me.

149
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
That way you win.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
Wait for it.

151
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,280
Do you understand?

152
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,920
Let me

153
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,000
think about it.

154
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,800
Just tell me straight up if you need me.

155
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,880
No need to beat around the bush.

156
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
Gu Chuan.

157
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
(Hello.)

158
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,760
(The number you have dialed cannot be reached.)

159
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,740
Yan Yan, are you asleep?

160
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
(How should I tell Yan Yan)

161
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,860
(that I'm going back to Reindeer Group?)

162
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,740
(Yang Chun Alley)

163
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,940
Brother Xu.

164
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,580
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

165
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,340
You're drinking?

166
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,380
Xiao Ning,

167
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,140
nothing.

168
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,620
I'm just feeling down

169
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,500
and wanted to talk to someone.

170
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,660
Because of the bidding?

171
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,860
Not only that.

172
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,060
I have something

173
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,100
to tell you

174
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,940
about this bidding.

175
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,260
I've always respected you

176
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,780
and treated you like a brother.

177
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,540
I've always felt that we're close.

178
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,860
But

179
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,740
you didn't have to do

180
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,100
that kind of thing

181
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,500
to win over Mr. Xu and Mr. Gu.

182
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,140
If Mr. Xu investigates this,

183
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,340
you'll probably...

184
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,020
Sue me, right?

185
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,780
Let him sue.

186
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,900
The reason that I've been

187
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,180
deliberately planning all these years

188
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,500
is to win over them.

189
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,260
I won't be able to establish a place for myself

190
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,420
in this industry

191
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,460
unless I win over them.

192
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,980
I can only help you

193
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,380
become a top-tier architect designer

194
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,340
when I obtain

195
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,660
enough money

196
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,180
and power.

197
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,820
That's the only way I can help you to make
all your dreams come true.

198
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,900
But

199
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,500
I never asked you

200
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,060
to do that for me.

201
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,540
And I would never let you

202
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,780
do all that.

203
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,700
I was too impatient.

204
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,940
I should have done it

205
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,020
when I've better established myself.

206
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,780
You're drunk.

207
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,740
Come upstairs with me.

208
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,620
I'll ask Aunty

209
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,460
to cook you some hangover soup.

210
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,700
Xiao Ning, I'm not going.

211
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
Xiao Ning, I'm not going anywhere.

212
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,940
Xiao Ning.

213
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,820
You must

214
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,020
wait till I finish.

215
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,500
I've kept it to myself

216
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,500
for too long.

217
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,700
I never had a chance

218
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,580
to tell you about it.

219
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,980
It's like a needle

220
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,020
hurting me every day.

221
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,580
If I don't say it,

222
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,460
it might destroy me.

223
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,540
What... what are you going to say?

224
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,340
Xiao Ning,

225
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,020
I like you.

226
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,140
Brother Xu,

227
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,140
you're drunk.

228
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,340
I'm not drunk.

229
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,020
Xiao Ning.

230
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,180
I'm sober.

231
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,020
So listen to me.

232
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,620
Xiao Ning, I like you.

233
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,860
I've always treated you like a little sister.

234
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,020
I thought that it would be enough

235
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,900
to just take care of you and protect you.

236
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,140
But it's not

237
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,380
what I imagined.

238
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,300
I realized that my feelings for you

239
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,660
are changing day by day.

240
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,700
I have fallen in love with you.

241
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,260
I want to give you the best life possible.

242
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,060
That's why I suffered in silence

243
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,300
in that house.

244
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,620
I just hope that one day,

245
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,980
after helping you

246
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,860
achieve all of your dreams,

247
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,020
I can tell you

248
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,460
that I like you

249
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,100
uprightly.

250
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,340
Brother Xu,

251
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,940
I already have someone that I love.

252
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,940
Why Gu Chuan?

253
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm just as good as him.

254
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,700
We grew up together.

255
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,660
We experienced the accident together.

256
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
I've protected you with my life.

257
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,300
You warmed my heart

258
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,260
with your smile.

259
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,300
Xiao Ning,

260
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,700
our story together is irreplaceable.

261
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,540
No one can take that away from us.

262
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,660
Brother Xu,

263
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,980
we grew up together.

264
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,860
I treat you as my family and real brother.

265
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,340
I told you I don't want to be your brother.

266
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,180
Brother Xu, you're drunk.

267
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,780
Let's talk again when you're sober.

268
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,740
Xiao Ning.

269
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,500
Xiao Ning.

270
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,300
Xiao Ning.

271
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,180
Brother Xu.

272
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,060
Brother Xu.

273
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,260
Brother Xu.

274
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,140
Brother Xu.

275
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,180
Brother Xu, wake up, Brother Xu.

276
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,500
Brother Xu.

277
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,900
I asked the doctor.

278
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,220
The doctor said that you're fine.

279
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,260
You'll be discharged after having a little rest.

280
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,940
What you said today

281
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,860
surprised me.

282
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,300
We grew up together.

283
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,980
But it was just

284
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,660
true friendship.

285
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,820
We're good friends.

286
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,380
It's even sibling love.

287
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,940
I know.

288
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,700
But you've hurt this love today.

289
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,620
Xiao Ning.

290
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,140
I really didn't

291
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,220
control my emotions well.

292
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,020
I said hurtful things.

293
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,060
Xiao Ning, don't take it to heart.

294
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,020
Xiao Ning.

295
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,900
We should avoid seeing each other from now on.

296
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,260
Take care.

297
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,420
Xiao Ning.

298
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,540
Hello,

299
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,980
the person you are calling is currently unavailable.

300
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,100
(Dr. P)

301
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,140
Hello,

302
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,940
the person you are calling is
currently unavailable.

303
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
What's wrong?

304
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,380
I missed you.

305
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
So I'm here.

306
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Feeling wronged?

307
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,860
No.

308
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,620
I just want to hug you.

309
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,740
Okay.

310
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,820
Let's hug.

311
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,740
What happened?

312
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,140
Chuan, save me.

313
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,420
If I keep doing this,

314
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,780
I'll have to go get another heart.

315
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,340
Help me.

316
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,940
I can't do anything.

317
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,780
No,

318
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,860
I'm just afraid that

319
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,700
when the whole truth is revealed,

320
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,380
Zhao Yan will...

321
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,460
kick me out of this house

322
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,620
without any hesitation.

323
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,180
Then confess.

324
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,540
Confess?

325
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
If I confess, she definitely will abandon me.

326
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,980
No, I would die faster if I confess.

327
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,140
Can I just

328
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,900
have it both ways?

329
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,300
He's busy.

330
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,020
Hello?

331
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,820
Irresponsible.

332
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,780
Who's this?

333
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,500
So weird.

334
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,140
That looks familiar.

335
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,660
Isn't this Mr. Xu Junior?

336
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,620
Right.

337
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,740
Mr. Xu.

338
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm your secretary, Zhang Xiao Mi.

339
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,340
Hi.

340
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,700
Secretary?

341
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,540
Yes.

342
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,980
Were you Tang Xu's secretary?

343
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,700
No.

344
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,780
I just got transferred here

345
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,460
from another department.

346
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,260
Then I'm good.

347
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,940
Okay.

348
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,820
I'll head out then.

349
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,020
Let me know if you need me.

350
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,780
Okay.

351
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,660
Brother.

352
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,220
You're in the wrong place.

353
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,060
This floor is for the senior executives.

354
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,340
The Administration Department is downstairs.

355
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,820
Also,

356
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,980
call me Mr. Xu here.

357
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm just here to hand over things.

358
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,260
Also to congratulate you.

359
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,940
I'm going to leave if you don't have anything else.

360
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,860
Wait.

361
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,100
You forgot something.

362
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,220
Take your drinkware away.

363
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,020
Baby.

364
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,180
Are you busy?

365
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,980
No, no. What's up?

366
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,260
I'm just calling to tell you that

367
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
I have to work overtime tonight.

368
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,740
You don't have to wait for me for dinner.

369
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,340
You're working overtime.

370
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,060
Overtime?

371
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,500
Work isn't that important.

372
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,020
Don't overwork yourself.

373
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,620
Don't take it too seriously

374
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,580
when you work overtime.

375
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
I'll let you do your work.

376
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
Working overtime.

377
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,300
Hmm...

378
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,140
Secretary.

379
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,020
Secretary.

380
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,820
Mr. Xu.

381
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm Zhang Xiao Mi.

382
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,060
Is there anything I can help you with?

383
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,780
Xiao Mi,

384
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,100
tell everyone my order.

385
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,940
No.

386
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,540
It's a mandatory rule.

387
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,060
No other department's personnel

388
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,060
is allowed to randomly

389
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,340
visit our floor for any reason.

390
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,420
Of course, Mr. Xu.

391
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,460
Also,

392
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,620
replace everything

393
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,860
that I don't like

394
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,780
in this room.

395
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,300
Okay.

396
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,380
So,

397
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,100
which ones do you not like?

398
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,740
Let me look around

399
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,980
and get back to you.

400
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,300
Okay, you can take your time.

401
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,260
I'll leave first.

402
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,580
You're the one I don't like the most.

403
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,660
You're so childish.

404
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,140
Playing hide-and-seek in the same building.

405
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,380
How long do you think

406
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,340
you can hide?

407
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,900
As long as I can.

408
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,140
Don't you tell

409
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,380
Jiang Xiao Ning.

410
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,380
Think about it.

411
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,380
When the whole truth is revealed,

412
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,900
what are you going to do?

413
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,260
I'll...

414
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,300
die in a really bad way.

415
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,940
Glad you know it.

416
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,180
Good luck.

417
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,060
I can do it.

418
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,660
I'll work hard

419
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,300
for my happiness.

420
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,660
Why are you here?

421
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,900
Xu Cheng Ran.

422
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,740
How can you recognize me when I'm like this?

423
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,780
I can recognize you with one glimpse.

424
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,060
Here for your dad?

425
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,580
No way.

426
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm not that lame.

427
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
I'm here

428
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,780
to pick you up from work.

429
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,460
So you came from upstairs.

430
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,140
I went to the wrong floor.

431
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,060
It's not important.

432
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,300
What do you want to eat?

433
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,420
Don't rush it. You can take your time.

434
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,660
With our current progress,

435
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,540
we should be almost done.

436
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,060
Wait a second.

437
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,300

We aren't

523
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,820
coming back tonight.

524
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,260
Check and see if you have your ID.

525
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,420
It's in my bag.

526
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,180
Check it.

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,340
It won't be good

528
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,380

532
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,220

533
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,460

535
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,820

537
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,780

538
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,700
To get married.

539
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,380
Did you

540
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,380
take my ID?

00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:56,980

543
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,980
I agreed to date you.

544
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,300
Did I say I would marry you?

545
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,180
I know.

546
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,900
Zhao Yan, if you say yes,

547
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,220
we'll go in right now.

548
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,780
If you don't,

549
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,420
we'll just take a day tour

550

551
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,980
We'll come here sooner or later anyway.

552
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,700
I'm going to go now.

553
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,220
Mess around on your own.

554
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,740
Yan Yan.

555
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,020
I didn't prepare a

556
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,260
fancy marriage proposal ceremony

557
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,220
because I know that

558
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,300
you don't like those.

559
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,500
I apologize that

560
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
you won't enjoy more time

561
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,980
of me chasing after you.

562
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,380
I'm really afraid that

563
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,820
you'll change your mind one day.

564
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,300
So I want to ask you now.

565
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,620
Will you marry me?

566
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,580
Xu Cheng Ran,

567
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,980
I do like you.

568
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,900
But if you're talking about getting married,

569
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,140
there are a lot of external conditions

570
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,220
that prove we're not a good fit.

571
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,060
I've never asked

572
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,020

573
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,900
But I know that you really don't like

574
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,820
rich second generation.

575
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,660
I've never relied on my family

576
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,700
after I graduated from university.

577
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,140
I started my business with Gu Chuan

578
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,940
and worked my way here.

579
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,900
You know about all this.

580
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,820
I've told you about this.

581
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,340
Yes, I'm born rich.

582
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,020
But whether it's my family

583
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,380
or Reindeer Group,

584
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,700
none of them is up to me.

585
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
I've never thought that

586
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,220
my family

587
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,460
can give me any convenience.

588
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
I think of it

589
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,100
as a responsibility.

590
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,100
The reason that

591
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm still not back at Reindeer Group

592
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,420

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,260
I'm afraid.

594
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
I'm afraid that I won't be able to

595
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,060
take on the responsibility.

596
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
I'm afraid that I'll destroy everything.

597
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,140
Hundreds of people

598
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,420
rely on that for a living.

599
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,020

that you won the bid

703
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,780
is because your design plan

00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,460
I'm starving.

764
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,740
Jiang Xiao Ning, you're a good cook.

765
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,220
Looks great, smells great.

766
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,580
Let me have a taste.

767
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,100
How is it?

768
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,060
Delicious.

769
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,140
Chuan,

770
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,460
you're a lucky guy.

771
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,420
Our Xiao Ning

772
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,220
excels at work

773
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
and in the kitchen.

774
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,540
Who will be so lucky

775
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,420
to marry her in the future?

776
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,300
So what are your plans?

777
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,940
Wifey,

778
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,020
I also excel at work and in the kitchen.

779
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,060
Aren't I great?

780
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,180
Why do you have to be a part of everything?

781
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,860
Gu Chuan, I'm serious.

782
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,100
Xiao Ning is someone

783
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,220
who always thinks about others,

784
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,140
but never

785
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,300
thinks about herself.

786
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,300
So you...

787
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,540
I know what you mean.

788
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,540
Don't worry.

789
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,700
Stop worrying.

790
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,100
Gu Chuan is very responsible.

791
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:29,820
-I…
-Sister Yan Yan.

792
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,860
Sister Yan Yan, time to eat.

793
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,060
Try out my cooking.

794
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,180
We were the ones who got married,

795
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,740
but you're the one who cooked all this.

796
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Although I feel kind of bad,

797
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,380
I'm really happy.

798
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,180
Our meal today is

799
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,860
to celebrate you two getting married,

800
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
to celebrate

801
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,860
signing a contract with Reindeer Group,

802
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,260
and to

803
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,140
thank you for taking care

804
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,500
of Xiao Ning all this time.

805
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,740
Xiao Ning,

806
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,260
I also want to thank you.

807
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,780
If it weren't for you,

808
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,020
I might not have gotten

809
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,060
Yan Yan to be with me.

810
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,620
Come on.

811
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,780
Happy Wedding Day

812
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,140
to Mr. Xu and Sister Yan Yan!

813
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,900
Thank you.

814
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:02,620
Cheers.

815
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,540
Thank you.

816
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,700
My dream has finally come true.

817
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,620
Wifey,

818
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,540
please take good care of me from now on.

819
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,940
Please take good care of me.

820
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,860
But your hair...

821
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,860
When will it grow back?

822
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,380
Sister Yan Yan.

823
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,500
Mr. Xu is so sincere.

824
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,540
He shaved his head

825
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,660
in order to propose to you.

826
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,220
This is being stupid.

827
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,700
Look at Gu Chuan.

828
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,140
What a romantic confession.

829
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,620
Alright, alright. Stop.

830
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,580
The second toast.

831
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,260
Wish Xiao Ning and Gu Chuan happiness.

832
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,580
Wish all the best

833
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,940
to the four of us.

834
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,620
Right.

835
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,140
All the best.

836
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,860
Hold on.

837
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,900
Let me get this out now.

838
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,180
If you don't

839
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,580
treat Jiang Xiao Ning well

840
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
and I find out about it,

841
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,900
you will be held responsible.

842
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,260
Why do I have to be held responsible

843
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,660
if Gu Chuan doesn't treat Jiang Xiao Ning well?

844
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,460
Inadequate supervision on your part.

845
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,820
Fine. Let's finish our toast.

846
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,060
Once we do, we can eat.

847
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,420
Cheers.

848
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,180
Cheers.

849
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,780
