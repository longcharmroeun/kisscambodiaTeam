Wei Zi Zhao.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,880
What kind of report is this?

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,960
Call the Marketing Department to
have a meeting right now.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
The Marketing Department?

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Mr. Xu.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,720
Mr. Xu.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm the manager,

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,520
Wei Zi Zhao.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,280
Well, the name is just a title.

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
Call me Brother-in-law.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You look familiar.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,280
Do I?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,320
Mr. Xu, I have one of those faces

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
that you can randomly see on the streets.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,080
Sorry, I'm late.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Mr. Xu.

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Wei...

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,440
Zi Zhao.

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,400
Wei Zi Zhao.

What kind of report the Marketing Department

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,240
has made?

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,560
I read no more than three pages

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,520
and I have found a few errors

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
that do not match with the time.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,520
How careless. And it's so messy.

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,480
Who made this?

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,680
I think it was...

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,560
I made it.

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,120
No matter who made it.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,600
As a manager,

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,920
shouldn't you go through it first?

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
There is a lot of staff.

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,400
I can't keep tabs on everyone.

59
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,840
Yes.

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
As the department leaders,

61
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
you should learn to take responsibility.

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,240
Redo it.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,640
Do it yourself.

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't get others to do your work.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,960
Got it?

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,600
Yes.

67
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
You're right, Mr. Xu.

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,080
Go on.

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,840
It's weekend.

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,640
Although you're my boyfriend,

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
you still have to pay me

72
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,160
for overtime work.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
Here. Take a look.

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,680
You're invited to participate in

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,440
the reconstruction of your alma mater's library.

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
This is awesome!

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
They sent me the invitation.

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,600
But after all,

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
I've graduated for quite some time.

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Shouldn't I give this opportunity

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,279
to my fellow juniors

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
who have

83
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,480
just graduated?

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,079
That's very generous of you.

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,960
But

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
you can't miss

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,120
this opportunity.

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,080
Think about it.

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
You can go back to your alma mater

90
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,720
and leave your mark there.

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
That's one way

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,280
to set an example to the juniors.

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
That's what I thought.

94
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,920
Well, what's with that idea

95
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,360
of giving your spot to others?

96
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,720
I just wanted to know what you think.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,320
Does it matter?

98
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Of course.

99
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,120
After I won the Jin An Award,

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,120
I once thought

101
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,560
about ending my own life.

102
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,480
You changed my mind.

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
So

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
I don't need to tell you

105
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,400
how big of an influence you have on me.

106
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
All my previous designs were made

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
with winning the Jin An Award as my goal.

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,360
So I was under

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,400
a lot of pressure.

110
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,840
This time,

111
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I want to regain

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,400
my original intention

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,840
of studying architectural design.

114
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
No strings attached.

115
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,760
Not seeking anything in return.

Zhao Yan.

193
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,280
During this period of time,

194
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,120
my work...

195
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,160
She's really champing at the bit.

196
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,600
Xu...

197
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Manager Zhao.

198
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Mr. Xu.

199
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,640
Get back to your work.

200
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,520
What is it, darling? Miss me?

201
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,360
Did you have me transferred

202
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,240
to work as an assistant?

203
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,080
I just want

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
to see you every day.

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,800
Did you ask for my opinion?

206
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,440
Isn't it great to work together?

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,960
Do you know what is respect?

208
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,640
Come on.

209
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,360
Well, Jiang Xiao Ning

210
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,560
is Gu Chuan's assistant too.

211
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
Re...

212
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,400
(Resign)
Resign.

213
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Darling,

214
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,000
get ahold of yourself.

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,480
Type the resignation letter yourself.

216
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm leaving.

217
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,800
Wait.

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,400
I just want

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
to be able to see you every day.

220
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,240
Was I wrong?

221
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,760
It's all because of Xu Cheng Ran?

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,560
No.

223
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,200
Don't deny it.

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
I've resigned.

225
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
Why must you resign?

226
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
If I don't,

227
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
we'll get a divorce certificate.

228
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Sister Yan Yan.

229
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,840
You don't have to.

230
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Our relationship

231
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,640
is very complicated, you know that?

232
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,600
If he was just my boss,

233
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
I'd have no comments

234
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,240
on the job transfer.

235
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,480
But he's now my husband.

236
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
He got me transferred

237
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,680
not because

238
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,880
he appreciates my ability

239
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,640
but because he wants to see me often.

240
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,400
Besides,

241
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,600
he didn't even discuss it with me.

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,280
Both my life and work.

243
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,280
Double kill.

244
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,960
You

245
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
should take a shower

246
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
and lie in bed comfortably.

247
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,600
If you can't fall asleep,

248
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,600
think of his goodness.

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,400
I think you've

250
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
made things too complicated.

251
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
I don't think so.

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,840
I think

253
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,680
when I got carried away,

254
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
I started to take things easy.

255
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,080
Are you really not going to let him come back?

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,720
I've changed the passcode of the door.

257
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
Stay here for a few more days with me.

258
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Why would this happen?

259
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,960
Cheng Ran

260
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,000
has worked in the company

261
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,280
for sometime.

262
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,880
I think

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,360
his performance

264
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,800
didn't go unnoticed.

265
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,040
Today,

266
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,720
we'll do a vote.

267
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,520
Please raise your hand

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,440
if you agree that Xu Cheng Ran

269
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,120
will serve as the executive director

270
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,760
and the CEO of the group.

271
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,720
Please raise your hands.

272
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,720
It's unanimously passed.

273
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,600
Really?

274
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
It looks like there's no objection.

275
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Since there's no objection,

276
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,120
that speaks a lot

277
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,800
to Xu Cheng Ran's capability.

278
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,800
All right.

279
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,080
It's passed unanimously.

280
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
(Statement of Assets and Liabilities
of Reindeer Group)

281
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,280
Mr. Tang.

282
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:27,960
Mr...

283
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,440
What's the matter?

284
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,360
I have no idea.

285
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,720
Sun.

286
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,640
Are you going out?

287
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes.

288
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
Director Xu asked to see me.

289
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,080
Anything?

290
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,360
Is he...

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,920
Is he going to check the accounts?

292
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,680
That's right.

293
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
He wants a thorough check.

294
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,400
I think

295
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,640
it's going to take a while.

296
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,880
I heard

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
there'll be external audits.

298
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,320
By the way,

299
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,040
do you remember

300
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,840
the funds

301
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,560
I asked you to transfer last month?

302
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,720
What about it?

303
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
I transferred out based on the contract.

304
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,520
Can you do me a favor?

305
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,640
Don't bother about the contract.

306
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
I'll settle the legal issue.

307
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
Can it be processed

308
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,480
as my personal loan?

309
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,920
How is it possible to process such a huge amount

310
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,880
as a personal loan?

311
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,720
Besides,

312
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,560
the Financial Department

313
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,360
doesn't get a say

314
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,320
in the audit.

315
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
It's handled by external auditors.

316
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
We're only working with them.

317
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Sun.

318
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
We're old acquaintances.

319
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,800
Look.

320
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,960
This has nothing to do with that.

321
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,560
All right now.

322
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,680
I'm busy. I have to go now.

323
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,440
How about this, Sun?

324
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,680
Buy me some time

325
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
and handle those funds

326
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,360
last.

327
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
I'll make up for the amount.

328
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,080
Please, I'm begging you.

329
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,200
Why do you need to do that?

330
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,480
Don't worry about this.

331
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,680
I'll make up for the funds

332
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,680
and rescind the contracts.

333
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,640
Just pretend none of this

334
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,400
ever happened.

335
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,800
Sun.

336
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,120
All right then.

337
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,720
One to two days, tops.

338
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,880
Not for long.

339
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,960
All right.

340
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Thank you, Sun.

341
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
I'll return the favor next time.

342
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
There's no need for that.

343
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,000
All right now.

344
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,600
Wait for me.

345
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,280
I need to go over now.

346
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,720
All right.

347
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,240
Take care.

348
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,880
Boss said

349
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,720
we'll be able to rest

350
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,160
after pulling a couple of all-nighters.

351
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Thank you.

352
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
I knew I'd be put through hell

353
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,240
when I chose to be in this line of work.

354
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,600
What did you say?

355
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,400
It's for our company's performance.

356
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,400
Here.

357
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
For the sake of our company,

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,440
we...

359
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
Don't mind working hard!

360
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
That's enough, Wang Kai.

361
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Boss.

362
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm just trying to boost morale.

363
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,760
All right.

364
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,280
What happened?

365
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,400
Damn, I was halfway through it.

366
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,200
What's going on?

367
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,920
It's rendered halfway.

368
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,680
What's going on?

369
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,280
Calm down.

370
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Stay calm, guys.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll check it out.

372
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,440
What happened?

373
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,840
You don't look good.

374
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm fine.

375
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,040
Maybe because the progress is a bit slow.

376
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,160
So I'm feeling a little anxious.

377
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,440
Are you mad?

378
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,120
No.

379
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,240
Was the power outage because of you?

380
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,600
Don't get me wrong.

381
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,360
This time,

382
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,840
it has nothing to do with me.

383
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Thank God.

384
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
Although it's slower than expected,

385
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,040
everyone is working hard.

386
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,760
Be patient, all right?

387
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,240
Okay.

388
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,160
What do you want?

389
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,240
(Marriage Certificate)
Please fulfill your obligations.

390
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,440
(Marriage Certificate)
You can't kick me out of the house.

391
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,560
I reserve all the right for final explanation.

392
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Darling, I'm sorry.

393
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,360
It hurts!

394
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,720
Are you alright?

395
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
My foot's hurt.

396
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Slow down.

397
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,760
Let me take a look.

398
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,680
Darling.

399
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,880
I was wrong.

400
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,640
Forgive me.

401
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,800
I promise I won't do it next time.

402
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,760
Next time?

403
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,400
No more next time.

404
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,360
Does it hurt?

405
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,840
A little.

406
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,440
Here.

407
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
I bought pizza and fruits.

408
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
I thought you don't eat these.

409
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm trying now.

410
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,400
After all, I've done things

411
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,800
that are way more dangerous.

412
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,720
What is it?

413
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,120
Loving you.

414
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
Ever since I'm with you,

415
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,480
my heart

416
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,320
tends to beat faster.

417
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,600
I couldn't even feel your heartbeat.

418
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,760
Which baby formula

419
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,720
is your baby having?

420
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,320
Baby!

421
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,640
Baby!

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,880
Gu Chuan!

423
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,120
Gu Chuan!

424
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,360
Gu Chuan!

425
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,680
Are you all right?

426
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,440
-Gu Chuan!
-Are you all right?

427
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,040
Gu Chuan!

428
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,680
Are you okay?

429
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,400
Gu Chuan!

430
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Gu Chuan, wake up!

431
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,880
Is he hurt?

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,560
Please call 120!

433
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
Please call 120!

434
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,120
Hello?

435
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,640
Hello?

436
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,040
Gu Chuan!

437
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,720
Is this 120?

438
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,360
There's been an accident.

439
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,560
It's at the park by the street.

440
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,520
-Please come at once!
-Gu Chuan.

441
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Hurry up.

442
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,480
-Gu Chuan.
-Thank you.

443
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
Don't fall asleep, all right?

444
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,400
The ambulance will be here soon.

445
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,720
You'll be fine.

446
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,840
You'll be fine.

447
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
You'll be fine, Gu Chuan.

448
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,680
It'll be all right, Gu Chuan.

449
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,880
Yes, a motorcycle.

450
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,760
A motorcycle.

451
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,240
You'll be fine.

452
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,960
Injured patients?

453
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,920
There are two.

454
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,280
How are you feeling?

455
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,080
Don't fall asleep.

456
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,560
Darling, I'm going out.

457
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,320
There's an emergency.

458
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,080
Go faster.

459
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,920
All right.

460
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,160
Where are you?

461
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,280
Gu Chuan got into a car accident.

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
We're on the way to the hospital.

463
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,400
I'll be right there.

464
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,600
Gu Chuan.

465
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,520
(Emergency)

466
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
The surgery went well.

467
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,520
The patient is awake now.

468
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,240
The only thing we can treat

469
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
is his physical injuries.

470
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,200
But there are things

471
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,960
that we aren't able to treat.

472
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,640
For his heart problem,

473
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,120
we have to contact Dr. Peer

474
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,120
from the Institute of Science.

475
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,120
I just called.

476
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
But no one answered.

477
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
You need to get in touch with

478
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,320
this doctor as soon as possible.

479
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
Otherwise, he'll be in grave danger.

480
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,680
You may see the patient now.

481
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,160
But don't disturb his rest.

482
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,320
Make sure that the patient

483
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,320
has a calm and stable emotional state.

484
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,760
All right?

485
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,320
Thank you, Doctor.

486
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,480
You're welcome.

487
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Get more rest.

488
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,600
Thank you.

489
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,640
Chuan.

490
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,640
Are you feeling better?

491
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,320
Much better.

492
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
You must be very scared.

493
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
A little.

494
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,480
Go home and rest.

495
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Xu Cheng Ran

496
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,600
can keep me company.

497
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,240
I want to stay.

498
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
Go home.

499
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,880
You can bring over

500
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
some stuff I need tomorrow.

501
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,320
Be a good girl.

502
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,280
Go home.

503
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,720
Don't worry.

504
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,760
This has happened

505
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,440
a few times before.

506
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,640
My heart aches all of a sudden.

507
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,800
I have no idea why.

508
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,560
Does it require

509
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
an update or something?

510
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
What did the doctor say?

511
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,760
Lately,

512
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,760
I haven't been able to reach him.

513
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,960
I've been calling him

514
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,920
just now.

515
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,000
But there was no answer.

516
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,040
Didn't he still say

517
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,800
that your heart problem

518
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,680
can be completely solved

519
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,840
soon enough?

520
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
Why the sudden loss of communication?

521
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,240
I've booked

522
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,320
the earliest flight tomorrow

523
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,320
to bring the doctor over.

524
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,320
All right.

525
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,000
Miss Qing Zi.

526
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,480
Mr. Xu.

527
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
Sorry to disturb you.

528
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,080
I'm here to see Dr. Peer.

529
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,360
Ms. Qing Zi.

530
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,320
Did something happen?

531
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
Dr. Peer

532
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,920
has passed away.

533
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,920
(Intracerebral hemorrhage.)

534
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,320
(He didn't even leave)

535
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,320
(any last words.)

536
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
(Miss Qing Zi.)

537
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,320
(I know)

538
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,560
(it's not the right time to say this.)

539
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,240
But this is really urgent.

540
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,480
What about the problems I'm having?

541
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Who will take over

542
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,520
the laboratory?

543
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,760
As far as I know,

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,120
the lab funding has been terminated.

545
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
I can think of ways

546
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,520
to help with funding.

547
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,280
Everything is open for discussion.

548
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,480
But the lab cannot be shut down.

549
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,560
It's not just for Gu Chuan.

550
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,240
It's the hope of many people.

551
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,960
The core of the lab isn't the funding.

552
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,320
It's Dr. Peer.

553
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,360
The mechanical heart is Dr. Peer's patent.

554
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,520
(It's way ahead)

555
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
(of any research institute.)

556
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
(So far,)

557
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,560
(no one has been able to come close to his level.)

558
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,600
You're shirking responsibility.

559
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,760
It was you

560
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,840
who replaced Gu Chuan's heart.

561
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,080
You can't just install it

562
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,320
and leave it just like that.

563
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,040
We feel sorry too.

564
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,800
(But it's legal for us)

565
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,120
(to help replace Mr. Gu's heart.)

566
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,360
(Even broad-spectrum drugs)

567
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,280
(may have side effects.)

568
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,240
(Mr. Gu's current situation)

569
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
(is the side effect of it.)

570
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,560
(Tell me.)

571
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,600
How long can Gu Chuan's heart last

572
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,880
if there's no upgrade?

573
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,880
According to Dr. Peer,

574
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,720
each time there's a glitch,

575
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,520
it causes damage to the master copy.

576
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
So the best way so far

577
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,680
is to live

578
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,040
according to the lifestyle

579
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,280
that the doctor

580
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,200
had previously advised.

581
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That way,

582
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,680
it can maximize its lifespan.

583
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,280
Perhaps, it can last a long time.

584
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,320
(But it may also)

585
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,640
(stop working all of a sudden.)

586
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Banana?

587
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,280
Sure.

588
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,320
Apple?

589
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,240
That's fine too.

590
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,720
We'll go with the tangerine.

591
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,560
Mr. Xu.

592
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,280
Since he's here, you can go back now.

593
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,040
You can change shifts now.

594
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,840
It pains my heart if you get too tired.

595
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,640
All right.

596
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll visit you again tomorrow.

597
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,240
Bye, Mr. Xu.

598
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,920
Bye.

599
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,000
You didn't find Dr. Peer?

600
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,520
What is it? Tell me.

601
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,760
Dr. Peer

602
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,640
has passed away.

603
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,400
It was very sudden.

604
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,640
Chuan.

605
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,040
There'll be some other ways.

606
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,920
Really, don't give up.

607
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,600
God must be kidding me.

608
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
I couldn't die when I wanted to.

609
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,000
Now that I want to live and he won't let me.

610
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,400
Chuan.

611
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,880
You won't abandon yourself to despair.

612
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
No one can tell me

613
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,560
what kind of life

614
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm supposed to live.

615
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,040
Does it mean

616
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,640
you're giving up?

617
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,200
I might leave this world

618
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,440
at any time.

619
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,400
Don't do anything stupid.

620
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,960
It's been 10 years.

621
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,040
In the past 10 years,

622
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,160
how many things,

623
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,920
big and small,

624
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,080
have happened?

625
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,560
There were so many times

626
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,040
I thought I wouldn't survive.

627
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,880
I have fought death

628
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,360
so many times.

629
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,520
This time,

630
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,320
I thought

631
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,000
I would be calm like how I was.

632
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
But I realized

633
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,280
I couldn't.

634
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,240
Because of Jiang Xiao Ning?

635
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,400
I'm afraid I might just drop dead

636
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,200
and it might happen right in front of her.

637
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,120
I really couldn't imagine

638
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,040
how big of a blow and impact

639
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,640
would this do on her.

640
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,760
She was already

641
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,920
unfortunate enough when she was a kid.

642
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,040
She had to witness

643
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
her parents died.

644
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,400
And now,

645
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,640
she finally got over it.

646
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,880
If I...

647
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,160
If I leave quietly,

648
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
she'll get anxious looking for me.

649
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,080
It's better not to prolong the agony.

650
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
Perhaps,

651
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,040
ending our relationship now

652
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,440
is the best thing to do.

653
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,760
That way,

654
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,040
even when she

655
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,440
learns about my death,

656
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
she won't be too sad.

657
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,520
There will be a way.

658
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,680
(That mechanical heart)

659
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
(can give you a second life.)

660
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,880
(But you have to understand.)

661
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,800
(It will also bring you the pain)

662
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,760
(you have to endure.)

663
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,120
It's a kind of happiness

664
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,600
when one's heart beats for another person.

665
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,480
But in your case,

666
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,320
that signals danger.

667
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,480
(So in the days to come,)

668
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
(you can't let yourself be filled with emotions.)

669
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,880
Gu Chuan.

670
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Ten years ago,

671
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,840
you went your own way

672
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,880
and pushed me away.

673
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,400
Ten years later,

674
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
are you still going

675
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,760
to do the same to another girl?

676
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,320
Is that you, Big Brother?

677
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,960
Yes.

Where are you?

690
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,880
I brought the dumplings

691
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,720
my aunt made for you.

692
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,840

693
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,320
I'm at the studio.

How can you be discharged?

695
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,320
Did the doctor allow you?

696
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,640
I can be discharged already.

697
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

698
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,080
Boss, please sign this.

699
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,600
The person in charge of each project.

700
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,400
Go to the conference room in five minutes

701
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,720
to report the progress of the project.

702
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,800
Report the progress of the project?

703
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,200
Didn't he say in the previous meeting

704
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,920
that we should all focus

705
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
on the library project?

706
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,720
Shoot.

707
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,520
I haven't started working on it.

708
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,920
Do you know what's wrong with our boss?

709
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,840
Why is he a different person all of a sudden?

710
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,880
All of a sudden?

711
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,560
That's because you don't know.

712
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Before you came,

713
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,520
our boss acted like the King of Hell

714
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,239
for a really long time.

715
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,560
His friendliness can only last for so long.

716
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,600
Dong.

717
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,560
Get moving.

718
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,760
You have only five minutes.

719
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,560
It's four and a half minutes.

720
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,560
It's four and a half minutes.

721
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,080
Four and a half minutes?

722
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,239
Hurry up.

723
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:31,800
Here's the design.

724
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
Give me the design.

725
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,360
Let's begin.

726
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,639
What's the matter?

727
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,280
Should I call your names?

728
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,040
Boss.

729
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,639
The sketch

730
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,480
of the library project

731
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,640
has been revised.

732
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,880
I'll need

733
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,560
your confirmation.

734
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,040
Why are you only asking it now?

735
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,760
You weren't around in the past few days.

736
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,120
Don't you have my WeChat?

737
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,520
I didn't want to disturb you.

738
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,960
I said this before.

739
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,520
The library project is our main project.

740
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,440
We're already behind schedule.

741
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,440
You know there's a problem

742
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
and you didn't communicate it at once.

743
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,920
Cheng Dong.

744
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,160
You're not new here.

745
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,560
Do you need me to teach you how to do your job?

746
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,040
Sit down.

747
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,120
I'm going to say this again.

748
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,720
The library project is our top priority.

749
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,880
It has to

750
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,160
be completed on schedule.

751
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,720
Got it?

752
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,400
-Yes.
-Yes.

753
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,520
All right.

754
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,360
Who's next?

755
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,800
Well...

756
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Mr. Gu.

757
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,600
This...

758
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,880
This is my architectural

759
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,560
design plan.

760
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,560
Are you sure you're okay?

761
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,320
I know the status

762
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
of my own health.

763
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,440
We can talk about personal matters after work.

764
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,880
Okay, Boss.

765
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,680
Hello.

766
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
Need help?

767
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,360
No, you can go.

768
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,080
Cheng Dong, are you done with the work?

769
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,080
Not yet.

770
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,080
You really don't need my help?

771
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,800
Boss said it upsets him to see
too many people around.

772
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,640
But...

773
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,640
I'm going to get the sketches.

774
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,440
(I'll wait for you downstairs.)

775
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,920
(I'll drive you home after you're
done with your work.)

776
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,880
Boss.

777
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,280
It's getting late.

778
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
You can go first.

779
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,800
Cheng Dong.

780
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,840
Those comments I made today...

781
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,480
It's all my mistake.

782
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,120
I was too harsh.

783
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,760
You can lead the team

784
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,360
to this project proposal meeting.

785
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,360
Me?

786
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,160
What?

787
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,520
You have no confidence?

788
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,880
It's not that.

789
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Boss, isn't that your project?

790
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
It's everyone's work.

791
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
Thank you, Boss.

792
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,680
I'll do my best.

793
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
I won't let you down.

794
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,200
By the way,

795
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,120
Xiao Ning is still waiting for you outside.

796
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,720
Did you...

797
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,560
I should be having late-night
snacks with friends now.

798
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,800
I'm late already.

799
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,880
Well, I'll get going.

800
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,240
Lock the door and windows

801
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,960
on your way out.

802
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,240
Brother Dong.

803
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,160
Xiao Ning.

804
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,080
You've finished working?

805
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Where's Boss?

806
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,160
He just left.

807
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,200
Left?

808
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
Boss told me

809
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,480
that he's having late-night snacks

810
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,960
with friends and left in a hurry.

811
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,880
I see.

812
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,480
It's getting late.

813
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,640
Why don't you go home?

814
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,360
What about I drive you home?

815
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,200
It's fine.

816
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,560
I can call a cab.

817
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,560
Bye, Brother Dong.

818
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,920
Stay safe then.
