Thank you, Boss.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,920
Okay.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Jiang Xiao Ning.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,600
When we were eating,

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I heard your aunt said

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,600
that your family was involved

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,160
in a car accident ten years ago?

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Was that ten years ago today?

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,680
Yes.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
Where was it?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,160
It was on the way to the geopark.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,640
It was my birthday that day.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,640
My dad finally had time

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,440
to take me to Grandma's place.

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
But on the way there...

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Dad! A car!

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
Do you remember

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
I told you that

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,960
I have

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
a big brother whom I miss a lot?

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,160
Actually,

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
that big brother was hit

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,480
and fell off the cliff with us.

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,080
It was really cold that night.

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,800
He was holding my hand

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,560
and encouraging me to stay alive.

50
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,480
He even sang the birthday song for me.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,880
Although he sang in a really low voice,

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
I heard everything.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Make a wish.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,720
The wishes

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,760
made on birthdays

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
always come true.

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Happy birthday to you.

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,520
Happy birthday to you.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Hope you're happy every day.

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Actually,

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,080
the birthday song you sang today

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,920
was a little special.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,680
Boss,

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
what's wrong?

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,200
Nothing.

66
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,960
Have all the dishes been washed?

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,480
Let's go to the living room if everything's done.

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,480
We'll be leaving then.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,440
Have a safe trip home.

70
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
Be happy!

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,400

72

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
You first.

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,880
I'll wait till you get in the car.

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,680

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,640
you're going back up.

82
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,920

132

to let me introduce myself to you.

133
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,039

139
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120

No.

150
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,720
You said yes.

151
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,960

I'm warning you!

159

This chance is offered to Xu Cheng Ran,

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440

Why don't you just

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,400
stay for the night.

166
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,640
Sure.

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,200
Drive safely on the way home.

168
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,560

Yan Yan, I love you.

170
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,080

171
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,720
drink coffee this time of the day?

172
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm afraid that you won't be able to sleep.

173
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,680
If it's not for Gu Chuan,

174
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,920
this brat who doesn't care about his life at all,

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,840
(Mechanical heart valve)
I won't be working this hard.

(Mechanical heart valve)

177
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,920

183
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,280
you haven't had a breakthrough

184
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,520
in a long time.

185
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
This is the nature of my job.

186
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,840
Maybe I won't make any progress in ten years,

187
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,880
or

188
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,400
I will make a

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,840
major breakthrough.

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
You still have to rest when you need to.

191
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,280
You have to alternate work with rest.

192
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,720
Alright.

193
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
Let's call it a day.

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,040
Breakthrough.

195
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,160
This is the breakthrough!

196
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,520
Right when I needed it.

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,920
Charging completed.

198
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,280
Hello?

199
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,200
Hi, Gu Chuan.

200
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm going to tell you something.

201
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,080
Promise me you will

202
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,640
control your emotions.

203
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Don't get so excited

204
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
that you destroy your own house.

205
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,840
Go on.

206
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,600
I'm in the charging station right now.

207
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,400
It's safe.

208
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,640
Since the last episode

209
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,640
of your excessive electric discharge,

210
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
I've been doing different calculations

211
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,320
in the lab

212
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,040
to try to find a solution to that whole series of

213
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,920
errors.

214
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,760
However,

215
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,560
nothing happened.

216
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,840
But,

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,880
just now,

218
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
a moment ago,

219
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,800
the moment that I turned off my computer,

220
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,640
everything changed!

221
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
So you're saying that...

222
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,520
All of the side effects

223
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,000
of your mechanical heart,

224
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,640
the noise, the electric discharge,

225
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,560
and everything else

226
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,200
have been solved!

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,520
There are only a couple of issues left.

228
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
Give me some time

229
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,960
and I'll be able to fix everything.

230
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,160
From then on,

231
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,040
you can start

232
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,720
living

233
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,640
like a normal person again.

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,880
No way.

235
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Are you serious?

236
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,520
I swear to god

237
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
with my whole career,

238
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,520
my assets,

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,240
and my thesis,

240
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,120
this is true.

241
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,800
How long would that take?

242
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,480
Three months.

243
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,960
Maximally three months.

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm here.

245
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm here.

246
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,440
I just got home when you called me.

247
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
What's up?

248
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm coming in now.

249
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,040
No way, what a coincidence.

250
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,440
What if you mistook her for someone else

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,640
and everything just isn't true?

252
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,920
Today is Jiang Xiao Ning's birthday.

253
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,120
Ten years ago today,

254
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,800
we were both

255
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
in the car accident.

256
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,680
Are you sure

257
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,000
it was the same car accident?

258
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,760
Yes.

259
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,040
So you're saying

260
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,640
the girl you saved

261
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,920
ten years go...

262
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,840
is Jiang Xiao Ning.

263
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
It's such a small world.

264
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,720
I know, right?

265
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
I couldn't believe it either.

266
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,000
And you two just

267
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,520
ran into each other like this.

268
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Not just running into each other.

269
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
What else?

270
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Don't leave yet.

271
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,640
What else?

272
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,960
Go on.

273
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,760
I don't want to keep running away.

274
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,720
I…
-So you like her?

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I knew it.

276
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,200
Why didn't you tell her?

277
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Who would accept a boyfriend

278
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,240
with a mechanical heart

279
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,360
that can discharge electricity at any time?

280
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,840
How long do you

281
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,880
plan to wait?

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,280
Three months.

283
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,080
The doctor said that

284
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,440
he will fix

285
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,320
every single problem

286
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
that the mechanical heart has.

287
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,040
At that time,

288
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,240
I can live

289
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,680
just like a normal person.

290
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,440
Really?

291
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
You're saying

292
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,720
after three months,

293
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
I won't have to drive you,

294
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,480
help you drink,

295
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,040
or stare at my phone all day

296
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,800
worrying about your heart rate?

297
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,600
Yes.

298
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,840
And that I won't have to worry about

299
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,760
you fainting because the battery is running low.

300
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,520
And that I don't need to worry about

301
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,920
seeing your suicide note

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
your organ donation card,

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
or you just disappear suddenly?

304
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,520
You're right.

305
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,080
That's great!

306
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,320
This is so sudden.

307
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,880
I don't even know

308
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
how we should celebrate this.

309
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,520
Let's do this.

310
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,880
We're telling Jiang Xiao Ning

311
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,160
that you like her, now.

312
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,320
How can I do that now?

313
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
I should wait for

314
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
three more months.

315
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,800
Look at you, so patient.

316
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,640
If I were you,

317
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,960
I must be running towards her now.

318
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,720
Destiny decided that

319
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
you two will come back to each other.

320
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
This means

321
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,400
she is the one for you.

322
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,840
To be honest,

323
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,000
I felt different

324
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,840
when I

325
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,160
first saw her.

326
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,520
Ten years ago,

327
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,840
I had a new chance

328
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,360
for life.

329
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,800
And when the day

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
all problems of the mechanical heart are fixed

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,480
and can work perfectly

332
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,040
finally comes,

333
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,560
it will be

334
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,680
another chance for me to start  afresh.

335
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
I have never

336
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,640
looked forward to that day this much

337
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,040
like I am

338
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,040
right now.

339
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,760
The destiny of you two

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
is just magical.

341
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,480
Oh, right.

342
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,480
The car accident that you just mentioned

343
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
has reminded me of something.

344
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,360
Does it mean that

345
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,359
Jiang Xiao Ning's father

346
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,839
was the one involved in
the Dong Jiang corruption case?

347
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,079
Jiang Guang Da?

348
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
How did you know about this?

349
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,280
My dad worked for Dong Jiang too.

350
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,560
After the corruption case,

351
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,560
the whole company

352
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,040
was in a chaotic situation.

353
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,400
My dad quit

354
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,319
and started his own business.

355
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,319
He also adopted

356
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
his colleague's son.

357
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,359
Tang Xu.

358
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,880
Tang Xu and Jiang Xiao Ning

359
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,480
grew up together.

360
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,680
Your dad adopted Tang Xu.

361
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
Does that mean

362
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,880
the three of them knew each other?

363
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,280
Maybe.

364
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
The world is just so small.

365
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
I'll ask my dad if I get a chance.

366
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,040
Okay, ask your dad when you get a chance.

367
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Now,

368
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,760
do you want to go grab a drink?

369
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,640
Now?

370
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's wait till your heart is totally fixed.

371
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,440
I really want to drink now.

372
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,040
If you aren't there to watch me,

373
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll probably end up

374
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,320
like I did last time.

375
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay.

376
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,440
I'll get to decide how much you drink.

377
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,840
Sure.

378
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,180
♪Woke up feel like a superstar♪

379
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,900

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,640
Apologize.

573
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,720
I told you to let go, did you not hear me?

574
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,160
Apologize.

575
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,960
Let go!

576
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,520
Calm down, calm down.

577
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,240
Let's all calm down.

578
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,440
Apologize.

579
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,800
Jiang Xiao Ning, are you crazy?

580
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,360
What are you all doing?

581
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,840
-You pushed me?!
-Mr. Gu.

582
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,560
Mr. Gu.

583
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,800
Mr. Gu.

584
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,760
Qi Hong,

585
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,360
we've worked together

586
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,600
for so many years.

587
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
What's wrong with you today?

588
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,960
Why did you disclose

589
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,160
the confidential information of our employees?

590
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,040
If I knew earlier

591
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,160
that my HR manager

592
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
is someone like this,

593
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
should I

594
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,200
think this through

595
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,240
and see if

596
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,400
I can find a better fit?

597
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,560
Mr. Gu,

598
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,400
I made a mistake today.

599
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,240
This will be the last

600
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
and the only time.

601
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,120
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

602
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,240
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

603
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm not the one you should apologize to.

604
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,080
Apologize to Jiang Xiao Ning.

605
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm sorry, Xiao Ning.

606
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,680
I made a mistake today.

607
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,560
I'm sorry.

608
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,040
Alright, alright.

609
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,440
Don't be angry with me.

610
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,480
Xiao Ning,

611
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,360
I was just gossiping around.

612
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,520
You know

613
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,720
what kind of person I am.

614
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
Don't take it personally.

615
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,600
Mr. Gu,

616
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,440
what caused the

617
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,920
style change recently?

618
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,600
I'm talking about your clothes.

619
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,320
Did I change?

620
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,320
To be more accurate,

621
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,040
you changed back to what you were like before.

622
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,160
Before?

623
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,200
Don't tell me you are changing the style

624
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,320
of your architecture design as well.

625
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,200
Can't say for sure.

626
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
You really have changed a lot.

627
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,240
You got so mad in the meeting room

628
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,520
and now you're so relaxed and laughing.

629
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,640
You look like a different person.

630
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,160
Isn't this better?

631
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,080
Is there anything else?

632
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,600
No.

633
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,400
If so, I'll get back to my work.

634
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,200
Boss,

635
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,920
let me drive.

636
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,920
Don't worry,

637
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,840
I'm okay.

638
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,160
Promise I'll drive safely.

639
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,280
Get in the car.

640
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,580
(Parking lot)

641
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,400
(Tomorrow is the weekend.)

642
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,760
(Let me take you somewhere.)

643
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,680
(I'll pick you up at 10.)

644
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,960
(Sure, Boss.)

645
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,640
(A date tomorrow.)

646
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,640
(Sure.)

647
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,160
Yes, yes!

648
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,760
Charging.

649
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,560
I got this.

650
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,360
I got this tomorrow.

651
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,240
Let's go!

652
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,120
Let's go!

653
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,480
Boss,

654
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,280
did something happen recently?

655
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,080
Is there any good news?

656
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,800
Why do you say that?

657
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,640
Your vibe

658
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,880
got much more charismatic,

659
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,400
like way more!

660
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,960
Have you had breakfast yet?

661
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,920
Not yet.

662
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,080
I knew it.

663
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,280
I got you breakfast.

664
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,640
And I knew that

665
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,360
you would have something prepared for me.

666
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,600
Would you like to have some before we leave?

667
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,280
I'll eat later.

668
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,040
Let's go, I'm driving today as well.

669
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,760
Sure.

670
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,200
Where are we going?

671
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,760
You'll know when we get there.

672
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,640
Where are you heading, girl?

673
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
I can give you a ride.

674
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,880
You're late.

675
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,720
No,

676
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,560
I got here a while ago.

677
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,360
I was watching you from upstairs.

678
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,120
If you are late again,

679
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,080
don't come anymore.

680
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,240
I was stuck in traffic.

681
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,200
Don't be mad.

682
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,800
Where are we going?

683
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,920
Where do you want to go?

684
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,120
You asked me out

685
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,320
and now you want to say where we're going?

686
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Are you doing this or not?

687
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,400
I just want to know

688
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,400
if you have

689
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,680
a specific place in mind.

690
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,400
Of course,

691
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,960
my house.

692
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,520
Get in the car, let's go.

693
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,680
I'll take you to wherever I decide.

694
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,560
That sounds better.

695
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,600
She likes the dominating style.

696
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
Boss, Boss, Boss.

697
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
Is this a prank?

698
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,360
I can't believe you're taking me here

699
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,680
knowing that I'm so unlucky.

700
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,640
You said

701
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,480
you were absolutely horrible at this, didn't you?

702
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,560
You can catch

703
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
as many as you want today.

704
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,240
You remembered everything I said?

705
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,880
You're thinking too much.

706
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
You speak too much.

707
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,880
No one can remember all of them.

708
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
Stop trying, Boss.

709
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,800
That is mission impossible.

710
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,280
The exhibition will end by the end of this month.

711
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,320
Thank god we're here today.

712
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,240
I know.

713
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,480
I've always wanted to come.

714
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,880
I know that too.

715
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,160
How do you know?

716
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,080
You posted on both

717
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
Weibo and WeChat.

718
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
You did your homework.

719
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,960
Of course.

720
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,040
Are you trying to please me

721
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,160
by taking me here?

722
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
Not really.

723
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,920
I work in

724
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,200
an art-related field.

725
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,840
Me being here for appreciating aesthetics

726
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,760
should be completely normal.

727
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,280
Also,

728
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,760
I'm your boyfriend.

729
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
It's my job

730
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,120
to make my girlfriend happy.

731
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,840
I'm not your girlfriend.

732
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,840
Not again.

733
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
I thought we talked about this that day?

734
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,160
I said to give you a chance

735
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,480
to prove yourself.

736
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,160
I didn't say that

737
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
you're my boyfriend.

738
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,639
What?

739
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,280
Great.

740
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,719
I think so too.

741
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,719
Would you like to try that?

742
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,199
That one.

743
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,600
-Try this.
-This one?

744
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,320
Move to the right a little bit.

745
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,560
Forward, forward, forward.

746
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,880
Right, right.

747
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,880
Too much, too much.

748
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,520
Go lighter.

749
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
To the right.

750
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Move it little by little.

751
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,760
I told you to go right a little bit.

752
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,720
It's all your fault.

753
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,040
I couldn't focus.

754
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,040
My fault?

755
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,040
No way.

756
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,920
How can I blame my boss?

757
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,160
Talk.

758
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,080
You told me to shut up.

759
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,640
Look at you.

760
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,120
I'm just sad.

761
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,360
Don't try to act cute.

762
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,920
May I talk?

763
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,760
Yes.

764
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Yesterday, you agreed that...

765
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,240
You could say anything except for that.

766
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,800
Then I'll stop talking again.

767
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Why didn't I realize

768
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,280
you are this compliant?

769
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,400
I was trying to irritate you.

770
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
Why?

771
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,560
I like you but you always ignored me.

772
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,160
So I just wanted

773
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,440
to get your attention.

774
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,640
Take a picture for me.

775
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,040
Come here.

776
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,200
Smile.

777
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,320
Let me help.

778
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,600
It's okay, Boss.

779
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,480
It's okay.

780
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,560
Why don't you try that one?

781
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,520
That one is easier.

782
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,540
(It will all be good luck
after we get through those bad days)

783
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,280
Boss,

784
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,800
maybe I should just give up.

785
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,600
Give it a try.

786
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,640
Come on.

787
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,120
Give it another try.

788
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,800
It's just a picture.

789
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,440
Am I

790
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,560
your boyfriend now?

791
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,240
No.

792
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,800
Then what am I now?

793
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,880
Candidate.

794
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,120
How can I pass the test?

795
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,520
It depends on your performance.

796
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,200
How should I perform to pass?

797
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
I don't know.

798
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,320
There has to be a standard.

799
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,040
My standard is...

800
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,160
There is none.

801
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,000
Just following my feelings.

802
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,720
What do you mean?

803
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,840
You don't have to if you don't want to.

804
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,040
Don't want to? Impossible.

805
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,640
Whatever my baby says.

806
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,960
Don't call me baby.

807
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
Whatever my darling says.

808
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,800
Not darling either.

809
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,480
My queen.

810
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,880
Whatever you say.

811
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,720
Okay.

812
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,880
Drive me home now.

813
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,400
Of course!

814
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,800
Jiang Xiao Ning.

815
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,080
Chen Chen.

816
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,600
Why are you here?

817
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,680
If I say

818
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,720
this is because

819
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,360
I can connect with you

820
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,800
and came by following your vibes,

821
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,440
would you believe me?

822
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,880
No.

823
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,400
Is this your friend?

824
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,080
This is Chen Chen.

825
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,040
You've met each other

826
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,080
at the convenience store.

827
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,360
We studied the same major in university.

828
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,040
I remember now.

829
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,160
Jiang Xiao Ning.

830
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,400
Boyfriend?

831
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,600
No, this is my boss.

832
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,160
Mr. Gu.

833
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,000
Boss.

834
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,560
Her boss.

835
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,920
Hello.

836
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,680
Try again.

837
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,680
Xiao Ning,

838
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,320
are you still studying architectural design?

839
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,200
I've been studying by myself.

840
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,200
I've registered for this class.

841
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,000
It's in the evenings.

842
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,960
Shall we be study buddies?

843
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,040
Let me think about it.

844
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,760
A little to the right.

845
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,600
It's all your fault!

846
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,600
You kept talking to me.

847
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,920
Let me do this.

848
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,720
I can't even watch.

849
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,280
Watch carefully.

850
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,000
What happened?

851
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,040
The power is out.

852
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,240
I almost got it.

853
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,920
I was this close.

854
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,820

after we get through those bad days)
