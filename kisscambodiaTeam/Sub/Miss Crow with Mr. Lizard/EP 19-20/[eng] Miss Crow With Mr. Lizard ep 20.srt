21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
This uninvited guest

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,400
comes like a tornado.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,400
Don't talk about him.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,400
How old is he?

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,440
What are you insinuating?

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
Nothing.

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,880
How does he look like?

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
I bet he has quite the look
since it bothers you so much.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
You may leave now.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't keep trying

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
to chase me away.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,240
With such a nice atmosphere,

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
if I were you,

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
I would have confessed.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,440
And you have to wait
for another three months?

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
Three months later,

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
there's no telling whose girlfriend

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
Jiang Xiao Ning will be.

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,400
How did it go for you today?

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
Well, things went well

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
and were under control, of course.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,280
So, Zhao Yan

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
is still not your girlfriend,

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,440
right?

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,600
Want to grab a drink?

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,080
(Mr. Huang: The address is 189, Guang'an Hutong.)

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,360
Dude.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,640
Do you know me?

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,480
Of course.

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
You don't look familiar to me.

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,279
What is it?

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Anything I can do for you?

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
You don't remember me?

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,640
I don't think

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
we have met.

56
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,200
Ten years ago,

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,040
I asked for your favor.

58
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
But you just disappeared.

59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,680
Do you mean Chen Yun?

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,960
That's my brother.

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,200
He's dead long ago.

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Your brother?

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,640
Forget it then.

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Hold on.

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,880
I can do

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
whatever Chen Yun could.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,960
Pay me

68
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,280
and I'll do the job for you.

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
Really?

70
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,760
Director Xu.

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,280
He is here.

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,280
Director Xu.

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,280
I've been watching Chen Ao lately

74
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,440
and I discovered something.

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Go on.

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Someone came to see him today.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,120
Who was it?

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Gu Chuan.

79
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,640
How could you go and see him yourself?

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,880
It's dangerous.

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
I was looking for an opportunity

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,560
to get near him

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,240
and see

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,280
if I could worm something out of him.

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
It's too much of a coincidence.

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,520
He actually has a twin brother.

87
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,000
His brother hit me with a car

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,760
and Jiang Xiao Ning's family

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,160
and he assaulted you not long ago.

90
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
Don't you think

91
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,400
there could be

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,480
a link?

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
How would I know?

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
Which is why

95
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
I asked for his number

96
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
on the pretext of needing his help

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
to see

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,440
if I could get anything from him.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,880
I'll go to meet him with you.

100
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Call him

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,440
and set a date.

102
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,880
All right.

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,000
(Hi.)

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
(The number you have dialed)

105
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,840
(is busy.)

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,560
No answer?

107
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
(Please try again later.)

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,720
Try again.

109
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
How is it?

110
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
Have you prepared the money?

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,600
Looks like he's avoiding you.

112
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,900
(Gu Chuan, missed calls)

113
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,640
Assistant Liu.

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,440
Going somewhere?

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,520
Cheng Ran.

116
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,480
Anything?

117
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,880
Do you know this guy?

118
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,039
Yes.

119
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Why?

120
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,600
Why did he come to see you?

121
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,880
Our company's new project is launching.

122
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
He was a nail house owner there.

123
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,560
Not only did he refuse to vacate his home,

124
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
he even brought people to cause a ruckus.

125
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,240
We couldn't reach an agreement

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,440
even after I had a discussion
with him here in the office.

127
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,000
He insisted on meeting Director Xu.

128
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,960
Later on, our company

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
secretly gave him more compensation.

130
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,760
Only then, he moved out.

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I think this photo

132
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
was taken when he came to get the money.

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,560
That explains why

134
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,760
he came after me.

135
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,200
He went to see you?

136
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,480
Are you all right?

137
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm fine.

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
I thought he was just saying it.

139
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,040
I didn't expect he would do it for real.

140
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
That's outrageous.

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
But worry not.

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,960
Since he has taken our money,

143
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,280
I bet he won't be coming here anymore.

144
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,640
Okay, I get it now.

145
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,440
Later.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Director Xu.

147
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
Cheng Ran came asking about it

148
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
and I've replied to him as you told.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Also,

150
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,040
Chen Ao has been taken care of.

151
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,760
He won't show up ever again.

152
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,480
Mr. Gu.

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,080
Is there anything else?

154
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,840
Nothing, you can get off work now.

155
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,720
Okay.

156
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,680
Boss.

157
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,400
May I take a day off?

158
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,840
I can't send you home.

159
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Why?

160
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,640
I have a date with my friends.

161
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
They're waiting for me.

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,440
Sure, go ahead then.

163
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
Thank you, Boss.

164
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,520
I'll send you home then.

165
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,040
It's fine.

166
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
I have a design to work on.

167
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,640
You may go now.

168
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,960
All right then.

169
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Don't stay too late.

170
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,200
Okay.

171
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Over here!

172
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,560
Would you like something to eat?

173
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,760
I have no appetite.

174
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Don't be upset.

175
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,800
If this goes on,

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,160
I'll be in a bad mood too.

177
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,720
It's not that.

178
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,920
Look.

179
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,880
Seriously?

180
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,040
It would take days

181
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,280
to tell you the whole story.

182
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
I'll tell you everything later.

183
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,280
How about this?

184
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,400
Come over.

185
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,400
What do you think?

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,880
That works.

187
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,120
You sure you don't want to eat?

188
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,560
No, I have no appetite.

189
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,760
Let's talk while we walk.

190
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,240
All right.

191
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Coming.

192
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,960
Hello.

193
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,480
A new friend.

194
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,920
Let me do the introduction.

195
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,640
Chen Chen.

196
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
This is my best friend.

197
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,560
Sister Yan Yan.

198
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,320
Hi, Sister Yan Yan.

199
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
How could you? Jiang Xiao Ning.

200
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,040
You never told me

201
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,000
you know such a handsome guy.

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,280
And you called me your best friend?

203
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
She didn't tell me either

204
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
about her pretty girlfriend.

205
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,240
Slick.

206
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,040
Of course.

207
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,640
But you're not really

208
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,480
my type.

209
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,840
Do you know whose house you are in?

210
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Jiang Xiao Ning.

211
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,440
Before you brought him here,

212
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,480
didn't you tell him
how my temper is like?

213
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,200
You come to my place...

214
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,800
All right now.

215
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,360
Stop fighting.

216
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,240
I've bought a lot of food

217
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,160
and some self-heating hotpots too.

218
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm starving. Let's eat, all right?

219
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,800
All right then.

220
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,680
Get me one.

221
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
I've been craving fish with Sichuan pickles.

222
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,840
It drives me crazy.

223
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
Here, this is for you.

224
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,019
(Self-heating hot pot)

225
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,480
I don't get you.

226
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
Your family can do more than support you

227
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,960
but you insist on depending on your own.

228
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,800
Why?

229
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,680
I'm not a three-year-old.

230
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,480
Why do they

231
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,640
interfere with my life?

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
In the eyes of parents,

233
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,280
their children never grow up.

234
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm really envious of you.

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
If my parents were still alive,

236
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,480
I would let them

237
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,560
even if they kept doing that.

238
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,080
Let's drink.

239
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,640
Here.

240
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,760
What's with the sigh?

241
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,720
Let's go racing when we have time.

242
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,720
If this was the only thing,

243
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,560
I wouldn't be so depressed.

244
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Look.

245
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,320
Don't get all emotional here.

246
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,440
I hate guys who cry.

247
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,360
Leave if you're going to cry.

248
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
Don't. Ignore her.

249
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Tell me.

250
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,440
What is it?

251
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
Xiao Ning, I got my heart broken.

252
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
I was dumped.

253
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,760
I thought it was something serious.

254
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,000
Out with the old,

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,640
in with the new.

256
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,240
As simple as that.

257
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,000
That's right.

258
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Yan Yan knows many people.

259
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,480
All kinds of physiques.

260
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,080
Take your pick.

261
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,320
You two girls have quite a special way

262
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,320
to cheer people up.

263
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Sister Yan Yan.

264
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,440
I want the type of girls

265
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
with big eyes, double eyelids,

266
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,400
and nice body shape.

267
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,680
That's picky.

268
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,960
But I think...

269
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
if I were you,

270
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
I would take action

271
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,840
and show them my determination.

272
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,240
You're right.

273
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,000
Prove myself with my actions.

274
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,600
You have to help me then.

275
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,360
How?

276
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,160
What is it?

277
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,360
Let's take a picture.

278
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,880
What does this have anything
to do with determination?

279
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,280
I'll post it on Moments.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
That's right.

281
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,000
Post it on Moments.

282
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,480
This would give the impression

283
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
that I'm doing just fine

284
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,160
as if I wasn't hurt at all.

285
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,640
I think that's a good idea.

286
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,520
Sure it is.

287
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,320
Come on.

288
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,360
Three, two, one.

289
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,980
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
(A small gathering of three. How delightful.)

290
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,160
Chuan.

291
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,400
Have you seen the post on Moments?

292
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,000
What post?

293
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,880
This one.

294
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,440
Is this the pretty boy

295
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,520
that you talked about?

296
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,360
A heart hand gesture really? Look.

297
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,720
This is nothing.

298
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,720
It's just a normal

299
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
friend gathering.

300
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,920
We, too, have had

301
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,160
many gatherings with them.

302
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
But I've never seen them

303
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
posting it on Moments.

304
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,200
At times like this,

305
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,360
you can't remain so calm.

306
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,520
You just told me

307
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,880
that you like Jiang Xiao Ning.

308
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,600
This is the first time

309
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,760
you ever like someone.

310
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,360
You can't just sit here and do nothing.

311
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,720
No.

312
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,480
I haven't confessed to her.

313
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,000
Jiang Xiao Ning and I

314
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,120
are simply

315
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,520
boss and employee.

316
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,560
Still trying to act tough?

317
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,600
But

318
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,800
as a future designer,

319
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,480
she's too shallow.

320
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,480
You're right.

321
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
She is.

322
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,360
He has the look

323
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,000
but not that good looking.

324
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,040
Compared

325
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,720
to you and me,

326
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,240
he's still far from it.

327
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
Bad aesthetic judgments.

328
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,960
Poor taste.

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,560
That's right.

330
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,680
Look at his hairstyle.

331
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,720
Unbelievable.

332
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
The hair quality is just average.

333
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,880
Not only that,

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
they made the heart hand gesture.

335
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,160
It's fine if he did it
with Jiang Xiao Ning.

336
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,520
Why did he drag Yan Yan along?

337
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,800
Why is it fine to do it

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,599
with Jiang Xiao Ning

339
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,119
but shouldn't get Zhao Yan involved?

340
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,800
Neither is acceptable.

341
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,640
We have to win this round.

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,760
How about...

343
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,319
you confess

344
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,480
to Jiang Xiao Ning tomorrow?

345
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,800
No way.

346
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
What if Dr. Peer
couldn't come up with a solution

347
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,160
three months later?

348
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,800
What do I do then?

349
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,760
If Jiang Xiao Ning

350
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,920
and I are together,

351
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,200
and I end up like a waste of space.

352
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,200
It's bad for her.

353
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
That's a really lame excuse.

354
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
Just be honest.

355
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,160
Are you afraid

356
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,040
of being rejected by Jiang Xiao Ning

357
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,840
and that it's going to put you on the spot?

358
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,720
Look.

359
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
If you keep this going,

360
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,120
Jiang Xiao Ning

361
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,600
is going to be with someone else.

362
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,720
If a wimpy kid got her before you did,

363
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,120
that would be a real shame.

364
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
You come up with a way

365
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,040
to get this man out of the picture quickly.

366
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,880
Don't let him

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,760
revolve around Jiang Xiao Ning

368
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,440
and give him the opportunity

369
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,600
to become a part
of Yan Yan's social circle.

370
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,000
No matter what,

371
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,080
in these three months,

372
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
you can't let Jiang Xiao Ning

373
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,000
be with this guy.

374
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,240
You have to be with her

375
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,040
at all times

376
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,080
and protect her.

377
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,840
Wait.

378
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,360
Are you being concerned about me

379
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,800
or are you worried about Zhao Yan?

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,760
That's not the point.

381
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,080
The point is that

382
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,560
we can't just sit back and do nothing.

383
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,000
We have to take the lead
and get to the bottom of things.

384
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,560
Are you coming or not?

385
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,400
Are you sure this is the place?

386
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,120
Yes.

387
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,560
Why isn't he here yet?

388
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,760
You're right.

389
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,680
That's him.

390
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,320
Him?

391
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
Can he do it?

392
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,160
It'll be fine.

393
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,200
Hurry.

394
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,360
Cover me.

395
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,520
Hit the dragon.

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,840
Hurry.

397
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,800
You two go on.

398
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,600
Coming!

399
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,087
(Food Delivery)

400
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,680
Hi.

401
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,040
Are you Miss Zhao,

402
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,680
the Super Invincible Conquering Palms?

403
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,240
Here's your delivery.

404
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,040
Did you guys order a takeaway?

405
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,240
No.

406
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Thank you.

407
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,960
A hangover soup?

408
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,560
Sir.

409
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,320
A moment, please.

410
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,360
What is it, sir?

411
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,800
Who accepted

412
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,800
the food delivery just now?

413
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
Are you a cop?

414
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,320
No.

415
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,840
If that's the case,

416
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,760
I can't disclose
the customer's personal information.

417
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm a very professional

418
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,520
food delivery man.

419
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,320
What if I'm to tell you

420
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
that I am the one who placed the order

421
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,160
and that I can give you a bad rating?

422
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,040
What? Is this a threat?

423
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,120
How about this?

424
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,680
I won't ask you anything

425
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,840
and you don't have to answer me.

426
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,800
Just a nod or a headshake will do.

427
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,680
Was it a girl

428
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,120
who signed the receipt for the food?

429
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,600
Her last name is Zhao.

430
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
She's about

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,800
this tall.

432
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,280
She's not pretty

433
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,720
and has buck teeth, crossed eyes,
and big nostrils.

434
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,120
Says who?

435
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,000
She's gorgeous.

436
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,160
There are another girl

437
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,080
and a guy in the house, right?

438
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,920
I can't tell you that. No comment.

439
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,320
Fine.

440
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
You're quite tight-lipped.

441
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,560
How about this?

442
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,720
Let's talk.

443
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,800
I'll place a few more orders.

444
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,080
Make it ten.

445
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,240
I can tell you don't usually
order online food delivery.

446
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,280
What do you mean?

447
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,160
The orders are randomly assigned.

448
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,120
I'll make a remark

449
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
to have you deliver the food.
How about that?

450
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,160
That will do.

451
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
The customer is king.

452
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,560
King, huh?

453
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,440
If that's the case,

454
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
can I make a few more requirements?

455
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm a...

456
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,640
Don't worry.

457
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,480
I know

458
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,160
you're a very professional
food delivery man.

459
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
I won't give you a hard time.

460
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,680
Coming.

461
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,840
Didn't you just leave?

462
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,760
Why are you here again?

463
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,320
May I know

464
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,200
if this is Miss Jiang's house,

465
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,920
the gentlest and cutest pretty girl
in the universe?

466
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,720
She's in bed already.

467
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,040
I didn't order any food delivery.

468
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm not sure about that.

469
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
The address is correct.

470
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,720
If she's asleep, you can accept these for her.

471
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,080
Well, I'll accept them on her behalf then.

472
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,520
They're pretty heavy.

473
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,320
You're a girl.

474
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,120
You can't handle them.

475
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
Why don't you ask

476
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,000
your boyfriend

477
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,880
or husband

478
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,640
to get them?

479
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
I am a single young woman.

480
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,920
I have no boyfriend.

481
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,600
Let alone a husband.

482
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,840
Shall I bring them in for you?

483
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,800
Thank you.

484
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,800
Where should I put them?

485
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
In the house.

486
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,600
Sir.

487
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
If he keeps delaying,

488
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,680
all the following orders will be canceled.

489
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,440
Ignore him.

490
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,160
As for me,

491
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,880
I'll place

492
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
another 100 orders.

493
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Well, 100 is a little exaggerating.

494
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm a professional

495
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,160
food delivery man.

496
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,880
Fifty will do.

497
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,960
Fifty, huh?

498
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,640
All right.

499
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,160
Fifty it is. Whatever makes you happy.

500
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,840
I'm going up for a bit.

501
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
Wait here for me.

502
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,600
Boss?

503
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,800
Why are you here?

504
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,560
I'm here to look for Xu Cheng Ran.

505
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
He didn't answer my calls.

506
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,840
Is he here?

507
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,320
Chuan, help me! Chuan.

508
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,800
Chuan!

509
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
Boss, don't get us wrong.

510
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,120
I had a drink earlier

511
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,000
and slept for a while.

512
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,320
When I woke up,

513
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,360
I saw Director Xu came to find Sister Yan Yan

514
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,280
dressed up as a food delivery man.

515
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,200
And he said he was playing

516
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,720
a cosplay game.

517
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
A game?

518
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,120
Mr. Gu.

519
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,040
Would you like to join us?

520
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,800
I'll pass.

521
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,000
This game

522
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,560
doesn't look like my type.

523
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
I still have plenty of

524
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,920
design drafts to revise.

525
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,680
Jiang Xiao Ning.

526
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,480
Are you going home?

527
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,280
I can give you a ride.

528
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,160
It's fine, Boss.

529
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm crashing here tonight.

530
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,640
All right then. Well, I...

531
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
I'll leave you be. Later.

532
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,240
Chuan!

533
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,600
Wait for me!

534
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,400
Perfect.

535
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,480
Delightful.

536
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,560
Xiao Ning.

537
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,360
Let's go to bed.

538
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,080
Why did those two

539
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,880
seem so weird?

540
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
Gu Chuan, what a loyal friend you are.

541
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,120
If I hadn't escaped,

542
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,800
would you have

543
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,600
left me there?

544
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,680
Was I that bad?

545
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,680
Yes!

546
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,520
Your look, your body,

547
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,680
and your words have betrayed you!

548
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,320
You were going to leave me there.

549
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,320
How is that possible? You're overthinking it.

550
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,360
Thank you, brother.

551
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
You're my real brother.

552
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,240
Unlike some people.

553
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
I'll place another 100 orders
for you tomorrow.

554
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,800
Brother, that's so generous of you.

555
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm a professional

556
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,400
food delivery man.

557
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,760
Feel free to ask me for anything.

558
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,000
Remember, 100 orders.

559
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,000
Actually, you can't blame me.

560
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,200
You offered

561
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,560
to deliver the food.

562
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,640
So?

563
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,160
Did you see anyone else?

564
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,760
Why should I tell you?

565
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,160
I risked my life going up there

566
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,000
yet you didn't care about me.

567
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,960
Ungrateful!

568
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,240
Actually, I already knew.

569
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,480
After you left,

570
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,240
that guy

571
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,160
left from the side entrance.

572
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,080
So nothing could possibly

573
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,360
happen up there.

574
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,720
Not possible?

575
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
That's because I was smart enough to escape.

576
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,320
If not, I would be screwed.

577
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
That's perfect, isn't it?

578
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,680
You could spend more time

579
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,960
with Zhao Yan.

580
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,960
You're right.

581
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,920
Why don't you send me up again?

582
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,960
Sure.

583
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,280
Hell no.

584
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,880
Drive.

585
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
Boss.

586
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,720
I would like to take a day off.

587
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,600
Having a meal with your friend again?

588
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,520
Yesterday was an exception.

589
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,680
I hope you don't mind.

590
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Not at all.

591
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,400
Tell me.

592
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,520
Why do you need a day off?

593
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,640
The school-leaving examination is coming soon.

594
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,600
If I can't get the credits required

595
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,520
in time,

596
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,160
I won't get the graduation certificate

597
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
and the degree.

598
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,600
So I've registered for

599
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
an evening cram school

600
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
to make some progress in a short time.

601
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,400
I may not be able to take you home

602
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,240
on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights.

603
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,160
Is that all right?

604
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Of course.

605
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,600
But are there any buses available

606
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,240
so late at night after class?

607
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,480
It's fine.

608
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,000
After class, if it's too late,

609
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,200
I can ask Chen Chen to send me home.

610
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,760
If there's nothing else, I'll get back to my work.

611
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,360
Hold on.

612
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Are there any spots left

613
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,520
in the cram class?

614
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,880
I don't know.

615
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,680
Why?

616
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,600
I'm thinking

617
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,640
to attend the class

618
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,360
or something.

619
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,240
Are you kidding me?

620
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,520
You're more than qualified to be a lecturer there.

621
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,640
I've worked for so long.

622
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,240
It's inevitable for my designs
to be too commercial.

623
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,800
It's time to be back in class

624
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,840
to feel the vibe again.

625
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,200
I can help you evaluate

626
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,280
if the cram school

627
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,680
is up to standard.

628
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,280
What's the matter?

629
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,240
No... Nothing.

630
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,520
Nothing?

631
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,720
It's settled then.

632
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,560
Get back to work.

633
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,720
Under normal circumstances,

634
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,240
a residential building

635
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,200
can be divided into many floors.

636
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,320
However, the architectural standard,

637
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,520
the coverage, and the layout

638
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,800
of each floor

639
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,520
are completely different.

640
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,520
Well, what is a building
with three floors or less called?

641
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,040
It's called a low-rise residential building.

642
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,080
Four to six floors...

643
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
(Her boss is here.)

644
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,120
multi-story residential building.

645
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,440
Seven to nine floors,

646
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,560
mid-rise residential building.

647
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,800
As for high-rise buildings,

648
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,120
the ones with ten or more than ten floors

649
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,440
are called high-rise residential buildings.

650
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,760
To be specific,

651
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,800
(Dinner tonight?)
low-rise residential buildings

652
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,400
refer to the ones of ten meters

653
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,440
or less in height,

654
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,720
They usually have

655
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,320
one to three floors,

656
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,640
such as bungalows and villas.

657
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Generally, low-rise residential buildings

658
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,240
feature simple building structure,

659
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
a short construction period,

660
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,120
and low construction cost.

661
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,200
They give people a sense of familiarity
and tranquility.

662
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,800
They stand right on land
and not many floors are built upon it.

663
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,400
They offer better coziness, convenience,
and spatial scale

664
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,320
than those of high-rise buildings.

665
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
Therefore, people love to have them

666
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
as a residence.

667
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,120
However, low-rise residences occupy a lot of lands

668
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
and the land utilization rate is low.

669
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,520
In cities,

670
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,120
the land is extremely expensive.

671
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,560
which makes it difficult
to develop this type of residence extensively.

672
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,000
(I don't believe you can stop me.)

673
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,120
Generally,

674
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,920
people call buildings

675
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
with eight to twelve or thirteen floors

676
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
as small high-rise buildings.

677
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,040
Small high-rise residential buildings

678
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,040
generally adopt
the reinforced concrete structure

679
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,360
with elevators.

680
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,320
There are multiple stories in a small high-rise.

681
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
It gives people a sense of familiarity
and tranquility.

682
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,440
The house type is preferable

683
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,080
with a higher building efficiency ratio.

684
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,720
It also boasts high resilience

685
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,520
and high durability

686
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,080
as the ordinary high-rise structure.

687
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,940
(You Si Design School)

688
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,520
Both of the two young men.

689
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,280
What are you doing?

690
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,400
Stand up.

691
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,800
Get out if you don't want to attend this class.

692
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,360
Don't disrupt the order

693
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
of the classroom.

694
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,320
Those who weren't listening

695
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,320
should be the ones to leave.

696
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,880
So you were listening then?

697
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,240
Well, tell me then.

698
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,640
What is spatial sequence?

699
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,640
The latecomer should answer first.

700
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,840
OK, you tell us.

701
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,480
About that.

702
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,040
Spatial sequence...

703
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,360
It's actually very simple.

704
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,720
It's...

705
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,120
Well...

706
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,920
In this space...

707
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,040
I...

708
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,040
Spatial sequence.

709
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,120
A construction

710
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
is a tridimensional entity.

711
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,680
People can't see all of it

712
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
at a glance.

713
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,320
Therefore, in the process

714
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:51,128
of continuously moving

715
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,160
from one place

716
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,560
to another,

717
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,560
people can see its parts

718
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,960
little by little

719
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,800
and form

720
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,840
an overall impression.

721
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,000
That's the meaning of spatial sequence
in architecture.

722
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,320
Did you see that?

723
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,760
It's indeed very simple.

724
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,920
Not bad.

725
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,040
Tell us

726
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,920
what the elements of green buildings are.

727
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,200
There are many elements

728
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,160
of green buildings,

729
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,600
like source economy,

730
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,720
lower cost,

731
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,080
whole-life design,

732
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,000
people-oriented design,

733
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,240
design flexibility,

734
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,880
unity of traditional

735
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,760
and modern architecture,

736
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,800
unity of architectural theory

737
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,760
and environmental science.

738
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,200
Not bad.

739
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,000
You may sit down.

740
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,920
Thank you, sir.

741
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,840
Unfortunately,

742
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,040
you need to leave the classroom.

743
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,080
Let's not let them

744
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,200
interrupt the lesson.

745
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,920
So he's Gu Chuan?

746
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,480
That's right.

747
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,360
He is the Gu Chuan

748
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,160
who won the Jin An Award.

749
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,120
He's so handsome.

750
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,640
Let's move on to detached houses.

751
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,720
So handsome.

752
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,160
Pay attention.

753
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,720
Where were we?

754
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,000
A detached house

755
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,560
is a single residential building
for one family only.

756
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,320
Feeling hungry already?

757
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,520
It was fun going to class with you.

758
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,480
I had fun.

759
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,880
You left the lecturer dumbfounded.

760
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,520
Jiang Xiao Ning.

761
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,600
Why are you still here?

762
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,520
Since I have nothing to do,

763
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,520
I might as well wait for you
to finish the class.

764
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,720
Wanna grab something to eat?

765
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,760
Jiang Xiao Ning.

766
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
Buy me a bottle of water.

767
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,920
Sure.

768
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,520
Look at you.

769
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
Instead of focusing in class,

770
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,560
why do you keep pestering Jiang Xiao Ning?

771
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,720
I think

772
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,320
something charming about her.

773
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,040
It makes you feel better

774
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,000
as soon as you see her.

775
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
If I can work

776
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,520
with her every day,

777
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't mind working for free.

778
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,160
You won't get the chance.

779
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,960
Why?

780
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,360
Do you like her?

781
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,360
It's none of your business.

782
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,760
Well...

783
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
if you don't like

784
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,760
Jiang Xiao Ning

785
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,640
and this goes on,

786
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
she might not be yours.

787
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
If not mine,

788
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,760
whose will she be?

789
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360
Mine, perhaps.

790
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,280
Where does your confidence come from?

791
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
Myself.

792
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,440
I know Jiang Xiao Ning

793
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,840
better than you do.

794
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,400
Boss, here's the water your want.

795
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,760
Okay.

796
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,680
Come on. I'll send you home.

797
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:27,960
Let's go.

798
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,640
Drive safely.

799
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,160
Study local culture

800
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,280
and bring modern art and historical traces...

801
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
If you don't like

802
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,640
Jiang Xiao Ning,

803
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,600
she might not be yours.

804
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,960
If not mine,

805
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,520
whose will she be?

806
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,080
Mine, perhaps.

807
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,280
I know Jiang Xiao Ning

808
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
better than you do.

809
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,200
So...

810
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,880
this is my rough idea.

811
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,240
What do you think?

812
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,920
Mr. Gu?

813
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,120
Mr. Gu?

814
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,920
Go on, please.

815
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,880
I... I'm finished.

816
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,840
Shall I repeat it?

817
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,920
It's fine.

818
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,360
You may go now.

819
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll come to you later.

820
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,680
Okay.

821
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,720
Brother Dong.

822
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,640
Boss.

823
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,480
Are you going to cram school today?

824
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,240
Yes.

825
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,880
Until before the exam.

826
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,160
I'll send you.

827
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,600
It's fine.

828
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,960
There are a lot of projects lately.

829
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,560
I'll just go there by bus.

830
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,400
It's too slow.

831
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,520
I'll send you.

832
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,680
End of discussion.

833
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,840
You may go now.

834
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,680
Well, thank you, Boss.

835
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,800
I've asked my lecturer.

836
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
He said you can't join the class.

837
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,080
It was fine last time.

838
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,159
Look who's talking.

839
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
The lecturer said you came to show off.

840
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,800
All right then.

841
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,480
Boss.

842
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,960
Are you going to drive back
by yourself?

843
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,000
Shall I call you a designated driver?

844
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,280
It's fine.

845
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,120
I'll take a walk nearby.

846
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,199
After that,

847
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,159
I'll drive back

848
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:45,880
on my own.

849
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,120
Can you?

850
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800
Why don't you wait
until my class is over

851
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,719
and I'll send you home?

852
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,960
It's all right.

853
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,040
Go to class now

854
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,120
or you'll be late.

855
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,199
Well, I'll get going then.

856
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,080
The load-bearing structure

857
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,480
is very easy to remember.

858
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,680
Three types.

859
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,120
Two, thirteen.

860
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,040
Jiang Xiao Ning.

861
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,240
Your boss really cares about you.

862
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,440
It's the load-bearing wall.

863
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,360
My boss always cares about me

864
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,240
and he's been very supportive of

865
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,000
me finishing my studies.

866
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,920
The load-bearing structure

867
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,120
is divided into 13 categories.

868
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,280
Could your boss

869
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,200
be in love with you?

870
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,960
I hope so.

871
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,880
Take a look in detail.

872
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,840
Do you like him?

873
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,800
I confessed to him before.

874
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,720
Then? What happened?

875
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,560
I guess he rejected me.

876
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I don't stand a chance.

877
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,680
That's not for sure.

878
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,920
Before I came to class,

879
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
I saw him standing at the door.

880
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Do you need my help?

881
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,240
Stop it.

882
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,360
Don't upset my boss.

883
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,360
Even if he rejected me,

884
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,120
I think we are good now.

885
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,800
Give it a try.

886
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,680
Just try it out.

887
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,720
Pay attention.

888
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,360
Don't distract me.

889
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,880
Have you learned

890
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,640
the things taught in class today?

891
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,800
Have you?

892
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
Of course.

893
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,880
Have you?

894
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,720
Tell me

895
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,680
what you have learned today.

896
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,880
Let's have supper later.

897
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,880
No, thanks.

898
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,920
Boss.

899
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,640
You haven't left.

900
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,800
I just came back from a walk.

901
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,280
You're really something, Boss.

902
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,920
You could even take a walk for two hours.

903
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,000
Good for you!

904
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,360
I'll drive you home, okay?

905
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,440
Since your boss is here,

906
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,400
shall we

907
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,760
go for a late-night snack together?

908
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,720
I'm not hungry.

909
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,720
No?

910
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,240
What a coincidence.

911
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
Xiao Ning said she was hungry

912
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,360
and we were planning to have hotpot.

913
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,040
Well.

914
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,240
You may leave first.

915
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,560
I said...

916
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,800
Let's have hotpot.

917
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,440
Jiang Xiao Ning.

918
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,200
Yes!

919
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,280
Drive.

920
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,160
I feel like having it now.

921
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,360
I'll lead the way. Follow me.

922
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,480
Jiang Xiao Ning.

923
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,440
What would you like to eat?

924
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,960
My boss can only

925
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,880
take food that is less oily,
less salty, and not spicy.

926
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
He's so picky.

927
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,720
I'm not picky.

928
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,400
It depends on my mood.

929
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,640
So you can eat anything?

930
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,560
No, he can't.

931
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,640
I can.

932
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,040
Boss.

933
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,160
You can't take this.

934
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,480
I'll order porridge for you.

935
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,600
It's fine.

936
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Give me a glass of water.

937
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
How about beer?

938
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,000
I need to drive Jiang Xiao Ning home.

939
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,160
All right, then.

940
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,920
Jiang Xiao Ning.

941
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,720
Get a big jug of water

942
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,760
and make sure it's cold.

943
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,680
Go.

944
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:25,960
Go on.

945
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,600
Pleasant to the eye.

946
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,120
Stop looking.

947
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,160
Looking at what?

948
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,960
Nothing.

949
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,960
Do you like her?

950
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,040
It's none of your business.

951
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,080
It is.

952
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,160
You can't.

953
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,280
Do you dare to?

954
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,640
It's boiling.

955
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,280
Here comes the water.

956
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,480
All right, you two.

957
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,360
It's not spicy.

958
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,520
Feels great!

959
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,680
Excuse me.

960
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,960
I'm going to the gents.

961
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,280
Afraid?

962
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,080
Who's afraid?

963
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,040
The oil got on my hands.
I'm going to wash it off.

964
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,280
I'm squeamish.

965
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,680
Give me water.

966
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,200
Water.

967
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Serves you right.

968
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,520
Are you out of your mind?

969
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,800
If anything happens to him,

970
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,040
I'm going to kill you.

971
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,040
Jiang Xiao Ning,

972
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
I give it all out for you.

973
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,760
Why did the power go out?

974
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,440
Waiter!

975
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,560
The power went out!

976
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,000
Waiter!

977
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,480
Boss!

978
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,360
How are we going to eat?

979
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,760
(Don't worry.)

980
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,080
(I'm fine, really.)

981
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,320
(Boss.)

982
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,720
(It was my fault.)

983
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,840
(I shouldn't have made you wait for me)

984
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,080
(and let you have hotpot.)

985
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,200
(It's not your fault.)

986
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,640
(I was being gluttonous.)

987
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,160
(I promise)

988
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,960
(you won't see Chen Chen again.)

989
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,680
(He's too awful.)

990
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,560
(I used to be good at eating spicy food.)

991
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,760
(If it weren't for the power outage
at the hotpot restaurant,)

992
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,720
(we would have battled it out.)

993
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,040
(Why was there a power outage at the restaurant?)

994
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,760
(It's nothing.)

995
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,880
(Rest early.)

996
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,120
(I'm going to take a shower and rest.)

997
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,080
(See you tomorrow.)

998
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,800
(See you tomorrow.)
