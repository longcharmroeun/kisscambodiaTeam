Although the company and the lab

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,320
have already been shut down,

23
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,480
but we still have to go through

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,120
the necessary procedures.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,320
Please sign the consent form.

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,800
Mr. Gu, have you finished reading it?

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,520
Do you need to

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,759
reconsider your decision?

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,040
What do you mean?

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,040
You were

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,360
once our client

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,800
so we have to

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
satisfy all your requests,

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
but restoring

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
Normal Mode right now

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
is equivalent to committing suicide.

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
This is unprecedented

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,200
because no one

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,760
wants to shorten their own lives.

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,800
So, in my opinion,

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,720
you should reconsider it.

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
There's no need to.

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,360
I've already made up my mind.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,160
Please restore it.

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
Let's get started then.

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,600
(Lifting Safe Mode)

47
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Are you done with the exam?

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Excuse me, Miss.

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Sir,

50
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,440
are you talking to me?

51
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,040
Yes.

52
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,440
Are you waiting for someone?

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,160
Yes.

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,720
Then, I'd like to ask,

55
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,800
are you waiting for your girlfriend?

56
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,320
Of course.

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,880
I can't keep chatting with you.

59
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,800
Otherwise, when my girlfriend comes out

60
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,520
and sees us,

61
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,760
she'll get jealous.

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,640
Nonsense.

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm not that petty.

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
Here. Your favorite.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
Thank you.

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,120
So refreshing.

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,840
How did the exam go?

68
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,480
Hardly encountered any difficulties.

69
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,360
It's hard not to get a high score

70
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,080
after being tutored by a nice teacher.

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,160
And did you know?

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
There was a question

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,360
which we had encountered

74
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,440
in our art gallery project.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,880
I had the answer right away.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
Really?

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,000
Say...

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
This...

79
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,760
How come you smile all of a sudden?

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,680
I haven't seen

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,160
you smile in such a long time.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't like smiling before

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
but I'm trying to

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,720
go along with your good mood

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
so you can relax.

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,320
I thought...

87
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,680
What?

88
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
What are you thinking?

89
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,720
I'm finally done with the exam.

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Should we celebrate?

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,840
To celebrate...

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
Shall we go to...

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
The old family house.
-The old family house.

94
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,320
Then I'll bring my grandma

95
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,080
and my aunt too.

96
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,680
Sure.

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,320
Let's go.

98
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
Mom.

99
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,440
She's asleep.

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,280
Mom.

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,600
Mom. Are you asleep?

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,880
Where are we?

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,560
Guess.

104
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,080
I think I recognize this road.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
Are we going home?

106
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, we're going home.

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,520
We're going home.

108
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,840
Going home.

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,280
Look how happy my mom is.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,520
This looks exactly like

111
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
our old family house.

112
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,360
Mom. Come and take a look.

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,920
Is it?

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
Can you still recognize it?

115
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,480
This is our home.

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
How can I not recognize it?

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,440
Really.

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,120
This is great.

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,920
The walls and the foundation are done.

120
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
Its exterior appearance won't change too much.

121
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,400
Grandma will recognize

122
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,040
this is our house with just one glimpse.

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Xiao Ning.

124
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,000
You've really made something of yourself.

125
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm so happy.

126
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,480
You're finishing

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,200
what your dad

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,520
couldn't.

129
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,840
I get emotional when talking about this.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Aunty, this is something to be happy about.

131
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,680
Let's stop being sad.

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
Right. I'll stop.

133
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,440
Mr. Gu.

134
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,320
I know that

135
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,480
you are the one

136
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,080
who has done most of what we see here.

137
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
But since

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,960
we're going to be

139
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,440
family in the future,

140
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
I won't

141
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
say thank you.

142
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,720
You're welcome, Aunty.

143
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,560
Aunty, what are you talking about?

144
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Gu Chuan, why aren't

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,680
the workers here today?

146
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,800
It's their day off.

147
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
When you come here tomorrow,

148
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
remind them that

149
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,760
the waterproof layer isn't thick enough.

150
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,880
Okay.

151
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,120
The yard looks so pretty

152
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,640
after it has been cleaned up.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
I came back after such a long time.

154
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,280
I have to go visit our old neighbors.

155
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,080
Mom, don't scare me.

156
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,000
How come you're not forgetful now?

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,240
You keep saying I'm a forgetful old lady.
I don't like it.

158
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
OK, you don't like it.

159
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,000
Which neighbor do I not know?

160
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,880
Alright, alright.

161
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,680
How about

162
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,440
you take me to visit

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
each and every one?

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,720
I haven't seen them in so long.

165
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,280
I don't know them anymore.

166
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,400
Grandma.

167
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,440
Mom.

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
-Mom, don't scare me like this.
-Grandma.

169
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,840
-Mom. Mom.
-Grandma.

170
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,500
(Operating room)

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
Don't be so anxious.

172
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,720
Grandma will be okay.

173
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,280
I kept thinking

174
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,480
that it can't be good

175
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
since she's been getting sleepy all the time.

176
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,400
But I didn't know

177
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,320
it would get this bad all of a sudden.

178
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,280
It's all my fault.

179
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,559
I shouldn't have brought her to the old family house.

180
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,200
How is this your fault?

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,360
It's okay.

182
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

183
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,820
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

184
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,360
Xiao Ning.

185
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,760
Uncle Tang. I'm sorry.

186
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm at the hospital.

187
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,960
I wasn't looking at my phone.

188
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,240
Wait.

189
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,800
Why are you at the hospital?

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
Something went wrong with Grandma.

191
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,720
Where's the patient's family?

192
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Doctor.

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,480
Doctor.

194
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,920
How is my mom doing?

195
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,640
Relax. She's stable right now.

196
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
But her blood pressure is unstable,

197
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,200
causing severe damage to
the blood vessels in her brain.

198
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
The patient is already awake.

199
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
Let her rest more.

200
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,560
Doctor.

201
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,160
So everything is okay?

202
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,400
For now.

203
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
One of you

204
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,600
get the procedures done for her admission.

205
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Thank you, Doctor.

206
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll handle it.

207
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
You and Aunty go take care of Grandma.

208
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,880
Everything's okay, Aunty.

209
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
That really scared me.

210
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
There there. It's okay.

211
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,120
Granda is already awake.

212
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,220
(In-patient department)

213
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,880
Grandma.

214
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
Aunty, Grandma is awake.

215
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,160
Mom.

216
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,560
Mom, you're finally awake.

217
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,040
You almost scared me to death.

218
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm not dead yet.

219
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,400
Why are you crying?

220
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
Grandma, Aunty is crying happy tears.

221
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,720
Happy tears.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,240
It's great as long as you've woken up.

223
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,920
I feel like

224
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
I was in a dream.

225
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,400
When I wake up, here I am.

226
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,240
Mom.

227
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,760
It's great as long as you've woken up.

228
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,840
Uncle Tang.

229
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,560
Here, just a little something.

230
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,680
Thank you, Uncle Tang.

231
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,520
Grandma, Uncle Tang came to see you.

232
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,280
Xiao Mai.

233
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
Mrs. Jiang.

234
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
It's Guang Da.

235
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
Guang Da.

236
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,160
Don't get too emotional.

237
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,800
-Guang Da.
-Don't get too emotional.

238
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,760
Mom.

239
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,280
Guang Da.

240
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,080
He's not Guang Da.

241
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,520
He's the reason why Guang Da died.

242
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,640
Aunty.

243
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,800
Uncle Tang.

244
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,840
Grandma has been having trouble
recognizing people these few years.

245
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,560
Why did it take you so long

246
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,920
to come back?

247
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,960
Were you busy with work?

248
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,200
Or did anyone judge you?

249
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,600
Just go along with what she says.

250
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
I've been...

251
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,400
really busy with work.

252
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,960
It's good to be busy.

253
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
At least, it's better than not having a job.

254
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,720
A lot of people

255
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,400
have been saying that you embezzled public funds.

256
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,080
Not only public funds

257
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,680
but also much of

258
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,680
the retired employees' pension.

259
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,760
Someone died because of it.

260
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
But I don't believe them.

261
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,400
I brought you up.

262
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,680
I know

263
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,600
what kind of person you are.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,240
You've been upright and kind
ever since you were a child.

265
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,160
You never made me worry.

266
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
I brought you and

267
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Xiao Mai up by myself.

268
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Many people asked me

269
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,520
why I sent my kids away

270
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,400
from home to go to school.

271
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,880
I don't think they understand

272
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,200
that going to school is the only way out.

273
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,000
You are the only one of our family

274
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,560
that have achieved something.

275
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,640
Don't be scared.

276
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,320
Mom believes in you.

277
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,960
When you walk out that door,

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,800
you need to keep your head up.

279
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,840
We won't confess to anything

280
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,880
we have never done before.

281
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,200
Guang Da.

282
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,400
Guang Da.

283
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,600
I am not babying you

284
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,480
or being

285
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,320
partial to you because you're my son.

286
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,480
I know you're innocent.

287
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,760
You're innocent.

288
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,520
You're not guilty.

289
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,520
So, child,

290
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,640
don't be scared to come home.

291
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Guang Da.

292
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,520
All these years,

293
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,280
-life has been tough on you.
-Don't get too emotional.

294
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Don't get too emotional.

295
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,960
My son.

296
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,640
Don't get too emotional.

297
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,600
You've gone through so much.

298
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,720
Mom.

299
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Lie down.

300
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,680
Mom.

301
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,720
My son.

302
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,040
Guang Da.

303
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,320
Mom, you need to rest.

304
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,400
Mom.

305
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Don't get too emotional.

306
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,880
Xiao Mai.

307
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,160
Xiao Mai.

308
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,200
Your big brother hasn't eaten yet.

309
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,600
Hurry,

310
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,320
get him something good to eat.

311
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,520
I got it, Mom.

312
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,360
I'll ask Xiao Ning

313
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,840
to take him to get some good food.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
Xiao Ning.

315
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,320
Uncle Tang.

316
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,120
My son is back.

317
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Guang Da is back.

318
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,720
Rest well.

319
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Guang Da is back.

320
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,320
Guang Da is back.

321
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,440
Mom, be at ease.

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,840
Sorry, Uncle Tang.

323
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,280
Grandma can't really think straight sometimes.

324
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,320
It's alright.

325
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,360
What do the doctors think?

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,720
The doctor said everything's fine.

327
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,680
Why were you in such a rush

328
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,080
to talk to me?

329
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,760
It's nothing.

330
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,240
I was worried about Grandma,

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
so I came by.

332
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,480
Take good care of her.

333
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,560
I'll come find you another day.

334
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,080
Okay.

335
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,839
I want to finish
the old family house as soon as possible

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,520
so Grandma can move in early.

337
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,800
I'm worried that she...

338
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,040
I'll contact them and ask them

339
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,319
to increase the manpower

340
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,079
and speed up the construction progress.

341
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,400
Thank you.

342
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,839
Don't worry.

343
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Let's go.

Please write down

356
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,480
what we discussed today.

357
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,080
Sure.

358
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,040
Okay.

359
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,160
Bye.

360
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,800
Bye.

361
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,360
Later.

362
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,920
Goodbye.

363
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,800
See you.

364
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,760
Bye.

365
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,360
Alright, we're leaving.

366
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,240
Okay.

367
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,120
You've been working so hard lately.

368
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,120
Want to take a day off?

369
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,080
No.

370
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,520
I don't want to miss anything.

371
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,760
I want to watch

372
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,360
the house being built little by little.

373
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
What are you going to do

374
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,640
with the burnt future

375
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,920
you've collected?

376
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,480
I want to transform them

377
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,480
and put them back into the house.

378
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,960
The furniture

379
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,560
carry the past.

380
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,760
They can jog Grandma's

381
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,240
and Aunty's memories.

382
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,000
It might make them feel better than

383
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
just giving them a house.

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
Designs filled with love

385
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
are perfect.

386
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,680
Let's go.

387
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,720
Hi, Uncle Tang.

388
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,440
Xiao Ning, do you have time?

389
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,680
I have something very important

390
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,720
to tell you.

391
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:15,300
(Ward one, Beds 56-58)

392
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,600
Here, have some water.

393
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
Thank you.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Uncle Tang.

395
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,800
Do you have something

396
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,080
to tell me?

397
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,320
During the ten years I spent in prison,

398
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,000
to be honest,

399
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,120
I thought about your dad every day.

400
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,760
I'm really sorry. I've failed your parents,

401
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,760
your grandma, and you.

402
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,520
Uncle Tang, you...

403
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,840
Your dad was framed.

404
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
That car crash ten years ago

405
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,420
wasn't an accident.

406
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,480
It was planned.

407
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,800
The person who actually embezzled public funds

408
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
was...

409
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,280
No.

410
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,080
What are you doing?

411
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,360
What's so secretive

412
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,760
that we have to come here to talk?

413
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,280
What's going on?

414
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,280
The numbers don't add up.

415
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,680
You and I are in charge

416
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,960
of this project.

417
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,760
If something goes wrong,

418
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,480
we'd be held responsible.

419
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,480
Don't worry.

420
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,920
No one knows about this money.

421
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,120
Even if someone finds out,

422
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,560
our superiors will have to be confronted with it first.

423
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,080
You mean... Xu Guo Xiang?

424
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,360
Right.

425
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,360
Lao Tang.

426
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,880
Can he shoulder the responsibility?

427
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,280
It's more than 10 million yuan.

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,960
Besides,

429
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,280
he's the department head,

430
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,640
but we are the ones in charge

431
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,720
of this project.

432
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,720
If something goes wrong,
we'd be the ones to take the blame.

433
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,200
Lao Tang. Tell me the truth.

434
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,440
Where did the money go?

435
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Tell me.

436
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,880
I can't tell you right now.

437
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
Lao Tang.

438
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,320
Being the kind of person you are,

439
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,120
you'd never do anything like this.

440
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,640
Xu Guo Xiang must be

441
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,000
the one behind you.

442
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,840
You two are in this together.

443
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,080
Right?

444
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
Lao Tang, what were you thinking?

445
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,280
You're sending yourself to jail,

446
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
you know?

447
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,160
Plus, these funds

448
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,920
include the pension for

449
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,760
the retired employees.

450
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,600
If you embezzle that money,

451
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,160
what will they live off of?

452
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,400
How dare you do something that

453
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,920
tramples over your conscience?

454
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,320
As time passes by,

455
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,720
there will be serious consequences!

456
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,600
Whatever,

457
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,160
suit yourself.

458
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,760
How much information does Jiang Guang Da have?

459
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,880
He started looking

460
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,520
for evidence a few days ago.

461
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,360
He's also the project manager.

462
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,920
He probably has all the

463
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,200
relevant evidence by now.

464
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
He...

465
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,800
He's going to report us.

466
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,280
What do we do?

467
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,400
Looks like we really...

468
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,000
have to think things through.

469
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,560
After your dad passed away,

470
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,160
we changed all the numbers.

471
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,840
Because the dead cannot give witness,

472
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,240
we shifted the majority

473
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,680
of the blame onto him

474
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,000
and I was only convicted as an accessory offender.

475
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
But being the department head,

476
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,240
Xu Guo Xiang only had to resign.

477
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,360
I'm sorry, Xiao Ning.

478
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
These are the accounting records...

479
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,320
I've kept from back then.

480
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,040
All the evidence

481
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,640
is in this thumb drive.

482
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,600
There's nothing I can do to make up for it.

483
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,320
I just want to give

484
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,400
these to you

485
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,360
and prove your dad's innocence.

486
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,800
So,

487
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,680
that car crash from ten years ago...

488
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,680
It was planned by Xu Guo Xiang

489
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,560
to make sure that the witness
will never talk again.

490
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,160
That car crash

491
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,400
not only killed my parents

492
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,920
but also badly injured Gu Chuan,

493
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,640
who tried to save us.

494
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,440
His life

495
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,160
has been a living hell for ten years.

496
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,680
No one knows

497
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,240
how much longer he has left.

498
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,520
I'm sorry, Xiao Ning.

499
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,760
It's all my fault.

500
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,560
It's all my fault.

501
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,080
I'm sorry.

502
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,240
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,600
It's all my fault.

504
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,240
It's all my fault.

505
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,040
I caused your dad's death,

506
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,960
and you lost your mom because of me.

507
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,760
What's wrong?

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,040
If I hadn't been so unlucky,

521
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
my dad wouldn't have run into

522
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
such terrible things;

523
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,960
there wouldn't have been a car crash;

524
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
my parents wouldn't have passed away;

525
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,400
you wouldn't have been injured,

526
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,480
and you wouldn't have been tortured
by the mechanical heart.

527
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,760
Now...

528
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,720
If it hadn't been for everything that had happened,

529
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,680
how could I have met you,

530
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,560
right?

531
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,760
But how come I'm the only one

532
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,720
who's alive and well?

533
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
My parents left me behind

534
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,920
and now even you are...

535
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,320
Don't leave me behind, okay?

536
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,360
What should I do?

537
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,400
I don't know what I should do.

538
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,480
It's okay.

539
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Stop thinking about that.

540
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,200
I've looked through the information

541
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,200
and the accounting records in the thumb drive.

542
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,840
It's all solid evidence.

543
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,520
You can totally prove

544
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,600
your dad's innocence.

545
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,040
It can also prove

546
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,400
that Xu Guo Xiang was the major offender.

547
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,280
It's Xu Cheng Ran.

548
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,960
I asked him to come.

549
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,120
I wanted to give him a heads-up

550
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,520
so he can be mentally prepared

551
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,560
before we call the police.

552
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,820
(Accounting records of Dongjiang Group)

553
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,239
I never would've thought that

554
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
it was my dad who ruined your lives.

555
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,120
He killed Xiao Ning's parents

556
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,480
and almost killed

557
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,360
my best friend.

558
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,040
I...

559
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,239
I don't know what to say.

560
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,320
I don't deserve to be your friend.

561
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,800
What are you doing?

562
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,520
Chuan.

563
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,840
Xiao Ning.

564
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,880
I'm sorry.

565
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,200
Don't blame yourself.

566
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,880
None of these is your fault.

567
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,640
But he's my dad.

568
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,000
That's a fact that cannot be changed.

569
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,880
No one will blame you.

570
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,640
This matter has nothing

571
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,520
to do with you.

572
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,720
Chuan.

573
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,200
I'd rather you scold me,

574
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,640
hit me, or whatever, right now.

575
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,680
At least,

576
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,920
I'd feel slightly better that way.

577
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,600
Don't say anything to comfort me.

578
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,080
Ran Ran.

579
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,200
We cannot change anything

580
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,080
that has already happened.

581
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,200
Right now, we should be thinking about

582
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,120
how to solve the problem.

583
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,080
Calm down.

584
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,360
Mr. Xu.

585
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,080
You are Gu Chuan's friend,

586
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,920
Sister Yan Yan's husband,

587
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,040
and my friend.

588
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
But,

589
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,600
I cannot forgive your father

591
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,680
just because of this.

592
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,000
He still has to be

593
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,160
punished by law.

594
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,920
The reason we chose to

595
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,920
tell you as soon as we could

596
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,440
was for you

597
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,920
to be mentally prepared.

598
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,840
I understand.

599
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,760
I won't stop you,

600
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,800
but

601
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,440
I have a presumptuous request.

602
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,520
Ran Ran,

603
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
be reasonable.

604
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,000
I just want to say...

605
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,480
that he is my dad after all.

606
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,320
Could you give me a bit of time

607
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,840
to convince him

608
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,960
to turn himself in?

609
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,080
I promise

610
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,840
if he has

611
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,320
no intention to repent,

612
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,120
I'll turn him over

613
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,760
to the police myself.

614
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,680
What brings you back?

615
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Dad.

616
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,280
You killed

617
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,120
Jiang Xiao Ning's parents.

618
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,680
What did you say?

619
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,720
I know everything.

620
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,240
I've already seen

621
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,040
all the evidence

622
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,440
about your embezzlement back then.

623
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,040
Who told you?

624
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,200
Jiang Xiao Ning?

625
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,920
Gu Chuan?

626
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,880
Does it matter?

627
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,840
Or are you going to kill the witnesses again?

628
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,040
Just like how you dealt with

629
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Jiang Xiao Ning's family

630
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:40,960
and Gu Chuan by hitting them off the mountain

631
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,600
all those years ago.

632
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,120
When I found out about it,

633
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,600
I felt

634
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,240
that I didn't know you anymore.

635
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,440
I don't understand.

636
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,080
How could you have done

637
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,200
something so heinous?

638
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,320
How could you be so cruel?

639
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,240
You not only committed embezzlement

640
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,520
but also murder, really?

641
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,040
Gu Chuan

642
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,440
and Jiang Xiao Ning,

643
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,720
are my best friends.

644
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,680
You have ruined their lives.

645
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,320
I can't face them

646
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,160
anymore.

647
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,760
Why did you do that?

648
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,720
I don't understand.

649
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,120
I don't understand

650
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,520
how my dad could be a murderer?

651
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,760
Why?

652
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,440
There is no "why".

653
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,680
Look at this house!

654
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,520
Think about the company!

655
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,800
After I die,

656
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
everything will be yours.

657
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,120
That's why!

658
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,840
Because you're my son!

659
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,000
Do you think that leaving the money,

660
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,560
this house,

661
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,440
and Reindeer Group to me

662
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,760
is for the best of my interest?

663
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,560
Have you thought about

664
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,760
what I want?

665
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
I just want an unbroken family,

666
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,000
with both of you and mom in it.

667
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,720
Go turn yourself in.

668
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,880
This is the only thing

669
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,200
I can do for you right now.

670
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,200
Xu Cheng Ran.

671
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
You're going to send

672
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,240
your own father to prison

673
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,760
for an outsider?
