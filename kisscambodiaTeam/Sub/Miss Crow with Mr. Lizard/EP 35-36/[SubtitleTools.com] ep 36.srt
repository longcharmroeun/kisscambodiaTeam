21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
Dad,

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,000
I've always hated you since I was a kid

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
and I always went against you.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,320
But I have never

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,960
told you this.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
Actually, you have always been my hero.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
I have always

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
wanted your approval.

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,520
That's why I partnered with Gu Chuan

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,320
to start a company.

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,640
That's why I returned to Reindeer Group.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
I don't want my hero

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,200
to be an irresponsible man.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,440
For all the things you did back then,

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,200
I could pretend

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,600
you did it for our family

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
and it was a momentary lapse in judgment.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,520
But wrong is wrong.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,320
You have to own up to it.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
I don't want my father

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
to end up being one who has no conscience.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you think I've

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
had a good time all these years?

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,000
You know what?

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,240
Actually, I have always

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,760
been beating myself up

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,960
and living with guilt.

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Now that it has come to this.

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
It has come to this.

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
Thankfully.

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,520
You're all grown up now.

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,800
You can handle everything on your own.

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,680
I have nothing

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
to worry about now.

55
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,400
All right.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,960
I'll listen to you.

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
I'll turn myself in.

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,280
Tomorrow morning.

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
Okay.

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,840
But...

61
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,400
you wouldn't try to run away,

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,880
would you?

63
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm old now

64
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,960
and this kind of thing has happened.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,680
Do you think running away will do me any good?

66
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,440
Son.

67
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,040
I have lived in this house

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,120
for far too long.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
I just

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,600
want to stay quietly in this house

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
for another night

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and I'll have no regrets.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,520
Son.

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,800
I have wronged you

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
and let you down.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Hello, Director Xu.

77
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,280
Tang Xu was just here.

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
I have warned him.

79
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
Yes?

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
Jiang Xiao Ning and Gu Chuan?

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
Okay, I got it.

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,760
All right. I'll go now.

83
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,120
What's wrong?

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,920
Pack up your things.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,120
Let's leave this place.

86
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
Didn't I tell you that I'm not leaving?

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,720
You have to go.

88
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
What's going on, Dad?

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,720
Are you hiding something from me?

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Look.

91
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
Xu Guo Xiang is going to jail and he'll

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
definitely drag you into this.

93
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,240
Wait a second.

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,080
How do you know that he is going to jail?

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,160
Hold on.

96
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,640
See for yourself.

97
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
And this.

98
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,460
(Account name: Dongjiang Group)

99
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
Have you got home?

100
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,960
Almost there.

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,560
I'll go and meet you

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
after I'm done charging.

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm going home to get some things for Grandma.

104
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Then, I'll go to the hospital to swap shifts.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
Why don't we meet in the hospital?

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,040
It's all right.

107
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,880
You've been running around with me all day.

108
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,040
Just go home and rest.

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,640
Get some sleep.

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,120
Don't worry about me.

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,880
I must be keeping you company

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
so that I can rest assured.

113
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,240
I know you must be in a bad mood.

114
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
But give Xu Cheng Ran

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,800
some time.

116
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,520
I believe

117
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,800
he'll be able to talk his dad round.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I know. I believe Mr. Xu, too.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,440
That's all for now. I'm hanging up.

120
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,000
- Open the door! What are you...
- Don't move!

121
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,740
(Gu Chuan)

122
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,040
(Gu Chuan)
Xiao Ning?

123
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,480
Who are you?

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,440
Where's the evidence?

125
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,120
I have given it to the police.

126
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,560
If that's true,

127
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,840
things will be different now.

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Don't lie to me.

129
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,760
None of you can get away with it.

130
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
Do you have a death wish?

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
Give me the evidence.

132
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,520
It's not with me.

133
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,960
Xiao Ning, where are you?

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,560
The evidence is with you, right?

135
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,440
Who are you?

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,680
That's not important.

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,040
What matters

138
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
is if the evidence is with you.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Yes.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,520
It's with me.

141
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,280
If you dare to

142
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,280
lay a finger on Jiang Xiao Ning,

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,720
you won't get the evidence.

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,520
She's not what I want.

145
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,679
Give me the evidence

146
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,000
and I'll send her back to you.

147
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,080
Remember.

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,200
Come alone.

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
Don't try to play tricks.

150
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,560
Otherwise, I can't promise

151
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,840
that you'll see Jiang Xiao Ning

152
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,440
in one piece.

153
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Where do I meet you?

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
I'll call you later.

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,880
Director Xu.

156
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
Where are you going?

157
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,880
How dare you

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
show up in front of me?

159
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,880
You've got a lot of nerve.

160
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,320
I'm not in the same league as you.

161
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,840
You could actually order the kill on people.

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Let me ask you.

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
Mr. Jiang and his wife's deaths

164
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,760
are on you, right?

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Did your dad

166
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,640
cook up nonsense again?

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,040
It looks like serving

168
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,960
ten years in jail isn't enough for Tang.

169
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,480
He didn't turn over a new leaf.

170
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,520
I suggest that

171
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
he should continue

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,360
serving time in jail.

173
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm warning you.

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,560
Don't lay a finger on my dad.

175
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,680
He took the fall for you

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
and served ten years in jail.

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,880
I merely took some money of yours

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,720
and that isn't enough

179
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
to make up for his loss!

180
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,560
Xiao Xu.

181
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,240
I've told you before.

182
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Don't line your pockets with my money.

183
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm afraid if you do,

184
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,440
you can't come back from that.

185
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,840
Got it?

186
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
You have to pay a great price

187
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
for stealing my money.

188
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,960
You killed Xiao Ning's parents

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,360
and got my dad thrown behind bars for ten years.

190
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
I can't let things slide.

191
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,560
Well,

192
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,600
what are you going to do?

193
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
Call the police?

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,400
Sure.

195
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,440
But before you do that,

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
look at yourself first.

197
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,000
If I get jailed,

198
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,040
do you think you can get away with it?

199
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,880
I wouldn't be here

200
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
if I wanted to call the police.

201
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
Suits yourself then.

202
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,680
Where are you going?

203
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,800
It's none of your business.

204
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,760
Dad, going somewhere?

205
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,880
Why are you back here?

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,480
All I can say is that

207
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
nobody understands one's father
better than his son.

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,560
Did you forget

209
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,960
what you promised me?

210
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
I told you

211
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,440
that I would turn myself in tomorrow morning.

212
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,880
From what I see,

213
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
it doesn't seem like it.

214
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Do you really

215
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
want your father

216
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
to be thrown behind bars?

217
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,120
You did let me down.

218
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,800
Ran Ran.

219
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,640
Actually, things aren't...

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,960
Say no more.

221
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,280
You have lied all your life.

222
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Aren't you tired?

223
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,840
All I know is that

224
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
to achieve great things,

225
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,800
one needn't stand on trifles.

226
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,640
The so-called great things

227
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,440
are doing things by hook or by crook

228
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,240
and even by killing people for money.

229
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,120
If so, I'll never understand.

230
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,720
Perhaps,

231
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Tang Xu will resonate with you.

232
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,160
Don't drag me into

233
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,040
your family affairs.

234
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,440
I'm leaving.

235
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,580
(Police)

236
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,160
No one will get away with it.

237
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Whatever you have to say,

238
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,080
you can say it to the police.

239
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
Who called the police?

240
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,920
Me.

241
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,120
(Dad, I'm sorry.)

242
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,000
(I have been avoiding it.)

243
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
(If I had straightened you out sooner,)

244
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,280
(maybe you wouldn't end up like this.)

245
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,400
(Dad, I'm sorry.)

246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,640
(Please forgive your unfilial son.)

247
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
Get on the boat.

248
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Where's the stuff?

249
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,640
What's the hurry?

250
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
It's right here.

251
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,920
Let her go first.

252
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
Are you all right?

253
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,360
Why are you here?

254
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,600
You can't give them the evidence.

255
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,920
Don't bother about that.

256
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,000
How would I know

257
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,640
if you had a backup copy?

258
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,040
Or

259
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,680
if you had called the cops?

260
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
The reason I didn't call the police

261
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,720
is that I wanted to keep it on the down low.

262
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,480
After all,

263
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
it was ten years ago.

264
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,240
As long as I can take her away from here,

265
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,360
we'll pretend like

266
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,680
none of this has ever happened.

267
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,920
Why should I believe you?

268
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,880
I have no reason to lie.

269
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,520
I can abduct her today

270
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,120
and I can do it anytime again.

271
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,800
You'll have to pay a great price if you lie to me.

272
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,360
Why would I want to lie to you?

273
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,600
Let's go.

274
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,680
What's the meaning of this?

275
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm sorry, you two.

276
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,880
No one is leaving today.

277
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,840
Do it.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,920
Are you all right?

279
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Watch out!

280
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,000
You shouldn't have messed with me.

281
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,480
Gu Chuan!

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,800
Gu Chuan!

283
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
Gu Chuan, wake up!

284
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,680
Gu Chuan!

285
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,000
Gu Chuan!

286
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,520
Gu Chuan, don't scare me!

287
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,960
Gu Chuan!

288
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,440
Gu Chuan!

289
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,640
Gu Chuan!

290
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
His vital signs

291
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,200
are stable now.

292
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,160
As to when

293
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,240
he'll wake up,

294
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,160
we don't know

295
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,120
for sure.

296
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,280
Hasn't the safe mode

297
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,440
been activated?

298
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,080
Why would there still be electricity discharge?

299
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Actually,

300
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,160
I've helped him

301
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,760
restore the initial mode.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
His mechanical heart

303
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
has exited the safe mode.

304
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,600
What?

305
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,320
Mr. Gu said,

306
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,120
despite knowing his time left would be cut short,

307
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,280
at least, he would feel alive.

308
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,800
Also, he gets to feel

309
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,960
real emotions,

310
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,160
instead of living

311
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,400
like a machine.

(to look you in the eye)

362
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,040
(and say goodbye.)

363
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,320
(Indeed, I'm not an ambitious person.)

364
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,040

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,360
(to bring joy)

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
(and fall in love with a girl.)

372
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,440
(my dad)

(All of a sudden,)

375
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
(I've lost the direction in my life.)

376
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,760
(Reindeer Group has gone bankrupt)

377
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,720
(and my dad is in jail.)

378
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
(I have to deal with a lot)

379
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,160
(of compensation issues.)

380

(to protect our love.)

(I don't want to be a drag on you)

388
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,080
(and make you suffer with me.)

389
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
(Just leave the agreement here)

390

(after you have signed it.)

391
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,240
(I'll send someone to get it.)

392
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,600
(I hope)

393
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,560
(you'll live)

394
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
(a happy life.)

395
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,600
(Take care. Xu Cheng Ran.)

396
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,640
Why don't you hide away if you want to leave?

397
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,920
You picked such an easy place to find.

398
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,840
What do you want to do?

399
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,480
Kill yourself?

400
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,800
Is Gu Chuan awake?

401
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,400
Will he

402
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,040
stay like this forever?

403
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
How long do you plan to hide from me?

404
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,640
Xu Cheng Ran, do you still love me?

405
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,400
Indeed, your dad has hurt them.

406
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,560
But not you.

407
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,720
Besides,

408
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,520
what do all these have to do with us?

409
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,320
My dad has been arrested

410
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,400
and all his property has been confiscated.

411
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,120
My family

412
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,320
is broke and ruined now.

413
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,520
And from now on,

414
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,080
no matter where I go,

415
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,080
people will point fingers at me.

416
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,480
There's nothing that I can give to you.

417
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,760
Why bother coming to see me?

418
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,840
I don't need anything.

419
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,760
All I want is you.

420
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
I don't think

421
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,240
you'll need anything from me.

422
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,800
All these years,

423
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,440
I've never believed in love

424
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,560
because I was afraid of getting hurt.

425
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,040
That's why I didn't believe anyone

426
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,760
nor did I believe in eternal love

427
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,520
until I met Xu Cheng Ran.

428
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,560
After being with Xu Cheng Ran,

429
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,920
I don't have to twist open a bottle cap,

430
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,480
change a light bulb,

431
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,800
nor do I have to eat alone

432
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,440
or walk late at night.

433
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,400
Xu Cheng Ran is

434
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,680
willing to accept me for who I am

435
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,840
and go along with all my ridiculous requests.

436
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,800
Most importantly,

437
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
he loves my bad temper the most.

438
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
So I was thinking.

439
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,840
If I don't come and find him,

440
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
other girls

441
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,840
might steal him from me.

442
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,840
It will all be too late then.

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm not that good...

444
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,800
Shut up. Let me finish.

445
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,000
So I came here today

446
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,640
to make it up to him

447
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,040
for all the pain

448
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,400
that I put him through back then.

449
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,400
I...

450
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,400
Zhao Yan...

451
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,880
kneel before Xu Cheng Ran

452
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,680
to ask his hand in marriage.

453
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,680
I hope

454
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,520
he'll come back to me

455
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
and let me be his queen again.

456
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,320
He'll always be prepared to let me
take advantage of him

457
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,040
and be at my beck

458
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,080
and call.

459
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,480
Let me use my lifetime

460
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
to love him with all my heart

461
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,600
for all eternity.

462
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,800
Xu Cheng Ran.

463
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,560
Will you marry me?

464
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,800
I do. Of course, I do.

465
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,280
But I've lost my job

466
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,120
and my company now.

467
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,680

There's a meeting at 2 PM.

Okay.

490
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,200
Okay.

491
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,520
Here. Take a look.

492
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,400
This.

493
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,620
(Emergency)

494
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,700
(Inpatient Department)

495
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,400
Good morning, Boss.

496
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,120
Today is Monday.

497
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,480
It's a working day.

498
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,680
So I still have to call you "Boss".

499
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
The weather is good today.

500
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,240
You don't have any plans anyway.

501
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,080
The only thing you need to do

502
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,360
is to lie in bed

503
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,760
and have a chat with me.

504
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,360
I'll tell you stories

505
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,240
and news.

506
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,920
Mr. Xu said,

507
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,240
Chen Ao,

508
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
the young man

509
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,640
who caused the car accident ten years ago, died.

510
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
The police found out

511
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,000
that Xu Guo Xiang

512
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,680
ordered Assistant Liu to do it.

513
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,960
That adds to their list of crimes

514
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,880
and they'll be given heavy punishments.

515
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,480
I have no idea

516
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,960
how to comfort Mr. Xu.

517
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,440
But don't worry.

518
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,600
Sister Yan Yan will surely

519
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,040
be with him and help him get through it.

520
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,480
The biggest news of today is that

521
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
I have got my degree certificate.

522
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,840
From now on,

523
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,320
I'm officially a designer.

524
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
You feel happy for me, right?

525
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,160
Yesterday, Grandma and Aunty

526
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,280
have moved into our family house.

527
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,600
I stayed there last night.

528
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,120
When I see all those things

529
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,680
that you prepared for me,

530
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,800
lying in the starry room that you made for me,

531
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,880
I would recall

532
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,400
the old memories.

533
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,920
The doctor said

534
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,760
that Alzheimer's is hereditary.

535
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
I'm afraid that I'll forget you someday.

536
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,280
If you don't want me

537
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,040
to forget you,

538
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,840
then wake up, alright?

539
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,760
All right now.

540
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,320
It's time for you to listen to the news.

541
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,760
A well-known Cambridge neuroscientist

542
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,480
recently pointed out

543
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,199
in a large public event in the United Kingdom

544
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,639
that although the human brain
is extremely complex,

545
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,560
the understanding

546
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,720
of various parts of brain cells
is gradually deepening.

547
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,520
If the computer has the function

548
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,840
of recreating a 100M connection,

549
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,560
it will

550
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,360
no longer be a dream to transform the brain

551
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,320
into a program code

552
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,240
to survive in the machine.

553
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,920
Did you hear that?

554
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,120
This new technology

555
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,000
seems like a good chance

556
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
for us.

557
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,760
What if

558
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,080
we convert our consciousness

559
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,800
into a digital file

560
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,040
and upload it to a computer,

561
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,160
does it mean

562
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,560
we can meet again

563
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,200
in the cloud?

564
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,200
Gu Chuan.

565
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
You can hear me, right?

566
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,480
All right.

567
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,240
I'll go downstairs and get some fruits.

568
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,820
(Three years later)

569
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,680
I'm back.

570
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,360
Do you feel tired today?

571
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,520
It's all right.

572
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,840
I went to the construction site today.

573
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,520
Everything goes according to plan.

574
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,680
It's going smoothly.

575
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,800
By the way,

576
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,280
Sister Yan Yan asked me

577
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,200
to accompany her for the prenatal
testing next week.

578
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,240
Shouldn't Xu Cheng Ran

579
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,160
go with him instead?

580
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Sister Yan Yan doesn't

581
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,440
want him to go with her.

582
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,160
Xu Cheng Ran gets all nervous

583
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,400
each time he hears

584
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,040
the baby's heartbeat from the device.

585
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,720
All right then.

586
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
What delicious food did you buy today?

587
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Take a guess.

588
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,560
Steak?

589
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,200
Why did you get it right again?

590
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,000
That's because

591
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
I've got the red wine ready in advance.

592
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
No one can beat

593
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,040
the chemistry between us.

594
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,520
Are you done charging?

595
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,720
Yes.

596
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,680
Do you want to test it?

597
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,920
Test what?

598
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,240
What can it be?

599
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,280
Here.

600
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,600
There isn't much fluctuation.

601
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,240
Your heart rate

602
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,360
remains over 80bpm now.

603
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,240
Back then, it would jump up

604
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,760
to over 100bpm when I kissed you.

605
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Does it mean

606
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,600
we can take it to the next level?

607
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,440
What's the rush?

608
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,080
What if

609
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
something goes wrong again?

610
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,120
Fine.

611
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,680
The rules of us getting along

612
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,920
remain unchanged for now.

613
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,080
Keep things the way they are now.

614
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,920
Actually, this is good enough for me.

615
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,400
Once in a while,

616
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,000
you can drink some wine

617
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,960
and let me kiss and hug you.

618
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,040
I think

619
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,720
we should take one step at a time.

620
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,360
When I'm fully recovered,

621
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,920
we can go directly

622
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,240
from the first to the third base.

623
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
