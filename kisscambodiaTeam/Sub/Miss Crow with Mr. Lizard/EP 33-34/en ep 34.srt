what will happen to his mechanical heart?

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Safe Mode will automatically be activated.

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,880
Safe Mode?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
(Based on what you told me,)

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
(Mr. Gu's mechanical heart)

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,080

(In other words,)

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
(he can't feel)

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,320
(Care instructions, Warning)
any emotions now

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
(Care instructions, Warning)
and it turns him

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
into a vegetable who can still talk and walk.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,040
He might not have

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
any emotions now.

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
But at least,

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,240
it can keep him alive for a while.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
How long

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
can his mechanical heart last

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,400
if Safe Mode is activated?

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
It's hard to say.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,680
But all the previous cases

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
didn't last for more than a year.

44

frame is about a year.)

(you can look on the bright side.)

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480

48

I'm just curious.

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,520
Was it fun?

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,440
Or were there lingering fears

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
that make you wake up with a start

Then, I had to face punishment.

89
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
After going to jail,

90
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
there was endless torment.

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,080
Regret and guilt.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
Honestly,

93
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,400
if I were given another chance

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,640
to choose again,

95
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,880
I would never

96
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,320
take a dime of anyone's money.

97
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,160
I think it's nothing.

98
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,880
Everyone's money is just the same.

99
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,560
What you said

100
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,200
is the feeling after being caught.

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,960
If you hadn't been arrested

102
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,920
and no one came after you

103
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
for taking their money,

104
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,360
you wouldn't regret or feel guilty.

105
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,000
Tell me.

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
If I were to follow

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
in your footsteps,

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,760
how fun would that be?

109
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,240
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,800
Why are you yelling?

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,760
Look, Xiao Xu.

112
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,320
Did something happen?

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,600
If there's anything,

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,800
you have to tell me.

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,120
You don't have to hide it from me, all right?

116
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,440
Yes, I know.

117
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,840
All right.

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
I told you. I was just saying nonsense.

119
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,840
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,480
Drink up.

121
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,400
Here.

122
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,680
No...

123
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,800
Drink up.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Sir.

125
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Sir, where are you going?

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,520
Sir, who are you looking for?

127
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm here for Director Xu.

128
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,760
Sir, you can't go inside.

129
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,480
Sir.

130
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
Director Xu, I'm sorry.

131
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,000
I couldn't stop him.

132
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,400
It's so hard to get a chance to meet you.

133
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,360
Director Xu.

134
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
Tang.

135
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Long time no see.

136
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,159
Long time no see.

137
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Is it that hard to meet me?

138
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Don't say that.

139
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,360
Here. Take a seat.

140
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,200
Here.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,679
It was my bad.

142
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,400
Look, now that you're out,

143
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,440
I should have paid you a visit.

144
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
But you have to come to me instead.

145
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,480
It's my fault.

146
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,920
I'm here to take some thing.

147
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Take some thing?

148
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
What is it?

149
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm here to claim

150
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
what you should have given to me.

151
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,720
I didn't spend ten years in jail

152
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,800
for nothing.

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
You didn't forget

154
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
your promise, right?

155
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
I've kept my promise,

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,760
Tang.

157
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,800
I raised Tang Xu

158
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,680
and gave him the best life

159
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
and the best education.

160
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,040
I made him an executive in the company.

161
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,000
Right?

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,600
So...

163
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,760
What else I didn't do?

164
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,040
How dare you bring up Tang Xu?

165
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,240
All these years,

166
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
how have you treated him?

167
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
Did you think I couldn't tell

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
how he felt hard done by all these years?

169
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,320
Wait.

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,720
He felt hard done by?

171
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,280
It's me who feels hard done by!

172
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,160
Tang.

173
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,760
If you here

174
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,760
to talk about this,

175
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,320
I...

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,960
There's nothing to

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,760
talk about between us.

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,000
So you're kicking me out?

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Xu Guo Xiang.

180
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,080
You haven't forgotten what happened

181
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,840
ten years ago, right?

182
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
Do you need me to remind you?

183
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,440
Tang.

184
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
Think about it.

185
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
You're the project manager.

186
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,760
You can't get away

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,240
with it anyway.

188
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
But have you thought about it?

189
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
If you're put behind bars,

190
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,840
what's going to happen to your wife and kid?

191
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,920
I heard that your wife

192
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,960
does not have a permanent job

193
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
and your son is still young.

194
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
How are they going to live? Have you
thought about that?

195
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,520
Just keep me out of it.

196
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,960
Even if you're put behind bars,

197
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,360
it'll just be a few years.

198
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,520
I'll take care

199
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,360
of your wife and son.

200
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,360
I'll send your son

201
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,720
to college, to study abroad,

202
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,320
and even make him a shareholder.

203
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,160
It's all on me.

204
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,040
It's just a few years.

205
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,360
Tang.

206
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,040
No problem.

207
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,560
I can promise you that.

208
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
This amount of money

209
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,520
isn't a big deal.

210
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
I can give you twice the amount.

211
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
But...

212
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,680
not anymore.

213
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,320
Because your Tang Xu

214
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
was such a disappointment. Do you know that?

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,280
But because

216
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
he's your son,

217
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
I let things slide.

218
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
But I have a record here.

219
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,960
Take a look.

220
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,880
That will get him decades of imprisonment.

221
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,380
(Jiangdong Commercial Bank, Personal account
transaction details)

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,840
Xu Guo Xiang, you're a scumbag.

223
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,080
You're obviously

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,160
using Tang Xu!

225
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
How dare you...

226
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Let go of me!

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,480
Don't move.

228
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Tang.

229
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
I just don't get it.

230
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
You're not young anymore.

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,640
Why are you still so impulsive?

232
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,320
And you're so brainless.

233
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,560
If I don't have something on Tang Xu,

234
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,200
do you think I can trust you?

235
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,280
Listen up, Xu Guo Xiang!

236
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,960
If you dare to hurt Tang Xu,

237
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,800
I'll fight you till the end!

238
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Assistant Liu.

239
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,920
He's too noisy. Throw him out.

240
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,880
Move.

241
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,640
Move.

242
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,400
I won't spare you!

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
A mad dog.

244
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,960
What should I do?

245
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,480
I miss you so much and it's only been a day.

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Why didn't you reply to my message yesterday?

247
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,960
I miss you so much

248
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,600
that words alone

249
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
can't express how I feel.

250
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,160
How was Grandma's check-up?

251
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,400
It was good.

252
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
As usual. It's just her dementia.

253
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,320
What's wrong?

254
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,320
Nothing.

255
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm just hungry.

256
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,920
What would you like to eat? I'll cook for you.

257
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,560
So you still care about me.

258
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,240
Why would you say that?

259
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
I used to be the one who cooked for you.

260
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,040
From now on, I'll cook for you.

261
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,920
What would you like to eat?

262
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
I love anything

263
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
that you make.

264
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,040
Really?

265
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,160
I...

266
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,520
You go first.

267
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,280
How about taking a walk

268
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,880
after dinner?

269
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Where to? Is it far?

270
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,680
Just around here.

271
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,400
Okay, I'll go with you.

272
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,400
I have something to tell you.

273
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,360
Let's eat.

274
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,840
I'll try the soup that you made.

275
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,440
(It looks like)

276
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,840
(the safe mode has been activated.)

277
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,600
(Is it going to end like this?)

278
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,280
(Stop trying out anything,)

279
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,920
(will you?)

280
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
(Let things stay the same they are)

281
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,960
(and it's good enough already.)

282
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Why did you bring me here?

283
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,800
Just feel like coming here.

284
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,000
Did you forget this place?

285
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,360

You read this too?

You can have it if you want.

290
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,000
It's the last one in the store.

291
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,840
Okay, I'll take it then.

292

What's wrong?

293
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,320
Nothing.

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,360
although you made a detour,

343
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,880
you believe

344
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,520
that as long as we keep walking,

345
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,400
we'll be able to reach our destination.

346
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,760
Do you still remember?

347
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,280
Gu Chuan.

348
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,400
What's wrong?

349
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,800
Stop reminiscing the past.

350
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,280
Why not?

351
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,200
I just don't want to.

352
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,400
These are

353
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,520
the beautiful memories we had.

354
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,840
Why can't we reminisce about it?

355
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,440
Perhaps, if I try harder,

356
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll be able to...

357
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,400
What?

358
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,720
So the safe mode can be deactivated?

359
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,960
How did you know?

360
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,320
I went to see Qing Zi.

361
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,120
You wanted to see me?

362
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,120
Why did you do that?

363
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,560
What did I do?

364
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,160
Why did you embezzle public funds?

365
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,440
Xiao Xu.

366
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,080
Have you forgotten

367
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,560
why I was put in jail for ten years?

368
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Who told you that?

369
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,160
Did you go to see Xu Guo Xiang?

370
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
Xiao Xu.

371
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
How could you do that?

372
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,040
It's a crime. You'll be jailed.

373
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,680
You're still young.

374
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,360
You can't go down the wrong path!

375
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,600
Look.

376
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,560
Look what our family turned into

377
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
because of my imprisonment.

378
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Dad, don't worry.

379
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
I didn't embezzle public funds.

380
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,280
What is it then?

381
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I took Xu Guo Xiang's dirty money

382
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,360
that can't be known by the public.

383
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,200
He set up a company

384
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,080
in my name

385
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,080
a long time ago

386
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,600
to help him

387
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
launder money from unknown sources.

388
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,520
Since he's

389
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,400
treating me this way,

390
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,920
I'll just go along with it

391
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,200
and cause him unspeakable sufferings.

392
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Karma.

393
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Karma!

394
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,820
(Jiangdong Commercial Bank)

395
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,640
(These are useless now.)

396
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,840
(It won't pose a threat)

397
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,280
(to Xu Guo Xiang anymore.)

398
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,440
Sorry for meeting Qing Zi

399
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,520
without telling you first.

400
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,600
She told you everything?

401
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,440
Yes.

402
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,840
So let's stop trying, all right?

403
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm afraid to hold your hands,

404
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,640
hug you,

405
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
or look you into the eyes

406
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,840
because I'm scared that

407
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,280
anything could happen to you.

408
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,280
I just want you to be safe.

409
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,440
To wait for death?

410
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,680
Qing Zi said

411
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
at least

412
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,640
things can remain as they are for some time.

413
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,320
Maybe during this period of time,

414
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,120
other labs might come up

415
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,480
with new solutions.

416
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,520
Look on the bright side.

417
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,800
Since Qing Zi has told you everything,

418
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm sure you know

419
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,160
it will not last more than a year

420
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
after the safe mode is activated.

421
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,320
I don't want to live like a machine,

422
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,400
being unable to feel happiness or pain,

423
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,960
or have the feeling of loving someone
and being loved.

424
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,240
I don't want to live a life

425
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,680
without hope

426
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,800
and emotion like before.

427
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,080
Also,

428
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,840
the most unbearable thing

429
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,560
is not being able

430
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,000
to love you.

431
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,480
Stop.

432
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,320
Look, just like now.

433
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
I can feel

434
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,360
the warmth of your body.

435
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,840
But I don't feel anything in my heart.

436
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,840
I know. I get it.

437
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,000
But still, I hope

438
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
that I can buy more time

439
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,600
with you.

440
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,720
Not just for me.

441
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
The same goes for your parents,

442
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,240
Mr. Xu,

443
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,200
and our colleagues at Chuan Design Studio.

444
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm sorry.

445
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
I shouldn't have said these to you.

446
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,040
How's your heart now?

447
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,960
It's fine.

448
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,760
Don't worry.

449
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,240
There won't be any electricity discharge anymore.

450
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,620
(Reindeer Group's New Fiscal Year Public
Welfare Plan Press Conference)

451
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,280
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,320
I'm Xu Cheng Ran,

453
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,280
the CEO

454
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,000
of Reindeer Group.

455
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,480
Today, on behalf

456
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,440
of the Reindeer Group,

457
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm announcing

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
the group's public welfare plan
for the new fiscal year

459
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,120
and also

460
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,520
our overall plan for the next 10 years.

461
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,920
We are serious about doing charity.

462
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,400
What I'm about to say today

463
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,720
is a promise to be kept.

464
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,160
We'll walk the talk.

465
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,240
Isn't the plan

466
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,160
only for the new fiscal year?

467
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,480
He'd better not talk drivel.

468
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,240
There are so many journalists

469
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,520
and live broadcasts.

470
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,080
What are we going to do?

471
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,280
It was one of those spur-of-the-moment enthusiasms.

472
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,920
As long as it's not out of line,

473
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,640
I think

474
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,200
it won't hurt. It's fine.

475
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,600
Ten years ago, from Dongjiang Real Estate

476
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,120
to the Reindeer Group today.

477
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,520
We have gone through a lot of things

478
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,440
and many trials and hardships.

479
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,560
Because of your companionship,

480
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,600
Reindeer Group

481
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,160
is able to come this far.

482
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,560
We have always had the idea

483
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,920
of giving back to the society

484
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,920
and repaying society.

485
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,040
Therefore, the group publicly promises

486
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,440
to donate 4 percent

487
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,440
of the group's annual income

488
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,720
to charities every year

489
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
in the future.

490
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,440
That's just nonsense.

491
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,800
It is clearly stated

492
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,760
in the plan as 0.5 percent.

493
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,080
That's right. Quickly stop him.

494
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,880
Cheng Ran.

495
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
You've made a mistake.

496
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,720
It's written in the plan

497
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,120
as 0.5 percent.

498
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,120
No.

499
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,280
It's 4 percent.

500
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,760
The detailed donation plan

501
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,400
is right here.

502
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,360
As the CEO

503
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,160
of the group,

504
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,280
I'll not make a baseless statement.

505
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
Like I said earlier,

506
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:15,688
Reindeer Group

507
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,800
is serious about doing charity.

508
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,080
We'll honor our words

509
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
and walk the talk.

510
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,480
Nice one!

511
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,440
Awesome!

512
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,440
We have done

513
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,080
all the measurements here.

514
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,360
For buildings by the lake,

515
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,480
the first thing to consider

516
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,760
is the anti-corrosion problem.

517
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,040
The climate around here

518
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,880
is always humid.

519
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,880
It's a big challenge

520
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,320
when it comes to the wall and the roof.

521
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,800
So we must follow

522
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,560
the design plan strictly.

523
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,040
You cannot change the materials.

524
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,920
All right.

525
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,080
Get out of the way!

526
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,144
Jiang Xiao Ning!

527
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,160
Are you all right?

528
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,320
Help!

529
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,160
How is she?

530
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,360
Is she all right?

531
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
- Call the ambulance!
- What do we do?

532
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,480
Hurry!

533
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,240
All right.

534
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,860
(Outpatient)

535
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,440
Cheng Dong.

536
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Boss, you're here.

537
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,640
Where's Jiang Xiao Ning? How is she?

538
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,440
It was too dangerous just now.

539
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,640
Jiang Xiao Ning pushed me away,

540
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,240
but...

541
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,640
She...

542
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,960

559
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,600
(Hi, Mr. Gu.)

560
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,040
(How can I help you?)

561
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,400
Do you have knowledge about the safe mode?

562
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,600
Yes.

563
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,600
Is there any way

564
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
to exit Safe Mode

565
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,040
and return to Normal Mode?

566
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,160
By restoring the initial settings,

567
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,240
the mechanical heart

568
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,200
can be reset to the normal mode.

569
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,440
But that is only a change

570
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,240
in the software.

571
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
The hardware problem still exists.

572
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
In simpler words?

573
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,240
In other words,

574
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,560
the safe mode allows you

575
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,960
to live for another year.

576
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,800
The normal mode

577
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,040
may only last you a month.

578
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,040
(In short, your remaining time)

579
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,040
(will be greatly shortened.)

580
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,120
Okay.

581
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,520
Help me restore to Normal Mode.

582
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,720
(Mr. Gu.)

583
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,920
(Are you sure you want to do that?)

584
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,960
Was my explanation

585
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,720
not clear earlier?

586
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,960
Do you need me

587
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
to repeat it for you?

588
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,480
Although the time left

589
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,400
will be shortened,

590
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,080
at least, I won't be like how I am now.

591
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,440
My current situation

592
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,560
is not different from being dead.

This charity project

598
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,560
is good for the image

599
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,400
of the group.

600
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,880
But this investment ratio

601
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,720
is too big, don't you think?

602
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,520
So much money is squandered

603
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,199
every year.

604
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,239
Tell me.

605
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,960
What will

606
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
the shareholders think?

607
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,639
You should consider

608
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,560
our feelings!

609
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,440
I think

610
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,080
I have fully considered

611
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,679
the feelings of all the directors.

612
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,440
I've taken a stand on this

613
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,360
at the press conference.

614
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,679
If you can accept it,

615
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,600
I'll stay

616
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
to clean up your mess.

617
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,440
If not,

618
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,840
you can dismiss me with immediate effect

619
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,880
and declare that

620
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
the last press conference was invalid.

621
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
I'll no longer

622
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,040
be the CEO of this company.

623
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,840

what you have done carefully.

627
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,000
The previous charitable donations

628
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,520
were all fake.

629

Everything I do

632

is to make atonement for you.

you were so willful.

Yes.

654
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,560
The most willful thing I have done

655
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,920
is pursuing you.

656
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
The more you play hard to get,

657
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
the more intense I get

658
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,960
and I just had to marry you.

659
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
What now? Do you regret it?

660
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,480
I didn't say that.

661
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,600
What do you think

662
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,760
of your husband now?

663
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,080
Well.

664
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,880
I never thought

665
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
you would have such cool ideas.

666
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,920
Of course. What did you expect?

667
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Your husband has great fundamental values.

668
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,400
Look at you. Getting all smug.

669
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,640
Are you starting to think

670
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,560
that I'm the real catch?

671
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,520
Almost.

672
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,240
Look.

673
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,800
You can never

674
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,280
escape from me.

675
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,560
The word "escape"

676
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,440
doesn't exist in my dictionary.

677
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
Here. Take a seat.

678
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm perfectly fine.

679
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,640
If so,

680
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,440
how about some revision?

681
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,120
What's wrong?

682
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,600
Nothing.

683
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,720
Just feeling a little nervous.

684
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,200
The maturity examination

685
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,320
is too important to me.

686
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,040
I must get a degree

687
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
in order to become a designer.

688
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,120
I don't have a chance to take a makeup examination.

689
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,600
The thought of it scares me

690
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,840
and it makes me nervous.

691
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,760
I didn't get to make any preparations

692
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,080
while I was in the hospital.

693
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,320
My mind is totally blank now.

694
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,240
Don't get nervous.

695
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,240
Just relax and answer the questions.

696
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
You'll be fine.

697
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,720
It's not as easy as that.

698
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,080
How about this?

699
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,720
To help relieve your stress and anxiety,

700
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,360
I can fulfill one wish for you.

701
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,200
Any wish?

702
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,600
Any wish.

703
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,480
It's a deal?

704
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,360
It's a deal.

705
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,200
It's getting late.

706
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,960
Why don't you stay here tonight?

707
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,360
It's close to the place where you're
having the exam.

708
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,120
I can drive you there tomorrow.

709
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,720
Really?

710
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,560
Look.

711
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
Although you're in the safe mode now,

712
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,640
you still care about me.

713
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,200
From what I see,

714
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,160
this is just a logical problem,

715
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,800
not an emotional problem.

716
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,920
I don't care.

717
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,280
Be it logical or emotional,

718
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,000
as long as you care about me,

719
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,840
that will make me happy.

720
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,440
All right. Quickly do your revision.

721
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,840

Mr. Gu, have you read everything?
