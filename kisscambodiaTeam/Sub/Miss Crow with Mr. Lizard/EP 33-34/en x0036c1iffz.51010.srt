=Episode 33=

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
You've started building

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,360
your house of love together already?

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,240
Mr. Xu, what are you doing here?

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
You seem to have a lot of free time.

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,600
There are some bricks over there.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,680
Help us move them.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,880
So cold?

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,840
If it weren't for my big mouth,

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,120
how can you two

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,000
be this lovey-dovey right now?

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,560
Thank you.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,759
What are you doing here, Mr. Xu?

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,120
Chuan.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,280
Something came up at the studio.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,720
The landmark project proposal

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
needs to be amended.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,560
Okay.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,480
I'll head to the office after I'm done here.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,240
Actually, no need.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,840
I found someone and got it done already.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,680
Who?

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,840
Su Man Lin.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
Sister Man Lin's back?

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,320
You two finally

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
got back together.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,080
I didn't want others

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
to bother you.

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,160
So I asked her

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
to come back to help out.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,680
Helped you buy

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
some precious time together.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,720
The amendments

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
have been sent to your email.

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Take a look at night when you have time.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
If you have time,

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,680
drop by the office tomorrow.

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,680
After all,

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,720
you're the lead designer on that project.

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,880
You can't not care.

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,840
Mr. Xu.

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
If you've already solved the problem,

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
why bother coming here?

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,160
You could have just called.

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm here to see Xiao Ning, alright?

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,040
Of course. Thanks, Mr. Xu.

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,880
I'm here to drop something off for you.

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,720
Someone

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,640
forced me to lie to you to make you sign.

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,640
His will.

70
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,440
Take a look.

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Don't get angry and don't quarrel.

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,760
A will?

73
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,480
Don't do anything like this again, okay?

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,440
I don't need you to

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
make all these plans for me.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,600
I just want you

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,880
to include me in your future plans.

78
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Of course you're in

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,360
my future plans.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,760
Rules are rules.

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,120
Not even occasionally?

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
No.

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,840
I need to think for

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,080
your health.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Just once.

86
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,640
No.

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,080
Let's cuddle.

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,840
Good morning.

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
Didn't I tell you

90
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,000
to not come pick me up anymore?

91
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,120
Why?

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,560
How can I let my girlfriend

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,920
drive me around every day?

94
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
Aside from being your girlfriend,

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
I'm also your employee,

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,320
your assistant.

97
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,040
Driving is my job.

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,400
To make me have no qualms

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,200
about earning money,

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,040
please order me around

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
as much as you can.

102
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,840
This way,

103
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,680
if I get paid less,

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,920
I can bad-mouth you.

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's walk to work today.

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,160
Can you?

107
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,200
Not every day.

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
Just today.

109
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,440
What do you mean?

110
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,280
Starting tomorrow,

111
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,880
if there are no special circumstances,

112
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,840
I don't plan on going back to work.

113
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,200
I want to spend more time

114
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
on other things.

115
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,080
Like spending time with my parents,

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
spending time with you.

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,880
Sure.

118
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Then what about the studio?

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,320
You're the soul of the studio.

120
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
You can't keep making

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
Mr. Xu act on your behalf.

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
Then it won't be "Chuan Design Studio".

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,320
Then I can change it into "Ran Design Studio".

124
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,160
These things

125
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
aren't important to me anymore.

126
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
I've been working so hard for ten years.

127
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,680
It's not unreasonable

128
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,720
to take a break.

129
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,840
Okay.

130
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,000
Then I'll go with you.

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Let's go.

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
But the person I just said

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
who doesn't have to work

134
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,360
is me.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,280
You still have to go to work.

136
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
Do I really?

137
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Of course.

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You don't like working?

139
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,000
I do. A lot.

140
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
That's it.

141
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Who's going to pay my bills if you don't work?

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Everyone,

143
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,280
listen up.

144
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,640
Mr. Xu just informed me

145
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
Mr. Gu is coming back to the studio today.

146
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
Everybody, get to work.

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,800
Hurry.

148
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Move.

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,840
That's so great.

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,120
I'm having a hard time making a decision.

151
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
What are you doing? Get to work.

152
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,760
Boss is back.

153
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
What are you scared of?

154
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,760
Xiao Ning must be

155
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,480
coming back with him.

156
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,640
How can you be so sure?

157
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,800
Maybe the negotiation went wrong

158
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,720
and they went their separate ways.

159
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
Shut your mouth.

160
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,000
Good morning.

161
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,040
Oh my gosh.

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
I thought it was Boss who came back.

163
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,080
So it's you, Xiao Ning.

164
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,160
Should be Mrs. Boss.

165
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,120
Xiao Ning,

166
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,680
you're finally back.

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,480
It was so boring

168
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,960
without you here.

169
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,320
As long as you're here,

170
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,560
we don't have to look at

171
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
Mr. Gu's ghostly face every day.

172
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
If it weren't...

173
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,600
If it weren't for

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,560
my infinite adoration

175
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
and admiration for Mr. Gu,

176
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
he's literally the beacon that lights the way
in my life.

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,400
I've always been wondering

178
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,240
how could a person

179
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,400
be this super-duper exceptional.

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm just...

181
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,440
Hi, Mr. Gu.

182
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,320
Morning.

183
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,800
Morning.

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,600
Looks pretty good.

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
It can be sent off right away

186
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,200
after I make some amendments.

187
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
In other words,

188
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
my job here is done.

189
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,200
To be honest,

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm really happy to be able to have

191
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,120
this opportunity to make things up.

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,600
You're ready to go to your new job?

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,520
Thank you for giving me

194
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,360
this chance to make up for my mistakes.

195
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,480
And thank you for

196
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
sending my resume

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
to that company overseas.

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,200
They're willing to hire you

199
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,000
because you have the right qualifications.

200
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080
A new company, a new environment,

201
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,240
a new life.

202
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
I hope I can also have a new beginning.

203
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
Good luck.

204
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm going to

205
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,040
have dinner with Jiang Xiao Ning tonight.

206
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,720
Gu Chuan. Take care of yourself.

207
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,360
You don't look so well.

208
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,040
Thank you.

209
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
It was me who brought you to this company.

210
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,679
Who would have thought

211
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
you'd be the one to send me off today.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,919
Sister Man Lin.

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,520
Thank you so much.

214
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
You've always been my role model

215
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
and you've taught me so much.

216
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
I've taught you so much,

217
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,760
but I've failed myself.

218
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,080
I used to think

219
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,280
the reason Gu Chuan didn't like me

220
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,720
is that I wasn't outstanding enough,

221
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,760
not good enough for him.

222
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
So I kept trying harder and harder.

223
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
But to what end?

224
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
You know how things went.

225
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
I still lost to you.

226
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't say that.

227
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,000
You're brilliant.

228
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,560
One day, I hope you can

229
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
meet someone

230
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
who can make you happy

231
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,680
even during your saddest moments.

232
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,720
Now I know

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,400
why he fell for you.

234
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,040
You're like those

235
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,000
female leads in dramas.

236
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,600
Although you were

237
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
a little annoying in the beginning,

238
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,760
as time goes on,

239
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,440
you can't really get people to dislike you.

240
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,160
This is probably your charm.

241
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,440
This is the first time I've heard you compliment me.

242
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,240
You're indeed

243
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,640
more mature than when

244
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
you first came to the studio.

245
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,560
So that's why I keep

246
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
wanting to thank you.

247
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
It's me who should thank you.

248
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,720
Why?

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,360
If you didn't come into the picture,

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
I would've stayed by Gu Chuan's side

251
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
like I've always done.

252
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,720
Because I believed that

253
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,320
as long as I waited for him,

254
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
he'd be mine eventually.

255
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,400
But you made me realize that

256
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
no matter how hard I tried,

257
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
how long I waited,

258
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,000
the results would be the same.

259
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,680
He wouldn't fall for me.

260
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
You'll meet someone who you like

261
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,200
and likes you back for sure.

262
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,480
Who knows. I'll just let it be.

263
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,800
But I came here today

264
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,600
to tell you something.

265
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
Jiang Xiang Ning,

266
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,360
I wish you happiness.

267
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
Sister Man Lin, thank you.

268
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
How many bookings have you gotten tonight?

269
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
I haven't gotten any yet.

270
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,480
I have a feeling I'm going to
get bookings tonight.

271
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,360
At least one.

272
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,640
Isn't it hard for a girl like you

273
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,840
to be a designated driver?

274
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,080
It's okay. As long as you get used to it.

275
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,760
Still not here.

276
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,800
Right.

277
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm hungry.

278
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,960
Hungry.

279
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,000
You guys take your time.

280
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,240
I've already paid the bill.

281
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Once Xiao Ning gets here,

282
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,880
we'll leave first.

283
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,720
Mr. Gu, why are you in such a rush?

284
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,480
Once Xiao Ning gets here,

285
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,520
you should have something to eat before leaving.

286
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,240
Exactly.

287
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,400
Sorry, everyone.

288
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,320
I'm late.

289
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,880
Xiao Ning, come on.

290
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,880
Xiao Ning, we've been waiting for you.

291
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,720
We couldn't start without you.

292
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,920
Now that everyone's here,

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,680
let's...

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,040
let's drink to

296
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
Boss and Xiao Ning's

297
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,760
sweet comeback.

298
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,520
Thank you.

299
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,840
Cheers. Thank you.

300
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,120
Come on, give it to me.

301
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
I have to drink to that.

302
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,200
You can't drink.

303
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
This drink is to everyone.

304
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,520
Thank you for all your hard work these years.

305
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,880
Thank you.

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,320
Thank you, Boss.

307
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,040
Bottoms up.

308
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,120
Alright.

309
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,200
I'll leave with Xiao Ning first.

310
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,640
Her exam is coming up.

311
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I have to tutor her.

312
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,400
You're tutoring her personally?

313
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,360
Yes.

314
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,400
We'll leave first then.

315
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,720
Okay.

316
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
Bye, Boss.

317
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
You guys take your time. Enjoy.

318
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,360
Bye-bye, Xiao Ning.

319
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,160
Bye-bye.

320
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,360
Bye-bye.

321
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,680
Why do I feel like

322
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,400
Boss is acting weird today?

323
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,440
I always thought Boss

324
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,880
would end up with Su Man Lin.

325
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,600
I didn't expect it to be Jiang Xiao Ning.

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,680
Are you that slow?

327
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,040
I knew a long time ago.

328
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,480
Mainly because neither of them said anything,

329
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,800
so I couldn't really gossip about it.

330
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
Being at the company for so long,

331
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,200
I've witnessed enough public displays
of affection.

332
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,320
When will I finally meet

333
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,360
my Prince Charming?

334
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,160
What are you looking at?

335
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,160
Cheng Dong.

336
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
What? I can't?

337
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,040
No.

338
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,320
You can't look at him.

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,080
Come with me.

340
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,800
Hurry.

341
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,160
I'm eating.

342
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,320
Where to?

343
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,680
Jia Jia, could you save some face

344
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,040
for me in front of our co-workers?

345
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
What's wrong with me looking at handsome guys?

346
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,600
You can't.

347
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,000
Fine. Then tell me

348
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
why looking at Cheng Dong is wrong.

349
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,720
Look, you're

350
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,520
a single lady.

351
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,240
Ogling like that

352
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,960
isn't good for your image.

353
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,480
Wang Kai, you're a chicken.

354
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
How am I chicken?

355
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,520
In every way.

356
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,800
You coward.

357
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,680
You like me.

358
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
Why can't you just say that directly?

359
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,080
Always beating around the bush.

360
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,080
Aren't you tired?

361
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,920
There are so many people at the office.

362
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,640
Look at Jiang Xiao Ning.

363
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,480
She made a public confession.

364
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,600
What are you afraid of?

365
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Do you like me or not?

366
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,600
I...

367
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,600
Say it.

368
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,800
I...

369
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Are you telling me or not?

370
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,720
Ouch.

371
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
I like you.

372
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,560
Then kiss me.

373
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,120
No.

374
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,400
Wang Kai.

375
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,040
No, no, no.

376
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,080
The timing isn't right.

377
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,880
This setting isn't very fitting.

378
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,080
But can you feel

379
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,760
my burning heart?

380
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
Feel my heartbeat.

381
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,280
Feel it.

382
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,160
Okay, I got it.

383
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
I know you felt it.

384
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,600
Let's go eat.

385
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,320
I didn't feel it.

386
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,920
Let's go eat.

387
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,560
Let's go eat, okay?

388
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
Let's go eat. Eat.

389
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,480
This setting is really not right.

390
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,880
Really couldn't do it.

391
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,560
No.

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,640
I'm serious.

393
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,520
Before the tutoring session,

394
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,320
let's deal with

395
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,240
this first.

396
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,160
Xu Cheng Ran lied to me.

397
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,960
I didn't take a look at these carefully
before signing them.

398
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
I'll ask our legal department

399
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,400
to take a look at it

400
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,080
to see how we can

401
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,120
rescind these agreements.

402
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,840
Back then, I was scared,

403
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,920
in case...

404
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,000
There is no "in case".

405
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,760
Starting now,

406
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
you just need to think about

407
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,760
how you're going to live happily every day.

408
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
From now on, each of your days

409
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,960
must have me in them.

410
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,600
Also,

411
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,240
don't work too hard.

412
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,480
Don't do any housework either.

413
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,000
I got it.

414
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Get to studying.

415
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,120
Do you agree with what I said?

416
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,920
I do.

417
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,839
Okay. Teacher.

418
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,200
You can start your lesson.

419
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,720
First, I have a question for you.

420
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,920
The minimum clearance of the upper and

421
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,160
lower aisles of a stairs landing

422
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
is 2 meters.

423
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:37,960
The minimum

424
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,480
headroom clearance for stairs is 2.2 meters.

425
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Was that statement

426
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,160
correct or incorrect?

427
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,400
Correct.

428
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,920
Correct?

429
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,960
Incorrect?

430
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,600
Incorrect?

431
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,080
Incorrect.

432
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,400
Are you just randomly guessing?

433
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,320
I know the answer.

434
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,760
You asked the question so suddenly,

435
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,680
so I doubted myself.

436
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Ask another question.

437
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,760
Think carefully

438
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,320
about the question I just asked you.

439
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,200
Have you read this section?

440
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,360
This section.

441
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,480
I finished the entire book.

442
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,040
How about this?

443
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,720
Not yet.

444
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Looks like you're in a bad mood.

445
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,200
Did you ask me to come drink with you?

446
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Not to drink.

447
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,560
Something better.

448
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,280
You're really something.

449
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,400
The good things you talk about

450
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,120
never end up happening.

451
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,080
You don't need to invest anything this time.

452
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,720
Just need some physical strength.

453
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,960
Then tell me.

454
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,320
The thing is...

455
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,840
some money came into my branch.

456
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,240
I want to move this money

457
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,080
to Zhi Mu Design's account.

458
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,360
Help me find a way

459
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,680
to cash it out.

460
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,080
I'll give you 20 percent afterwards.

461
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,720
How much?

462
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,760
Thirty million.

463
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,880
That much?

464
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,440
Whose is it?

465
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,920
It's Xu Guo Xiang's for now,

466
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,600
but it'll be mine later.

467
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,720
You dare touch his money?

468
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,040
Aren't you scared he's going to kill you?

469
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,520
Zheng, relax.

470
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,600
I have something on him.

471
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,640
He wouldn't dare to touch me.

472
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,320
Plus, I've done

473
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,880
so much for him over the years.

474
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,640
If there were problems, I would've
gone to jail already.

475
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,280
I deserve this money.

476
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,480
Don't you worry.

477
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,320
I'll take responsibility if something
were to happen.

478
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,760
Thirty percent should be enough, right?

479
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,080
Alright, I'll do it.

480
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,240
But I'm telling you right now,

481
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,680
if something were to happen, you would
have to deal with it.

482
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't worry.

483
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,480
Looking forward to working with you again.

484
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,880
Director Xu.

485
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,480
Director Xu.

486
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,000
Xiao Xu. Why is it taking so long?

487
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,560
It has been more than a week already.

488
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,480
How come the money still hasn't been cashed out?

489
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Didn't you ask me to be more careful?

490
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,560
I'm being thorough.

491
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
Don't want to get caught.

492
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,960
No matter how thorough you're being,
it should've been done already.

493
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,400
It didn't take this long last time.

494
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,800
Am I doing it or are you?

495
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,080
You can do it then.

496
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,320
Director Xu.

497
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,480
Director Xu. It's still going to take a few more days.

498
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,840
Xiao Xu.

499
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,440
Although we're not related by blood,

500
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
we've been living together for more than ten years.

501
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,800
You should know that

502
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,440
I think of you as my own son.

503
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Of course, I do.

504
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,120
You've always been so good to me.

505
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,760
So, think about it.

506
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,120
Why do I ask you to transfer

507
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,200
that much money?

508
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,600
It's because I trust you.

509
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,960
Xiao Xu.

510
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
You can't let me down.

511
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,120
I won't, Director Xu.

512
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,640
I won't let you down.

513
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
You've treated me so well.

514
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,360
That's good.

515
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,200
That's good.

516
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,960
Go on.

517
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,120
This isn't normal.

518
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,840
I think something has been

519
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,080
going on with this kid as well.

520
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,160
Keep an eye on him.

521
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,440
Find out what's going on.

522
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
Okay, right away.

523
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,200
Xiao Mi, is Xu Cheng Ran in?

524
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,360
Yes.

525
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,640
He has been

526
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,560
working overtime for several nights.

527
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,720
I know.

528
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,760
I'm going to go in to see him.

529
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,840
How about I give him a heads-up first?

530
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,920
That's alright.

531
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,960
Once he's done with work,

532
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,360
we'll go home together.

533
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,200
You've worked hard.

534
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,160
Thank you.

535
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,960
Wifey.

536
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,400
What are you doing here?

537
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
Wifey brought Hubby food.

538
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,880
Is that a problem?

539
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,480
Wifey.

540
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,560
I thought you didn't want anyone

541
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,080
to know about our relationship.

542
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,800
You're not afraid that someone will see us?

543
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,600
We're official and legal.

544
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,640
What's there to be scared of?

545
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,720
But before, you...

546
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,520
No more "but"s.

547
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,800
From today on,

548
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,320
I want to

549
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,320
be with you openly.

550
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,080
You've finally come around.

551
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,400
So cute.

552
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,680
Xu Cheng Ran.

553
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm sorry.

554
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
I didn't want you to make

555
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,040
our relationship public

556
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,360
because I was overthinking everything,

557
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,840
not because you're not worthwhile.

558
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,000
Seeing Gu Chuan and Jiang Xiao Ning

559
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
getting back together

560
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
made me think that

561
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,840
I should cherish

562
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,520
every single day I get to spend with you.

563
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,600
Wifey is right.

564
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,080
You should cherish me.

565
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
Let's go home right now.

566
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,920
So you could make it up to me.

567
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,520
What's wrong with you?

568
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
I just gave you an inch

569
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
and now you want to take a mile?

570
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,680
Oh, right. Wifey.

571
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,600
I want you to come to a press conference

572
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,720
being held in a few days.

573
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,160
No, I'm just

574
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,080
a department manager.

575
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,320
What manager?

576
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,560
You're my wife.

577
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,520
You have to come.

578
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,600
I don't want you to miss

579
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,960
your husband's shining moment.

580
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,760
Get back to work.

581
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,200
Have it while it's hot.

582
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,280
I'm leaving.

583
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,360
What work?

584
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
Didn't I say

585
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,200
we're going home and you're making things up to me?

586
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,600
Let's go.

587
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,960
(Chairman's Office)

588
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,760
No need to work overtime today.

589
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,880
Go home early, everyone.

590
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,520
My wife came to pick me up.

591
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,440
I'm leaving now.

592
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,800
See you all tomorrow.

593
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,080
Nice going, Xu Cheng Ran.

594
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,080
So many female employees here.

595
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,640
All wearing short skirts.

596
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,800
It smells so good, Wifey.

597
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,720
What did you make?

598
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,420
(Indoor Plant Decor)

599
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,440
Isn't there a lot to do?

600
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,680
What are we doing at a nursery?

601
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,720
To buy some

602
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,240
flowers for the yard.

603
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,080
Then this is not a part of

604
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,080
architectural design.

605
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,560
It's landscape design.

606
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,160
These are pretty nice.

607
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,920
(Everything seems the same.)

608
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,960
(Yet, everything seems different.)

609
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
(I'm standing right next to him,)

610
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,920
(but I have to distance myself from him at all times.)

611
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,600
(Our hearts)

612
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,480
(have never been this closer together.)

613
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,640
(But like he said,)

614
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,720
(our future)

615
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,800
(has never been so unclear)

616
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
(and uncertain.)

617
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,520
(Although I don't know)

618
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
(how we can keep going,)

619
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,080
(as long as I'm by his side,)

620
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,760
(no matter in what way,)

621
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,640
(I'll feel at ease.)

622
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,560
Do you think

623
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
Grandma will like this?

624
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,200
She will.

625
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
What were you thinking?

626
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,040
Nothing.

627
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,720
I was wondering whether we have to buy a bunch?

628
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,040
Of course.

629
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,520
How will we bring everything back?

630
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,520
They do delivery.

631
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,920
Let's keep looking.

632
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,440
We have a pretty wide

633
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,080
variety of plants.

634
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,440
For example, these flamingo flowers over here

635
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,720
imply the blossoming of fortune.

636
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,720
You could consider buying several.

637
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,480
I've already taken out my share.

638
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,720
The rest

639
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
has been transferred to your account.

640
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,400
I've received it, Zheng.

641
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Thanks.

642
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,920
Tomorrow, I'll be

643
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,840
away for a while.

644
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,480
I understand.

645
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,240
It's the right move to stay away for a while.

646
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,240
Come back when it's clear.

647
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,720
You're not leaving?

648
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,880
Why would I leave?

649
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,280
I have nothing to be afraid of.

650
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Here. Enjoy your trip.

651
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,320
I've read the new proposal.

652
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,520
It's great. I'm very satisfied with it.

653
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,520
As long as all the board members are satisfied.

654
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,160
Actually,

655
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,640
we're not against this plan.

656
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,720
As long as the expenditures are reasonable,

657
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,000
there's nothing else wrong with it, right?

658
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,720
You're right.

659
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,240
The current spending plan

660
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,040
was revised

661
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,280
according to the suggestions put forward

662
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,560
by the board members at the last meeting.

663
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,400
I promise to implement it to a tee.

664
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,920
Good. Great.

665
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,160
Great.

666
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Sure enough, Cheng Ran

667
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,000
is becoming more and more mature.

668
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,720
Like father, like son.

669
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
We're all very pleased that

670
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,080
you're able to take over so soon.

671
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
From now on,

672
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,080
the group is in your hands.

673
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
I'll do my very best.

674
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,120
Oh, right.

675
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,000
There will be a press conference in a few days.

676
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
I invited many journalist friends

677
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
to help promote us.

678
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,240
It'll also be live-streamed on the Internet.

679
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,760
This will be a great opportunity

680
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
to build our company's image.

681
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,120
I hope all the board members

682
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,120
can attend.

683
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,400
Such a great opportunity.

684
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,800
We've got to attend, right?

685
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,320
Exactly.

686
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,560
Alright.

687
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,080
Let me summarize.

688
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,080
We'll all go back you up.

689
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,440
How's that?

690
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,960
Alright?

691
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,840
Sure.

692
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,560
Then, thank you all

693
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,000
in advance.

694
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,600
Okay.

695
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,600
The time for the younger generation has come.

696
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,400
Young and promising indeed.

697
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,520
Yes.

698
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,680
Let me.

699
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,680
Just sit here.

700
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,760
Don't do anything.

701
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,680
Don't touch anything.

702
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Leave everything to me.

703
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

704
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,680
Let me do it.

705
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,320
I said let me...

706
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,680
Gu Chuan.

707
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,880
Gu Chuan.

708
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,920
What's wrong?

709
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,960
Help me to the charging room.

710
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,640
Okay.

711
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,320
Come on. Be careful.

712
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,200
Careful.

713
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,480
How do you feel?

714
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,880
Be careful.

715
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Charging.

716
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,400
Charging interrupted.

717
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,920
What's happening?

718
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,200
Why is it happening?

719
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Charging.

720
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,440
Charging interrupted.

721
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,040
Gu Chuan.

722
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,320
Gu Chuan. Wake up. Gu Chuan.

723
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,560
Don't do this to me.

724
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,920
Gu Chuan.

725
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,400
Gu Chuan. Wake up. Gu Chuan.

726
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
Gu Chuan. You're going to be okay. Gu Chuan.

727
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,680
Gu Chuan.

728
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,800
Charge. Gu Chuan.

729
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,040
Gu Chuan. You'll be okay.

730
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,040
It'll be okay. Gu Chuan.

731
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,840
Charge.

732
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,720
Charge.

733
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,720
Charge.

734
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,400
Charge.

735
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,000
Charging.

736
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,280
You almost scared me to death, Gu Chuan.

737
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,560
I thought you were leaving

738
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,040
me by myself again.

739
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,080
I'm fine. Stop crying.

740
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm not crying.

741
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,400
Safe Mode?

742
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,480
Yes. This way, the mechanical heart

743
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,960
will work at minimum capacity,

744
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,280
only maintaining the most basic functions.

745
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,720
But,

746
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,720
it will affect the blood flow.

747
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,880
For example,

748
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,520
it won't

749
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
respond to

750
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,400
human emotions.

751
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,560
The person

752
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,160
will become kind of dull and slow.

753
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,800
But at least,

754
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,200
it'll allow the person to live a little longer.

755
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,920
Wait.

756
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,560
Why do you have to

757
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,040
have this Safe Mode?

758
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,840
To prolong one's life.

759
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,800
This way, at least you'll have enough time

760
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
to say goodbye to this world.

761
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,400
You won't leave the world suddenly.

762
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,120
In other words,

763
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,760
if I'm in the Safe Mode,

764
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
that means it's reminding me that

765
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,160
I don't have much time left?

766
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,480
Right.

767
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,480
You can think of it that way.

768
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,520
This...

769
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,800
You're up.

770
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
Why are you in a daze?

771
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,880
Let's eat.

772
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,480
Do you remember

773
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,200
the first time I cooked for you?

774
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,480
I do.

775
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Back then, I hoped

776
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,080
you could live a warmer and more emotional life.

777
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,760
What about now?

778
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,000
Now,

779
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,120
I want you to be healthy and happy.

780
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,840
I will.

781
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
Eat while it's still hot.

782
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,080
How is it?

783
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:00,960
It's good.

784
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,159
Then have some more.

Nothing.

790

I just like looking at you.

791
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,360

Director Xu.

807
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,680
Director Xu, you asked for me?

808
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,400
Tang Xu.

809
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,000
You dare to touch my money?

810
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,800
Do you have a death wish?

811
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,480
Or do you think I'm getting old?

812
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,600
All these years,

813
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,920
I think I've done a lot for you.

814
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,080
Even if the work I've done doesn't get recognized,

815
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,240
the time and effort I put in cannot be denied.

816
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,520
So I think

817
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,440
I deserve that money.

818
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,680
Tang Xu, so you're saying that

819
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,760
you're keeping this money

820
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,480
no matter what?

821
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,920
Why? Can't I?

822
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Do you think you should?

823
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,360
Tang Xu.

824
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,480
What you've said is all bollocks.

825
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,640
I've supported you for so many years and

826
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,760
treated you like my own son.

827
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,120
This is how you repay me?

828
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
Don't bother with the pretty words.

829
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,920
Who are you trying to fool?

830
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,320
Answer me.

831
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,400
Will you let Xu Cheng Ran

832
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,800
do something illegal with you?

833
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,400
If what you've said is true,

834
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,320
the two of us are the same to you.

835
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,840
Fine.

836
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,440
I'll transfer the money to him right now.

837
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,200
Let him be your pawn

838
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,800
for once.

839
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,120
You really are an ingrate.

840
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,920
Ungrateful bastard.

841
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,480
Tang Xu, I'm telling you.

842
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,520
Don't play tricks with me.

843
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
Give me back the money right now.

844
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,960
Otherwise, not only will I not spare you,

845
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,560
I won't spare Tang Zheng Cheng either.

846
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,200
If you dare to lay a finger on him,

847
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,480
I'll make sure all the evidence

848
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
I have on you get out.

849
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
You dare to challenge me?

850
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,160
Anyway, I'll drag you down with me.

851
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,000
I know too much about you.

852
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,720
Tang Xu.

853
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,200
If I can be so easily

854
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,080
manipulated by you,

855
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,240
I should get rid of my last name, Xu.

856
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,800
Go check as you wish.

857
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,080
But I can

858
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,960
tell you right now that

859
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,920
the only person who will be

860
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,320
found guilty is you.

861
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,520
You have three days

862
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
to give me back my money

863
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
and get lost.

864
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,960
(Hello.)

865
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,560
(Are you Dr. Peer's assistant,)

866
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,720
(Miss Qing Zi?)

867
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,200
(There is something very important that)

868
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,000
(I'd like to discuss with you.)

869
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,920
(I look forward to hearing back from you.)

870
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,280
(If you could give me your contact details,)

871
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,200
(I would appreciate it. Jiang Xiao Ning.)

872
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,720
Xiao Ning.

873
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,040
Go downstairs and

874
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,160
buy tomorrow's breakfast.

875
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,760
Where is she?

876
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,400
Mom.

877
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,720
What's going on with her?

878
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,800
What's she doing cooped up

879
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,880
in her room?

880
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,760
Studying.

881
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,720
Studying?

882
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,840
Ning Ning.

883
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,320
Studying hard.

884
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,200
Okay.

885
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,840
(Sorry, I just saw your email.)

886
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,600
(Here is my contact details...)

887
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,160
Hello?

888
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,960
I'm Gu Chuan's girlfriend.

889
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,840
Sorry to contact you out of the blue.

890
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,920
I have something very important

891
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,240
I'd like to ask you about face-to-face.

892
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,680
I'm in Shanghai for a business trip.

893
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,000
You can come meet me.

894
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,760
You're on a business trip in Shanghai?

895
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,680
Could I go meet you?

896
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,520
Okay, great.

897
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Thank you.

898
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,840
(Gu Chuan.)

899
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,800
(I know you won't give up on me.)

900
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,920
(I won't give up on you either.)

901
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,200
Hello, Boss.

902
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:18,920
Hello.

903
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,160
I'd like to take some time off.

904
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,080
Why?

905
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,000
I want to take Grandma

906
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,440
to get a thorough check-up.

907
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,560
Need to be

908
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,640
vigilant at all times when it comes to seniors.

909
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,520
Grandma's got more and more

910
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,520
episodes of memory loss recently.

911
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,160
Aunty has a bad back, so she can't go.

912
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,480
I'll go with you.

913
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,480
No, that's okay.

914
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,640
It's only a check-up.

915
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,440
Alright.

916
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,280
If you need anything,

917
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,560
feel free to let me know.

918
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,840
Okay. Thanks, Boss.

919
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,280
You're still calling me "Boss"?

920
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,480
Thanks, my boyfriend.

921
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,920
Hello. Are you Qing Zi?

922
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,080
You must be Miss Jiang.

923
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,960
Please have a seat.

924
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,920
Miss Jiang came by

925
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,880
to ask me

926
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,440
about the mechanical heart, right?

927
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,320
Yes.

928
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,880
I did some research online.

929
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,040
I want to know

930
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,320
what kind of problem

931
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,000
is Gu Chuan's mechanical heart having.

932
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,720
I found these symptoms,

933
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,200
but they don't seem to be the same.

934
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,480
So I want...

935
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,560
Stop looking.

936
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
Mr. Gu's problem

937
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,200
is rare,

938
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,480
not common.

939
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Even when Dr. Peer

940
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,640
was alive,

941
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,040
he couldn't solve the problem.

942
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,960
What you can find on the Internet

943
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,360
is even less useful.

944
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,080
Is there another way?

945
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,000
Can't it be replaced with a biological heart?

946
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,680
Mr. Gu has been using

947
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,880
a mechanical heart for ten years.

948
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,080
If he were to switch to

949
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,000
a biological heart now,

950
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,520
his survival rate will be very low.
