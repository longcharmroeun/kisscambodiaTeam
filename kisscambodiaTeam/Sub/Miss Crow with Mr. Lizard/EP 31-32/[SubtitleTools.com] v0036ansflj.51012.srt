00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,720
Here.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,440
Yan Yan, something happened to Gu Chuan!

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,520
You're awake.

24
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
Why did you bring her here?

25
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,520
I've told her everything.

26
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,040
You swore

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,160
you wouldn't tell anyone.

28
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,800
Yes.

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,760
I did say

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,720
that if I were to tell anyone,

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
I would be struck by lightning.

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,760
But Yan Yan isn't anyone.

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,000
She's my wife.

34
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Right?

35
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,640
Don't worry.

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
I won't tell anyone.

37
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,600
Also,

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
I wanted to visit you as well.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,040
Did you get me here?

40
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,520
Yes, there is a low battery alarm.

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,560
Did you forget to charge again?

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,920
If you keep doing this,

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,600
that'll be suicide.

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
It was my negligence.

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,600
Earlier,

46
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,360
I thought

47
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
my time was up

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
and that I was going to die.

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
for making it here timely and saving me.

51
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Knock it off.

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,560
It's good to have you.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
Gu Chuan, I'm sorry.

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
I misunderstood you.

55
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,520
I kept telling Xiao Ning

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,320
that you were a jerk

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
to treat her that way.

58
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,480
But after hearing your condition from
Xu Cheng Ran,

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,120
what you did for Xiao Ning

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
was really noble.

61
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
In this world,

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,880
you're the man who loves Xiao Ning the most.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
I apologize to you.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,880
Thank you

65
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,840
for using your own way

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,840
to love Xiao Ning.

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
Here's your wedding gift.

68
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
What is it?

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
It's a painting.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,440
I painted it a long time ago.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
But I didn't have the chance to give it to you.

72
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,520
Thank you, Xiao Ning.

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Wen Wen.

74
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,960
How long will you be there this time?

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,080
I think I'll be there for quite some time.

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,880
Otherwise,

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,240
I wouldn't have asked you out

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
to say goodbye to you.

79
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,840
After we're married,

80
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,480
we don't intend to settle down in one place.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
So we plan to travel first

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,680
and think about where to live later on.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,360
I'm so envious of you. Such a perfect couple.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
What's there to envy?

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,840
There are different

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
types of happiness in life.

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Speaking of which,

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,160
you don't look so great.

89
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,880
Are you too exhausted?

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,080
Do I?

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
There are things

92
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,800
that haven't been taken care of.

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,360
How are you and Gu Chuan?

94
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
Mr. Xu said he went on a vacation.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,760
I haven't seen him for quite some time.

96
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
This is my own business.

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,560
You can just leave me alone.

98
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,680
I know.

99
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,880
I'm being meddlesome.

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,440
I just hope you and Jiang Xiao Ning

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
can be happy.

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
If you just let her pass you by like this,

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
I will feel sad for you.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,080
I'm the one who feels the saddest.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,880
Do you know

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
about his mechanical heart?

107
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,320
He told me.

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,160
And he saved me in the car accident

109
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
ten years ago.

110
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
I didn't know you two

111
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
had such a story.

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,800
Xiao Ning.

113
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,720
I can't comment

114
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,400
on your relationship.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,760
But I think

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,440
Gu Chuan is the kind of person

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,880
who keeps

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
everything to himself.

119
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,920
So if you don't want

120
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,320
to give up on him just yet,

121
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,640
I think

122
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
you need to try a little harder.

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't just believe what you hear

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,480
and what you see.

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,560
Feel with your heart.

126
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,320
Whatever your decision is,

127
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,280
I'll have your back.

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,640
All the best.

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,440
See you.

130

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
Hi, doctor.

180
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,360
Hi.

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Why did you give me a refund?

182
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,160
Didn't you bring the cat

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
to the vet the other day?

184
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,080
You have paid for

185
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
the euthanasia drug.

186
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,720
But we didn't give it the injection.

187
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,440
Of course,

188
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,600
we have to get you the refund.

189
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
No injection?

190
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,680
That's right.

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,520
Didn't he sign

192
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,560
the consent form?

193
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,840
Didn't he tell you?

194
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,080
He did sign the form.

195
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
But he couldn't bear to do it.

196
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,600
After much deliberation,

197
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,320
he changed his mind.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,760
Here is the money.

199
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,840
Please put it in the car.

200
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,560
Thank you.

201
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,440
All right.

202
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,080
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Sir, the cement's here.

203
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,560
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Okay.

204
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,680
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Speed up.

205
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,240
(Jiang Xiao Ning)
Thank you.

206
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
(Xiao Ning, what's the matter?)

207
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,960
Do you remember

208
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
what I told you about Ice Cream?

209
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,400
I thought Gu Chuan

210
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,720
signed the consent form for euthanasia.

211
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,200
But today the pet hospital called

212
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,840
and told me to get the refund.

213
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,200
The vet told me that Gu Chuan changed his mind

214
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,000
about the euthanasia injection

215
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,640
and took Ice Cream back.

216
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,200
I wanted to ask him

217
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
what actually happened.

218
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,400
But I called him twice

219
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,280
and there was no answer.

220
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,960
Could you ask Mr. Xu for me

221
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,800
if he knew

222
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,000
where Gu Chuan had gone to?

223
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,800
I didn't hear him talk about it.

224
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Sister Yan Yan.

225
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,880
I'm so confused now.

226
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
I can't help thinking

227
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,640
like things aren't that simple.

228
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Could you ask Mr. Xu for me

229
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,400
if he knew

230
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
where Gu Chuan had gone to?

231
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,160
Do you really want to know?

232
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,520
Of course.

233
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,920
Sister Yan Yan.

234
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Do you know something?

235
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,720
Tell me, please.

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,200
Gu Chuan took Ice Cream back

237
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,080
and accompanied Ice Cream

238
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,280
during its final hours.

239
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,080
He didn't tell you

240
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
because he was afraid

241
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,720
the pain would be too much to you.

242
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,000
(Xiao Ning, Gu Chuan was trying to protect you.)

243
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,480
What do you mean?

244
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,480
Did he tell you these

245
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,080
or it was just a wild guess?

246
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,200
Xiao Ning, stop asking questions.

247
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,600
Did it cross your mind

248
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,160
Gu Chuan's current situation

249
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
is similar

250
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
to Ice Cream's?

251
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,680
What are you talking about?

252
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,560
What is similar?

253
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,200
Sister Yan Yan, just tell me, please.

254
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
(Xiao Ning, ask no more.)

255
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,280
Think about your wish.

256
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,520
Think with your heart.

257
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,680
You'll know where he is.

258
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,720
(Sorry, the number you have dialed)

259
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,080
(cannot be reached temporarily.)

260
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,839
Gu Chuan.

261
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,200
You shouldn't be here.

262
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,480
So you hiding here and rebuilding my family house

263
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,400
is what you should do?

264
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,840
I just want to help you

265
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,880
rebuild your family home.

266
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
Who are you to help me?

267
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
You don't even want me.

268
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,160
What's the point

269
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
of you fulfilling my dream?

270
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,080
I'm such a fool.

271
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,240
I was with you all the time.

272
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,680
I should have known

273
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
you weren't feeling well.

274
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
I should have known

275
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,920
that you were lying to me.

276
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
Regardless,

277
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,560
we can't be together anymore.

278
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,280
Why?

279
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,760
I don't want

280
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,080
to tie you down with me.

281
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
You can have a better future.

282
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,560
I don't want you to regret it in the future.

283
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:54,044
That's right.

284
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,640
Gu Chuan.

285
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,240
I have no right

286
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,560
to tell you how to live your life.

287
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,040
And you can't dictate

288
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,040
how my life will be.

289
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,560
Did you think

290
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,840
breaking up was doing me any good?

291
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
Have you forgotten

292
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
what we've been through together ten years ago?

293
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,280
I met you again ten years later

294
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,240
and I fell for you.

295
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,600
I fell in love with you.

296
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,920
Even if you left me

297
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,200
or refused to see me now,

298
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,440
did you think I could forget you?

299
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,280
It doesn't matter when you leave me.

300
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,920
To me,

301
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,800
it still hurts as much.

302
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,120
It doesn't make it any less painful.

303
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,120
But...

304
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,000
if you are willing to be with me,

305
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
no matter how long we can go,

306
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,960
every single day in the future

307
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
will be a blessing to me.

308
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
All you're trying to do now

309
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
is just

310
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,560
to fulfill my dream

311
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,040
so that

312
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,280
I could live a good life.

313
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,120
If so,

314
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,800
why can't you do it in a simpler way?

315
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,520
We can do these things

316
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,360
together.

317
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
As you already know,

318
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,440
I don't have

319
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,120
much time left.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
What would you do

321
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
if you were me?

322
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,000
If one day, I'm gone

323
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,160
all of a sudden,

324
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,120
how are you going to face it?

325
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,160
Ten years ago,

326
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,760
you held my hand

327
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,320
and encouraged me to persevere.

328
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Why wouldn't I have the courage

329
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,480
to face it?

330
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,480
Gu Chuan.

331
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,240
If you were to leave now,

332
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
would I not have any regrets?

333
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,840
I respect your decision about your life.

334
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,800
But you, too,

335
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,120
have to respect mine.

336
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,600
Even if there's no tomorrow,

337
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,920
I still want to be with you.

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,380
♪Love is silently playing tricks♪

344
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,100

347
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:52,700
♪Take me away to our air space♪

348
00:21:53,180 --> 00:22:00,540
♪Take me away, fairy tales are different

349
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,320
Stop walking around.

350
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
It puts me on edge.

351
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm nervous.

352
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
So am I.

353
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,240
Look who's talking.

354
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,000
It's all because

355
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,920
you told her.

356
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,480
I thought I was the worse

357
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,680
secret keeper ever.

358
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,640
You're even worse than me.

359
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,280
Don't tell me if you have the guts!

360
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Besides,

361
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,960
I didn't say anything.

362
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,480
I merely

363
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
gave her some hint.

364
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,440
Hint?

365
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,680
The only thing you didn't do

366
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,520
was to send her the location.

367
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,360
What now?

368
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,200
What do you think

369
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,280
the two of them

370
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,760
will talk about when they meet?

371
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,240
What will happen?

372
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
Will Gu Chuan pass out

373
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,760
if he gets agitated?

374
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
His heart is...

375
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,080
Call her now.

376
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,240
No.

377
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,040
You call her if you want.

378
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,320
There's no warning alert on my phone.

379
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,160
But the index is fluctuating.

380
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,600
I think it should be fine.

381
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,000
Perhaps,

382
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,920
they've made up already.

383
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,840
But if the two of them

384
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,080
get back together,

385
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,440
we are the ones who make it happen.

386
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,000
That's a good thing, Wifey.

387
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,360
How about going into our room

388
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,280
and celebrating it?

389
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,600
I'll take a shower first.

390
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,880
I didn't even know

391
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,840
there was a nice hotel

392
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
around here.

393
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,400
Once our resort project

394
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,040
is completed,

395
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,680
it will be the best hotel in town.

396
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,760
Of course.

397
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,640
No one's design

398
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,240
can beat my boss's.

399
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,160
They should know their place.

400
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,320
Being a bootlicker again.

401
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,640
Our reporting relationship

402
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,720
can only last

403
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,360
because of that, right?

404
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,720
Is that so?

405
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,120
I always thought

406
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,640
it was your intelligence and talents.

407
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,960
Flattering my boss

408
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
is part of my job too.

409
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,800
Fine.

410
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,720
I'm going to get the key card.

411
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
No.

412
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
I won't run away.

413
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,760
Who knows?

414
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,720
Please swipe the card.

415
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,440
Thank you.

416
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,360
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

417
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,600
A moment, please.

418
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,280
Our system

419
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,400
is rebooting.

420
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,160
All right.

421
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,960
In the past two days,

422
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,960
the power system's

423
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,840
been a little unstable.

424
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,600
The breaker trips

425
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,760
occasionally.

426
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,640
We have upgraded the system.

427
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,520
If there's any problem,

428
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,840
feel free to contact us.

429
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,680
Sorry about that.

430
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
Thank you.

431
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,320
Don't worry. It's our mistake.

432
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,920
It's done.

433
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,680
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,680
Does the lady

435
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,480
want to check in as well?

436
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,320
Are you sharing the room?

437
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
Yes, thank you.

438
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,560
Are we not?

439
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,800
Don't waste your money.

440
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,720
I can sleep on the floor.

441
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,200
Please give me another room.

442
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,120
No.

443
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,960
I'll take the bed and you take the floor then.

444
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,400
My ID. Thank you.

445
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,400
Let's go.

446
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,680
I never thought we would check in to a hotel

447
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,960
under such circumstances.

448
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,760
You called this checking-in to a hotel?

449
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,040
Instead of going home, we stay in the hotel.

450
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
What else could it be if it's not
checking-in to a hotel?

451
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,720
You're right.

452
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,840
By the way,

453
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,360
did you tell your aunt you are not
going home tonight?

454
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,600
I...

455
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,040
Get on the bed.

456
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,640
It feels a little far to talk like that.

457
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,200
Get on the bed?

458
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,040
Do you feel unsafe with me?

459
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,120
How is that

460
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,160
even possible?

461
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,400
Come on then.

462
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,880
Here.

463
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,960
I will definitely

464
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,760
control myself.

465
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,120
What were you saying?

466
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,720
I was saying

467
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,600
did you tell your aunt that you are staying out?

468
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,520
I lied to her and said that I am working overtime.

469
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,680
Oh, no.

470
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,080
She'll not spare me.

471
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,400
If she knew

472
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,280
that you didn't want me,

473
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
she wouldn't spare you for sure.

474
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,120
Did you tell your aunt

475
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,440
everything?

476
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, no.

477
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
But I had to keep it a secret and it was so hard.

478
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,000
Actually, after the accident,

479
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,920
I tried looking for you.

480
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,440
My parents' deaths

481
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,760
were a huge blow to me.

482
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,920
But I remember everything.

483
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,440
I told my aunt that I wanted to find you

484
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,720
and say thanks to you.

485
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,040
What then?

486
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,440
Then,

487
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
my aunt said she couldn't find you.

488
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,280
To me,

489
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,600
you're my life savior.

490
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,080
But to you,

491
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,520
they weren't good memories.

492
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,280
My aunt told me

493
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,000
not to live in the past

494
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,360
and that I had to step out of it and start afresh.

495
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
I never thought

496
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,040
we ended up meeting each other again.

497
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,280
Actually, I kind of regret it.

498
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,800
If you didn't meet me again,

499
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,120
your heart

500
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,440
wouldn't have had frequent glitches.

501
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,000
You could continue

502
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,000
living your life based on

503
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,892
your previous lifestyle

504
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,000
and live all the way to 80 years old.

505
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
And you wouldn't have so much worry

506
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,760
and trouble.

507
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,240
If I didn't meet you again,

508
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,440
I would have left this world

509
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
after winning the award.

510
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,200
I never regret meeting you,

511
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,680
Jiang Xiao Ning.

512
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,920
Forget it.

513
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Forget it.

514
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,200
If we get too intimate,

515
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
your heart rate

516
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,040
will keep rising.

517
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,960
I don't want to send you

518
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,800
to the emergency room

519
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,560
while we're dating.

520
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,200
We are the most special couple

521
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,200
in the world.

522
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,560
I should just sleep on the floor.

523
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,080
It's too cold on the floor.

524
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,520
I should go instead.

525
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Hold on.

526
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,080
I've thought about it.

527
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,360
We need to set our own rules

528
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,200
of getting along together.

529
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,760
Ensure it's strictly enforced.

530
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,800
And we should keep your heart rate

531
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,680
within a safe range.

532
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,440
Not only will it

533
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,160
be good for your heart,

534
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,400
but also make us

535
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,720
less alienated.

536
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
This is not something

537
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
within my abilities.

538
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,200
I'll leave it to you.

539
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,280
All right.

540
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,520
Go to bed.

541
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,560
I'll do the thinking.

542
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,600
Go on and sleep.

543
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,080
We can share the same bed.

544
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,280
But we can't kiss.

545
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,480
We can hug each other.

546
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,680
But that depends.

547
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,120
Is this okay for you?

548
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,760
Whatever you say.

549
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,040
Good night.

550
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,280
Good night.

551
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,840
Good night.

552
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,148
(I can kiss him on the cheek when he's asleep.)

553
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:17,326
(We can look into each other's eyes,
but have to keep it short.)

554
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:19,830
(When he's angry, I can behave
in a coquette-ish manner.)

555
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,580
(I can help dry his hair. Wear matching couple
T-shirts and exchange roles for one day.)

556
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,880
Jia Jia, here's your coffee.

557
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
What's wrong?

558
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,239
What's on your mind?

559
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I don't know.

560
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,080
My mind is blank.

561
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,199
Look, even the office is empty.

562
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,719
It's so desolate.

563
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,040
You have me.

564
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,560
Knock it off.

565
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Su Man Lin is gone.

566
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,679
I don't really like her,

567
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,719
but listening to her bossing me around

568
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,920
actually livened up the place

569
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,920
a little.

570
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:01,159
And now, Jiang Xiao Ning is gone too.

571
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,040
She used to jump around the place

572
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,080
like a rabbit,

573
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,880
always helping us out with a smile on her face.

574
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,199
But now that I don't see her.

575
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,960
The office

576
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,280
seems so lifeless.

577
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,120
Have a cup of coffee.

578
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,880
It helps improve your mood.

579
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,440
Jia Jia.

580
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,480
Here are the materials that you asked for.

581
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,120
Thank you, Dong Dong.

582
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,920
Now, it feels like

583
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,840
the atmosphere here

584
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,560
is much better now.

585
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,200
Was the atmosphere bad?

586
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,040
I was so down before you came back.

587
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,200
You should avoid

588
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,160
going out so often.

589
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,240
If not,

590
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,720
I'll have no one

591
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,000
to talk to in the office.

592
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,640
Sure. No problem.

593
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,080
Go now. Get back to your work.

594
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,680
Why are you still laughing?

595
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,000
Hello?

596
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,480
Were you laughing earlier?

597
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,680
No.

598
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,560
You...

599
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,480
Just now,

600
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,280
you were pulling a long face.

601
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,960
But

602
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,920
you were all smiles

603
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,520
as soon as you saw him.

604
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,840
You rolled your eyes at me.

605
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,560
Are you...

606
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,960
What are you talking about?

607
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
You...

608
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,040
I'm saying...

609
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,600
Oh, no.

610
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,880
This is bad.

611
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,080
What happened?

612
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,640
The landmark project.

613
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,240
Mr. Gu's previous plan

614
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,960
was not detailed enough.

615
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,960
So during this time,

616
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,520
we've been making adjustments

617
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,480
based on the opinions

618
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,280
of the project expert group.

619
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,120
Here comes the final feedback.

620
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,640
There are many things that require amendments.

621
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,480
But Mr. Gu isn't around. What do we do?

622
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,240
I'm sure all of you are aware of the amendments

623
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,160
needed for the project, right?

624
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,240
Mr. Xu, we were just talking about it.

625
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,760
Mr. Xu, what do we do?

626
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,800
Cheng Dong, why don't you go?

627
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,880
You have experience in it after all.

628
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
Brother Kai, you need to be mindful.

629
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,200
How could you randomly assign

630
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,000
someone to deal with it?

631
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,600
Su Man Lin was the first assistant director.

632
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,840
It'll not be a problem if she's around.

633
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,000
And she's familiar with Mr. Gu's style.

634
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,440
But you expect me to take over at the last moment.

635
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,960
Aren't you ruining

636
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,400
the previous design concept?

637
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,280
We should wait for Mr. Gu to come back.

638
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,240
Mr. Gu hasn't been here

639
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,920
for so long.

640
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,680
He should be back soon.

641
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,360
No.

642
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,240
Definitely not.

643
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
No one is allowed to contact Gu Chuan.

644
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,840
You hear me?

645
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
If anyone dares to breathe a word of this

646
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,520
to Gu Chuan,

647
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,880
I won't go easy on you.

648
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,240
Mr. Xu.

649
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,400
How do we solve this then?

650
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,080
I'm here, aren't I?

651
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,520
Wait to hear from me.

652
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,600
It's been a while.

653
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,200
Not really. Does it feel that long?

654
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,080
Perhaps I've been missing you.

655
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,000
That's why

656
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
it felt like it's been a while.

657
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,520
Knock it off. I know you.

658
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,640
Stop beating around the bush.

659
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,440
Just put your cards on the table.

660
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,760
There's been a minor problem with the design

661
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,920
for the landmark project.

662
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,440
It requires some amendments.

663
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
Gu Chuan got something to deal with

664
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,680
and he couldn't take time off.

665
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,640
You're the only one I can think of.

666
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,400
Are you asking me

667
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,240
to go back and amend the design?

668
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:11,624
After all, you were the first assistant director

669
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,560
of this project.

670
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,360
No one's a better candidate.

671
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,920
But do you think

672
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,560
I could still bring myself to go back there again?

673
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,280
Everyone in the company

674
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,760
must hate me to the core.

675
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,320
I don't know what they think

676
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,400
and I don't care.

677
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
All I know is that

678
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,440
you have put a lot of effort

679
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,280
into this project too.

680
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,200
You can't just let it

681
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,520
fall apart.

682
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,120
I would love to help.

683
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,520
But I've booked

684
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,480
a flight ticket for tomorrow.

685
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,800
Where to?

686
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,160
I applied for a position

687
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,200
at a foreign design company

688
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,320
and I'm going to report to work.

689
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,040
So this city's

690
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,000
iconic architectural design plan

691
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,680
and the control and guide...

692
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,320
Actually...

693
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Hey, are you guys

694
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,800
even listening?

695
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,200
Cheng Dong, they think

696
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
your proposal

697
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,680
doesn't match Mr. Gu's style.

698
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,560
This makes no difference at all.

699
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,880
What can I do?

700
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,960
Mr. Gu isn't here.

701
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,120
I can only voice out my opinion

702
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,400
and discuss it with you guys!

703
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,680
What's the point of asking all of you here?

704
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,200
Calm down. Let's discuss it.

705
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,640
We'll find a way.

706
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,600
Hear me out.

707
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,080
There have been some changes in the project.

708
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,920
So I've invited Su Man Lin

709
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,440
to help us out.

710
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,160
She was supposed

711
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,960
to report to work at a

712
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,560
design company in Italy.

713
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,600
But I managed to persuade her

714
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,520
to stay and help us out.

715
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
She'll leave after completing the project.

716
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,680
Welcome back.

717
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,920
Aren't you going to welcome her?

718
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,400
Save it.

719
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,720
Our top priority is the design.

720
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,760
Nothing else matters.

721
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,640
Cheng Dong.

722
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,080
Tell me the feedback.

723
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,160
What are the problems?

724
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,520
This is the report from the project team.

725
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,240
Take a look.

726
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,120
Sister Man Lin.

727
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,160
