21

This is what

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,920
I've always pictured it in my head.

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Aunty and Grandma

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
are taking a walk in the yard.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,520
And the yard has been filled with

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
different flowers and plants.

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
You're here.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
What are you looking at?

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm looking at

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
a helpless face.

31
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,600
That's why I asked you to come help.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,160
Ever since

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,040
you said "let's break up" last time,

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,880
Yan Yan has been really hard on me.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,560
I can't even

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
protect myself.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,280
I haven't even said what it is yet

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,480
and you've already thought of

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,360
a bunch of reasons to put me off.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Tell me, what is it?

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Here.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
These are all the relevant information

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
on all the projects of our studio.

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
I've sorted them out for you

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,760
in chronological order

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,880
and in order of importance.

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
You just have to make sure
the project coordinators

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,920
finish their projects according to the plans.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
What do you mean by this?

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
You're done with work?

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,960
I want to go away for a while.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Where to?

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
The performance of my mechanical heart

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,520
keeps getting

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
more and more unstable.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm really scared

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,480
that one day,

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,240
I might pass out in the car,

59
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,200
on the streets,

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
- or in the studio...
- Stop it.

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't say unlucky things like that.

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,480
I don't want to hear it.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,040
But I have to face it.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,840
Don't worry.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm not

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
as extreme as I used to be.

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,720
I won't end my life on my own.

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,000
I just

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
want to use the time I have

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
to help others.

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,360
Such as,

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,760
helping those I love.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Chuan,

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,280
can we

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
not talk in this way?

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,520
It scares me.

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,480
You made it sound like a farewell message.

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,960
What would you do

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,480
if you were me?

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
I don't know.

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,440
You should at least

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
tell me where you're going.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,120
Xiao Ning has always wanted

84
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,360
to rebuild her family house.

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
So I want to

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,839
help them fulfill this wish.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
If Xiao Ning asks me,

88
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,520
what should I tell her?

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
That I don't know.

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
I just know that

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,400
out of everyone around me,

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
you're the best at lying.

93
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,680
Entrusting this task to you

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,040
is definitely the right choice.

95
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,680
I believe in you.

96
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,060
(Architectural design size)

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Chuan.

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
Chuan, when are you leaving?

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,160
Not up yet.

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,640
(Take care of the studio.)

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,320
Mr. Xu.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,360
Xiao Ning.

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,560
Where is Mr. Gu?

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
I didn't see his car

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,360
in the parking lot.

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
He's not picking up my calls either.

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,360
He left.

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Where to?

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
You know that Gu Chuan and I

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,760
went to the same university, right?

111
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Yes.

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,680
Our university

113
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,480
is holding an alumni works exhibition.

114
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,360
Gu Chuan is an outstanding alumni representative.

115
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,880
He's going to host the exhibition.

116
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,400
When will he be back?

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,480
He told me

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,520
to temporarily take care of company affairs.

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
I'm guessing it'll be a while.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,920
One to two months.

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
Maybe even half a year.

122
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,440
I'm not sure.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,080
It's okay.

124
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
He'll be back eventually.

125
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,600
Or, do you not want to be

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,560
my assistant?

127
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,320
No, it's all work.

128
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,720
It's the same for me.

129
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
Have you had breakfast?

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Gu Chuan left me some breakfast

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,400
before he left.

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,320
Let's have some together.

133
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,280
I'm fine.

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,360
Mr. Xu,

135
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll be going to the studio now.

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,400
Then I'm not having any either.

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,000
Wait for me.

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
Let's go together.

139
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,800
(We've broken up already.)

140
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
(I no longer have any hope.)

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
(Why leave without saying goodbye?)

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
(Is he trying to avoid me on purpose?)

143
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
(Does he)

144
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
(hate seeing me)

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320

00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,400
What's up with you?

173
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
You're disappointed that it's me, right?

174
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,040
No, I'll go get you water.

175
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,440
Chuan,

176
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,720
you're really worrying me.

177
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,320
(I'm fine.)

178
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,680
Have you thought it through?

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
If we continue like this,

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,840
I'll tell Jiang Xiao Ning

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
everything for sure.

182
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,520
No matter what,

183
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm never going to give up on you.

184
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,000
Who are you never going to give up?

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,160
Wi… Wifey.

186
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm not someone

187
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
who looks through a man's phone.

188
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,080
But I can't let you

189
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,600
play me like a fool.

190
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,160
Wifey, what are you talking about?

191
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
You're not a fool at all.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Don't try to change the topic.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Who was it? Tell me.

194
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,080
It's really no one.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,120
It's Gu Chuan.

196
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,480
Who are you trying to fool?

197
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,160
What can you two talk about?

198
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,160
It really is Gu Chuan.

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,240
Check my phone if you don't believe me.

200
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
See if it's his number.

201
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,920
What were you two talking about?

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,840
We were

203
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,080
just randomly chatting.

204
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,800
Randomly chatting about what?

205
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,400
I can't tell you.

206
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,800
You just

207
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,080
want to do it the hard way, huh?

208
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
Xu Cheng Ran.

209
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,360
Wifey.

210
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,120
I really can't tell you.

211
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,280
I can't tell you even if you beat me to death.

212
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
I mean

213
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,840
what kind of shameful deal

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
did you two make?

215
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,040
If I tell you,

216
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
that would make me a terrible bro.

217
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,280
If you don't,

218
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,920
you'd be a terrible husband.

219
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,760
Xu Cheng Ran.

220
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,400
What did you promise me before?

221
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,000
Didn't you say

222
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,600
that you'd never lie to me again?

223
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,960
Wifey. Could you not put me

224
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,840
in a tough spot?

225
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,360
Are you going to tell me?

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,080
I...

227
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
I can't.

228
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Fine.

229
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,400
No need to tell me.

230
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,840
My wifey is so great.

231
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,280
I'd never do anything

232
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,840
to hurt you.

233
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
Pack your stuff and get out of here.

234
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,600
(I was worried that she wouldn't be able to face me.)

235
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,520
(But actually, it's me who can't face her.)

236
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,160
Hello?

237
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
(I'm getting married next month.)

238
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,080
Congratulations!

239
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,760
Why did you

240
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,440
break up with Jiang Xiao Ning?

241
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,760
No reason.

242
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
Just thought we weren't a good fit.

243
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,120
(Really?)

244
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
(Think it through.)

245
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,000
If you turn your back on her now, it'll be for life.

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,640
You're always like this.

247
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,440
You decide

248
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,160
everything on your own.

249
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,360
Why can't you face

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,960
what's going on together?

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,800
It's solely my business.

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,440
Don't stick your nose in it.

253
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,280
I know

254
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm being nosy.

255
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,680
I just want

256
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,560
you and Jiang Xiao Ning to be happy.

257
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
If you let her pass you by like this,

258
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,280
I'll be sad for you.

259
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,400
The person who feels the saddest is me.

260
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,120
Jiang Xiao Ning.

261
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,560
When you weren't here,

262
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,640
we processed the data

263
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,360
for this.

264
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,280
But it hasn't been checked.

265
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Here, check it.

266
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,880
Although I wasn't here these couple of days,

267
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,560
I didn't stop working.

268
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
I finished checking it

269
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,480
and made notes of mistakes

270
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,800
on the side.

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,880
Please check it.

272
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,280
(Main materials of the project equipment)

273
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,400
Nice. Very thorough.

274
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,480
You've made great progress.

275
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,360
Thanks, Brother Dong.

276
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,720
It's what I should do.

277
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,760
Xiao Ning,

278
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,920
come with me.

279
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,480
What is it?

280
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,520
Did you guys

281
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,440
quarrel or break up?

282
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,320
Was that

283
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,600
too blunt?

284
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,640
But everyone in the company

285
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
knows about you and Mr. Gu.

286
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,880
Something between you two

287
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
seems off these days.

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
There's nothing between Mr. Gu and me.

289
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,880
I'm just

290
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,440
a normal employee like you.

291
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
My position isn't even as high as yours.

292
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,160
Something must be going on between you two.

293
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,080
Look at you.

294
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,640
It's as if your soul has left your body.

295
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,920
Everyone is talking about

296
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
how an iron girl like you taking time off

297
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,040
is either because of a major accident or...

298
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
Just think it's because of a major accident then.

299
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,080
Go back to work.

300
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
It's really nothing?

301
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,920
Work hard.

302
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,480
Okay.

303
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,680
I'm starting to realize that

304
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
those in hiding have it easy,

305
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
while those who are left behind are about
to have a mental breakdown.

306
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
I couldn't take it and almost

307
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,560
told Yan Yan the truth several times.

308
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,120
What are you doing here?

309
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,720
To see you.

310
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
You've made quite a bit of progress already.

311
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
If you tell Zhao Yan,

312
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,280
you're seriously dead to me.

313
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,040
I didn't.

314
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
A big-shot designer like you

315
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
doesn't need to

316
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,040
worry about these tiny details.

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,920
I'll ask designers from

318
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,840
our company to come help you.

319
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
I can't let anyone

320
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,560
related to our company get involved.

321
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm afraid Jiang Xiao Ning will find out.

322
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,640
Alright then.

323
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
Take it easy and pace yourself.

324
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,560
Don't rush too much.

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,400
Don't worry.

326
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,760
I know what I'm doing.

327
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm just scared...

328
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,040
Chuan,

329
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,280
are you okay?

330
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Let me help you go back to rest.

331
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,600
Be careful.

332
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
It's too hot.

333
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
Do I need to charge you now?

334
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,120
No.

335
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
These days, it

336
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,320
occasionally malfunctions.

337
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,840
Hurts a lot.

338
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
Go back with me.

339
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
What good does going back do?

340
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
No difference between being here and going back.

341
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,200
Resting at home

342
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,000
will at least be a little better.

343
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,960
Have you gotten Xiao Ning to sign the will?

344
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,800
Not yet.

345
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,360
Are you sure about this?

346
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
Don't let her find out

347
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,560
what those are.

348
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,560
Otherwise, she'd definitely come looking for me.

349
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,400
Everything I've done so far

350
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,640
would be for nothing.

351
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,200
Alright. Go back.

352
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,800
The earlier everything gets settled,

353
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,680
the more at ease I'll be.

354
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,080
Go.

355
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,920
I'll leave then.

356
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,200
Take care of yourself.

357
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,200
Call me if anything happens.

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,120
Okay.

359
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,000
Xiao Ning.

360
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm downstairs.

361
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,200
Can you come down?

362
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,680
Brother Xu.

363
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,600
Long time no see.

364
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680
How are things between you and Gu Chuan?

365
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Why are you bringing him up all of a sudden?

366
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,480
Is Gu Chuan really that great?

367
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,600
To you...

368
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,280
I seem pretty useless.

369
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Brother Xu, don't say that.

370
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
When we were kids, you always

371
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,840
fought back for me when I got bullied.

372
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,000
When I wanted candy,

373
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
you bought me candy.

374
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,440
For my birthday every year,

375
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,320
you'd give me

376
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
really pretty presents.

377
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,080
I remember everything.

378
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,200
I've always thought of you as my own big brother.

379
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,400
You're a part of our family too.

380
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
So you won't develop feelings for me

381
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,000
and fall in love with me, right?

382
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
You're so exceptional.

383
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,160
Given everything about you,

384
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,400
you'll definitely find me

385
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,680
a super perfect sister-in-law.

386
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
I'll be waiting,

387
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
waiting for the day you have that
silly smile on your face.

388
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,640
Xiao Ning.

389
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,240
To be honest,

390
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
it's really nice to still

391
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
be able to chat with you like this.

392
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,720
I thought you were

393
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
never going to talk to me again.

394
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,960
No way.

395
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,520
You're my big brother.

396
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,840
Have you eaten?

397
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,200
Aunty says we're having dumplings.

398
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,200
Come have some with us.

399
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
I'd love to,

400
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,520
but I'm scared that Aunty will kill me.

401
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,680
I'll protect you.

402
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Really?

403
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,760
Let's go.

404
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Let's go.

405
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,600
Do you like it?

406
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,760
Here.

407
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,560
You have some too.

408
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,920
Mom.

409
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,720
Why is this actor showing up again?

410
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,240
Doesn't he know that

411
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,400
he's not welcomed?

412
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Not welcomed, not welcomed.

413
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,160
Both Grandma and I don't like him.

414
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
It's okay. Just eat.

415
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't like him.

416
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,960
Aunty, you don't have to say that much.

417
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,440
Aunty,

418
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,200
come and have some.

419
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,600
There were only 15 dumplings.

420
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,520
And I made all those for you.

421
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,360
There's nothing left for me.

422
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm full. You should have some.

423
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,360
Brother Xu, Aunty is joking.

424
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,280
Aunty, I'm hungry.

425
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,280
Sit. It's okay.

426
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,680
Eat.

427
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,720
I made these this afternoon.

428
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,960
Thank you, Aunty.

429
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,240
Thank you, Aunty.

430
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,560
I miss the red cooking you make the most.

431
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,320
Look at you talking nonsense.

432
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,840
I thought you

433
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,080
didn't like quail eggs when you were little.

434
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,360
How come you like them now?

435
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,920
I was too young.

436
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,320
I grew up now.

437
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,080
You become a sweet talker now.

438
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,880
Really?

439
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,680
I thought he was already a sweet talker
when he was little.

440
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Who is this?

441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,240
How come he looks so familiar.

442
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,800
Grandma,

443
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,320
Do you remember Brother Tang Xu?

444
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,920
I do. I do.

445
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,360
He always gets first place in exams.

446
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,560
So you remember that.

447
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,360
You should come to my place to eat.

448
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Ning Ning,

449
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,560
learn from him.

450
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
But don't stay for too long.

451
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,360
If you can't finish your homework,

452
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,680
you'll be scolded.

453
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,360
Got it.

454
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,680
Come, Grandma.

455
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,320
Let's watch TV together.

456
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,240
Come on, let's go.

457
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,680
Brother Xu, take your time.

458
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,600
I will.

459
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
Nice.

460
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,520
This kid is so good at studying.

461
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
The TV show is pretty interesting.

462
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Aunty,

463
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,280
I actually visited here a lot.

464
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:38,960
I've always wanted to come up,

465
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,080
but I was afraid.

466
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,080
I was afraid that you'll be unhappy to see me.

467
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,560
After all, my father...

468
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,040
Alright. Stop.

469
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm warning you once again.

470
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,320
Don't bring

471
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,840
the old things up again.

472
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,280
I understand.

473
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,040
It's between the elders.

474
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,720
You have nothing to do with it.

475
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,560
Grandma and I

476
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,800
are just mad at your father.

477
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,400
We're mad that he embezzled the funds

478
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,760
and got my brother involved.

479
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,000
But he is gone for more than ten years.

480
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,120
Why bring it up?

481
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
I know

482
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
what you're thinking.

483
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
I have everything

484
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,200
that you've given me

485
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,280
written down in a notebook.

486
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,640
Aunty,

487
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,960
you don't have to give anything back.

488
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm not asking for anything.

489
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,760
So you want me to give them back?

490
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,560
I'll have to be able to afford it.

491
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,760
But I can't afford it.

492
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,080
But,

493
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,440
to be honest,

494
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,960
we're reasonable people.

495
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
We know

496
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,400
who treats us well

497
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,560
and who doesn't.

498
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,960
I don't hold

499
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,960
a grudge against you.

500
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,080
And

501
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
I shouldn't.

502
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,800
As long as

503
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,800
you're still treating Xiao Ning well

504
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,080
like you did before.

505
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,640
Treat her as your own sister.

506
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,640
I'll treat you like I did before.

507
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,320
Come up if you ever visit.

508
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,120
Don't stand downstairs by yourself

509
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
and make things look weird.

510
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,080
Neighbors are gossiping.

511
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,720
Understood. Thank you, Aunty.

512
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,240
Not enough to eat, right?

513
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,600
Let me make some more.

514
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,640
Eat.

515
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Lao Jiang,

516
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
I'm finally here to see you.

517
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,360
Even though

518
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
I've been out for days,

519
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
I was afraid to visit you.

520
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,960
(Grave of Late Father Jiang Guang Da and Late Mother Shen Si Lan)

521
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
(Grave of Late Father Jiang Guang Da and Late Mother Shen Si Lan)
I'm ashamed to visit you.

522
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,200
But I can't run away from it any longer.

523
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Even if I avoid visiting you now,

524
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,480
we might see each other

525
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,520
on the other side

526
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,960
after I die.

527
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,160
So I'm here shamelessly

528
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,600
to visit you, my brother and my sister-in-law.

529
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Lao Jiang,

530
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,960
this toast is to you two.

531
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,720
We haven't been

532
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,960
drinking together in decades.

533
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm going to drink too.

534
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
Uncle Tang.

535
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,240
Xiao Ning,

536
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,880
why are you here?

537
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,160
I meant,

538
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,280
do you not have to work today?

539
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,600
It's the weekend.

540
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,680
What was I thinking?

541
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,840
Come.

542
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,480
Uncle Tang.

543
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,880
Thank you for visiting my parents.

544
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,560
None of my dad's past co-workers

545
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,800
came to visit,

546
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,760
ever.

547
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,440
You're the first one.

548
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Don't thank me.

549
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,240
I should have come

550
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,360
a lot earlier.

551
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,600
What kind of person

552
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,840
do you think my dad was?

553
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
Your dad is

554
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,000
the kindest

555
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,280
and the most honest person I've ever met.

556
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,000
Do you think he would be

557
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,600
someone who would embezzle public funds?

558
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,760
You can tell me when you've thought about it.

559
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,520
What's up, Xiao Ning?

560
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,520
Mr. Xu.

561
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,920
I didn't know you were still here.

562
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,880
I thought someone forgot to turn off the lights.

563
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,120
You're just in time.

564
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,040
I have something to talk to you about.

565
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,240
Sit.

566
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,120
I heard from Gu Chuan that

567
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,000
you've been working

568
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,240
as an intern.

569
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,760
But your internship has already ended
a long time ago.

570
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,320
Although your payroll has changed,

571
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,120
the company

572
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,400
has not officially processed it.

573
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,320
Is that right?

574
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Even though Gu Chuan is good at designing,

575
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,600
he's terrible at managing a company.

576
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,800
He has too much on his plate.

577
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,360
Plus, I already got my pay raise.

578
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,200
I didn't care

579
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
about the official process.

580
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,520
That's not okay.

581
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,320
We have to be professional when it
comes to managing a company.

582
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,760
Sign these documents.

583
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,980
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

584
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,920
Xiao Ning,

585
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,440
Gu Chuan

586
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,360
didn't attend the open class.

587
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,960
Where did he go?

588
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,800
Did something happen?

589
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,840
Is he okay?

590
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,120
He's fine. He's good.

591
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,640
He went on vacation.

592
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,560
I don't understand

593
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,800
this person.

594
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,080
He said he wanted to find a place

595
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,320
where he can't see you

596
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,520
to find some peace.

597
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,720
He can go anywhere

598
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,160
he wants to go, as long as he's happy.

599
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,360
I don't want him to

600
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,000
get annoyed by seeing me.

601
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,000
Last time we talked over the phone

602
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,240
and he told me something even worse.

603
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,280
What did he say?

604
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,280
He said that

605
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,280
he won't come back

606
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
if he finds a girl there.

607
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,080
He really said that?

608
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,760
I think so.

609
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,040
I was a little drunk,

610
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,360
so I can't remember clearly.

611
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,880
This is the last document.

612
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,920
Sign it.

613
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,660
(Successor: Jiang Xiao Ning)

614
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,600
Good. Everything has been signed.

615
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,400
Thank you.

616
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Mr. Xu.

617
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,880
If you have any news of Gu Chuan...

618
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,520
I will let you know immediately.

619
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

620
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
I'll leave then.

621
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,480
Please forgive me, Chuan.

622
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,440
She won't sign

623
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
if I don't lie to her like this.

624
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,680
(Am I this annoying to him?)

625
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,800
(Then why should I still stay here?)

626
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,320
(I should resign.)

627
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,480
Check this out.

628
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
You'll see a garden

629
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,560
after you enter.

630
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,320
The living room is inside.

631
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,520
We built a balcony

632
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,760
on the second floor.

633
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,560
It follows

634
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,600
the design you gave us.

635
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,280
You can rest assured.

636
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Let me answer this call first.

637
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,360
Cool.

638
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,639
Hello?

639
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,440
Chuan.

640
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,480
I finally made her sign

641
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
with the help of a little lie.

642
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,639
When should I bring them to you?

643
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,840
Can you keep them?

644
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,280
I'm afraid that if something happens,

645
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,560
I won't have time to handle everything.

646
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,960
Don't say things like this,

647
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,639
alright?

648
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,639
I'll keep them for you temporarily.

649
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,560
I'll bring them to you

650
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,719
when I go see you.

651
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,440
Thank you.

652
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,880
You don't need to thank me.

653
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,800
Thank you for taking care of me

654
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,400
and tolerating me all these years.

655
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,400
Nonsense.

656
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm going to hang up.

657
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,639
I got things to do.

658
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,820

Wifey,

668
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
I miss you so much.

669
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,480
I have something to tell you.

670
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:33,100
♪I'll stay right here and wait for you to come back♪

672
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,280
Didn't you say that you
have something to tell me?

673
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,400
How many cans have you drunk?

674
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,600
Let me drink more.

675
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Otherwise, I don't know

676
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,560
how I should start.

677
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,120
I don't understand.

678
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,400
Is there anything

679
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,640
you can't tell me?

680
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,400
Wifey,

681
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,720
I want to tell you about

682
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,200
Gu Chuan and me.

683
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,920
Do you want to hear it?

684
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,440
Of course.

685
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,000
Gu Chuan and I

686
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,520
were in the same year in university,

687
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
but we were in different majors.

688
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,600
However, I had heard of him long before that.

689
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,720
People said that

690
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,640
there's a genius

691
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
in our university.

692
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Being just in his second year,

693
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,080
he had already won all the university-level

694
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,320
awards in his field.

695
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,880
I was curious.

696
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,400
I thought

697
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,480
who could be that smart?

698
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,960
Can he really outsmart me?

699
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,720
So I went to check him out.

700
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,720
I wanted to see

701
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,920
what kind of person he is.

702
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,680
He was

703
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
even weirder than he is now.

704
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,640
He was so cold

705
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,360
and refused to let other people into his life.

706
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,720
I was so interested in him.

707
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,080
I mean it.

708
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,080
I pestered him

709
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,440
like how I pestered you.

710
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,200
It took me half a semester

711
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,040
to become friends with him.

712
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,560
And then one day when I was chatting with him,

713
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,120
I said to him

714
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,160
"Chuan,

715
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,880
everything is good about you.

716
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,200
Except for that you always pull a long face,

717
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,440
showing no emotions and acting like a dead person.

718
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,920
You can't create any designs

719
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,920
with love being like that.

720
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,000
Then I found out that

721
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,320
the youngest triple

722
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,880
Grand Slam winner

723
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
in the field of design,

724
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,960
my best friend, Gu Chuan,

725
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,880
cannot

726
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,240
live like a normal person at all.

727
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,520
He died once.

728
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,520
He was in a car accident

729
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,280
and had to get a mechanical heart.

730
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,040
You're drunk.

731
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
I'm not drunk.

732
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,240
What mechanical heart?

733
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,200
Just talk about Gu Chuan.

734
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,280
Don't make it like a sci-fi movie.

735
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,160
It's the truth.

736
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,120
The mechanical heart

737
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,840
is also a global limited edition.

738
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,560
That thing tortures him every day.

739
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,280
It makes a lot of noise when it's working.

740
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,320
It has to be charged every day.

741
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,320
An abnormally high heart rate would
cause electric discharge,

742
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,240
which will hurt the people around him.

743
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,520
That's why

744
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,800
he lives

745
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,800
with no emotion.

746
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,120
Does Xiao Ning know?

747
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,560
Jiang Xiao Ning knew about it.

748
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,920
I'm thankful to her.

749
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,320
Before her, Gu Chuan was afraid

750
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,520
of dating other people.

751
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,440
He was afraid that

752
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,240
he won't be able to make others happy.

753
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,440
He finally lived like a human for the first time

754
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,880
after he met Jiang Xiao Ning.

755
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,600
Why did he still

756
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,240
date Jiang Xiao Ning

757
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,720
if he can't be with anyone?

758
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,320
Wifey.

759
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,200
You know what?

760
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,880
Gu Chuan.

761
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,320
Gu Chuan will die soon.

762
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,640
What do you mean?

763
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,360
The doctor who did research on mechanical hearts

764
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,160
suddenly passed away not long ago.

765
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,920
Gu Chuan's heart

766
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,360
cannot hold on any longer.

767
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,080
And no one can

768
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,240
repair and maintain it.

769
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,600
Isn't that just frustrating?

770
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,440
They say that these things are high-tech,

771
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,880
but they can't even perform automatic upgrades.

772
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,320
So you're saying that

773
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,640
Gu Chuan can die anytime?

774
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,920
He's already preparing for
his funeral arrangements.

775
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,600
He even made a will.

776
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,440
Besides his parents,

777
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,360
he left a part of his inheritance

778
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,520
to Jiang Xiao Ning.

779
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,320
He really loves Jiang Xiao Ning.

780
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
His mechanical heart

781
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
has been having a lot of problems.

782
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,080
And he won't rest at home.

783
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,520
You know what he's doing?

784
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,880
He's been leaving early and
going home late recently

785
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,720
to fix

786
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,600
Jiang Xiao Ning's family house.

787
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,720
Yan Yan,

788
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,080
Gu Chuan is my best, best,

789
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,040
best friend.

790
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,840
But I can only

791
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,920
watch him die

792
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,560
and I can't do anything about it.
