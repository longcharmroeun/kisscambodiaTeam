21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,440
Wifey,

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,160
I have a question for you.

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
If,

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,640
I mean if.

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,840
If we're dating now,

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,760
we love each other so much,

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
and I treat you super well,

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,360
but all of a sudden I realize that

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,920
I have cancer.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
Although I really love you,

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
I will have to keep distance between us

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,960
to not put any burden on you.

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,760
If you find out,

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,680
what would you do?

35
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,960
I don't think you'd be that noble.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm just asking a question.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,640
What if it really happens?

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,400
If it really happens,

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,520
I'd never leave your side

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,080
and stay with you.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,080
I knew it.

42
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,720
But I don't know

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,280
whether that's right or wrong.

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,680
Why do you ask

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
this question all of a sudden?

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,440
No reason, just casually chatting.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,280
Let me see.

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,920
Are you really sick?

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Do you have cancer or something?

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,280
I'm very healthy.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm in great health.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,000
Then why did you...

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,640
Do you want to give it a try?

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
Let me down.

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,920
Let me down.

56
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,440
What are you doing?

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
Good morning, Boss.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,920
I told you

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
to not come.

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,560
How can I

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
let you drive?

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,760
Let's go.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
Have you had breakfast?

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,440
Yes.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,240
What's wrong?

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
You're blowing hot and cold.

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
I'm a little tired.

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
Don't talk to me.

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, take a nap then.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Manager Wei.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,880
Zhao Yan.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I heard that

73
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
Mr. Xu Jr. dumped you.

74
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
Is this work-related?

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,200
I find this pretty weird.

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
He just brought you up

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,480
to the top floor to be a secretary.

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
And now he doesn't even say hi

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
when he sees you at work,

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
pretending he doesn't know you.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
This attitude change...

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
You're such an attentive person.

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,440
There are no secrets

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,480
at work.

85
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
Everything happens in this one building.

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,320
Everyone in the building

87
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
finds out instantly

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,280
if someone dates someone

89
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
or

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,600
someone dumps someone else.

91
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
That's just you.

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,920
Unlike me,

93
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
I don't know anything.

94
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,840
Okay.

95
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,400
Since you're back,

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
adjust your mindset

97
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
and work.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,960
Okay?

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,360
But Zhao Yan,

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
I have to say this to you.

101
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,400
You have to know your place.

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,040
Mr. Xu Jr. is different.

103
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,520
He's up here

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,720
and you're down here.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,440
That's the difference.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,600
You know?

107
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Manager Wei,

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,320
I just realized that

109
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,800
your current position doesn't show
your full potential.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You should be a paparazzi.

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
You'd be leading the field.

112
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,040
I'll give it a try if I have a chance.

113
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,680
But as of now,

114
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,960
get me a cup of water.

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,840
Why?

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm your boss.

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,000
And I'm ordering you to get me a cup of water.

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
Right now.

119
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,760
Bring it to my office.

120
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,000
I...

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Mr. Xu.

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,360
Mr. Xu.

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,280
Why are you here?

124
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,880
Mr. Xu.

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,880
Wei Zi Zhao.

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,880
You

127
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,400
don't deserve to be the department manager.

128
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,160
Listen up, everyone.

129
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,280
From now on,

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,600
Wei Zi Zhao and Zhao Yan

131
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,680
will swap positions.

132
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,560
Zhao Yan

133
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
will be your manager.

134
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Understand?

135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
Greetings, Manager Zhao.

136
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,480
The weather's so nice. Let's go.

137
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,520
Um...

138
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Congratulations, Manager Zhao.

139
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,160
That

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,720
is pretty sweet.

141
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
(Did I)

142
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,080
(cross the line just now?)

143
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,840
(I hope I didn't upset you.)

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,960
(You've never been this charismatic before.)

145
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,800
So charismatic.

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
So charismatic.

147
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
Take a break and have some food.

148
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,560
Did I tell you that I wanted to eat?

149
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Take this to the client.

150
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,240
I can...

151
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,920
Okay.

152
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,760
What's wrong with Boss?

153
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,520
Did you do anything wrong?

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,480
Boss,

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
it's break time.

156
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to have lunch with you

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,480
and get some sun together.

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm busy.

159
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Do you plan on treating me like this forever?

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,080
What did I do wrong?

161
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,640
You didn't do anything wrong.

162
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,000
Then why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

163
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
Although you're on lunch break,

164
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm still working.

165
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,960
Get out.

166
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,520
Boss's condition hasn't been good recently.

167
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
I agree.

168
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
It's scary.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Come on, let's work.

170
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,040
We'd better not get caught,

171
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,520
or we'd be scolded again.

172
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,440
Poor Xiao Ning.

173
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,520
(You already skipped lunch.)

174
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,480
(You can't skip dinner again, right?)

175
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,880
(I don't have time.)

176
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,600
(You haven't tutored me)

177
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,840
(in a long time.)

178
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
(Let's talk about it tonight.)

179
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,360
Yan Yan.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,680
You haven't left yet?

181
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,640
I was waiting for you.

182
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,960
Why were you waiting for me?

183
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,480
Come to the hospital with me.

184
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,280
Why?

185
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,920
There's no why.

186
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,600
You must go.

187
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,520
I was just talking about a what-if scenario.

188
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
Look how strong and healthy I am.

189
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,200
How could I possibly be sick?

190
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,000
Then why did you

191
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,280
say strange things like that?

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,040
I was just casually bringing it up.

193
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,800
Then just

194
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
consider it a check-up.

195
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,880
But I'm healthy.

196
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,280
Why do I need a check-up?

197
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,880
Then just take it as a

198
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,960
premarital health screening that we didn't have
before getting married.

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
If you're not going, then don't come home tonight.

200
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,280
I'll go. I'll go.

201
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
So speaking to you nicely doesn't work.

202
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,040
I just didn't think that you would
care about me this much.

203
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
You love me so much, don't you?

204
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,920
You're acting like a whole different
person recently.

205
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,040
Do your work.

206
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,200
This shouldn't be

207
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
how you talk to your girlfriend.

208
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
You're here to get tutored.

209
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,360
But...

210
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,400
Do your work.

211
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
I don't want to do it anymore. Don't have the mood.

212
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,720
You won't even talk to me.

213
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,760
Why should I do it?

214
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,360
Are you here to learn?

215
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,040
Are you not going to become

216
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,400
an architect designer without me?

217
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,640
Then what about

218
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,360
everything you told me before?

219
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
Was it a joke?

220
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Jiang Xiao Ning,

221
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
this is your path.

222
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,080
No one can take it away from you.

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,880
If I were you,

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
nothing

225
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,280
will ever

226
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,680
make me change my mind.

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,920
I wasn't serious about what I just said.

228
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,320
What's wrong?

229
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
Did something happen to you?

230
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,120
Tell me.

231
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,200
We'll face it together.

232
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
It's getting late.

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,800
You can leave early

234
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
if you're done.

235
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
Ice Cream.

236
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,960
What happened?

237
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,760
According to the observatory,

238
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,600
we'll have a supermoon

239
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,040
in three days if the weather is good.

240
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,920
The supermoon is a once-in-a-century phenomenon

241
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
and will be visible to the naked eye.

242
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,440
(The supermoon is coming.)
It will be

243
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,600
(The supermoon is coming.)
the closest the moon will be to the Earth

244
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,640
in three centuries.

245
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
If you miss it this time around,

246
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,440
you'll have to wait until

247
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
2125 for the next time.

248
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,240
Let's watch it together, Wifey.

249
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
I have to work overtime.

250
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,520
You're the manager now.

251
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,240
You have the final say.

252
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,640
Let's take Gu Chuan

253
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,440
and Jiang Xiao Ning.

254
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,920
Just like what we did when we watched
the ephemeral plants.

255
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
The four of us will watch the moon and drink.

256
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Maybe take some pictures and have
conversations about life.

257
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,040
That would be nice.

258
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
You have to do your check-up first.

259
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,360
Talk about it later.

260
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,000
(In-patient Department for Cats)

261
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
Someone sign this please.

262
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,800
I got it.

263
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,200
Doctor,

264
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
how is the cat doing?

265
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,200
We have to observe it for a few more days.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,760
Thank you.

267
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,160
Don't worry, we'll try our best.

268
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Let's go back first.

269
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,680
Ice Cream,

270
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,920
stay strong.

271
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,960
We'll come get you home

272
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
once you're well.

273
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,320
You got this.

274
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,440
Let's go.

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,360
Hi, sign this for me please.

276
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,040
According to the observatory,

277
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,840
we'll have a supermoon in three days

278
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,320
if the weather is good.

279
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,080
The supermoon is a once-in-a-century phenomenon

280
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,840
and will be visible to the naked eye.

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,560
It will be

282
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,960
the closest the moon will be to the Earth

283
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,920
in three centuries.

284
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
If you miss it this time around,

285
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,720
you'll have to wait until

286
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,040
(The supermoon is coming.)
2125 for the next time.

287
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,760
Did you hear that?

288
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,680
There will be a

289
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,440
once-in-three-centuries supermoon.

290
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,280
(You should always stay this happy.)

291
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,800
(This is how your life should go.)

292
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,040
(Full of hope and happiness.)

293
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
(Xiao Xu)

294
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,520
Hello?

295
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,800
Xiao Xu.

296
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,880
Do you have time today?

297
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
Come have lunch together.

298
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,200
I just learned to make Dynamite Stir-fry Shrimp.

299
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
Come and give it a try.

300
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,080
I don't have time.

301
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,200
It's just lunch.

302
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,040
You can go once you're finished. I won't keep you here.

303
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay?

304
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,640
I've been busy.

305
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Wait till I have time.

306
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:09,880
Then,

307
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,800
what about I bring it to you?

308
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,440
Hello.

309
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,840
Do you mind

310
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,120
getting Tang Xu for me?

311
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,360
Okay, one moment, please.

312
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,760
Hey...

313
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
Hear me out.

314
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,040
I've told you countless times.

315
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,520
Don't come here looking for me.

316
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,360
Okay?

317
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm only here to bring you food.

318
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,720
I've been very annoyed recently.

319
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,320
I beg you to not come here ever again,

320
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,040
alright?

321
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,960
Do you know

322
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,080
how these people

323
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,480
would judge me every time you're here?

324
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
How?

325
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Me.

326
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,520
The son of a criminal.

327
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
You hear that?

328
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,200
Please, I really haven't been having

329
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,400
a good time recently.

330
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Please don't make it worse.

331
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,440
Alright?

332
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
I'm going to go. You can go home.

333
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,440
Okay.

334
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,040
You must be Uncle Tang.

335
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm Xu Cheng Ran.

336
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,800
Xu Guo Xiang's son?

337
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,520
You don't look alike.

338
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,840
I look more like my mom.

339
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,040
Are you leaving?

340
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,920
Let me drive you home.

341
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,880
There's no need.

342
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,680
I have time.

343
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,760
I'll drive him home.

344
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,040
I thought the Financial Department

345
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,920
is verifying your accounting records.

346
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,240
You'll probably be working overtime.

347
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,360
Let me do it.

348
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,440
Let's go, Uncle Tang.

349
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,040
Don't forget to eat.

350
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,360
Uncle Tang,

351
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,440
I can see that you treat Tang Xu very well.

352
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,640
Xiao Xu

353
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
treats me well too.

354
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,080
He's just

355
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,640
too busy.

356
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,680
He doesn't have time.

357
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,040
He has been struggling a bit

358
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,120
these days.

359
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
How did you recognize that

360
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,440
I'm his father?

361
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,320
I've seen pictures of you.

362
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,360
If you want to

363
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,040
ask me anything,

364
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,440
just ask.

365
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,480
How did you figure out that

366
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,560
I have questions for you?

367
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,840
Or else,

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,840
why would you drive me home?

369
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,840
I've only heard about the event regarding

370
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,640
Jiang Xiao Ning's father, Jiang Guang Da.

371
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
But I don't know the details.

372
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,120
You were directly involved.

373
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,560
You must know the details.

374
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
I'm just curious.

375
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,960
I want to hear it from you.

376
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,120
Did Jiang Xiao Ning's father

377
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
really embezzle money?

378
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,280
Uncle Tang.

379
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,080
Has your father ever mentioned me?

380
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,960
No.

381
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,480
Your father,

382
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,280
Jiang Guang Da,

383
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,880
and I

384
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,200
were co-workers

385
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
at the same company.

386
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,840
Your father was our boss.

387
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
I know.

388
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,880
How would the boss

389
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,400
not know if someone working for him

390
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,480
embezzled public money?

391
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,440
So you're saying that...

392
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,040
If the water of a pond is dirty,

393
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,840
the fish in there

394
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,040
wouldn't be any cleaner.

395
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,920
Mr. Gu,

396
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,040
I thought you had changed a lot

397
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,240
the last time I saw you.

398
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,560
How come this time...

399
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
Things change.

400
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,600
Then for the design...

401
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,600
No more changes.

402
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,640
Okay.

403
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
I mentioned to you last time that

404
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,160
you would need some documentation

405
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,520
to purchase a cemetery plot.

406
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Such as death certificate,

407
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,520
cremation documents...

408
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,680
I'll have all those.

409
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,350

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,000

(Patent Transfer Agreement)

413
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,660
(Transferor: Gu Chuan)

414
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,480
Doctor,

415
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,760
how is its recovery going?

416
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,440
Not good.

417
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
The bacteria have already entered its kidneys.

418
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,920
It hasn't eaten for days.

419
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,400
According to the current situation,

420
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
it should stay in the hospital

421
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,160
for a few more days.

422
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
Please make sure that it's cured.

423
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,520
Don't worry.

424
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,640
I'll try my best.

425
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,320
But

426
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,680
I can't guarantee you anything.

427
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,840
It all depends on how it reacts.

428
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
Stay strong.

429
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,240
We'll help you

430
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,400
get better no matter what.

431
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,280
Keep it up.

432
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

433
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,480
Are you still at the hospital?

434
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,440
Ice Cream isn't

435
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,880
doing well.

436
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,800
Listen to whatever the doctor says.

437
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,480
Accept the reality.

438
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,600
I'm sure it'll be okay.

439
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,720
The things that are meant to happen

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
will always happen.

441
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,440
No...

442
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,920
How can you say something like that?

443
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,520
At a time like this,

444
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,440
can't you just say something

445
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
comforting?

446
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,360
Jiang Xiao Ning,

447
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,280
those words

448
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,640
won't solve any problems.

449
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,080
Maybe,

450
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,120
you really just have to accept it.

451
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,080
Ice Cream.

452
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
It's okay.

453
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,000
Stay strong.

454
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,240
I'll take you home when you're better.

455
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,360
Chuan,

456
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
what exactly do you want to do?

457
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
I'm just trying to get things ready

458
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,840
before I die.

459
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,640
Aren't you okay

460
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,280
for the time being?

461
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,400
I have already contacted

462
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,840
other researchers who study
the mechanical heart.

463
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,200
People are looking for solutions.

464
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,240
You talked about death

465
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,320
when you got the Jin An Award.

466
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,600
Jiang Xiao Ning spent so much effort

467
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,800
to change your mind.

468
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
Why are you doing these crazy things?

469
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,520
Are you really planning for your

470
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,440
funeral arrangements?

471
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,080
I don't know when

472
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,320
my life will come to an end.

473
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,040
I don't know when I'll die.

474
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
It's better to be prepared

475
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
than to panic

476
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,800
when the time comes.

477
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
For the past ten years,

478
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,280
all I have is doing the work

479
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,520
that I love...

480
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
You have me.

481
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,920
Of course,

482
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,960
I also have you

483
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,720
and my parents.

484
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
But other than that,

485
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,160
my life is so boring.

486
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
Ten years ago,

487
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,960
we went through the car accident together.

488
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,280
Destiny got us to meet again

489
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,680
to give me a reason

490
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
to continue living.

491
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,200
I just didn't expect that

492
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,480
I would have to say goodbye

493
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
to this world so soon.

494
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,880
It's too cruel.

495
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,840
Chuan,

496
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,640
I don't believe that

497
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,840
there is no one better

498
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
than Dr. Peer in this world.

499
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,480
Everything will be solved

500
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,280
when we get in contact

501
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,040
with other mechanical heart researchers.

502
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,720
If that's the case,

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
then why didn't the funders of the lab

504
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,080
invite them over?

505
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,520
Life won't last forever.

506
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm very fortunate

507
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,000
to live ten more years than I was supposed to.

508
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,440
If you think that you can get away

509
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,200
with saying all that,

510
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,440
you're wrong.

511
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,560
Take all the bollocks back.

512
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm going to burn

513
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,120
all of these bollocks documents.

514
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,480
I ask you to come today

515
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
to ask you to do me a favor.

516
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,120
I won't help you.

517
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,760
If you don't help me,

518
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,920
I'll ask others to help.

519
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,760
Don't worry.

520
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,240
I'm just trying

521
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,560
to be prepared.

522
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,360
Just

523
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,960
do your brother a favor.

524
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,480
Help me make these arrangements.

525
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,480
Okay?

526
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,440
So is this what

527
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,600
you think would be the best

528
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,200
for your parents and Jiang Xiao Ning?

529
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,760
Have you ever thought about

530
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,280
what they really want?

531
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,480
Jiang Xiao Ning did so much for you

532
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,040
these days.

533
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,160
What about you?

534
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
What did you do for her?

535
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,000
Hello, Boss.

536
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,320
Are you not up?

537
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,400
I've been waiting downstairs

538
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,400
for a while.

539
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,760
You're already at the studio?

540
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,480
The colors of the glass

541
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,160
will match the different areas
they correspond to.

542
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,360
This isn't just to make the appearance

543
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,640
more synchronized.

544
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,040
The refraction of the light

545
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,280
will help emphasize

546
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:06,960
the differentiation

547
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,280
of these areas.

548
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
The look will be different

549
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,720
based on

550
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,480
different weather conditions.

551
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,360
On our end,

552
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,480
we have to first confirm that

553
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,640
the glass has the right color and material.

554
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,360
Only after this step,

555
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,080
can the construction team start working.

556
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,960
Cheng Dong,

557
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
you'll be in charge of this one.

558
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,120
Yes.

559
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,760
Boss,

560
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,040
the food is here.

561
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Who let you in?

562
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
You told me to

563
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
get food for everyone.

564
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,160
Do you think

565
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,080
this is the right time to come in?

566
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,360
I'm sorry.

567
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,920
I'll take it out now.

568
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,640
What happened?

569
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
I don't know.

570
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
Mr. Gu is

571
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
the original Mr. Gu again.

572
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,480
Maybe this version of Mr. Gu

573
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,040
is the true Mr. Gu.

574
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,320
Is that some tongue twister?

575
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,120
You don't understand.

576
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,320
Also,

577
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,680
I'm not satisfied

578
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,520
with this design.

579
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
Who made this?

580
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,280
(I have things to tell you.)

581
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,120
What's wrong?

582
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,680
What do you want to say?

583
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,360
Your attitude.

584
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,880
You're ignoring me.

585
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,120
You don't look like

586
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
you like me at all.

587
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,200
You have to apologize to me

588
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,040
for all that.

589
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,200
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

590
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
If there is anything,

591
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,240
you can talk to me about it.

592
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
Maybe I won't be able to help.

593
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,200
But at least,

594
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,520
we can face it together.

595
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,200
You've been avoiding me these days.

596
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,400
You stay far away

597
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,760
even you're tutoring me.

598
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,640
I'm used to being alone.

599
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't feel comfortable

600
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,800
when someone else is in my house.

601
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,400
What do you mean?

602
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,560
You told me that you like me.

603
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,680
Now you're telling me to leave.

604
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,480
Gu Chuan,

605
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm a simple person.

606
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm okay with you disliking me.

607
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,760
And you can deny

608
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,880
my value as a person.

609
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,800
But I'm

610
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,160
a living person.

611
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,240
You can't just

612
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
tell me to come and leave whenever you want.

613
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,200
Do you not think that this is not okay?

614
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,360
So you want to break up with me?

615
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,560
Then tell me.

616
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,600
I've always thought that

617
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,280
I'm the most unlucky person.

all the bad luck I've experienced

621
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400

Yes, I'm dumb.

688

Dumb.

689
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,160
Did you watch some random soap drama

690
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,800

694
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,320

we should break up.

719
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,600
Why?

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,720
some coincidental things happened

724
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,120
and it made me feel like

725
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,440
I like you.

726
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm very clear-headed now

727
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,280

728
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
how I truly feel.

729
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,600
I didn't want to make it too blunt.

730
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,160
But I realized that
