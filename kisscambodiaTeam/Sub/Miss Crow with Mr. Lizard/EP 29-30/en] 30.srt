Are you Mr. Gu?

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
You need a driver, right?

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,360
Gu...

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,680
You were right.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,800
But this isn't the only way

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,600
to get

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,039
to any part of the world.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm emboldened by drinking.

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,760
All my gratitude

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,080
can be expressed with this hug.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Boss, give me your hand.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,240
Hold on.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,160
Can I be included

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,320
in your future plans?

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,840
That's because

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,240
I like you.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,480
I'd like to buy something from you.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,640
What?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,720
Your smile for today.

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
How could you do this?

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,000
I wasn't mentally prepared.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
Am I dreaming?

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520
I can tell you this again

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,600
in all seriousness.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
Jiang Xiao Ning, I like you.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,960
Hello.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
Do you need help?

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,160
No, you can go.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm tired.

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Don't talk to me.

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Eat something and get some rest.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,520
Did I say that I wanted to eat?

53
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Take this to the client.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
I'll go.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,400
Don't give up on me.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Stop pushing me away, okay?

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,640
Yan Yan!

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,320
Yan Yan!

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Yan Yan!

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Where's Xiao Ning?

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
Is she all right?

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,160
Gu Chuan wants to break up
with Xiao Ning.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,040
Why?

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
How would I know

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
the reason?

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
Look, Xu Cheng Ran.

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,480
Your stupid friend, Gu Chuan.

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm going to kick his ass!

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,200
Yan Yan.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,160
Calm down.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Hear me out.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,440
Gu Chuan has his own reason.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,200
What is it?

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,920
Does he also have cancer?

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
You two sure are good friends

76
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,520
to come up with the same excuse.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
It's not like that.

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Gu Chuan...

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
(Insufficient Charge)

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm going to find him.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,960
Go on.

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,840
Don't ever come back if you go.

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,920
Chuan!

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
Why are you doing this?

85
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
You love her.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,200
Why do you

87
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
have to torment each other?

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,640
Chuan!

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Shoot.

90
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
(Charging)

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,200
You gave me a real scare.

92
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,840
I thought

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,400
you were gone.

94
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,120
Gu Chuan, tell me.

95
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
What are you trying to do?

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,000
You won't even recharge it.

97
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
Do you have a death wish?

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
If you keep this going,

99
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm going to beat your up.

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,800
Fine.

101
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,240
Even if you don't care

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,400
about your own life,

103
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,160
you should at least
think about my feelings.

104
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,160
At least,

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
be responsible to me.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm begging you.

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
Stop hurting me.

108
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm not young anymore.

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,240
My heart can't take

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
such a big blow.

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080

Come to the hospital now.

142
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,760
The doctor said Ice Cream is dying.

143
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,000
(Ai-Bi Pet Hospital)

144
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
How is it?

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
Finally, you came.

146
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
Ice Cream's condition is getting worse.

147
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,640
We've tried all possible means.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
There's nothing I can do now.

149
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,560
Are you saying

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,640
that we should transfer him to another hospital?

151
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,680
I'll be honest with you.

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,400
Its organs

153
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
are failing.

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
Even if you had him transferred,

155
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,560
it wouldn't change the fact.

156
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,080
Here's my suggestion.

157
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
Euthanise him.

158
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,000
Euthanise him?

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
No.

160
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
I disagree.

161
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
Is there no other way?

162
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
It's the only option.

163
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,760
The decision is in your hands.

164
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,880
I agree.

165
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,240
Who are you to decide?

166
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
You can discuss it first.

167
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,880
Look at him.

168
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,360
He's suffering.

169
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,920
Since there's no hope,

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,880
why not let him go

171
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
and set him free sooner?

172
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
Are you trying to take away

173
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,200
his final moment?

174
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,560
It's his most painful moment.

175
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,640
How do you know he's suffering?

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,200
He may be using this time

177
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,840
to say goodbye to the world.

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
Perhaps, he doesn't want to leave.

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,480
That's why he's still holding on.

180
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,800
Whatever the reason,

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,960
it's his own choice.

182
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,240
He doesn't have a choice.

183
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Besides, he can't talk.

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
He can't tell you

185
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,280
how painful it is for him.

186
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,640
I can tell

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
he doesn't want to leave.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,840
He wants us to save him.

189
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,520
How about this?

190
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
I'll talk to the doctor

191
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,520
and see

192
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,960
if there's a better option.

193
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
Ice Cream.

194
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,040
You'll be fine.

195
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,680
I'll be with you.

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
I won't let anyone hurt you.

197
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,200
You'll get better. I'm sure.

198
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,240
Should we

199
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,840
give him a name?

200
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,200
Look.

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Your last name is Gu,

202
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,560
and mine is Jiang.

203
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Gu Gu.

204
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,440
Jiang Jiang.

205
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
I disagree with that name.

206
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
How about Ice Cream?

207
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,960
We found him

208
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
when we were having ice cream.

209
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,040
How about Ice Cream?

Gu Chuan.

214
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
Give Ice Cream back to me.

215
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Pick up the phone.

216
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,800
You're back, my baby Ning.

217
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,080
Xiao Ning.

218
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,200
Here. Eat up.

219
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,000
Mom.

220
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,760
This is for Ning Ning.

221
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,600
(Want to come and have a look at Ice Cream?)

222
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,960
Aunt, take care of Grandma.

223
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm going out for a bit.

224
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,200
Jiang Xiao Ning, where are you going?

(Pet Cemetery)

227
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,200
I have something to say to you.

228
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,920
I didn't prepare anything

229
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,200
but I don't want to go
to the office anymore.

230
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,800
So I can't hand in

231
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
the resignation letter to you myself.

232
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,560
I hereby

233
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,080
give you my verbal resignation.

234
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,760
You should continue to work there.

235
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,400
I muster up the courage to be with you.

236
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,720
I didn't care

237
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,920
what people thought of me.

238
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,480
But I realized

239
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,040
I was wrong.

240
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,160
Indeed, a mechanical heart is cold.

241
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,120
It's no use no matter how hard I try

242
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
to warm it up.

243
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,880
When you broke up with me,

244
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,400
I thought it was an act of impulse

245
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
and that you were just throwing tantrums.

246
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,000
I thought

247
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,280
you would surely come back to me.

248
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,160
Everything

249
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,640
would go back to how it was.

250
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,520
But

251
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,960
what happened with Ice Cream,

252
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,400
you really let me down.

253
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,320
You don't care

254
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,760
how others feel at all.

255
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,000
That's right.

256
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
That's me.

257
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,840
You finally admit it.

258
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,160
Well.

259
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,680
Let's hit the brakes

260
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
on our relationship.

261
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,960
Is there still hope?

262
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
There's no other way.

263
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,280
And all his organs

264
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,240
are inflamed.

265
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,000
It's suffering.

266
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,120
You can think about it.

267
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I agree.

268
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,960
I agree with euthanasia.

It's me,

299

not Jiang Xiao Ning.

Stop dreaming.

301

If you don't want her to go,

302
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,160
get her back.

303
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,480
Jiang Xiao Ning is a reasonable person.

The fluctuations

309
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,520
are greater than ever before.

310
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,360
Shall I move in with you?

311
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,880
I'm worried about you living alone.

312
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,840
I'm fine.

313
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,240
Go back to the office.

Look at you now.

Stop worrying about the company.

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,760
If your condition isn't taken care of,

318
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,360
I can't be bothered with anything else.

319
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,440
Do you have any news

320
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,960
of Jiang Xiao Ning?

321
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,800
How is she?

322
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,640
I have asked Yan Yan.

323
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,040
She has no idea as well.

324
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,480
If you're worried,

325
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
you should

326
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,920
call her yourself.

327
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,760
I was just asking.

328
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,000
Get a good rest.

329
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,960
Without you at work,

330
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,440
it won't go bankrupt any time soon.

331
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,360
(I have to get used to the days without her.)

332
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,840
Director Xu.

333
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,720
Director Xu.

334
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,720
You wanted to see me?

335
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,720
About the company that I gave you.

336
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
You can't just leave it dormant.

337
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,240
There's no business lately.

338
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,360
Besides,

339
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
isn't that company

340
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,440
used for money laundering?

341
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,400
It's exactly

342
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,040
because of that,

343
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,720
you can't just leave it dormant.

344
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,840
It's too obvious.

345
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,120
Got it?

346
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,560
I'll need your help

347
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,720
with another transaction soon.

348
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,480
Director Xu.

349
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,320
The scale of the operation
of the branch office is small

350
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,840
and the transaction dates

351
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,040
are too close.

352
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm afraid if we keep doing it,

353
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
our accounts will be audited soon.

354
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,520
Use your noodle.

355
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
Think of a way.

356
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,720
Got it.

357
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,960
Well, I'll figure things out.

358
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,000
Go.

359
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,520
Director Xu.

360
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,600
About that incident,

361
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,200
I beg you to trust me once again.

362
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,280
Do I not trust you enough?

363
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,480
It's not that, Director Xu.

364
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,720
Besides money laundering,

365
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,560
I can do

366
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,120
other things that can benefit the group.

367
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,120
If you give me free rein

368
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,760
and let me run the branch,

369
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
I can make it prosper.

370
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,280
Director Xu.

371
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,080
Trust me.

372
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,040
I can make more money for you.

373
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,040
I won't let you down again.

374
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,200
What matters is to find your own position.

375
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,120
Got it?

376
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,920
Just do what you're doing

377
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,880
and do it right.

378
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,480
What do the group's affairs

379
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
have to do with you?

380
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,400
It's none of your concern.

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,520
Do you not understand

382
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,880
what I said?

383
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,320
I understand.

384
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,520
Mr. Tang.

385
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,200
Get lost.

386
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,560
Get lost!

387
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,000
Hello?

388
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,240
When are you free

389
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,560
to come back?

390
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,640
I'm not sure

391
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,280
if you still want some of these things.

392
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,480
I'll see if I have time tomorrow.

393
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,040
Hi, what would you like to drink?

394
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Give me two of those.

395
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Two cups of cherry and berry?

396
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,880
Yes.

397
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,560
A moment, please.

398
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,560
Hold on.

399
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,600
It's fine.

400
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,560
I'll have two of those.

401
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,280
Your aunt and your grandma are asleep.

402
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,320
Thank you.

403
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,760
Go home.

404
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,760
You don't have to stay.

405
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
What is it? Trying to kick me out?

406
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,440
You'll need an audience to watch you cry.

407
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,720
Look, Jiang Xiao Ning.

408
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,560
No matter what happens in the future,

409
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,400
don't ever turn off your phone again.

410
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,080
Do you know

411
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:54,840
how worried I was

412
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,160
when I was looking for you?

413
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,440
I didn't want to

414
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,520
but as soon as I turned it on,
I would start wondering

415
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
if he had contacted me.

416
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,600
Was his phone broken?

417
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,040
Was there no signal?

418
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,480
Was there a bug problem on WeChat?

419
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,640
I kept expecting to hear from him.

420
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,680
Have you told your aunt?

421
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,520
Not yet.

422
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,120
I didn't want her to worry.

423
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,360
I came home

424
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,480
only after I had cried my eyes out.

425
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,200
I'm afraid she will find fault

426
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,880
with Gu Chuan after seeing me like this.

427
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,480
He has put you through so much pain,

428
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,360
and you're concerned about him?

429
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,640
Has he considered how you feel?

430
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,040
This is your first love.

431
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,680
I thought

432
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,960
you had found your Mr. Right.

433
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
But turns out, he's a scumbag.

434
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
He didn't even have the guts to ask for a breakup.

435
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,160
I never thought

436
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
my first love would end just like that.

437
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,720
It feels like it was just yesterday

438
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,960
when I mustered up the courage
to confess to him.

439
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
But

440
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,280
that's how first love is supposed to be.

441
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,720
There's no happy ending for it.

442
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
It's not that you have bad taste in men.

443
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,160
It's Gu Chuan's fault.

444
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,120
I don't blame him.

445
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,160
The only thing I was mad about

446
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,160
is the way he handled Ice Cream's situation.

447
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,360
I don't blame him

448
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,720
about us.

449
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,920
Did you cry too much that you lost your mind?

450
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,160
Regardless,

451
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
it's all over.

452
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,360
The only thing I can do

453
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,320
is to accept it.

454
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,920
Don't you want to teach him a lesson?

455
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,480
You might think

456
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,440
that I'm a fool in love

457
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,480
to believe him in everything.

458
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,120
But I know

459
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,640
what kind of guy he is,

460
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
his character

461
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,920
and his personality.

462
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,280
He never meant to hurt me.

463
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,120
Come on. Look around you.

464
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,040
You were dumped.

465
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,640
In public!

466
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,680
How could you act

467
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,560
like nothing ever happened

468
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,320

Let's think about tomorrow.

482
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,320
I have a family to support.

483
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,159
I'm planning to find a job tomorrow.

484
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,440
Why do you need to find a job?

485
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,880
Your current job is good, right?

486
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,520
Don't you love

487
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,400
your current job?

488
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,440
Why should you quit?

489
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,480
Sister Wen Wen did tell me

490
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,320
to be careful with workplace romance.

491
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,639
Things would be awkward after the breakup.

492
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,639
I'm not afraid of what people say.

493
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,679
I just dare not face Gu Chuan.

494
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,840
What's there to be afraid of?

495
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,679
Listen to me.

496
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,560
Go to work.

497
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,920
Keep showing up in front of him.

498
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,280
Let's see who gets drained first.

499
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm not as tough

500
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,600
as you are.

501
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,320
I prefer to save myself

502
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,960
one last bit of dignity.

503
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,800
But you have

504
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,880
a tough best friend.

505
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,840
Also, when you were

506
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,920
doing part-time jobs,

507
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,160
you endured all kinds of hardship

508
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,960
and did all sorts of embarrassing stuff.

509
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,680
And now

510
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,720
you're talking about dignity?

511
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,760
Take my advice.

512
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,640
Go.

513
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,720
Go to work.

514
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,080
Go.

515
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
But I don't want to put Gu Chuan in a bad spot.

516
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,440
Xiao Ning.

517
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,040
Can you stop being so sensible?

518
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,280
Whenever I see you

519
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,600
being so sensible,

520
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,000
it makes me feel

521
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,200
sullen

522
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
and so mad.

523
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
I find it so unfair to you.

524
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
Do you know that?

525
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
Go to work.

526
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,320
It's a must.

527
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,200
If not, I'll break up with you.

528
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,560
Go to bed.

529
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,240
Xiao Xu.

530
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,080
You're here. Come on in.

531
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,320
Come on in.

532
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,560
I just want you

533
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,280
to come back and take a look at these things.

534
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
It's been a while

535
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,560
since you last opened the storeroom, right?

536
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,560
So I thought

537
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,040
of cleaning up the place.

538
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,040
When I opened it,

539
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,120
I found all these.

540
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,640
Look.

541
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,800
These are your trophies,

542
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,520
honorary credentials,

543
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,800
and also

544
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Certificate of Merit.

545
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,960
The video game.

546
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,680
This is a picture of you and Ning Ning.

547
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,960
That's right.

548
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,200
Since you were a kid,

549
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,760
you've been

550
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,240
a really good kid.

551
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,480
Be it your studies

552
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,960
or any other aspects,

553
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,360
your mom and I

554
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,280
never had to worry about you.

555
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,320
You know what? Back then,

556
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,560
the happiest thing for your mom and I

557
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
was to attend the parent-teacher meetings.

558
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,560
Sorry.

559
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,600
If it hadn't been for me,

560
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,400
you would have a better future prospect.

561
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,560
I was the one who ruined it.

562
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,680
I know things must have been tough

563
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,320
for you

564
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,400
all these years

565
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,400
although you were living in a rich family.

566
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,920
Like you said,

567
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,960
Xu Guo Xiang was nice to you.

568
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,920
But still, it's nothing like home.

569
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,880
I can only imagine what it was like

570
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,440
to live under someone else's roof.

571
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,600
Sorry.

572
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,440
If you're not working late tonight,

573
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,720
stay and have dinner.

574
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,360
So you agreed?

575
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,560
It's fine.

576
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,240
I'll buy some nice ingredients.

577
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Wait for me.

578
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,720
(Job boards)

579
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,680
Sister Wen Wen.

580
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,120
Xiao Ning.

581
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,160
I'm back.

582
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,080
How are you? Is everything okay?

583
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm...

584
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,400
not doing great.

585
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
What happened?

586
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,440
Did you fight with Gu Chuan?

587
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,960
Where is he?

588
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,400
He's probably at work.

589
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,640
I...

590
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,520
I resigned.

591
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,800
You resigned?

592
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,280
You were right.

593
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,240
After the office romance ended,

594
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,560
things do get awkward.

595
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,000
I've been thinking about it lately.

596
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,160
I have no courage to go back to work.

597
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,960
Jiang Xiao Ning, that's so silly of you.

598
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,520
A relationship is about two persons.

599
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,440
Why are you the one

600
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
to bear the consequences after the breakup?

601
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,040
Why are you the one to resign?

602
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,560
But I...

603
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,880
But what?

604
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,080
Since you had the courage to confess to him

605
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,680
and to start a relationship,

606
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,560
you should have the courage

607
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,120
to face the consequences.

608
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,200
I don't know

609
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,560
why he broke up with you.

610
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,800
But resignation

611
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,400
isn't advisable

612
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,640
unless he sacks you.

613
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,600
But if he did,

614
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,760
he wouldn't be the Gu Chuan

615
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,080
that I knew.

616
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,920
So, you mean I should go back to work?

617
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,520
A breakup simply means a different way

618
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,920
to get along with each other.

619
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,480
Since he can accept it,

620
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,200
why can't you?

621
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,560
I'm afraid...

622
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,040
Of what?

623
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,840
It's not like he's bedridden

624
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,720
in the hospital

625
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,480
and has sunk into depression
that he can't take care of himself.

626
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,200
He still goes to work like usual.

627
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,840
Why are you

628
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,080
