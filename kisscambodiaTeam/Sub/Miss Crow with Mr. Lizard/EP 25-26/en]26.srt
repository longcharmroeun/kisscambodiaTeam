21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,440
Hello, Brother Xu?

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,920
All right.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,280
Give me a moment. I'll come right away.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,000
These are for you.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
Brother Xu.

26
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,000
You need to stop buying me gifts.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm running out of space at home.

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,520
Don't worry.

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,640
I can support myself

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,200
and I can take care of my family.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
This is the gift card you gave me.

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,600
I'm giving it back.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,000
It's for you, Xiao Ning.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
I insist.

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't want to rely on others.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,640
Xiao Ning.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,760
I just joined

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,840
a design company.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Would you

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
like to work for me?

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
This is my second time asking you.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,200
Brother Xu.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't put me in a bad spot.

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,320
I like my current workplace.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,240
But Gu Chuan

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,280
will never be like me.

47
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,160
I'll give you

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,200
all the space you want.

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,560
You should know.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm starting to take over

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,200
the operation of Reindeer Group.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,480
When I become the CEO,

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,280
you can come.

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,120
I'll set up the best

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,920
design studio

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
for you alone.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Brother Xu.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm glad to see

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,920
that you're doing well now.

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,320
But

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
I want to follow my own path.

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,000
It's more down-to-earth

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
and more practical.

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
Do I not sound practical?

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Don't get me wrong.

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,960
That's not what I meant.

67
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
Everyone wants success.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,400
This is the ultimate goal

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
for most people.

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,680
But I'm well aware

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,320
of the path that a designer has to go through.

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,560
This profession

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
is like architecture itself.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
It needs a solid foundation.

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
If the foundation is not strong,

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,000
one day, it'll collapse

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
no matter how gorgeous the design is.

78
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,840
So, in order to lay a good foundation,

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,280
I have to take things one day at a time.

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,800
That's the path that most people

81
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,440
have to take.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
But not you.

83
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,960
Because you have me.

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
Have we not had enough misfortune

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,560
over the years?

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,560
We've endured a lot of pain

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
that people at our age couldn't.

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,120
Only you and I

89
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,840
know this pain, isn't it?

90
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,880
Xiao Ning.

91
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Don't be silly.

92
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
This is a rare opportunity.

93
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,360
Seize it.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
Also, you have to trust me.

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
I swear to you

96
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,880
I can keep my words.

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
I can't digest

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
so much information now.

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
I want to focus on my exam now.

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
Let's talk about it next time.

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,360
Sure.

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,440
I won't bother you then.

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,120
But I want you to know this.

104
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
No matter where and when,

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,680
I'll always be by your side.

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
Thank you, Brother Xu.

107
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
Well, I'll get going.

108
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Let's talk again.

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Drive safe.

110
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,040
Did you catch a cold?

111
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
How about a cup of 666?

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,040
Thank you, Xiao Ning.

113
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
What I need now

114
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,440
isn't a cold remedy.

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
What I need is sleep.

116
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,200
Cold remedies can treat colds.

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,200
But look at the dark circles.

118
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
I sleep until noon

119
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,200
every Saturday.

120
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,680
I finally had two days

121
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
of beauty sleep.

122
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,960
Working overtime

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
is simply destroying my youth.

124
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
I really miss my bed.

125
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm currently at the site of the

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
architectural scheme bidding meeting

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
of the Reindeer Group

128
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
in Jiangdong City Business North District.

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm bringing you live news

130
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,840
from caijing.com.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,560
(Reindeer Group) (Jiangdong City Business)
The companies

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
(North District Architectural Scheme Bidding Meeting)
participating in

133
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
the bid today include Chuan Design Studio,
Zhi Mu Group, et cetera.

134
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,600
Please wait for a moment.

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
I will notify you in advance

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
when you're up next.

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

138
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,560
It's just a bidding meeting.

139
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Can't it be done in the company

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,920
conference room?

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
Instead, they're doing it here.

142
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
How ostentatious.

143
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,920
Such a waste of our money.

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
If it were you,

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,480
it would be way more than this.

146
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
That's for sure.

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,840
I just couldn't stand him.

148
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,200
Chuan.

149
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,040
The ball is in your court now.

150
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,480
Trust me.

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,120
Boss, drink some water.

152
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,160
Thank you.

153
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Sister Man Lin.

154
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,200
Sister Man Lin?

155
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,160
What is it?

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,680
Drink some water.

157
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,120
Sorry, Sister Man Lin.

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
Man Lin, what's wrong?

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,800
Are you nervous?

160
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,280
You're not going on the stage.

161
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Gu Chuan will be there.

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm fine.

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,720
Hi, Mr. Gu.

164
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,440
Please come with me.

165
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,880
Sure.

166
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,480
Chuan.

167
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
This is similar to ours.

168
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,840
This is not just similarity.

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,800
Even a layman

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,080
can tell the degree of similarity.

171
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,680
What happened to the design?

172
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,920
We're screwed.

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Did someone

174
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
plot against our company?

175
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
There are so many journalists.

176
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
What do we do?

177
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,320
Why would this happen?

178
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,000
Chuan.

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
To leave or to stay?

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,760
You call the shots.

181
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,960
What's the matter?

182
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Is this plan on the screen

183
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,960
made by the company

184
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,880
that just left?

185
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,520
That's right.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,919
Is there a problem?

187
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,039
It's none of your business.

188
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
This is our own internal affairs.

189
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,600
We'll take care of it.

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:46,960
Right.

191
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,160
I'm only here to remind you.

192
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
Time is running out.

193
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,880
Every company

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
has a fixed duration.

195
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
Could you give us more time?

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,480
We'll be quick.

197
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,240
We can't

198
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
use this plan.

199
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
An identical plan is taboo.

200
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,280
We'll become a laughing stock.

201
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,400
It's obvious they copied ours.

202
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,320
What's there to be afraid of?

203
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
Mind your words.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,680
We need evidence

205
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,720
to prove that they plagiarized.

206
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,080
That's enough. Stop arguing.

207
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,560
The journalists are taking pictures.

208
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Chuan.

209
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
Wang Kai.

210
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Give this

211
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,760
to them.

212
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
Understood.

213
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
Take your seats.

214
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,400
Let's go.

215
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
Coming up next is Chuan Design Studio.

216
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,160
Let's welcome the designer, Gu Chuan.

217
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,040
I apologize

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,960
for the delay

219
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,200
because we made

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,080
some minor changes

221
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
to our design plan.

222
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,560
Let's take a look at the screen.

223
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,200
This time, our design plan

224
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,200
is based on warm colors.

225
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,320
We mainly use glass

226
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,920
for the exterior design

227
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,560
which makes it

228
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
look more modern.

229
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
It may not be the same

230
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
as the ordinary design scheme.

231
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Usually,

232
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,520
construction using glass material...

233
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,240
This isn't our initial design.

234
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,040
That's Gu Chuan

235
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,160
who recently won the Jin An Award.

236
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,440
In addition to the sense of simplicity,

237
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,400
it also gives people

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
a sense of coldness and distance.

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,880
In order to break out of

240
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
rigid thinking patterns,

241
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,040
we use

242
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
the reflection principle of glass

243
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
to convert the blue basic cold light

244
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,160
into warm light.

245
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,600
Jiang Xiao Ning.

246
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,800
Do you know what's going on?

247
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,920
Boss.

248
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,380
(A few days ago)

249
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,480
Here.

250
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,720
Take a look.

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,200
What do you think?

252
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
It's beautiful.

253
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
So this is how

254
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,720
your initial design looks like.

255
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,960
I didn't say it was mine.

256
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,560
It's not?

257
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
But it's very similar to your style.

258
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,640
It's far from it.

259
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,480
It is at first glance.

260
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,360
But your current style

261
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,280
is more avant-garde,

262
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
technological, and futuristic.

263
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,880
I've seen some of your work.

264
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
It's all grotesque and variegated.

265
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,160
But at first glance,

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,440
this design is bright and radiant.

267
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,680
There's hope.

268
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,600
There are similarities between the two.

269
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
Really?

270
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,560
My dad always said

271
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,920
that the outer shell of one's works will change,

272
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
but not the inner core.

273
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,200
Many ideas

274
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,040
have been formed

275
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,480
in childhood.

276
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,080
Even if the building is different,

277
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,320
the style on the inside

278
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,360
will not change.

279
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,840
Even if your current work

280
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,680
is avant-garde,

281
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,640
there is a warm

282
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,880
and bright side of it.

283
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,600
This was

284
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
my work when I just went to college.

285
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,240
I did some modifications.

286
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,120
That explains it.

287
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,600
There are some differences.

288
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,040
But this is a really cool design.

289
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,840
Do you think

290
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,440
it's suitable for this plan

291
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,600
if it's based on this?

292
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,240
This design

293
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
looks really warm.

294
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,680
But don't we already

295
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,000
have a plan for...

296
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,760
We'll go with this as the foundation.

297
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,680
Here.

298
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
You're in charge now.

299
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,560
Can I?

300
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
Of course.

301
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,320
If there's anything you don't understand,

302
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,680
just come ask me.

303
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,940
♪In my memory♪

304
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,820
♪Who is that♪

305
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,140
♪No, I can't sleep♪

306
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,620
♪Pieces piece together our encounter♪

307
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,440
So...

308
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,040
the two of you

309
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
did it anew.

310
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,480
We haven't slept much this week.

311
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
It is possible

312
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,160
if he has a good foundation.

313
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,280
But this

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,480
is an impossible task.

315
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Also, this design is really beautiful.

316
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,200
It's even better than the previous one.

317
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,480
I like it.

318
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
Jiang Xiao Ning.

319
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,360
You two are my life saviors.

320
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,400
And so

321
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
this is the design

322
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,720
from Chuan Design Studio.

323
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,960
Feel free

324
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,640
to give us your valuable feedback.

325
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
You can't do this.

326
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,200
This wasn't the plan you submitted.

327
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,400
What's going on?

328
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,520
Does it violate the rules?

329
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,720
You...

330
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
It's not a problem.

331
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,080
We appreciate

332
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,600
and are willing to accept

333
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,240
better design plans,

334
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,160
even if

335
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,920
it is your momentary inspiration.

336
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,800
It's good enough to prove your brilliance.

337
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,960
Gu Chuan.

338
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
You're good.

339
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,760
Thank you.

340
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,180
(Thanks for watching)

341
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,680
Mr. Gu.

342
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,760
Why did you suddenly

343
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,480
change your design?

344
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,240
I heard you discussing

345
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,000
in the conference room

346
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,680
that someone has copied

347
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,520
your original design plan.

348
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,080
Is it true

349
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,320
that it's the same as Zhi Mu's?

350
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,840
Who's plagiarizing?

351
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,960
I have no comments

352
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,560
about this.

353
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
All I want to say is that

354
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,880
works with vitality in it

355
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
can never be plagiarized.

356
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
The life

357
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,600
everyone desires is different.

358
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,400
I love this beautiful world.

359
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
Thank you.

360
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,680
All right. Thank you.

361
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,960
Thank you.

362
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,560
Stop taking pictures.

363
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,200
Thank you.

364
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,120
Okay. Thank you.

365
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,880
Thank you.

366
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,640
Stop taking pictures.

367
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
Thank you.

368
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,280
(Chuan Design Studio)

369
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,720
You make me proud.

370
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,200
You are the most talented

371
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
and the coolest

372
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
designer team I know.

373
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,560
Although the results aren't out yet,

374
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,520
I believe that today's work

375
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,640
is enough

376
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
to take Chuan Design Studio

377
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,480
to another level.

378
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
Anyway,

379
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,360
we won

380
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,960
a handsome victory.

381
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
Thank you, Director Xu.

382
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,680
Allow me to update you.

383
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,880
The final plan was actually made

384
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,600
by Mr. Gu and Jiang Xiao Ning

385
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,360
who pulled all-nighters

386
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,360
in the final week.

387
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,760
So the credit goes to them.

388
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,000
We just benefited from them.

389
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,640
Cheng Dong.

390
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,560
We're a team.

391
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,800
The credit goes to everyone.

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
Everyone has made contributions.

393
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,400
Jiang Xiao Ning and I

394
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
used it as a backup plan.

395
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,960
We were worried

396
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
there would be a clash of designs.

397
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
It was a coincidence

398
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,600
that it came in handy.

399
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,960
Mr. Gu, you're being so modest.

400
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a huge change in style.

401
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,720
How could you say

402
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
it was just a backup plan?

403
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,560
That's what makes a boss.

404
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,480
That explains why I'm poor.

405
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,480
That's for sure.

406
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,400
In fact, this time,

407
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,880
the inspiration came from Jiang Xiao Ning.

408
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,120
Although she hasn't been in the industry
for a long time,

409
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,600
she quickly perceives

410
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,360
the concepts and value of designs.

411
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,480
If a designer

412
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,160
does not have the ability to perceive things,

413
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,160
it's as good as losing everything.

414
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,320
So we have to thank

415
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,920
Jiang Xiao Ning for that.

416
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,360
Here.

417
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,520
A toast to Jiang Xiao Ning.

418
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,880
A toast to Xiao Ning.

419
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,520
A toast to Jiang Xiao Ning.

420
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,680
Cheers!

421
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
Cheers!

422
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,200
What's wrong?

423
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm just too happy.

424
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,800
This is

425
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,560
the first time I gain recognition from someone.

426
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,720
I couldn't believe it.

427
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,040
When you become a famous designer,

428
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,040
you'll be sick of listening to these.

429
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,400
Xiao Ning.

430
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,760
This time,

431
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,800
you're our hero.

432
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,800
That's right, Xiao Ning.

433
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
If it hadn't been for you,

434
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,359
I would be so embarrassed.

435
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,119
But

436
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,200
how did our design

437
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,359
leak out?

438
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,880
We can just check the CCTVs.

439
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,640
The CCTVs

440
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,960
are only available in the lobby

441
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,280
and the elevator of the office building.

442
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,760
The reason why I don't install
surveillance cameras

443
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,440
is that

444
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,920
we are a design company.

445
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,079
I hope

446
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,079
everyone can work more freely.

447
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,319
So there's no way

448
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,720
to find out who's the culprit.

449
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,000
There were people

450
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
keeping an eye on it the whole time.

451
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,520
Qiao Meng Jia,

452
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,160
Cheng Dong, and I have been keeping an eye on it

453
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,520
throughout the time.

454
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,480
We didn't see anyone coming in.

455
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
Forget it.

456
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,120
Just call the police and let them investigate it.

457
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,000
The process was precarious.

458
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,600
But it turned out well.

459
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,920
Chuan.

460
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,400
I've made a decision for you.

461
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
Everyone has been working hard lately.

462
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,200
How about a three-day break?

463
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,360
Thank you, Director Xu!

464
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Thank you, Director Xu.

465
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,760
We can use this opportunity

466
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,480
to find out how did our design get plagiarized.

467
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
No need for that.

468
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,080
It being an outsider is very unlikely.

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,800
If it was someone from our company,

470
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,640
I hope

471
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,320
that person would come to me personally.

472
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,800
We've worked together for a long time.

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,640
I won't be ruthless.

474
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,080
Why were you so careless?

475
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,160
Why didn't you stay until the last minute

476
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,000
before giving me the design?

477
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,040
Don't you understand?

478
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,360
I've told you.

479
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
They pulled all-nighters to work on it.

480
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,880
They being

481
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,120
lovey-dovey isn't news.

482
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,840
I can't

483
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,400
be keeping an eye on them at all times.

484
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,360
You must have done something

485
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,480
that raised their suspicion.

486
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,160
I didn't.

487
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,400
I didn't say anything.

488
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,400
Everything was normal.

489
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,480
The hell with it then.

490
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,600
Knock it off, will you?

491
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
Do you think I enjoy this?

492
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,920
I haven't been able to sleep or eat lately.

493
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
I actually fell for your words

494
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,320
and did something like this.

495
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,680
You willingly worked with me.

496
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,640
Okay?

497
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,960
Fine. I made my own bed.

498
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,160
I love Gu Chuan so much,

499
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
but I ended up

500
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
doing something to hurt him.

501
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,680
It was so foolish of me.

502
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,560
Look, Su Man Lin.

503
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,680
Don't think you're the victim here.

504
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,560
My situation

505
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
might be way worse than yours.

506
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,320
What's on your mind?

507
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
Don't you want to find out who did it?

508
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
I couldn't think of anyone.

509
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,400
Actually, I know who did it.

510
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,320
I just wanted

511
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,720
that person to come to me

512
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,600
and come clean with me.

513
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,800
So it was someone from our company?

514
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
It was Su Man Lin.

515
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
Sister Man Lin?

516
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,360
It's fine. I have an umbrella.

517
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,480
I can do it.

518
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
What happened to her?

519
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,240
She encountered something unpleasant

520
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,760
on a rainy day.

521
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,440
So she doesn't like

522
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,960
going out on rainy days.

523
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
True.

524
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
Anyone who was trapped

525
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,720
in such a high place would have trauma.

526
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,360
(I've never told Su Man Lin)

527
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,280
(about you on the rooftop the other day.)

528
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,160
(Why would she know about it?)

529
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
(That caught my attention.)

530
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
(The surveillance footage)

531
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,520
(showed Su Man Lin)

532
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,520
(followed you and Chen Wen Wen in.)

533
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
(That night,)

534
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
(the one who locked you)

535
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,160
(on the rooftop was Su Man Lin.)

536
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,440
(I never thought)

537
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,080
(Su Man Lin would do such a thing.)

538
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,800
Since then,

539
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,240
I've been watching her.

540
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
(Throughout)

541
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
(the design process,)

542
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,520
(Su Man Lin was often distracted.)

543
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,560
(I knew something wasn't right with her.)

544
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,960
Your phone is ringing.

545
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm going to the restroom.

546
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,440
(I never thought)

547
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
(she would steal our design.)

548
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
Sorry, Sister Man Lin.

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,040
Sorry.

550
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
Ever since I joined the company,

551
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,360
she has really helped me a lot.

552
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,840
She led me

553
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,720
in some of the projects.

554
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,560
She would teach me

555
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,080
if I didn't understand anything.

556
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,040
I couldn't fathom

557
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,720
the reason she did all this.

558
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,680
I find it hard to believe.

559
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I feel the same.

560
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,120
Su Man Lin has worked in the company for years.

561
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
I didn't want her

562
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,600
to leave with a bad reputation.

563
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,960
All right.

564
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,760
Let's not talk about that.

565
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
You should think about

566
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,360
where you want to go

567
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,600
if I give you a few days off.

568
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,280
You're giving me a few days off?

569
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,440
Of course.

570
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,600
Anywhere?

571
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,080
Whatever you say.

572
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,400
I'll have to make a plan then.

573
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,520
Come here.

574
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,080
Come on.

575
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
That's my plan.

576
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,080
Hello, what's up?

577
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,760
Hold on!

578
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,600
Something urgent came up!

579
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,320
I'll call you back.

580
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,160
Thank you for the design.

581
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,160
Don't say that.

582
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
The client loves your plan.

583
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,120
-You did a good job.
-Yan Yan!

584
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,640
Thank you.

585
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,080
You're here.

586
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,200
You're early today.

587
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,880
Not at all.

588
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,280
This is Zhou Xiang.

589
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,360
He's my new colleague.

590
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,760
Hi, I'm Zhou Xiang.

591
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,720
Xu Cheng Ran.

592
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,640
Yan Yan's husband.

593
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,800
Don't listen to him.

594
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,040
Well, future husband.

595
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,760
How about this, Yan Yan?

596
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll make you some soup tomorrow.

597
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
Don't order delivery food anymore.

598
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,920
No need.

599
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,480
Just leave the tough job

600
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,880
to her future husband.

601
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,440
Next time.

602
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,360
What are you looking at?

603
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,280
Get in the car.

604
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,120
What are you doing?

605
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,680
Does his cooking taste better?

606
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,120
Are you jealous?

607
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,920
Me? Jealous? You've got to be kidding me.

608
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,640
Why would I be jealous?

609
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,280
You're not confident.

610
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,000
He's quite good-looking.

611
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,240
But so am I.

612
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
He's just slightly younger.

613
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,160
What's the big deal?

614
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,600
I was once young too.

615
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,880
You're so childish.

616
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,480
Haven't you heard?

617
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,880
Love makes people childish.

618
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,760
Missy.

619
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,720
Aren't you into

620
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,040
a childish pretty boy?

621
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,120
Don't call me that. It's so gross.

622
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,320
Can you

623
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,680
not eat the food others make?

624
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,680
Missy.

625
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,680
All right.

626
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
Mister.

627
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,160
What are we having?

628
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,080
Missy.

629
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's have

630
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,520
some savory hot pot.

631
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,160
Sure, Missy.

632
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Say that again!

633
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,040
I was wrong.

634
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,320
Safety first.

635
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,280
-Sit tight.
-Shut up.

636
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,720
Okay.

637
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
Here I come!

638
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,200
Here I come!

639
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,560
Didn't I ask you to wait at home?

640
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,840
Why did you come here?

641
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
I just wanted to see you sooner.

642
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,080
I'll drive.

643
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
How can I let you drive?

644
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,680
I'll be driving today.

645
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,800
Just sit and enjoy

646
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,160
sitting on the passenger side.

647
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,520
Okay?

648
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,680
Here.

649
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,320
Fasten the seat belt.

650
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,440
Here we are!

651
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,240
Home sweet home.

652
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,280
Let's go inside.

653
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,960
Watch your step.

654
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,080
The ground. Look.

655
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
There's a step here.

656
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,360
Here.

657
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,560
Look.

658
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,680
Xiao Mai.

659
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Where is this place?

660
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,400
Xiao Mai, look.

661
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,280
This is our house.

662
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,120
Look.

663
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,760
This was Guang Da's room.

664
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,040
When he was a kid,

665
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
he would do his homework

666
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,200
by this window.

667
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,120
That's right.

668
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,440
My brother's grades

669
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,960
were good back then.

670
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
If he was

671
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,520
still alive,

672
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
our lives

673
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
wouldn't be this tough.

674
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,440
Aunty.

675
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,320
We're back here

676
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,400
to cheer Grandma up.

677
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,680
Don't talk about the sad things.

678
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,640
You're right.

679
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,720
My bad.

680
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,080
Why did I bring that up, right?

681
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,960
Grandma.

682
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,320
The condition of your house

683
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,760
will not remain like this.

684
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,840
Xiao Ning has told me.

685
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,360
She will personally design

686
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,680
and renovate this place

687
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,560
and let you move back in here.

688
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,920
Who's that?

689
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,480
Mom, don't you recognize him?

690
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,040
This is Xiao Ning's boss.

691
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,680
Hi, Boss.

692
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,280
Grandma.

693
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,160
Don't worry.

694
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Xiao Ning

695
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,520
will be a great designer

696
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,000
in the future.

697
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,920
Not only

698
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
she'll fix this place,

699
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,560
she'll also

700
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,440
give you a better life.

701
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,480
That's great.

702
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,240
That's awesome, Boss.

703
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,040
You have to help her.

704
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Don't worry, Grandma.

705
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,560
I'll surely help her.

706
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,080
Xiao Ning.

707
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Your boss said he was going to help you.

708
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,200
Grandma, say no more.

709
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,920
If you keep talking,

710
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,920
we're going to start to think

711
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,120
that you only pretended to be a dotard.

712
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,000
How could you say that?

713
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm not a dotard.

714
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,760
Not at all.

715
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,440
When being back here, she's sober-minded now.

716
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,560
Right? Let's go.

717
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,240
Let's go over there

718
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,160
and check out my room.

719
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,960
All you think about is Guang Da.

720
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,600
Why don't you remember my room?

721
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,840
This is...

722
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,000
This is the scene

723
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,560
that I keep imagining.

724
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,520
My aunt holding my grandma

725
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,040
and taking a walk in the yard.

726
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,720
There are all kinds

727
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,280
of flowers and plants in the yard.

728
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,000
What's wrong?

729
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,920
Thinking about the days to come

730
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,600
warms my heart.

731
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,280
♪The summer in July♪

732
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,960
Grandma.

733
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,080
Do you remember taking us here

734
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,600
when we were kids?

735
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,920
We even went into the water to catch fish.

736
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,040
Xiao Ning.

737
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,520
Just like a boy,

738
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,080
you were swimming right here.

739
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,960
Really?

740
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,960
That's right.

741
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,800
I was so worried

742
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,680
and told you to stop.

743
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,640
While I wasn't looking,

744
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,520
you went back there to swim again.

745
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm good at swimming.

746
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,040
I heard from Xiao Ning

747
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,280
that you brought her here before.

748
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes, we came here before.

749
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,680
Do you really like Xiao Ning?

750
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,320
Yes.

751
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,560
This girl

752
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,120
is very simple.

753
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,840
And she's a little silly.

754
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,360
But she has a good heart.

755
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,560
Although

756
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,000
she has done many part-time jobs,

757
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,240
she doesn't have much social experience.

758
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,160
If she

759
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,600
does anything the wrong way,

760
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
please bear with her.

761
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,000
Aunty.

762
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
I think Xiao Ning

763
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,800
is a very sensible

764
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,200
and hard-working person.

00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,560
I don't have to bear with her.

766
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
She's the one who's been forgiving to others,

767
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,160
me included.

768
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,840
All right.

769
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,880
I'll get some water for my mom.

No.

779
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
She was just telling me

780
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,720
that if I were to give you a hard time,

781
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,160
she would throw me into the river

Let me do it if you can't.

788
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,660
I know how to do it.

789
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,760
Be careful.

790
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,600

What happened?

794
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,280
I got electrocuted.

795
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,120
Bear with it.

796
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Does it hurt so much?

797
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,160
Not at all.

798
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,360
I'm a tough guy.

799
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm just worried about the floor.

800
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,800
You should just worry about yourself.

801
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,840
Why are you

802
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,040
so concerned about me suddenly?

803
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,920
Yan Yan.

804
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,320
Look at the candles.

805
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,240
Don't you think it's romantic?

806
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't you think, at times like this,

807
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
we should...

808
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,840
At times like this, you're still thinking

809
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,600
about all this nonsense.

810
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,840
What's wrong?

811
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,840
I'm scared.

812
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,480
Scared?

813
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,880
Of what?

814
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,160
I'm scared

815
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,600
that you live a life of luxury

816
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
and got used to living a good life.

817
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,200
You're now with me

818
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,520
just for the sake of fun.

819
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,040
After some time,

820
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
you'll want to return

821
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
to the fancy lifestyle.

822
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,040
You get emotional all of a sudden.

823
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,080
I'm not quite used to it.

824
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,240
Come on.

825
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,120
Give your king a massage.

826
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,160
Here?

827
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,320
Further down.

828
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,720
Here?

829
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,240
It hurts!

830
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,720
That's what you get for talking drivel.

831
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
Well, I'll talk about the serious stuff then.

832
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,560
I went abroad with my mom

833
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,719
since I was a kid.

834
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,360
I've never lived

835
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,679
a life of luxury

836
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,239
or lived a good life.

837
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,120
I've always looked out for myself.

838
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,000
After I graduated from college,

839
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,199
you know the story

840
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,159
about my relationship with my dad.

841
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,639
I don't use his money.

842
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,320
I made it to where I am today

843
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,840
all on my own.

844
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,960
Well, I depended on Gu Chuan and myself.

845
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,159
In short,

846
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,239
to me,

847
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,560
being with you is the most blessed thing

848
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,120
no matter what kind of life it is.

849
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll prove my love to you

850
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
with my action.

851
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,160
Go easy.

852
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,800
I need to rest for a week.

853
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,400
Go down further.

854
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,560
Feeling better?

855
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,880
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital?

856
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,320
No.

857
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
Director Xu, you were asking for me?

858
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
It's about the bidding meeting.

859
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,040
It's been making the rounds on the Internet

860
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,080
by the media.

861
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,600
I want to talk to you about it.

862
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,520
Sure.

863
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,760
I learned some news

864
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,800
through a friend of mine

865
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,280
and would like to verify it with you.

866
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,600
We asked the expert

867
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
to check on Chuan Design Studio's initial design

868
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,600
and indeed, it was similar to Zhi Mu's.

869
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,400
That's between

870
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,360
those design companies.

871
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,880
It's hard to tell

872
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,360
who was plagiarizing.

873
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Zhi Mu Group

874
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,800
is a new design company.

875
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
You and the guy named Zheng

876
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,680
are the investors.

877
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,320
Director Xu would like you

878
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
to clarify this.

879
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,120
Director Xu.

880
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,840
Director Xu.

881
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,640
I just think that

882
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,760
the company has too many projects recently.

883
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,000
We need a design company

884
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,080
and I see no reason

885
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,400
for project bidding.

886
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,080
That's why I set up this company

887
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,720
with my friend.

888
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,000
I hope you won't mind.

889
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,680
I really didn't know

890
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,000
that the design could be changed.

891
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,120
Director Xu.

892
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
That's enough.

893
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,040
I get it now.

894
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,400
To put it bluntly,

895
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,800
you're still wet behind the ears.

896
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,920
That's why you lost big time to Gu Chuan.

897
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,840
Business is a battlefield.

898
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,400
Is it wrong to cook up a scheme?

899
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,240
Not at all.

900
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,600
But that was a humiliating defeat.

901
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,840
You're right.

902
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,240
I was wrong, Director Xu.

903
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Leave.

904
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,760
Give me another chance,

905
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,520
would you?

906
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,680
I won't make mistakes again.

907
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
I...

908
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,000
Have a good rest then.

909
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
I'm sorry, Director Xu.

910
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,200
Assistant Liu.

911
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,520
Anything?

912
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,000
The board of directors

913
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,320
didn't pass your resolution for
the CEO appointment.

914
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,760
Director Xu arranged for you

915
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
to be a department manager in the
Administration Department.

916
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,240
(Notice of Job Transfer)

917
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,840
(Notice of Job Transfer)
This is an internal transfer order.

918
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,920

Please sign it.

919
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,940
(Gu Chuan)

920
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,880
Hello?

921
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,640
It's me, Gu Chuan.

922
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,760
Come to the studio.

923
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,880
Okay.

924
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,380
(Chuan Design Studio)

925
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,800
You're here.

926
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Take a seat.

927
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,480
Why did you ask me to come here all of a sudden?

928
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,080
Actually, in the past few days,

929
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,960
I've been waiting for you.

930
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Waiting for me?

931
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,720
Waiting for you to come clean with me.

932
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,400
Come clean about what?

933
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,040
I've always trusted you.

934
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,560
Your ability.

935
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,120
Your character.

936
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,960
I've always told myself

937
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
that you

938
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,440
are my most trusted friend and work partner.

939
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,760
But I now realized

940
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,520
that I don't know you at all.

941
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,520
I...

942
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,400
I didn't follow you.

943
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,600
Jiang Xiao Ning has never done harm to you.

944
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,080
Why did you treat her that way?

945
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,800
I didn't.

946
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,760
What happened to her

947
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,320
on the rooftop that night

948
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,160
will be trauma to her for a really long time.

949
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,040
And now,

950
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,280
you gave my design

951
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,440
to Tang Xu.

952
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,920
If I hadn't made preparation in advance,

953
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,360
you would have ruined me

954
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,680
and everyone

955
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,640
in Chuan Design Studio.

956
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,800
What was your reason?

957
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,120
In the past few days,

958
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,080
I have been thinking of giving you another chance.

959
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,920
As long as you come to me,

960
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,600
I'll forgive you.

961
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,320
But right now...

962
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,200
Sorry.

963
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,440
Sorry.

964
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm just not resigned.

965
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I've worked with you for six years.

966
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,600
Why couldn't I win your heart?

967
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,400
But everything

968
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,200
came so easy

969
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,880
to Jiang Xiao Ning.

970
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,080
Why?

971
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,080
I'm not obligated to answer these questions.

972
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,080
Su Man Lin.

973
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,280
Pack your things.

974
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,000
