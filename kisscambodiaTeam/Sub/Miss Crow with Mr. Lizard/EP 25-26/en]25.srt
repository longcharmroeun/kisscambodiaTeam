Are you in a bad mood?

22

No.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,080
Don't worry about me.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,040
Are you worried about the exam?

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
You can read my mind

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,600
even with a computer monitor in the way?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
I've been busy with detailed issues

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,759
of the art gallery recently.

29
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,520
Haven't had time to tutor you in a while.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Why don't we finish working early today

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,760
and head home to study?

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Okay.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Thank you, Boss.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Here.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
Didn't you say that

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,480
you have to pass

37
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,920
the general exam this year,

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
complete the credit requirements,

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,040
and there is no make-up exam?

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,040
So I've prepared

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
these study plans for you.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
I have to go through all of these?

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
Not only do you have to go through these,

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
but you also have to master everything.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Okay.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
I'll pull myself together

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,560
and not let Boss down.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Right now we're off work.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
Don't call me Boss.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
I won't let my

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,320
handsome and outstanding boyfriend down.

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,440
Be serious.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,320
Hello.

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,640
Are you Mr. Gu?

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,120
Yes.

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
This is your package.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Please sign for it.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,120
Okay.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,560
Sorry.

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,760
I forgot to bring my pen.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,280
Could I borrow yours?

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
Sure, wait a second.

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,200
Thank you.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,080
Going to use your pen for a bit.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
What package?

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,040
Your learning materials.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
There's more?

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,640
You...

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,200
These...

70
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,120
These are only part of it.

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,760
Oh my god.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,080
What?

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,600
You don't want to study?

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,200
You can't imagine how much I want to study.

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
If you can let me

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,160
go out and take a break,

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
I'll be even happier.

78
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,160
Sir.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,680
Your cat ran away.

80
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,519
Ran away?

81
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
Ice Cream.

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,720
Ice Cream.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,960
Ice Cream.

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,480
Ice Cream.

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,560
Why are you here?

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,680
You scared me.

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,360
Ice Cream is here.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,120
Where did you go?

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
You scared me.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,440
I got so anxious.

91
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,320
Ice Cream.

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,680
Do you feel the same way I do?

93
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,960
Tired of being stuck at home

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
and wanted to go out

95
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,480
to relax?

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,360
How come you're tired of being stuck at home?

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
I've been studying

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,160
all afternoon.

99
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,240
I got a headache because of it.

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
Studying for one afternoon

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
gave you a headache?

102
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,640
I need to balance studying and resting.

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,760
I want to take a break and go outside.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,360
Yes,

105
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
there should be a balance between
studying and resting.

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
Look, you've been

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
taking a break for a while.

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
Shouldn't you go back

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
to studying now?

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,120
I just...

111
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
Coming.

112
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,960
Come in, come in.

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,560
Take a seat.

114
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
Dishes are ready.

115
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,080
Dumplings will be ready soon.

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,280
Take a seat.

117
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
Look.

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,560
My timing is spot-on.

119
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Dishes are done and dumplings are ready.

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
You're here too.

121
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Here.

122
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,320
Delicious dumplings.

123
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,880
What do you need?

124
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,320
Nothing.

125
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,440
I just wanted you to come home to eat with me.

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,520
Try some of my dishes.

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,160
I've been really busy recently.

128
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
It's okay.

129
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
You should eat no matter how busy you are.

130
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,720
You can leave after eating.

131
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
I won't ask you to stay. Okay?

132
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Here.

133
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,840
I made these myself.

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,160
Try one.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,920
See if

136
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,400
it still has the taste from your childhood.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,680
Hello?

138
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay, I'll be there soon.

139
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:04,880
What?

140
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,560
Finish eating before you leave?

141
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,240
I have to take care of things at the company.

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
I need to go.

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Also,

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,640
don't call if there is nothing.

145
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,320
Don't contact Director Xu either.

146
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,960
Dad, I'm tired.

147
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,240
Tired? Do you want Dad to carry you?

148
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,240
Yes.

149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Let's go.

150
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,560
Let's go.

151
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,760
(We heard your father is an embezzler.)

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,840
(How much did he embezzle?)

153
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Give some money to us

154
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,600
to buy something to eat and drink.

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
You idiot.

156
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,920
Your dad is an embezzler.

157
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,360
Don't play the victim.

158
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,400
I won't give money to you guys.

159
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,720
The teacher is coming.

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,080
Let's go.

161
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,000
Someday,

162
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,320
I'll stop being bullied by others.

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,280
When that day comes,

164
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,039
you won't be bullied either.

165
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll protect you.

Thank you for all your support.

Thank you.

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
Drink some water first.

183
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,920
You were almost hysterical.

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
Please pay attention to your wording.

185
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,240
What do you mean by hysterical?

186
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,480
This is being crazy for love

187
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
and making the tune linger in the room.

188
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,200
I want some water.

189
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,280
Your idea of relaxation is singing karaoke?

190
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't think that was relaxing.

191
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,440
You're tired from singing and I'm tired
after listening to your singing.

192
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
You mean I suck at singing?

193
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
I brought you here

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,560
precisely because I suck at singing.

195
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,800
Your turn.

196
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,600
I'll pass.

197
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Please sing.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
To make up for your mistake.

199
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,120
Are you really asking me to sing?

200
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,840
Yes.

201
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
What do you want to sing?

202
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,640
Whatever. There's no difference.

203
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
Then this song.

204
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,920
Here.

205
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,920

You come here often.

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,160
It looks like you have a lot to worry about.

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,480
The usual.

236
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm an idiot.

237
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
Turned down everyone

238
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,480
for one person.

239
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
And ended up with nothing.

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
It looks like

241
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,000
we're

242
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
the same type of people.

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,480
We're obsessed with our feelings towards someone,

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
but we don't want to let them know.

245
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
In the end, we're so hurt on the inside,

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,560
but we're still pretending to be okay.

247
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,080
You sound like you know everything.

248
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,880
But you didn't get

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,080
Jiang Xiao Ning either, did you?

250
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
We might not become friends,

251
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,200
but at least, we won't become enemies.

252
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,480
I don't have many friends,

253
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,680
but I think we

254
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,600
get along pretty well.

255
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,880
If either of us wants to chat about

256
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
our failing relationships in the future,

257
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,120
we can drink together.

258
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,540
(Reindeer Group) (Tang Xu)
(Deputy General Manager)

259
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
You're quite a catch.

260
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,000
Why don't you try pursuing

261
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,840
Jiang Xiao Ning again?

262
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm not very confident.

263
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,280
I got it.

264
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,920
Your cowardness

265
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
has done harm to both of us.

266
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,440
My apologies.

267
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,760
I'm just saying.

268
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,880
In Gu Chuan's words,

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,520
I didn't lose to Jiang Xiao Ning,

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,720
I just chose the wrong person.

271
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
In other words,

272
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,920
Gu Chuan

273
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,000
has never liked me.

274
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,520
Do you hate him now?

275
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,400
Hate?

276
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,640
Not quite.

277
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,440
It's despair.

278
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,880
There's nothing worse than apathy.

279
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,800
Some people come into your life

280
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
just to teach you a lesson

281
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,960
and they will just leave after that.

282
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,200
You're right.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I need to thank him.

284
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,680
Thank him for teaching me a lesson

285
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,400
that overwhelmed me

286
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
with pain and sorrow.

287
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,480
Still lots of whiskeys left.

288
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,840
I'm willing to listen to you for a while.

289
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,600
Cheers.

290
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,200
So when we're having

291
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,440
the team-building event last time,

292
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,920
you sang horribly on purpose

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,520
because of me?

294
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,280
I choose to be the one inflicting pain,

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,800
rather than bearing the pain.

296
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,040
Then you should be the one who sings

297
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,280
and I'll listen.

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Okay.

299
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,400
Only sing for me.

300
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,520
Would that be too much to ask?

301
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,360
That's...

302
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,360
not too much to ask at all.

303
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
You're too nice.

304
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,600
I really want to kiss you.

305
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,720
Here.

306
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,000
The seat belt is stuck.

307
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Let's go home first.

308
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Come in.

309
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,760
Boss.

310
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,840
You have a guest.

311
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,560
Sorry.

312
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,760
I didn't make an appointment in advance.

313
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
We can call each other friends.

314
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,080
Get straight to the point.

315
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,840
You guys talk.

316
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
I'll go make some coffee.

317
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,960
Mr. Gu.

318
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
This is a proposal.

319
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,160
(Procurement Proposal)
(Reindeer Group)

320
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,280
(Coordinator: Tang Xu)
Reindeer Group plans to

321
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
construct a new office building
in the New District.

322
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,120
The goal is

323
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,600
to make it become the city's new landmark.

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,720
We want to ask your company to be in charge of
designing the building.

325
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Who is the coordinator

326
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,720
for this procurement?

327
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,400
Look,

328
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,640
the board has not finished

329
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
the review and approval process.

330
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm not the formal CEO

331
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,080
of our company yet.

332
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
However, I've been in charge of

333
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,560
all the projects

334
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,880
so far.

335
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,440
I really hope Mr. Gu

336
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,960
can participate in our project.

337
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,400
I'm also looking forward to your designs.

338
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,160
After all,

339
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,480
you are a designer who has won the Jin An Award.

340
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,760
I'll take a look at the proposal first.

341
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,320
I'll contact you after I'm done.

342
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,640
Okay.

343
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,080
I won't keep you any longer.

344
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,160
Brother Xu.

345
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,920
Are you guys done talking?

346
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,640
Oh right, Xiao Ning.

347
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
This is for you.

348
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,640
What's this?

349
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,520
A gift card.

350
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,760
I can't take it.

351
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,560
This is for Aunty.

352
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Remember,

353
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,040
this is the best way

354
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,960
to make elders happy.

355
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,600
Brother Xu.

356
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,480
Okay, I have to get going.

357
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
He's so attentive.

358
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,320
Showing off how caring he is

359
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,080
after showing off his power.

360
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
He said it's for Aunty.

361
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,840
I'll look for a chance

362
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,960
to return it to Brother Xu.

363
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,840
Okay.

364
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,960
My Chuan, you finally remembered me.

365
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Do you know about

366
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,080
Reindeer Group's new landmark project?

367
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,520
How could I know?

368
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,560
Reindeer Group gave this project

369
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,800
to us.

370
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,920
Maybe my father intentionally gave this to us

371
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
to prove that I can't live

372
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,600
without his protection?

373
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,000
Turn it down.

374
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,920
Tang Xu just handed the

375
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,040
proposal to me personally.

376
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,440
He also said

377
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,520
he is going to be the CEO.

378
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,240
Tang Xu?

379
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
Something feels a bit strange.

380
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,360
That's my father's style.

381
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,040
Making me have crisis awareness.

382
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,720
You should go back and ask him.

383
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
But don't have a quarrel with him.

384
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,120
Okay.

385
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
The landmark project.

386
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
I'm turning down the collaboration
on behalf of my company.

387
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,160
We won't do it.

388
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,320
Why?

389
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,640
First,

390
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,760
I don't need you

391
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,360
intentionally taking care of my company.

392
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,920
You walk your own path.

393
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,200
I walk my own path.

394
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,400
Second,

395
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
this is the largest project

396
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,040
of the group so far.

397
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
A new landmark of the entire city.

398
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,960
I beg you

399
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,640
to take care of it yourself.

400
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,400
Don't let outsiders take advantage of it, alright?

401
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,360
Who is the outsider?

402
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,080
Tang Xu.

403
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,160
How can Tang Xu be an outsider?

404
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,080
He's your brother.

405
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,080
Brother.

406
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
How can he not be your brother?

407
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,400
He is doing his filial duty for you.

408
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
Besides that.

409
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,040
The board of directors knows that

410
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,640
Tang Xu has the ability.

411
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,640
You're not on this project.

412
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,640
Are there any problems for me

413
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,880
to hand the project to him?

414
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,640
You mean

415
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
he's more capable than I am?

416
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm worse than him, right?

417
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
Mark my words.

418
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,160
If he's in charge of this project,

419
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,040
he won't give me an advantage

420
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
during the procurement process, right?

421
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,480
We'll play a fair game.

422
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,400
I'll show you

423
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,360
if my tiny company

424
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,800
is capable to win.

425
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,880
Sure.

426
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
I'll wait and see, boy.

427
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,000
Don't look down on me.

428
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm not.

429
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm not bidding for your money.

430
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,920
I'm bidding for my pride.

431
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,680
So sudden.

432
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,920
Did your old wounds hurt again?

433
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,280
Or are you cured?

434
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
I just want to express my gratitude.

435
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,680
Not necessary at all.

436
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,800
Thanks for taking care of me yesterday.

437
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,160
You're a gentleman.

438
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,840
You mean

439
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,880
I don't look like a gentleman?

440
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,520
And almost made you misunderstand me?

441
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,120
I was joking.

442
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
I simply want to say thank you.

443
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,040
Although you're very pretty,

444
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
I have self-control.

445
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,560
I won't

446
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,840
take advantage of you.

447
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
You're good at chatting with people.

448
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,840
Chatting with me feels

449
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,280
better than chatting with Gu Chuan, right?

450
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,200
I was just starting to feel better.

451
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,640
Can you not mention him?

452
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,000
If you dislike him that much,

453
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,000
why not quit your job

454
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,360
and come work at my company?

455
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,600
I don't want to leave.

456
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,920
Not resigned?

457
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,360
If I were you,

458
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,720
I wouldn't be resigned either.

459
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,960
You must remember that

460
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,320
you need to make him realize

461
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
how important you are.

462
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,640
For him,

463
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
you are the irreplaceable woman.

464
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,160
If he didn't have you,

465
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
he wouldn't have become who he is today.

466
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,400
That's impossible.

467
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,840
He'll never think in that way.

468
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,720
That's because

469
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,160
everything is going well for him nowadays

470
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,200
and he won't know how important you are.

471
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,280
What are you trying to say?

472
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,960
You know what I mean.

473
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't want revenge.

474
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,040
It's not revenge.

475
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,480
You need to let him

476
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,520
suffer a setback.

477
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
I'm telling you.

478
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,000
A man

479
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,040
will only know which woman is true to him

480
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,720
when he is at a low ebb.

481
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,480
Of course,

482
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
I just want to help you.

483
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,080
I don't have other intentions.

484
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,560
It could be

485
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,760
hard for you to hurt him

486
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,080
given his prestige

487
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,120
in the field.

488
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,000
However,

489
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,600
if you don't let him

490
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
suffer a setback,

491
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
you'll never have a place

492
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,920
in his heart.

493
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,320
Are you giving me advice?

494
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,440
What's in it for you?

495
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
This is not advice.

496
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,800
In other words, this is

497
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,040
a collaboration.

498
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
If the collaboration goes well,

499
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,280
I can get my Jiang Xiao Ning back,

500
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,040
and

501
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,320
you can win back your Gu Chuan,

502
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,880
right?

503
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,840
A win-win resolution.

504
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,260
(Sustainability)

505
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,940
(Thanks for watching.)

506
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,960
In recent years,

507
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,800
I haven't been coming to the office often.

508
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,760
But I remember all

509
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,480
your names.

510
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
I also know everything that

511
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
goes on in the company well.

512
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,280
Okay, maybe not that well.

513
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,760
I made an agreement with Chuan.

514
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,800
I would take care of

515
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
the initial funding of the company

516
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,120
and he would handle all the technical aspects.

517
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,360
I promised not to intervene.

518
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,520
However, this time,

519
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,440
I'm going to assign tasks to everyone.

520
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
We have to win

521
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,680
this bid.

522
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,920
I've never participated in this type of

523
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,960
bidding before.

524
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,840
But it's different this time.

525
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
We can't let Mr. Xu down.

526
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
From now on,

527
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
take a break from your current projects

528
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,120
and focus on this bid.

529
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,800
I only ask for one thing.

530
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,600
We must win.

531
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,360
We've got this!

532
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,360
Come on.

533
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,240
One, two.

534
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,560
We've got this!

535
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
Now, I'm going to announce

536
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,360
the project team members.

537
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,920
Coordinator.

538
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,600
Me.

539
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,560
First assistant, Su Man Lin.

540
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,560
Second assistant, Cheng Dong.

541
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,760
Graphics, Qiao Meng Jia.

542
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,060
♪You are the most perfect when full of vitality♪

543
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Hey, everyone.

544
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,680
You guys have been working hard.

545
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,720
I appreciate your efforts.

546
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Keep it up

547
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,920
and the victory is ahead of us.

548
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,200
Brother Kai.

549
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Everyone hasn't eaten anything yet.

550
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,680
I'll go buy some food.

551
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Great idea.

552
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,080
I'll reimburse you.

553
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Okay.

554
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,280
(It seems we can get started.)

555
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,560
Welcome to Lai Yi Fen.

556
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,400
We have a lot of snacks for you to pick.

557
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,200
Thank you.

558
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,960
Hello, please choose whatever you like.

559
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,160
Do you have any discounts today?

560
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,640
Yes.

561
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Buy one get one free for those nuts.

562
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
Okay, I'll take some.

563
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,560
Hi. I'll pay the bill.

564
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,240
Okay.

565
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,280
Can I pay with my phone?

566
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,000
Sure.

567
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,800
Where did everybody go?

568
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,720
Where did you go?

569
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,520
I went downstairs to buy food for everyone

570
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,080
since no one had eaten anything.

571
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,280
They're not lucky enough to eat these.

572
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,600
Where are you going?

573
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,400
Work.

574
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,960
I'm back.

575
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,680
You're back.

576
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,320
You haven't gone to bed?

577
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,200
How dare I?

578
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,760
Sister Zhao Yan dined out

579
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,920
with her good-looking colleague.

580
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
Seems like you're tired from having a great meal.

581
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,080
Do you want to pick a fight?

582
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,080
I put a lot of effort into

583
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,080
making all these dishes,

584
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,120
waiting for you to come back.

585
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,520
I didn't call you

586
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,440
or send you a WeChat message

587
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,760
because I was afraid of interrupting you.

588
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,800
Didn't I say

589
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,680
I was having dinner with my colleagues?

590
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,560
I just want to know

591
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,520
how attractive

592
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,640
this colleague is

593
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,640
that could make you

594
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,800
leave your handsome boyfriend

595
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,480
at home alone.

596
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,280
Why do you sound like a grumbling woman?

597
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,160
What do you mean sound like?

598
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,560
I am a grumbling woman.

599
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
Leave me at home all by myself.

600
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm so scared.

601
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,720
Xu Cheng Ran, you.

602
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,080
It's a waste if you don't become an actor.

603
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,600
Be serious. Don't laugh.

604
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,280
Okay, I'll be serious.

605
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,560
Come on.

606
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,160
Say what you want to say.

607
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,880
Start your performance.

608
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm not performing. I'm serious.

609
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Are you jealous?

610
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
I'm seriously jealous.

611
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,720
Am I not important to you?

612
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,560
Of course you're important.

613
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,840
You

614
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,080
are the most important one.

615
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,520
I'm going to take a shower.

616
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,440
Do you mean it?

617
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,640
Did you lie?

618
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm taking a shower.

619
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,680
Every floor

620
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,920
has a certain capacity.

621
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,920
This way,

622
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,000
it can put together more people.

623
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,720
What do you think?

624
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,000
I brought some Meco Fruit Juice for everyone.

625
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,280
Help yourself.

626
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,720
Thank you.

627
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,640
Thank you, Xiao Ning.

628
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,640
Sister Man Lin.

629
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,960
Jiang Xiao Ning.

630
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,440
I'm here.

631
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,320
Go to Wu Yi Street to

632
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,840
take some photos of the street for me.

633
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,520
The more, the better.

634
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,680
Okay, I'll go right now.

635
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,680
Wait.

636
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,680
Traffic is heavy on that street.

637
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Take care of yourself.

638
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,480
Okay. Thank you, Boss.

639
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,520
Your phone is ringing.

640
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
Okay, I'll answer it.

641
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,160
Don't call me

642
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
during work.

643
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
Okay, I'll call back at another time.

644
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Has the design come out?

645
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,800
I need to have them

646
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,800
in advance to prepare.

647
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,040
Should be soon.

648
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,520
I'll contact you in advance.

649
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,200
Okay. Remember.

650
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
You're not doing this for me.

651
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,840
You're doing this for yourself.

652
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,960
Are you sure

653
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,840
you can do what you've promised me?

654
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,360
Don't worry.

655
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,320
As long as Gu Chuan

656
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,400
got knocked off his pedestal,

657
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,360
Xiao Ning will no longer

658
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,560
admire him blindly.

659
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,200
At that time, I'll just need to give it a little push

660
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,160
and she'll let go.

661
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,200
Hurry up.

662
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,080
Empty an office

663
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,480
for me first.

664
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,000
We'll discuss other things

665
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,040
in detail later.

666
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
Don't mess around with those right now.

667
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
You should handle other things first.

668
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,960
Do what's important first.

669
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,360
Zheng.

670
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,560
Mr. Tang.

671
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,400
What do you think?

672
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,280
Is my pace alright?

673
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,840
Yes.

674
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,600
When you said you wanted to start a company,

675
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,880
I got your

676
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,960
business license,

677
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,200
office space,

678
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,160
and staff ready immediately.

679
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,880
You're one step away from opening.

680
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,280
Zheng.

681
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm giving you an opportunity

682
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,240
to make money.

683
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,840
This is a huge bid.

684
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
If other people get it,

685
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,640
they would be too happy to fall asleep.

686
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,160
Actually,

687
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,960
I feel happy but also worried.

688
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,600
Are you sure I can win

689
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,480
this huge bid?

690
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,040
Rest assured.

691
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,440
You'll know soon.

692
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,960
I'll give my plan to you later.

693
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,840
But you must ask your

694
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,480
design team

695
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,840
to make revisions based on my plan.

696
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
I need the plans to be similar

697
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,920
but not exactly the same.

698
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,800
If you can do this,

699
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,480
the bid is yours of course.

700
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,239
It's simply copying.

701
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,239
No problem.

702
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,400
You're paying for it anyway.

703
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,480
You are the boss.

704
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,760
(Zhi Mu Architectural Design Company)
Hey, you two.

705
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,639
(Zhi Mu Architectural Design Company )
What are you doing?

706
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,960
(Zhi Mu Architectural Design Company)
Leave that.

707
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,880
(Zhi Mu Architectural Design Company )
Focus on priorities.

708
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,679
Okay, okay.

709
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,360
Look at them.

710
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,700
(Zhi Mu Architectural Design Company )

711
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,760
I know what the problem is.

712
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,719
Look here.

713
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,679
Like this.

714
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,000
If you look at it from a different angle,

715
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,760
the problem is resolved.

716
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,159
Here.

717
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,560
The visual focal point changed.

718
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,000
It's like this every time.

719
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,120
When it looks like

720
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,560
we've hit a dead end,

721
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,880
you can always think of a workaround

722
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,880
to shift the way of thinking.

723
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,360
Maybe this is

724
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,080
the talent that a designer should have.

725
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,840
Sister Man Ning.

726
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,640
Boss.

727
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Juice.

728
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,560
Xiao Ning.

729
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,680
Go buy a sandwich for me.

730
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm starving.

731
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,040
But...

732
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,200
it's raining outside.

733
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,360
I have an umbrella at my desk.

734
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,720
I'll go.

735
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,320
It's okay. I have an umbrella.

736
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,800
I can do it.

737
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,560
What's wrong with her?

738
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,680
She encountered something unpleasant

739
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,160
on a rainy day.

740
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,360
So she doesn't want to go out

741
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,480
when it rains.

742
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,800
True.

743
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,160
Being trapped in such a high place.

744
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,680
Anyone would have trauma.

745
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
How long do we need to wait?

746
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,400
Don't get anxious.

747
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,400
Wait a little longer.

748
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm confident.

749
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,440
You guys worked hard these days.

750
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
Take a break.

751
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,960
I'll treat you all to dinner later.

752
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,160
Great.

753
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Mr. Gu.

754
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,800
You guys go first.

755
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,240
Qiao Meng Jia, Cheng Dong, and I

756
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,880
can stay here

757
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,280
until the file finishes rendering.

758
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,480
Okay, thank you, guys.

759
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,160
Xiao Ning.

760
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,680
Okay.

761
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,120
I'll clean up.

762
00:36:59,520 --> 00:36:59,960
You guys...

763
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,380
(Downloading)

764
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,400
Jia Jia.

765
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,160
Come.

766
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,320
Sit here.

767
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,560
I'm starving.

768
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,520
I got everything ready for you.

769
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,360
Be quick.

770
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,560
Look.

771
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,280
Come.

772
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,280
Use this.

773
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,480
Eat.

774
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
I saw everyone's hard work

775
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,600
when working on this bid.

776
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,000
Let's take

777
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
a half-day off tomorrow.

778
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,680
Great!

779
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,680
Come on, make a toast.

780
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
But Boss,

781
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,600
don't say that.

782
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,480
We have to rely on you for making money
to buy food.

783
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
It looks like you've eaten a lot

784
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,320
to look the way you are today.

785
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,600
Good for money-making.

786
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,840
Come on.

787
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,800
(I'm here.)

788
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,040
Yes.

789
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,880
Where is the restroom?

790
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,920
On the left.

791
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm going to the restroom.

792
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,880
Eat this.

793
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,520
Give it to me.

794
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,480
We've come this far.

795
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
Why are you still hesitating?

796
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,120
Nothing.

797
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,840
I disgust myself.

798
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,760
That's better than

799
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
always losing.

800
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,120
Be quick.

801
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,440
Eat more.

802
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,080
This is so yummy.

803
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,280
Don't drink too much.

804
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,600
Cheng Dong.

805
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,720
Come on.

806
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,080
You've worked hard.

807
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,080
It's what I should do.

808
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,480
How's the food?

809
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,320
Very good.

810
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,320
The food tastes so good.

811
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,720
Boss.

812
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,280
Thank you.

813
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,000
See you tomorrow.

814
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,760
See you tomorrow, Boss.

815
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,840
Bye-bye.

816
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,400
Rest well.

817
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:09,960
Take care.

818
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,880
Bye-bye.

819
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,720
I'm so happy.

820
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,600
I haven't been in

821
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,920
such a good mood in a long time.

822
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,680
Feeling fulfilled and looking forward to it.

823
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,680
Look forward to what?

824
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Our bidding result.

825
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,920
Do you have confidence

826
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,040
in our design?

827
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,080
Let's go.

828
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,760
Mr. Tang.

829
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,360
I'm a layman.

830
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,520
But I think

831
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,560
your previous design

832
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,480
is very well done.

833
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:43,880
You...

834
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,600
It's none of your business.

835
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,840
The point is

836
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,320
whether your team can meet my requirements.

837
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,080
I want a design that looks similar

838
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,680
but not exactly the same.

839
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,240
No problem.

840
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,480
These are not people

841
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,120
randomly picked off of the street.

842
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,040
I chose and poached

843
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,800
them one by one

844
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
from other companies.

845
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
They're super experienced.

846
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,240
Also,

847
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,000
the base is very strong.

848
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,800
Doing a little

849
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,320
copying is not a problem for them.

850
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,400
Come and take a look.

851
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Take a look.

852
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,800
Look.

853
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,840
What do you think?

854
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,820
