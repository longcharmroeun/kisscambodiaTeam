Boss, do you need me to drive you home?

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,280
No need.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
Are you going to cram school?

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
That's good, I'm going to cram school too.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,479
You...

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,160
still want to go?

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,160
I don't have anything else on anyway.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,200
Let's go.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,920
But...

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,400
Mr. Gu,

33
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,360
bad news.

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,200
What happened?

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,240
The construction manager

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,080
of the art gallery site

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
and Chen Dong got into an argument

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,040
and almost fought.

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,160
The situation is getting out of hand.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,600
The workers want to stop working.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,320
Let's go and take a look.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,000
Boss,

43
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,480
do you need me to drive you two there?

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,080
No need,

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,440
you can't be of any help if you go anyway.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,840
Okay then.

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
Sister Man Lin, Boss,

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,760
I'm leaving then.

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Be careful.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,800
Call me

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,840
if anything happens.

52
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,880
What do you need her to be careful about?

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Nothing much.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,080
Just that it's quite late now,

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
and she's a girl...

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,160
Xiao Ning.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,920
Thank you.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,480
Greetings, Boss Jiang.

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,200
Why didn't your boss come along today?

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,200
Something came up, he went to attend to it.

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,920
So coincidental?

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
I thought he got scared.

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,920
Chen Chen,

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
you've gone too far.

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm helping you agitate him.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,040
Yet you tell me I've gone too far?

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,920
He really

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
has a lot of work to do.

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Stop fooling around.

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,920
How am I fooling around?

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,880
After knowing you

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,800
for so many years,

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Jiang Xiao Ning,

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,000
you've really fallen in love with your boss.

75
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,720
Whatever you say.

76
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Open the door.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,760
Drive.

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,200
No matter what problems occurred,

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
you could always negotiate,

80
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
why did you hit him?

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,480
That's not it, I didn't hit him.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Look at my collar.

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,520
The buttons have fallen off.

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,600
I just pushed you a little,

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
can that be considered hitting you?

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Also,

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,920
your words were so harsh.

88
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,440
I...

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,640
What do you mean by negligent?

90
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,600
What do you mean by careless

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,360
and perfunctory?

92
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
Did we get the design in the drawing

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,880
wrong?

94
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,400
The construction quality of the wall

95
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,320
isn't even good enough.

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,600
If it isn't good enough, you can tell us,

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
we can make changes.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's not that easy.

99
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
How do you account for the time it'll take?

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,960
Chen Dong,

101
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
in the future, put your inspection results

102
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,680
into a report and submit it to Su Man Lin.

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,960
Let her do the communicating.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,560
Chargehand Pan,

105
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,640
I don't have time today

106
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,160
to head in and check on your construction quality.

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,720
I'll let Su Man Lin do it in a while.

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
If we discover

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,840
any issues

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
that will affect the construction

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
and our schedule,

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,360
then we'll deal with it

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
according to the contract.

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,240
By the way,

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,120
no matter what happens in the future,

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,360
do not touch my staff.

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,800
I just pushed him a little.

118
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,600
Not even push.

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
If this happens again in the future,

120
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,280
I won't deal with it

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,760
in the same manner as I do today.

122
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,480
Carry on with your work.

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,800
Okay, okay, stop looking.

124
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Start working.

125
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,000
Hurry, hurry up.

126
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,600
Su Man Lin,

127
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
are you able to go back yourself?

128
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,560
I have something going on.

129
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,280
I can drive her.

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
Can you drive by yourself?

131
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,680
Not a problem.

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,400
Boss,

133
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,520
-today I…
-We can talk later.

134
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
So Mr. Gu does know how to drive.

135
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,760
It seems like

136
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,360
he has changed a lot recently.

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,760
Indeed, he has changed a lot.

138
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
What are you thinking about?

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm thinking about

140
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
whether you behaving like this

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
will make Boss angry.

142
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
It won't.

143
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,360
If it does,

144
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
it shows he cares about you.

145
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,480
Chen Chen,

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
don't go overboard.

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,040
There won't be an effect

148
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,040
if I don't agitate him like this.

149
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,080
Just listen to me.

150
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,760
Stop looking.

151
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,560
It's so late and he's not here.

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
He might not come.

153
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
Boss.

154
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,320
Jiang Xiao Ning,

155
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,160
get in the car.

156
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Hello, Boss.

157
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,120
You rushed back even though it is so late?

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
Okay, Boss.

159
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,040
Jiang Xiao Ning,

160
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,240
you are not having a late-night snack?

161
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,320
Hurry back.

162
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,120
Boss.

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,400
Boss,

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,840
let's have hot pot another day.

165
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Drive slowly.

166
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,880
Boss,

167
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,320
why do you bring me here?

168
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,760
There's a project inside which is

169
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
very important for your future.

170
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Go and take a look.

171
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,240
<i>Huiju Centre</i>

172
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Boss.

173
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
Where's Boss?

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,640
What did he bring me here to see?

175
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,960
There's nothing.

176
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Jiang Xiao Ning.

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,280
It turns out that all encounters

178
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
are long-awaited reunions.

179
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,840
Thank you for bringing me

180
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
so many wonderful days.

181
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,679
Jiang Xiao Ning,

182
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,000
did you know

183
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,559
that you look the prettiest

184
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,679
when you smile?

185
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,880
Jiang Xiao Ning,

186
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,640
your appearance is like a rainbow

187
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,880
that brings colours into my monochromatic life.

188
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
Jiang Xiao Ning,

189
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,560
I realized that

190
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
when I'm with you,

191
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,320
doing anything makes me happy.

192
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,720
Thank you for your courage.

193
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
The moment you confessed to me

194
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
was the moment when I realized

195
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,920
both of us actually

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,520
felt the same way.

197
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,000
Because of you,

198
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
my heart has been beating busily.

199
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,600
I hope that moving forward,

200
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,120
I can bring you happiness.

201
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,560
Jiang Xiao Ning,

202
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I like you.

203
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,720
Jiang Xiao Ning.

204
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,720
How could you do this?

205
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm not mentally prepared at all.

206
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,440
Am I dreaming?

207
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,440
I can tell you in all seriousness

208
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,560
one more time.

209
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,280
Jiang Xiao Ning,

210
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
I like you.

211
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,120
There.

212
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,240
But I haven't finished

213
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,760
my words.

214
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,600
What else?

215
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,920
Can't you finish what you want to say

216
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
all at once?

217
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,760
My heart is about to burst.

218
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Although I like you a lot,

219
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,960
I can't be with you

220
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
right now.

221
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
I don't understand what you mean.

222
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Why?

223
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Can I not tell you the reason for now?

224
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,000
If you're willing,

225
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
can you wait for me for three months?

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,560
Okay.

227
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,200
I can wait, no matter for how long.

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,040
If even after three months,

229
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,280
we are unable to be together,

230
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
will you blame me?

231
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
I won't blame you.

232
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
Thank you for telling me these things today.

233
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,280
This is the first time in my life

234
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,920
someone I like

235
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,240
tells me that

236
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
he likes me too.

237
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
This is also the most beautiful moment

238
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
in my life

239
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,400
till this day.

240
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Jiang Xiao Ning,

241
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,280
can't you feel a prickling sensation?

242
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,040
I don't feel it.

243
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
But I feel

244
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,520
comfortably tingly.

245
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,840
Why won't you let me drive you?

246
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,960
You'll drive me around during work hours.

247
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Beyond that,

248
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
I'll drive you.

249
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
But can you drive...

250
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,880
I won't drive for others.

251
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,800
But

252
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,400
for you, I will.

253
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
Hurry, head home.

254
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,480
I still want a hug.

255
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,520
What's wrong?

256
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,360
I was just thinking

257
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,600
that since we're not

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,600
officially together,

259
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,880
we should

260
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,520
still maintain

261
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,320
some distance.

262
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,160
This is probably the weirdest confession

263
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,960
in the world.

264
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,640
Wait for me.

265
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,000
Three months.

266
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,560
I'll head up then. Goodnight.

267
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,240
Goodnight.

268
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,840
I'm really heading up.

269
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,960
Why won't my feet listen?

270
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,160
My feet

271
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,680
don't seem to be listening to me either.

272
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Really?

273
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,000
It's like they're glued to the ground.

274
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
Well then,

275
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,400
okay,

276
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,120
to save you,

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,800
I'll head up first.

278
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,160
Goodnight.

279
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,480
Goodnight.

280
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,160
Jiang Xiao Ning, what're you doing?

281
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Jiang Xiao Ning.

282
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,560
Why are you ignoring me
when I'm talking to you?

283
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
Okay, I'll be done right away.

284
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,720

Director Xu,

309
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,000
rare to see you being so carefree.

310
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,040
You've done such a good job

311
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,160
with everything.

312
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,040
Of course I'd be carefree.

313
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,880
Sit.

314
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
I never imagined

315
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,720
you would be able to do such a good job

316
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,640
with this branch company.

317
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
I was right about you.

318
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,280
I'll tell the board of directors tomorrow

319
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
to transfer you back.

320
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,600
Tang Xu,

321
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
it's time for you to make something of yourself.

322
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,800
Rest assured,

323
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
I won't let

324
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,720
you down.

325
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,760
By the way,

326
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,160
Tang Zheng Cheng

327
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,840
should be out these few days, right?

328
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,560
Yes.

329
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,280
What are your plans?

330
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
I've thought about it.

331
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,440
We still need to go through

332
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,520
all the conventions.

333
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,920
If I ignore him completely,

334
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,520
others may mock us.

335
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,640
They might feel

336
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,760
you haven't taught me well,

337
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,040
so I don't know the manners at all.

338
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
Although in my heart, I hate him

339
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,800
and despise him,

340
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,440
I still need to help him

341
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,360
sort out his life for a bit.

342
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,600
I won't interfere

343
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,040
with what you want to do,

344
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,800
but most importantly, your relationship...

345
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,440
You need to manage this relationship well.

346
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,200
Understand?

347
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
Actually, I have no relations

348
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
to him at all.

349
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,960
I'm just fulfilling

350
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,320
my obligation.

351
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,120
How should I put this...

352
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
You don't need to be so cruel.

353
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,560
In this world,

354
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
we need to learn tolerance.

355
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,520
How about this?

356
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,320
When he comes out,

357
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
I'll let my driver

358
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,640
drive you there to pick him up.

359
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,720
When I have the time,

360
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll go and visit him.

361
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,200
Okay, I'll do as you say.

362
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,240
Why did you order so much food?

363
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,040
Your exam is coming up.

364
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
<i>Three Beavers Garden Restaurant</i>
I can't help you with anything,

365
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,080
so I can only buy you food

366
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,920
to help you get refreshed.

367
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,000
Then I'm digging in.

368
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh right,

369
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
how are Grandma and Aunty?

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,320
They're well, don't worry.

371
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,120
Okay.

372
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,240
I bought them something.

373
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,840
Bring these to them

374
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,520
when you leave.

375
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,280
You don't have to buy anything.

376
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,240
Aunty...

377
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,080
I know.

378
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
Just don't tell her that

379
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,080
I bought these.

380
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,840
Brother Xu,

381
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,040
I don't know how to express my gratitude.

382
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,720
You're so

383
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,840
nice to us.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,280
I hope what I'm doing

385
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
will help resolve

386
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,080
their hatred to my dad.

387
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,920
He's almost out.

388
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,840
Really?

389
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,960
In a few days.

390
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,480
He has been refusing to see me

391
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,840
during all these years.

392
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I have a lot of questions for him.

393
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,240
I finally get to see him.

394
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Brother Xu, you have to help me.

395
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
I understand.

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,080
However, he just got out of jail.

397
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,360
Let's wait a bit.

398
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,320
I understand, I'm not in a rush.

399
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,440
Oh,

400
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,320
I've already cleaned up

401
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,160
the apartment I rented.

402
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,520
I'll move as soon as possible.

403
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,120
Xiao Ning, no need to rush.

404
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,600
I rented him an apartment.

405
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
You guys can still live there.

406
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Cancel the original lease.

407
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,680
Our lease hasn't ended.

408
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,280
Canceling it isn't a good decision.

409
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,400
Also,

410
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,560
your dad must wish to

411
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,440
live in his own house.

412
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,000
Xiao Ning, you really don't have to.

413
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,920
We promised it's temporary.

414
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,240
Then we'll just keep our words.

415
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,360
I insist.

416
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,240
Let's not talk about this right now.

417
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,920
Thank you, Brother Xu.

418
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,600
You are very welcome.

419
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,480
Thank you indeed.

420
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,240
Eat more.

421
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,960
Come on.

422
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,140
<i>Design Director, Chuan</i>

423
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,280
Come in.

424
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Boss,

425
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,280
could I take this afternoon off?

426
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
Are you going to the cram school again?

427
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,800
No,

428
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm moving back to my previous apartment.

429
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,520
I'm pretty free this afternoon.

430
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,400
Let me help you.

431
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,160
It's okay,

432
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,200
I can handle the

433
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
physical stuff.

434
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,160
Also, there's not much stuff anyway.

435
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,720
If I really can't handle it,

436
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,120
I'll ask my friends who have

437
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,800
nothing to do for help.

438
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,240
Alright,

439
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm the friend

440
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,680
who has nothing to do.

441
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,240
Hi, Boss.

442
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
There we meet again.

443
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,040
Jiang Xiao Ning,

444
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,320
I've already asked the movers to come.

445
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,520
Your leisure friend

446
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,760
really

447
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,680
doesn't have to come.

448
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,800
I told Chen Chen not to come,

449
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,520
but…

450
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,160
Xiao Ning, so you're ditching me

451
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,600
after all those years of me helping you?

452
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,560
Jiang Xiao Ning didn't need any help.

453
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,880
It's none of your business.

454
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,840
We're all friends.

455
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,240
What are you two doing?

456
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,280
If we're friends,

457
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
do you want to eat hot pot together?

458
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,360
Hot pot is fine!

459
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Wait till

460
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,360
we're both free.

461
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Okay.

462
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,200
Don't worry about it.

463
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,600
Xiao Ning,

464
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
I came here to tell you that

465
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
I'm moving to another city.

466
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm just saying goodbye today.

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,080
That's so sudden.

468
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,120
Then we won't be able to meet

469
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
this easily again.

470
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,240
Someone here doesn't want

471
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,440
us meeting regularly.

472
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,640
Come on.

473
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,360
Give me a hug before I leave.

474
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,600
Come here,

475
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll hug you for her.

476
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,520
Nice, nice.

477
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,160
Let's go.

478
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,680
Jiang Xiao Ning,

479
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,600
come and check

480
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,560
if you still want these.

481
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,440
Coming.

482
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm heading upstairs now.

483
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,080
Take care, I hope everything goes well for you.

484
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,960
Bye.

485
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,360
Why aren't you gone yet?

486
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,600
Xiao Ning is a good girl.

487
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,600
Treat her well.

488
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,280
I know.

489
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,320
I'll stop right here, kid.

490
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,560
Think about it,

491
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,440
if it wasn't for my assist,

492
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,800
how can you two progress this quickly?

493
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,720
So don't keep everything

494
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,440
to yourself.

495
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,480
You've lived for several decades now.

496
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,800
There is no need

497
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,760
to be so shy about your relationship.

498
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
You're too young.

499
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,120
There are a lot of things that you don't understand.

500
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,240
I'll tell you when you grow up.

501
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,600
Just go.

502
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,580
<i>Yangchun Alley</i>

503
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,600
Drink some water.

504
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,680
Thank you, Grandma.

505
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,640
Guang Da,

506
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,800
you just got off work.

507
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,920
Go to take a shower

508
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,960
and rest a little.

509
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll make you some dumplings.

510
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
You have an idea of

511
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,560
how my grandma acts now.

512
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
If she sees a young person,

513
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,880
she will think that I'm dating too early.

514
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,520
If she sees a mature one,

515
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,600
she will call him son.

516
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,880
But we don't look

517
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,880
that much different.

518
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,520
I look super young.

519
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,520
Why do you care so much

520
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,520
about age recently?

521
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,480
I don't.

522
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,240
I only care about

523
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,280
if we get to eat dumplings tonight.

524
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,960
Aunty,

525
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,560
Gu Chuan asks if there'll be any dumplings.

526
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,600
Of course.

527
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,120
Stay for dinner.

528
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,280
Aunty will make you dumplings.

529
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,840
Aunty says yes.

530
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,360
Guang Da,

531
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,480
you like celery dumplings, right?

532
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,720
Celery.

533
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,400
Xiao Mai,

534
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,160
we're making celery dumplings.

535
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,720
Got it, mom.

I have nothing to be mad about.

552
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
Xiao Xu,

553
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,880
I...

554
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,760
Don't worry,

555
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,400
I know what you mean.

556
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,440
I'm doing well staying with Director Xu,

557
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,920
and I've been really busy lately.

558
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,840
Don't come to me except for emergencies.

559
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,240
If you want to make things up for me,

560
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
just don't let me see you.

561
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,840
And stop causing trouble to my life.

562
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,880
That would be the best gift

563
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040

564
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
Let's just end it here.

Stay and chat with me.

569
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,800
I don't have time.

570
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,440
Or do you want to eat together?

571
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,160
I'm good.

572
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,360
Let go of me.

573
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm sorry.

574
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,240
It's all my fault.

575
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,320
Since the day you went to jail,

576
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,880
since the day my mom jumped off of that building,

577
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,800
I swore

578
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,240
never to forgive you.

579
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,760
My phone number is in it.

00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,080
Don't call me unless it's an emergency.

581

Cantilever beam...

582
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,080
Cantilever beam...

583
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,720
And this is... continuous beam?

584
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,960
You didn't reply to my messages.

585
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,640
Why are you still here at this hour?

586
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,280
I got too busy and didn't hear my phone ring.

587
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,400
Did you run into any problems?

588
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,440
I don't understand

589
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,840
these documents.

590
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,600
You'll get it if you look it up.

591
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,520
I used to be good at English,

592
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,160
just not as good as you guys.

593
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,840
Let me help you.

594
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,240
That way it would be faster.

595
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,120
If I let you

596
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,400
help me with little things like this,

597
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,440
I would feel like

598
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
that I'm rubbish.

599
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,560
Helping you is helping myself.

600
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,320
If you don't get off work,

601
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,640
I'm going to be pretty bored alone.

602
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
Let me see.

603
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,360

Brother Xu,

617
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,080
why are you here?

618
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,920
Xiao Ning.

619
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,080
Boss, give me one second.

620
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,080
Are you here for me?

621
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,520
Why didn't you call me?

622
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,520
I wasn't sure if you were here.

623
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm just passing by.

624
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,080
I didn't expect to actually see you.

625
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,680
Oh,

626
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,160
do you want to get food together?

627
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,200
Mr. Gu.

628
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,680
Brother Xu,

629
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,160
I'm driving my boss home today.

630
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
Next time.

631
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,800
Bye.

632
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,240
Xiao Ning.

633
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,800
Bye.

634
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,840
Why didn't you go?

635
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
Work is not done yet,

636
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,000
I have to send you back home first.

637
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,880
So is it all about work?

638
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Boss,

639
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,080
are you being jealous?

640
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,160
Why do we have to wait for three more months?

641
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,760
I can't wait.

642
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,640
I think that if you love someone,

643
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,840
you should tell them what you really think.

644
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
Actually, these three months...

645
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,080
What's up?

646
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,000
Never mind. Let's talk about this later.

647
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,720
You can tell me

648
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,960
everything.

649
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,679
I can take it.

650
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,520
I've never hated

651
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,520
time so much.

652
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
It passes too slowly.

653
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,760
Me too.

654
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,120
You have a fever?

655
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,159
Do you really plan on

656
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,600
telling Jiang Xiao Ning

657
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,960
about your mechanical heart?

658
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,239
Would it be better

659
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,280
if I just tell her the reason?

660
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,920
If I keep it from her

661
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,639
and make her wait for three months,

662
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,360
I'm afraid that...

663
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,159
But you've been guarding this secret

664
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,360
for all these years.

665
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
And now, you're just

666
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,480
going to let it out this easily?

667
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,080
Easily?

668
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,720
Chuan,

669
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,280
what if three months later,

670
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,720
I'm just supposing,

671
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,760
what if the doctor couldn't fix anything,

672
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,840
and you still cannot

673
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,240
be with Jiang Xiao Ning?

674
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,600
Do you still

675
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,880
want her to know then?

676
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,520
I think if it's Jiang Xiao Ning,

677
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,400
it would be okay.

678
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,080
You're just

679
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,080
blinded by love.

680
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
If Jiang Xiao Ning finds out,

681
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,480
but you two never get together...

682
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,120
What if she tells Zhao Yan

683
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,040
and Zhao Yan tells other people,

684
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,520
and in the end,

685
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,840
everyone knows

686
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,120
about your secret?

687
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,440
Then they will think

688
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,040
you are a weirdo.

689
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,800
You won't be able to live normally

690
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,920
ever again.

691
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,920
Do you know?

692
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,840
When I look at Jiang Xiao Ning's face

693
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,880
when she asked me,

694
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,600
I felt so bad.

695
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,480
Does it only take

696
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,360
one facial expression

697
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,000
to make such a big decision?

698
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,800
Isn't this enough?

699
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,080
You're not

700
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,480
the Gu Chuan I know anymore.

701
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,560
Let me go grab a drink

702
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,640
and chill.

703
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,040
Take care.

704
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,240
Why do we need to wait for three more months?

705
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
I can't wait.

706
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,880
I think if you love someone,

707
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,840
you should tell them what you really think.

708
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,000
Give me a little more time.

709
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,080
I'll be able to solve all the problems.

710
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,320
From then on,

711
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,240
you'll be able to

712
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,600
live like a normal person again.

713
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,360
Charging interrupted.

714
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,680
Let's grab lunch together.

715
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,800
<i>Let's grab lunch together</i>

716
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Sure.

717
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
<i>Let's grab lunch together</i>
<i>Sure</i>

718
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,240
What do you want to eat?

719
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,320
I don't want to eat anything after seeing you.

720
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,120
I forget that I'm hungry.

721
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,480
Do you want some burgers

722
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,400
or fries?

723
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
Burgers?

724
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,480
I thought you wouldn't eat

725
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,160
such junk food.

726
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,160
I like whatever you like.

727
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,560
I had a great time these past few days.

728
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,320
I haven't felt this way

729
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,560
for a very long time.

730
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,800
Didn't you say that

731
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
we shouldn't hide anything

732
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,560
from each other

733
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
when being together?

734
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,400
If you don't want to say it,

735
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,720
I won't ask anymore.

736
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
Today, you can ask

737
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
whatever you want.

738
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,800
Really?

739
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,800
That's the reason

740
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,240
I asked you out today.

741
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,560
I just want to ask you about

742
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,760
the reason why we have to wait

743
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
for three more months.

744
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,600
I saw this question coming.

745
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,080
It's a long story.

746
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,480
It might

747
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,120
take a bit of time.

748
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,320
I'm willing to listen for a lifetime,

749
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
if you're willing to talk.

750
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,880
Are you alright?

751
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
I'm sorry, I...

752
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,960
Are you alright?

753
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,960
I'm good, I'm good.

754
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,920
I'm truly sorry.

755
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm going to go if you're good.

756
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,200
Take it slow in the future.

757
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,400
Be careful.

758
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,000
What happened?

759
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,200
I'm okay.

760
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,440
Boss,

761
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,360
you don't look like you're okay.

762
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,840
Should I take you to the hospital?

763
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,840
I'm going home now.

764
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,520
I'll call you tonight.

765
00:39:30,544 --> 00:40:00,544
