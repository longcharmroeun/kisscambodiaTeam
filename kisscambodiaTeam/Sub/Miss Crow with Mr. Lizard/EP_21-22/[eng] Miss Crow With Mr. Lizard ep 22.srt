Chuan, what's going on?

Why is the alarm activated?

36
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,880
It's just a malfunction.

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,000
It's no big deal.

38
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080

on my way here?

42
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,800
I was afraid

43
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
you would just...

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,080
All right now.

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,960
Stop being emotional.

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,920
So?

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
Have you told Jiang Xiao Ning?

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,959
I haven't gotten the chance to.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,640
Also...

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,280
I lost my watch.

51
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,480
You lost your watch?

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Perhaps,

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,560
Jiang Xiao Ning found it.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
That's great.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
You can't hide it anymore.

56
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,840
Have you made up your mind?

57
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,840
Yes.

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,520
Director Xu.

59
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,880
Where's Gu Chuan?

60
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Is he all right?

61
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,280
He's fine.

62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
He is waiting for you
in the charging room upstairs.

63
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
You two may talk.

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I'll get going.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
Charging room?

66
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,760
Charging interrupted.

67
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,880
Boss.

68
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,720
What are you doing?

69
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
This is a mechanical heart.

70
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,120
I need to recharge it to stay alive.

71
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
So...

72
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
you were charging it?

73
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
That's right.

74
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,240
I found your watch.

75
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,000
It says "charging".

76
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,800
All of a sudden,

77
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,040
I recalled many things.

78
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,080
Now that you have seen it.

79
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
This is my greatest secret.

80
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,680
Are you...

81
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,840
a robot?

82
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm not.

83
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,880
Besides

84
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,200
having a mechanical heart,

85
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm just like ordinary people

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,320
in every other aspect.

87
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,280
It's just that

88
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,520
at times,

89
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,280
there will be some glitches.

90
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,960
What glitches?

91
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,920
If my heart rate is high,

92
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,280
and I don't control it well,

93
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
there'll be electric discharge

94
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,320
from my body.

95
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,080
That's why you broke the car,

96
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,920
and electrocuted He Sheng

97
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
and me?

98
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,400
The reason I asked you here

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
is to tell you

100
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
about my mechanical heart

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,360
and the things between us.

102
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,640
There are still some problems

103
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
with the mechanical heart.

104
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,680
So I can't live

105
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,320
like a normal person.

106
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
But a few days ago,

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,160
the doctor

108
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:17,320
who developed the mechanical heart said

109
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
that he would solve all the problems

110
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,520
of the mechanical heart

111
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,960
within three months.

112
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,640
In other words,

113
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
except for the need for recharging,

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,960
I will be able to live

115
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
just like normal people.

116
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,520
The reason why I asked you

117
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,000
to wait for me for three months

118
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,560
is because I hope that

119
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,000
these problems can be solved

120
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,320
before we get together.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,280
Well, why would your heart

122
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,200
be in such a state?

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
Ten years ago,

124
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,720
I suffered a very serious injury.

125
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,160
What happened?

126
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
A car accident.

127
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,320
I was driving on the mountain road

128
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,200
and saw a truck in front of me

129
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,000
hit a car.

130
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
I got out of my car to help.

131
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,120
The truck hit me and the car

132
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
and we plunged down the cliff.

133
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
When I woke up,

134
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
I was in the valley.

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
She was stuck in the car and couldn't move.

139
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,480
And she couldn't see her parents

140

From now on,

175
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
we'll never be apart again.

176
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,700
♪Ah~ah~♪

177
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,740
♪Exchanging sunshine for moonlight♪

178
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,140
♪Exchanging fortune for the past♪

179
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,620
♪Exchanging my heartbeat for you♪

180
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,520
I could feel the electric discharge.

181
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,960
Isn't it

182
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
that you couldn't feel the pain?

183
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
You didn't feel it before

184
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,360
when the electricity is discharged from my body.

185
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,880
Let me feel it again.

186
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,160
I could really feel it.

187
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Why would it be like this?

188
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
Will you be afraid of me?

189
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,160
It's just electricity leakage.

190
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm not afraid.

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
Back then, when I had dreams,

192
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,320
I couldn't see your face clearly.

193
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,120
Now, I finally know

194
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,960
what that big brother

195
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
looks like.

196
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,160
So the saying is true.

197
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,080
"All encounters in life

198
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,960
are reunions after a long time apart."

199
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,640
Well, I'll get going now.

200
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Otherwise, my grandma and aunt

201
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,040
will be worried.

202
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,920
Can you manage it being by yourself?

203
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,000
I can.

204
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,640
If not,

205
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,520
you can stay and keep me company.

206
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
I think you look fine.

207
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,400
I'll go now.

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,960
I'll walk you.

209
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,920
Dr. Peel said

210
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,640
it's just three months, right?

211
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,200
That's right.

212
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,280
Will there be no electricity leakage

213
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,120
after three months?

214
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
Jiang Xiao Ning.

215
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
I believe you.

216
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,000
You came right away

217
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,400
without asking where I wanted to go?

218
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,720
I'll accompany you

219
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,040
wherever you want to go.

220
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,640
Never leave your side.

221
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,200
At your beck and call.

222
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,880
Pick somewhere nice.

223
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,760
Let's go for an outing.

224
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Yan Yan.

225
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,720
This is the first time you asked me out.

226
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,080
Does it mean

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,840
that our relationship

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,920
has taken another step further?

229
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,360
That's right.

230
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,280
It's hot.

231
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,280
Yan Yan.

232
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800
To let you get to know me better,

233
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
today, I decided to show

234
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
the talented side of me.

235
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,960
A moment, please.

236
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,680
You're being mysterious.

237
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:45,996
<i>Self-heating hot pot</i>

238
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,080
You can play guitar?

239
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Not bad, right?

240
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,800
I composed it myself.

241
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,920
But no lyrics yet.

242
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,920
It's nice.

243
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,160
When I was a kid,

244
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,040
I used to secretly

245
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,160
practice the guitar.

246
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
But my mom doesn't like it.

247
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,040
She likes classical music.

248
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,720
So I've learned piano,

249
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,280
violin, cello, et cetera.

250
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,320
So you want to be a musician?

251
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,720
That never crossed my mind.

252
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,880
I just like listening to it.

253
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,200
It makes me happy.

254
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm better at doing business.

255
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,960
I like maths too.

256
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
When I was young,

257
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,400
I dreamed of being a mathematician.

258
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,280
You're different

259
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,440
from what you appear to be.

260
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,440
Right?

261
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Did you suddenly realize
there are many sides of mine

262
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,560
and each one of them is perfect?

263
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.

264
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,360
Is the self-heating pot ready?

265
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,440
Do you remember the big brother

266
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,600
that I told you about?

267
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,400
Of course.

268
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,160
You've said it many a time.

269
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,280
It's destiny to meet

270
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,160
in the boundless huge crowd...

271
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,680
It's Gu Chuan.

272
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,200
That big brother is Gu Chuan.

273
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,080
You...

274
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,240
It's giving me

275
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
goosebumps.

276
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,320
The person that you've been thinking about

277
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
is the one you have a crush on?

278
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,760
What a plot twist.

279
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,360
Actually,

280
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,280
there's one more thing that I haven't told you.

281
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,320
He said yes to you?

282
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,400
How did you know?

283
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,480
I could tell from the look on your face.

284
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,360
I thought

285
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,640
it was Director Xu who told you.

286
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,560
That fool

287
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,000
is probably still none the wiser.

288
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,280
Don't underestimate him.

289
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,720
He has many admirers.

290
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,240
My colleague, Qiao Meng Jia,

291
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
seems to be really into him.

292
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
Don't get me started.

293
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,080
As my bestie,

294
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,080
how could you not tell me

295
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,080
who that girl was?

296
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,240
Those two...

297
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,440
It was an act.

298
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,560
But still,

299
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
she couldn't keep asking him for a kiss.

300
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
Just be honest.

301
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,480
Do you like him or not?

302
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,240
You keep playing hard to get.

303
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
It's not your style.

304
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,520
You've always been very resolute.

305
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,640
Either you like him,

306
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,680
or you don't.

307
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
I like him.

308
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,200
Accept him then.

309
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,920
I'm just scared.

310
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,240
I know what love is like.

311
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,840
Experiencing it once

312
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,520
is enough.

313
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,000
I...

314
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,480
I don't want to be fooled again.

315
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,880
It's not Director Xu's fault

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,120
to be born rich.

317
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,040
Besides,

318
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
he's definitely not a married guy.

319
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,760
He won't be like that scumbag.

320
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,800
He truly loves you.

321
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,320
Let's move on to you.

322
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,440
I'm more interested

323
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,240
with your stuff.

324
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,440
Have you two...

325
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,200
I...

326
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,000
We...

327
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,720
Spill!

328
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,240
I want feedback

329
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
on these documents before the end of the day.

330
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,840
Okay, Boss.

331
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,960
Also,

332
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,080
here.

333
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,480
I bought it for you.

334
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,560
First Blood!

335
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,600

<i>Chuan Design Studio</i>

Triple Kill!

338
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,160
Brother Kai.

339
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,840
Have you noticed

340
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,360
those two are acting weird?

341
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,280
Why are you laughing?

342
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,000
Who?

343
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,560
Both of them.

344
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,920
Here's the thing.

345
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
It's not appropriate

346
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,800
for us, the Admin Department,

347
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,560
to make comments

348
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,680
on your Design Department.

349
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,520
Go back to your department then.

350
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
Watch your tongue.

351
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,840
Go on.

352
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,800
Jia Jia.

353
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,480
That's a brilliant move by Mr. Gu.

354
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,400
Jia Jia.

355
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,360
The love design specially made by Kai Kai Wang.

356
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,240
Jia Jia.

357
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
Two same design of Kai Kai Wang's

358
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,960
Meco Peach and Pink Grapefruit.

359
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,120
It's tasty, and it brings luck,

360
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,120
boosting your love luck.

361
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
You deserve it.

362
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,200
Are you not right in the head?

363
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,040
Wang Kai.

364
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,200
I want to use another way

365
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,440
to confess to you.

366
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
The fruit juice is nice.

367
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,960
But

368
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,800
you are not as good as it.

369
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,640
Don't switch styles as you wish.

370
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,200
I...

371
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:32,760
The day I become rich

372
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,720
will be the day I marry you.

374
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,680
Excuse me.

375
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,480
Could you help to take a look

376
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,320
if this is the right address?

377
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Yes, this is the place.

378
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,120
It's correct.

379
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm looking for Tang Xu.

380
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,360
Have you made an appointment?

381
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,760
Appointment?

382
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
If not,

383
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,840
I can't help you

384
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,720
get him.

385
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm Tang Xu's dad.

386

<i>Reindeer Group</i>
Xu Guo Xiang and I

387
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,680
<i>Reindeer Group</i>
are old friends.

388
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,200
We've known each other for over two decades.

389
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm sorry, sir.

390
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,120
Why don't you give him a call

391
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
and ask him out?

392
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,000
Look.

393
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
I'm Tang Xu's dad indeed.

394
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,360
If you don't believe me,

395
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,840
you can call him and check.

396
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,400
You...

397
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,240
Hi, Mr. Tang.

398
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,240
Xiao Xu.

399
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,800
Xiao Xu.

400
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,440
Why are you here?

401
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
I came to see you.

402
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,760
It looks good around here.

403
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,160
Well, if you're busy,

404
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,600
I'll go and see Xu Guo Xiang.

405
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,600
I have things to talk to him about.

406
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,480
He's out.

407
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,000
Besides, he seldom comes to the company.

408
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,120
When will he come again?

409
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,520
I don't know.

410
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,920
I'll let you know if he comes.

411
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
How about having lunch together?

412
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,920
It's almost lunch time anyway.

413
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,880
I'm not free.

414
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,760
Look.

415
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,040
When I was in prison,

416
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,560
I could talk to others

417
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,680
when we were let out for exercise.

418
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
But now?

419
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,760
I'm out now.

420
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,040
Besides buying groceries, I'm all alone

421
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,400
at home.

422
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,120
There's no one to talk to.

423
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,640
If you are free,

424
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,800
come home some time.

425
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
Are you done yet?

426
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,080
Listen.

427
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
I don't have time.

428
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm very busy.

429
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,640
Look.

430
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,320
You...

431
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,600
Come home when you're free.

432
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,560
You've been staring at me for a long time.

433
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,680
Boss.

434
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,640
Don't you think

435
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,320
we're a perfect match?

436
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,440
There's electric discharge from your body,

437
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,720
and I'm not afraid of the pain.

438
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,840
There's no one more suitable

439
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,760
to be with you than me.

440
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,360
Are you all right?

441
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm fine.

442
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,920
Well, can I continue?

443
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Do what?

444
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,000
Confessing.

445
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,040
Jiang Xiao Ning.

446
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,840
You're a girl.

447
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680
You should be more reserved.

448
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,880
What's with that expression?

449
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,600
Do you accept me or not?

450
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,960
Don't just smile.

451
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,640
Do you accept me or not?

452
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,440
I do.

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Where are we going now?

454
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,120
You'll know when we get there.

455
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,440
Okay.

456
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,800
Boss.

457
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,160
We're on the campus

458
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,880
at this late hour.

459
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,640
Are you thinking about

460
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,960
having campus romance with me?

461
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,480
Look at you.

462
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,760
What's on your mind all day?

463
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,720
You.

464
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,040
Here.

465
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,520
Take a look.

466
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,220
<i>Clock of Time</i>
<i>Designer: Jiang Guang Da, in 2006</i>

467
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,560
This is...

468
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,160
This is from your dad.

469
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,300
<i>Clock of Time</i>
<i>Designer: Jiang Guang Da, in 2006</i>

470
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,960
How did you know

471
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,000
it was here?

472
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,480
When I was going through the information,

473
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,960
I found

474
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,640
that the designer is called Jiang Guang Da.

475
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,640
I was wondering

476
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
if he was your dad

477
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,200
or just someone with the same name.

478
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,600
Then I checked the personnel list

479
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,880
and found that it was really your dad.

480
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,800
I don't even know about this.

481
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,560
It's been quite some time.

482
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
The land in this place

483
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,720
is getting more and more expensive.

484
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,280
The campus may have to relocate

485
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,480
to a new place.

486
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,600
In another two years.

487
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,040
This place will be demolished after two years.

488
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,120
How did you know

489
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
that he left this behind?

490
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,640
Was it really from him?

491
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,240
It's from your dad, really.

492
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,280
Actually, the designers are the people

493
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,560
working behind the scenes.

494
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,080
After the building is put into use,

495
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,320
not many people will care

496
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,920
who the designer is.

497
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
For example,

498
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,360
when we go to the mall, listen to the opera,

499
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,280
or go to the exhibition,

500
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,360
no one will ask

501
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,280
who built those buildings

502
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,320
or who the designer is.

503
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
That's why many designers

504
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,560
will leave their own marks

505
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,440
in their own designs.

506
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,360
Some designers

507
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,120
will incorporate some of their own styles,

508
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,000
whereas some designers

509
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,720
might leave behind

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,880
a piece of brick,

511
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,440
a tile,

512
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,720
or a cornerstone.

513
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,520
And so,

514
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,480
your dad left this.

515
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
I never thought

516
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,280
I would find something

517
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,080
related to my dad now.

518
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,920
Thank you.

519
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,760
Our company

520
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,720
will be responsible

521
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,200
for the design of the new project here.

522
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,560
If you take part in it,

523
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,840
your name

524
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,520
will be engraved on it too.

525
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,000
Then,

526
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,200
your name

527
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,400
will be engraved

528
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,640
with your dad's.

529
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,560
Consider it a gift from me.

530
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,160
Thank you.

531
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,160
Which faculty are you from?

532
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,120
What time is it now?

533
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,600
Why are you cuddling here?

534
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,120
Run.

535
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,200
Let's go.

536
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,580
♪What kind of me would you like♪

537
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,100
♪I'm at a loss for words♪

538
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,020
♪It's like I'm seeing the future♪

539
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,840
♪It's because you're by my side♪

540
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,640
Boss.

541
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
The safety belt is broken. I can't pull it.

542
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,140
♪Woo～～♪

543
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,740
♪Woo～～♪

544
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,440
Who taught you that?

545
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,800
Sister Yan Yan.

546
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,440
You don't have to learn these tricks anymore.

547
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,720
Why?

548
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,880
Because you're the one I like.

549
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,220
♪Woo～～♪

550
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,460
♪My heart beats because you are by my side♪

551
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,880
What's the matter?

552
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,880
You can sleep in the room.

553
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,800
I'll take the couch.

554
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,080
No, I'll take the couch.

555
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,520
Listen to me. It's not comfortable
sleeping on the couch.

556
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,080
Boss, go upstairs and sleep.

557
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,000
Don't mind me.

558
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,640
If that's the case,

559
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
I'll sleep on the couch too.

560
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,640
It's not comfortable.

561
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,120
I want to be closer to you.

562
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,760
Just sleep.

563
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,280
Boss, what time is it?

564
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,160
It's 9:30 am.

565
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I must have slept soundly

567
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,600
that I slept through the alarm.

568
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
I turned off the alarm.

569
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,880
Get more rest.

570
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm cooking porridge for breakfast.

571
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,000
I'll wake you when it's ready.

572
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,640
I need to get to work.

573
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,400
Wherever I am,

574
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,000
that's where you'll work.

575
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,920
I never thought I would be able to sleep in.

576
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,640
It's such a blessing to be able to do that.

577
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,560
I want to make more money

578
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,640
and retire early.

579
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,440
That way, I can live such a life sooner.

580
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
Thinking about retirement already?

581
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,760
There are decades to go.

582
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,920
I know.

583
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,480
That's why I'll be working hard.

584
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Sister Man Lin.

585
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,080
Jiang Xiao Ning, what time is it now?

586
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,720
Where is the information I gave you yesterday?

587
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:09,960
I've organized the content

588
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,960
and sent it to your mailbox.

589
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
Perhaps, it didn't get through.

590
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,159
Help me buy an iced latte.

591
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Buy coffee?

592
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,719
I haven't arrived at the office yet.

593
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,239
I'll buy it for you when I get there.

594
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,719
What time is it now?
You haven't come to the office yet?

595
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,560
Are you sick of this job

596
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,840
and don't want it anymore?

597
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,199
It's not that.

598
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,199
Jiang Xiao Ning is working on some stuff

599
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,080
at my place.

600
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
She will go to the office once it's done.

601
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,199
You can get back to sleep.

602
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,080
I can't sleep now.

603
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,560
It puts me on the edge,

604
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,800
and it's getting tougher.

605
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,520
Hello?

606
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Didn't I tell you

607
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,320
that Jiang Xiao Ning is sleeping now?

608
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,960
You can order a takeaway.

609
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,640
You are...

610
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,820
<i>Brother Xu</i>

611
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,520
Brother Xu.

612
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,560
Go on.

613
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
Xiao Ning, where are you now?

614
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,880
I'm at the boss's house.

615
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,640
What's up?

616
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,560
Nothing.

617
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,240
Tang Zheng Cheng is out.

618
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,040
He wants to cook a meal for you.

619
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,840
Would you like to go?

620
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,360
Sure.

621
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,280
I'll be there.

622
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,680
Just text me

623
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,880
the time and location.

624
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,960
Also, make sure it doesn't clash

625
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,000
with my working hours.

626
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,800
Okay.

627
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,520
Get back to your work then.

628
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,240
Okay.

629
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,960
You have so many friends, huh?

630
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,280
Why is Boss always angry?

631
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,800
He probably didn't sleep well,

632
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,400
and thus got a bad temper.

633
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,440
Let's see what kind of food

634
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,200
can help to ease that.

635
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,440
Xiao Ning, you're here.

636
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,280
Come on in.

637
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,000
This way.

638
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,720
Xiao Ning, you're here.

639
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,320
Mr. Tang.

640
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,400
It's been a while.

641
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,760
That's right.

642
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,240
You're a big girl now.

643
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,040
That's right.

644
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,640
It's been ten years now.

645
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:47,960
That's right.

646
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,760
Xiao Ning, take a seat.

647
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,880
Right.

648
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,400
Here.

649
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,400
Here. Take a seat.

650
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,720
Here.

651
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,440
Mr. Tang, take a seat.

652
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,160
Sure.

653
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,480
I wanted to take you to eat out.

654
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,760
But he insisted to cook for you

655
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,600
at home.

656
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,920
The food outside

657
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,760
isn't as clean and hygienic

658
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,040
as home-cooked meals.

659
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,000
Mr. Tang.

660
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,680
Have you gotten used to your life now?

661
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,320
It's all right.

662
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,040
Something happened at home

663
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,880
a while ago.

664
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,000
So I was staying at your place

665
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
for some time.

666
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Xiao Xu told me about it.

667
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,440
Did you enjoy your stay?

668
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,760
That's great.

669
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,840
Here, Xiao Ning.

670
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,400
Eat up.

671
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,200
That's right.

672
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,880
Here.

673
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,880
Eat up.

674
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,320
Here.

675
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,040
Here.

676
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,840
Try the prawns that I made.

677
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,840
What do you think?

678
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,360
How do you like the food?

679
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,640
Mr. Tang.

680
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,280
When I went to visit you,

681
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,720
you refused to see me.

682
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,520
Now that we have met,

683
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,440
I still have some questions for you.

684
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,240
Go ahead.

685
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,760
What happened back then,

686
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,840
was that the whole truth?

687
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm not sure what you're asking about.

688
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,000
Did my dad really embezzle money?

689
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,080
He has passed away.

690
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,640
I can only ask you now.

691
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,640
Did he really embezzle money?

692
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,480
I know

693
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,320
what kind of man my dad was.

694
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm sure you do as well, right?

695
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,840
So I just want to know

696
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,360
what really happened back then.

697
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,280
Mr. Tang.

698
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,360
I don't mean to rub your nose in the dirt.

699
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,400
But this

700
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,760
is really important to me.

701
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,680
Xiao Ning.

702
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,320
I get how you feel.

703
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,160
But this

704
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
was a long time ago.

705
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,800
There are many things

706
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,320
that I don't remember anymore.

707
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,800
If my dad committed the crime,

708
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,480
you can just tell me.

709
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
I can accept it.

710
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,240
But

711
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,040
if there is any misunderstanding

712
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,720
or something

713
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,920
that has not been investigated,

714
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,440
you should tell me.

715
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,520
You are the only witness

716
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,800
I can find.

717
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
I've waited for this answer for ten years.

718
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,280
I don't know.

719
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,840
I really don't know!

720
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,000
Mr. Tang.

721
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,640
If you could recall

722
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,400
any details

723
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,400
at all,

724
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,280
come to me.

725
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,240
All right?

726
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Xiao Ning, I'm sorry.

727
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm having a bad headache.

728
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,720
I...

729
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,680
Let's talk some other time.

730
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,400
Sorry.

731
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm going to take a nap.

732
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,760
Xiao Ning.

733
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,160
Brother Xu, I'm sorry.

734
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,680
I wanted to have a good chat.

735
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,920
But I couldn't control myself.

736
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,240
I didn't mean

737
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,440
to upset Mr. Tang.

738
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,440
I know.

739
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,240
I...

740
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,600
I should get going.

741
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,720
I'll send you then.

742
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,240
It's fine.

743
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,600
I want to be alone.

744
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,160
Xiao Ning.

745
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,840
Gu Chuan's lawyer friend

746
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,200
has been investigating Chen Ao.

747
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,760
Jiang Guang Da's daughter, Jiang Xiao Ning

748
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,640
went to see Tang Zheng Cheng again today.

749
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
It seems a little dangerous.

750
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,240
Jiang Xiao Ning and Gu Chuan

751
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,160
were both survivors

752
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,920
in the valley.

753
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,600
Right now, Jiang Xiao Ning

754
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,480
is working

755
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,280
at Gu Chuan's company.

756
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,640
Do you think

757
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,200
there's such a coincidence in this world?

758
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,840
With both of them together,

759
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm sure they have some information

760
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,720
to investigate what happened back then.

761
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,680
I even wonder

762
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,360
if Gu Chuan deliberately

763
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,640
became good friends

764
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,400
with Cheng Ran.

765
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,160
He made friends with Cheng Ran

766
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,040
to get closer to you.

767
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,120
This guy is becoming a threat.

768
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,240
If we let them keep digging for the truth,

769
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,240
they must cause great trouble for us.

770
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,680
No.

771
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,240
We can't let this happen.

772
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
We need to tie up loose ends.

773
00:41:55,184 --> 00:42:16,184
