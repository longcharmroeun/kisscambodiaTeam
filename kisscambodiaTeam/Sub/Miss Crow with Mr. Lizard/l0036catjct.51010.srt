00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,440
This is what

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
I've always pictured it in my head.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,880
Aunty and Grandma

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,400
are taking a walk in the yard.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
And the yard has been filled with

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,400
different flowers and plants.

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,720
You're here.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
What are you looking at?

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm looking at

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,920
a helpless face.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,600
That's why I asked you to come help.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,160
Ever since

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,040
you said "let's break up" last time,

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,880
Yan Yan has been really hard on me.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,560
I can't even

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
protect myself.

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,280
I haven't even said what it is yet

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,480
and you've already thought of

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,360
a bunch of reasons to put me off.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Tell me, what is it?

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
Here.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,120
These are all the relevant information

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,840
on all the projects of our studio.

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
I've sorted them out for you

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,760
in chronological order

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,880
and in order of importance.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
You just have to make sure
the project coordinators

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,920
finish their projects according to the plans.

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,600
What do you mean by this?

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
You're done with work?

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,960
I want to go away for a while.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Where to?

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
The performance of my mechanical heart

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,520
keeps getting

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,000
more and more unstable.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm really scared

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
that one day,

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,240
I might pass out in the car,

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,200
on the streets,

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,640
- or in the studio...
- Stop it.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't say unlucky things like that.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,480
I don't want to hear it.

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,040
But I have to face it.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,840
Don't worry.

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm not

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,960
as extreme as I used to be.

67
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,720
I won't end my life on my own.

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
I just

69
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
want to use the time I have

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
to help others.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Such as,

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,760
helping those I love.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Chuan,

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,280
can we

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
not talk in this way?

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
It scares me.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
You made it sound like a farewell message.

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,960
What would you do

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,480
if you were me?

80
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
I don't know.

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,440
You should at least

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
tell me where you're going.

83
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Xiao Ning has always wanted

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
to rebuild her family house.

85
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
So I want to

86
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,839
help them fulfill this wish.

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
If Xiao Ning asks me,

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,520
what should I tell her?

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,240
That I don't know.

90
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,480
I just know that

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,400
out of everyone around me,

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
you're the best at lying.

93
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
Entrusting this task to you

94
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,040
is definitely the right choice.

95
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,680
I believe in you.

96
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,060
(Architectural design size)

97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,360
Chuan.

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,760
Chuan, when are you leaving?

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,160
Not up yet.

100
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,640
(Take care of the studio.)

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,320
Mr. Xu.

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Xiao Ning.

103
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,560
Where is Mr. Gu?

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,480
I didn't see his car

105
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,360
in the parking lot.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
He's not picking up my calls either.

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,360
He left.

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Where to?

109
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
You know that Gu Chuan and I

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,760
went to the same university, right?

111
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Yes.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,680
Our university

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
is holding an alumni works exhibition.

114
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
Gu Chuan is an outstanding alumni representative.

115
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
He's going to host the exhibition.

116
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,400
When will he be back?

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,480
He told me

118
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
to temporarily take care of company affairs.

119
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm guessing it'll be a while.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,920
One to two months.

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Maybe even half a year.

122
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm not sure.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,080
It's okay.

124
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
He'll be back eventually.

125
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
Or, do you not want to be

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
my assistant?

127
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,320
No, it's all work.

128
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
It's the same for me.

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,600
Have you had breakfast?

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Gu Chuan left me some breakfast

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,400
before he left.

132
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,320
Let's have some together.

133
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm fine.

134
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,360
Mr. Xu,

135
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,520
I'll be going to the studio now.

136
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,400
Then I'm not having any either.

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Wait for me.

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,960
Let's go together.

139
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
(We've broken up already.)

140
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,080
(I no longer have any hope.)

141
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,960
(Why leave without saying goodbye?)

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,840
(Is he trying to avoid me on purpose?)

143
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
(Does he)

144
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200

145
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320

Morning.

169
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
What would you like to drink?

170
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,520
Please get me a glass of water.

171
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Thanks.

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,400
What's up with you?

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
You're disappointed that it's me, right?

174
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
No, I'll go get you water.

175
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,440
Chuan,

176
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,720
you're really worrying me.

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,320
(I'm fine.)

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,680
Have you thought it through?

179
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
If we continue like this,

180
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,840
I'll tell Jiang Xiao Ning

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,280
everything for sure.

182
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,520
No matter what,

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm never going to give up on you.

184
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,000
Who are you never going to give up?

185
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,160
Wi… Wifey.

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm not someone

187
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
who looks through a man's phone.

188
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,080
But I can't let you

189
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,600
play me like a fool.

190
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,160
Wifey, what are you talking about?

191
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
You're not a fool at all.

192
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,800
Don't try to change the topic.

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,680
Who was it? Tell me.

194
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,080
It's really no one.

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,120
It's Gu Chuan.

196
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,480
Who are you trying to fool?

197
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
What can you two talk about?

198
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,160
It really is Gu Chuan.

199
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,240
Check my phone if you don't believe me.

200
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
See if it's his number.

201
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,920
What were you two talking about?

202
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,840
We were

203
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,080
just randomly chatting.

204
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,800
Randomly chatting about what?

205
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,400
I can't tell you.

206
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,800
You just

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
want to do it the hard way, huh?

208
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,120
Xu Cheng Ran.

209
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,360
Wifey.

210
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,120
I really can't tell you.

211
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,280
I can't tell you even if you beat me to death.

212
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,960
I mean

213
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,840
what kind of shameful deal

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
did you two make?

215
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,040
If I tell you,

216
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
that would make me a terrible bro.

217
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,280
If you don't,

218
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,920
you'd be a terrible husband.

219
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,760
Xu Cheng Ran.

220
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,400
What did you promise me before?

221
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,000
Didn't you say

222
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
that you'd never lie to me again?

223
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
Wifey. Could you not put me

224
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,840
in a tough spot?

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Are you going to tell me?

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,080
I...

227
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
I can't.

228
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
Fine.

229
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,400
No need to tell me.

230
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,840
My wifey is so great.

231
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,280
I'd never do anything

232
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,840
to hurt you.

233
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,520
Pack your stuff and get out of here.

234
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,600
(I was worried that she wouldn't be able to face me.)

235
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,520
(But actually, it's me who can't face her.)

236
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,160
Hello?

237
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,640
(I'm getting married next month.)

238
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Congratulations!

239
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,760
Why did you

240
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
break up with Jiang Xiao Ning?

241
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,760
No reason.

242
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Just thought we weren't a good fit.

243
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
(Really?)

244
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
(Think it through.)

245
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,000
If you turn your back on her now, it'll be for life.

246
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,640
You're always like this.

247
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,440
You decide

248
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,160
everything on your own.

249
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
Why can't you face

250
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,960
what's going on together?

251
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,800
It's solely my business.

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
Don't stick your nose in it.

253
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,280
I know

254
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
I'm being nosy.

255
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,680
I just want

256
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,560
you and Jiang Xiao Ning to be happy.

257
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,760
If you let her pass you by like this,

258
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,280
I'll be sad for you.

259
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,400
The person who feels the saddest is me.

260
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Jiang Xiao Ning.

261
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,560
When you weren't here,

262
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,640
we processed the data

263
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,360
for this.

264
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,280
But it hasn't been checked.

265
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,280
Here, check it.

266
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,880
Although I wasn't here these couple of days,

267
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
I didn't stop working.

268
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,600
I finished checking it

269
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,480
and made notes of mistakes

270
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,800
on the side.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,880
Please check it.

272
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,280
(Main materials of the project equipment)

273
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,400
Nice. Very thorough.

274
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,480
You've made great progress.

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,360
Thanks, Brother Dong.

276
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,720
It's what I should do.

277
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Xiao Ning,

278
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,920
come with me.

279
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,480
What is it?

280
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,520
Did you guys

281
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,440
quarrel or break up?

282
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,320
Was that

283
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,600
too blunt?

284
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,640
But everyone in the company

285
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,240
knows about you and Mr. Gu.

286
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,880
Something between you two

287
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,880
seems off these days.

288
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,600
There's nothing between Mr. Gu and me.

289
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,880
I'm just

290
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,440
a normal employee like you.

291
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
My position isn't even as high as yours.

292
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,160
Something must be going on between you two.

293
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,080
Look at you.

294
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,640
It's as if your soul has left your body.

295
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,920
Everyone is talking about

296
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,240
how an iron girl like you taking time off

297
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
is either because of a major accident or...

298
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Just think it's because of a major accident then.

299
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,080
Go back to work.

300
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
It's really nothing?

301
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
Work hard.

302
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,480
Okay.

303
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,680
I'm starting to realize that

304
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,880
those in hiding have it easy,

305
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,480
while those who are left behind are about
to have a mental breakdown.

306
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,960
I couldn't take it and almost

307
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
told Yan Yan the truth several times.

308
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,120
What are you doing here?

309
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,720
To see you.

310
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
You've made quite a bit of progress already.

311
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
If you tell Zhao Yan,

312
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,280
you're seriously dead to me.

313
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,040
I didn't.

314
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,880
A big-shot designer like you

315
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,360
doesn't need to

316
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,040
worry about these tiny details.

317
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,920
I'll ask designers from

318
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,840
our company to come help you.

319
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
I can't let anyone

320
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
related to our company get involved.

321
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm afraid Jiang Xiao Ning will find out.

322
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,640
Alright then.

323
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,080
Take it easy and pace yourself.

324
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,560
Don't rush too much.

325
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Don't worry.

326
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,760
I know what I'm doing.

327
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm just scared...

328
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,040
Chuan,

329
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,280
are you okay?

330
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,760
Let me help you go back to rest.

331
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,600
Be careful.

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
It's too hot.

333
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
Do I need to charge you now?

334
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,120
No.

335
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
These days, it

336
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,320
occasionally malfunctions.

337
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,840
Hurts a lot.

338
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,640
Go back with me.

339
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
What good does going back do?

340
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,880
No difference between being here and going back.

341
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,200
Resting at home

342
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,000
will at least be a little better.

343
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,960
Have you gotten Xiao Ning to sign the will?

344
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,800
Not yet.

345
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
Are you sure about this?

346
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,920
Don't let her find out

347
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,560
what those are.

348
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,560
Otherwise, she'd definitely come looking for me.

349
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,400
Everything I've done so far

350
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,640
would be for nothing.

351
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,200
Alright. Go back.

352
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
The earlier everything gets settled,

353
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,680
the more at ease I'll be.

354
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,080
Go.

355
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,920
I'll leave then.

356
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,200
Take care of yourself.

357
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,200
Call me if anything happens.

358
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,120
Okay.

359
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,000
Xiao Ning.

360
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm downstairs.

361
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,200
Can you come down?

362
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
Brother Xu.

363
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,600
Long time no see.

364
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,680
How are things between you and Gu Chuan?

365
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,000
Why are you bringing him up all of a sudden?

366
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,480
Is Gu Chuan really that great?

367
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,600
To you...

368
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
I seem pretty useless.

369
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,400
Brother Xu, don't say that.

370
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,440
When we were kids, you always

371
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,840
fought back for me when I got bullied.

372
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,000
When I wanted candy,

373
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
you bought me candy.

374
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,440
For my birthday every year,

375
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,320
you'd give me

376
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
really pretty presents.

377
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,080
I remember everything.

378
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,200
I've always thought of you as my own big brother.

379
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,400
You're a part of our family too.

380
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,320
So you won't develop feelings for me

381
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,000
and fall in love with me, right?

382
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,680
You're so exceptional.

383
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,160
Given everything about you,

384
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,400
you'll definitely find me

385
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,680
a super perfect sister-in-law.

386
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,720
I'll be waiting,

387
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,440
waiting for the day you have that
silly smile on your face.

388
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,640
Xiao Ning.

389
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,240
To be honest,

390
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
it's really nice to still

391
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,760
be able to chat with you like this.

392
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,720
I thought you were

393
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
never going to talk to me again.

394
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,960
No way.

395
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,520
You're my big brother.

396
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,840
Have you eaten?

397
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,200
Aunty says we're having dumplings.

398
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,200
Come have some with us.

399
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
I'd love to,

400
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
but I'm scared that Aunty will kill me.

401
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,680
I'll protect you.

402
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,640
Really?

403
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,760
Let's go.

404
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Let's go.

405
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,600
Do you like it?

406
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,760
Here.

407
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,560
You have some too.

408
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,920
Mom.

409
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
Why is this actor showing up again?

410
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,240
Doesn't he know that

411
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,400
he's not welcomed?

412
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Not welcomed, not welcomed.

413
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,160
Both Grandma and I don't like him.

414
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,080
It's okay. Just eat.

415
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,640
I don't like him.

416
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
Aunty, you don't have to say that much.

417
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,440
Aunty,

418
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,200
come and have some.

419
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,600
There were only 15 dumplings.

420
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,520
And I made all those for you.

421
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,360
There's nothing left for me.

422
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm full. You should have some.

423
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,360
Brother Xu, Aunty is joking.

424
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,280
Aunty, I'm hungry.

425
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,280
Sit. It's okay.

426
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,680
Eat.

427
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,720
I made these this afternoon.

428
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
Thank you, Aunty.

429
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,240
Thank you, Aunty.

430
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,560
I miss the red cooking you make the most.

431
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,320
Look at you talking nonsense.

432
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:17,840
I thought you

433
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,080
didn't like quail eggs when you were little.

434
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,360
How come you like them now?

435
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
I was too young.

436
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,320
I grew up now.

437
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,080
You become a sweet talker now.

438
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,880
Really?

439
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,680
I thought he was already a sweet talker
when he was little.

440
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Who is this?

441
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,240
How come he looks so familiar.

442
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,800
Grandma,

443
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,320
Do you remember Brother Tang Xu?

444
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,920
I do. I do.

445
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,360
He always gets first place in exams.

446
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,560
So you remember that.

447
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
You should come to my place to eat.

448
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Ning Ning,

449
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,560
learn from him.

450
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
But don't stay for too long.

451
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,360
If you can't finish your homework,

452
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
you'll be scolded.

453
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,360
Got it.

454
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,680
Come, Grandma.

455
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
Let's watch TV together.

456
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,240
Come on, let's go.

457
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,680
Brother Xu, take your time.

458
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,600
I will.

459
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
Nice.

460
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,520
This kid is so good at studying.

461
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,200
The TV show is pretty interesting.

462
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Aunty,

463
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,280
I actually visited here a lot.

464
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:17,960
I've always wanted to come up,

465
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,080
but I was afraid.

466
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,080
I was afraid that you'll be unhappy to see me.

467
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,560
After all, my father...

468
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,040
Alright. Stop.

469
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,920
I'm warning you once again.

470
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,320
Don't bring

471
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,840
the old things up again.

472
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,280
I understand.

473
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,040
It's between the elders.

474
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,720
You have nothing to do with it.

475
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,560
Grandma and I

476
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
are just mad at your father.

477
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,400
We're mad that he embezzled the funds

478
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,760
and got my brother involved.

479
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,000
But he is gone for more than ten years.

480
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
Why bring it up?

481
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,040
I know

482
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,480
what you're thinking.

483
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,360
I have everything

484
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,200
that you've given me

485
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,280
written down in a notebook.

486
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,640
Aunty,

487
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,960
you don't have to give anything back.

488
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,760
I'm not asking for anything.

489
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,760
So you want me to give them back?

490
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,560
I'll have to be able to afford it.

491
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,760
But I can't afford it.

492
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
But,

493
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,440
to be honest,

494
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,960
we're reasonable people.

495
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,320
We know

496
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,400
who treats us well

497
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,560
and who doesn't.

498
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,960
I don't hold

499
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,960
a grudge against you.

500
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,080
And

501
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
I shouldn't.

502
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,800
As long as

503
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,800
you're still treating Xiao Ning well

504
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
like you did before.

505
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,640
Treat her as your own sister.

506
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,640
I'll treat you like I did before.

507
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,320
Come up if you ever visit.

508
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,120
Don't stand downstairs by yourself

509
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,000
and make things look weird.

510
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
Neighbors are gossiping.

511
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,720
Understood. Thank you, Aunty.

512
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,240
Not enough to eat, right?

513
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,600
Let me make some more.

514
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,640
Eat.

515
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,200
Lao Jiang,

516
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm finally here to see you.

517
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,360
Even though

518
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,200
I've been out for days,

519
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I was afraid to visit you.

520
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,960
(Grave of Late Father Jiang Guang Da and Late Mother Shen Si Lan)

521
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
(Grave of Late Father Jiang Guang Da and Late Mother Shen Si Lan)
I'm ashamed to visit you.

522
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,200
But I can't run away from it any longer.

523
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,640
Even if I avoid visiting you now,

524
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,480
we might see each other

525
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,520
on the other side

526
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
after I die.

527
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,160
So I'm here shamelessly

528
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
to visit you, my brother and my sister-in-law.

529
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Lao Jiang,

530
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,960
this toast is to you two.

531
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,720
We haven't been

532
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,960
drinking together in decades.

533
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm going to drink too.

534
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,480
Uncle Tang.

535
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,240
Xiao Ning,

536
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,880
why are you here?

537
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,160
I meant,

538
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,280
do you not have to work today?

539
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,600
It's the weekend.

540
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,680
What was I thinking?

541
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
Come.

542
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,480
Uncle Tang.

543
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
Thank you for visiting my parents.

544
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,560
None of my dad's past co-workers

545
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
came to visit,

546
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,760
ever.

547
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,440
You're the first one.

548
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Don't thank me.

549
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,240
I should have come

550
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,360
a lot earlier.

551
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,600
What kind of person

552
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,840
do you think my dad was?

553
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,440
Your dad is

554
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,000
the kindest

555
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,280
and the most honest person I've ever met.

556
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,000
Do you think he would be

557
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,600
someone who would embezzle public funds?

558
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,760
You can tell me when you've thought about it.

559
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,520
What's up, Xiao Ning?

560
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,520
Mr. Xu.

561
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,920
I didn't know you were still here.

562
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,880
I thought someone forgot to turn off the lights.

563
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,120
You're just in time.

564
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,040
I have something to talk to you about.

565
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,240
Sit.

566
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,120
I heard from Gu Chuan that

567
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,000
you've been working

568
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,240
as an intern.

569
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,760
But your internship has already ended
a long time ago.

570
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,320
Although your payroll has changed,

571
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,120
the company

572
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
has not officially processed it.

573
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,320
Is that right?

574
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Even though Gu Chuan is good at designing,

575
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,600
he's terrible at managing a company.

576
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,800
He has too much on his plate.

577
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,360
Plus, I already got my pay raise.

578
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,200
I didn't care

579
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
about the official process.

580
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,520
That's not okay.

581
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,320
We have to be professional when it
comes to managing a company.

582
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,760
Sign these documents.

583
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,980
(Jiang Xiao Ning)

584
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,920
Xiao Ning,

585
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
Gu Chuan

586
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,360
didn't attend the open class.

587
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,960
Where did he go?

588
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,800
Did something happen?

589
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,840
Is he okay?

590
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,120
He's fine. He's good.

591
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,640
He went on vacation.

592
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,560
I don't understand

593
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,800
this person.

594
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,080
He said he wanted to find a place

595
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,320
where he can't see you

596
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,520
to find some peace.

597
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,720
He can go anywhere

598
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,160
he wants to go, as long as he's happy.

599
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
I don't want him to

600
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,000
get annoyed by seeing me.

601
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,000
Last time we talked over the phone

602
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,240
and he told me something even worse.

603
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,280
What did he say?

604
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,280
He said that

605
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,280
he won't come back

606
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,280
if he finds a girl there.

607
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,080
He really said that?

608
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,760
I think so.

609
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,040
I was a little drunk,

610
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,360
so I can't remember clearly.

611
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,880
This is the last document.

612
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,920
Sign it.

613
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,660
(Successor: Jiang Xiao Ning)

614
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,600
Good. Everything has been signed.

615
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,400
Thank you.

616
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Mr. Xu.

617
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,880
If you have any news of Gu Chuan...

618
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,520
I will let you know immediately.

619
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,320
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

620
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
I'll leave then.

621
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,480
Please forgive me, Chuan.

622
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
She won't sign

623
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,040
if I don't lie to her like this.

624
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,680
(Am I this annoying to him?)

625
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,800
(Then why should I still stay here?)

626
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,320
(I should resign.)

627
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,480
Check this out.

628
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,440
You'll see a garden

629
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,560
after you enter.

630
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,320
The living room is inside.

631
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,520
We built a balcony

632
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,760
on the second floor.

633
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,560
It follows

634
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,600
the design you gave us.

635
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,280
You can rest assured.

636
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Let me answer this call first.

637
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,360
Cool.

638
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,639
Hello?

639
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,440
Chuan.

640
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,480
I finally made her sign

641
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,800
with the help of a little lie.

642
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,639
When should I bring them to you?

643
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
Can you keep them?

644
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,280
I'm afraid that if something happens,

645
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,560
I won't have time to handle everything.

646
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:28,960
Don't say things like this,

647
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,639
alright?

648
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,639
I'll keep them for you temporarily.

649
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,560
I'll bring them to you

650
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,719
when I go see you.

651
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,440
Thank you.

652
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,880
You don't need to thank me.

653
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,800
Thank you for taking care of me

654
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,400
and tolerating me all these years.

655
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,400
Nonsense.

656
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,440
I'm going to hang up.

657
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,639
I got things to do.

658
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,820
♪The rims of my eyes eventually turned red♪

659
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,980
♪I have so many things to say♪

660
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:21,060
♪There's no need to say them out loud,
let them be secrets♪

661
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,500
♪Let them become eternity♪

662
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,180
♪The box is full of our past memories♪

663
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,180
♪It's heavy enough to defy the passage of time♪

664
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,860
♪That energetic boy is riding in the car♪

665
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,260
♪With the pinky promises we made♪

666
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,120
♪The person I used to love so much♪

667
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,160
Wifey,

668
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
I miss you so much.

669
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,480
I have something to tell you.

670
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:12,100
♪I'll stay right here and wait for you to come back♪

671
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:25,680
♪I'll stay right here and wait for you to come back♪

672
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
Didn't you say that you
have something to tell me?

673
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,400
How many cans have you drunk?

674
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,600
Let me drink more.

675
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Otherwise, I don't know

676
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,560
how I should start.

677
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
I don't understand.

678
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,400
Is there anything

679
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,640
you can't tell me?

680
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,400
Wifey,

681
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,720
I want to tell you about

682
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,200
Gu Chuan and me.

683
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,920
Do you want to hear it?

684
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,440
Of course.

685
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
Gu Chuan and I

686
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,520
were in the same year in university,

687
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,760
but we were in different majors.

688
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,600
However, I had heard of him long before that.

689
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,720
People said that

690
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,640
there's a genius

691
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,560
in our university.

692
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Being just in his second year,

693
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,080
he had already won all the university-level

694
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,320
awards in his field.

695
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,880
I was curious.

696
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,400
I thought

697
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,480
who could be that smart?

698
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,960
Can he really outsmart me?

699
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,720
So I went to check him out.

700
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,720
I wanted to see

701
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,920
what kind of person he is.

702
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,680
He was

703
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
even weirder than he is now.

704
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,640
He was so cold

705
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,360
and refused to let other people into his life.

706
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
I was so interested in him.

707
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,080
I mean it.

708
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,080
I pestered him

709
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,440
like how I pestered you.

710
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,200
It took me half a semester

711
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,040
to become friends with him.

712
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,560
And then one day when I was chatting with him,

713
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,120
I said to him

714
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,160
"Chuan,

715
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,880
everything is good about you.

716
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,200
Except for that you always pull a long face,

717
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,440
showing no emotions and acting like a dead person.

718
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,920
You can't create any designs

719
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,920
with love being like that.

720
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,000
Then I found out that

721
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,320
the youngest triple

722
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,880
Grand Slam winner

723
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,000
in the field of design,

724
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,960
my best friend, Gu Chuan,

725
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,880
cannot

726
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,240
live like a normal person at all.

727
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,520
He died once.

728
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,520
He was in a car accident

729
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,280
and had to get a mechanical heart.

730
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,040
You're drunk.

731
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I'm not drunk.

732
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,240
What mechanical heart?

733
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,200
Just talk about Gu Chuan.

734
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,280
Don't make it like a sci-fi movie.

735
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,160
It's the truth.

736
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,120
The mechanical heart

737
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,840
is also a global limited edition.

738
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,560
That thing tortures him every day.

739
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,280
It makes a lot of noise when it's working.

740
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,320
It has to be charged every day.

741
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,320
An abnormally high heart rate would
cause electric discharge,

742
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,240
which will hurt the people around him.

743
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,520
That's why

744
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,800
he lives

745
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,800
with no emotion.

746
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,120
Does Xiao Ning know?

747
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,560
Jiang Xiao Ning knew about it.

748
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,920
I'm thankful to her.

749
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,320
Before her, Gu Chuan was afraid

750
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,520
of dating other people.

751
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,440
He was afraid that

752
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
he won't be able to make others happy.

753
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,440
He finally lived like a human for the first time

754
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,880
after he met Jiang Xiao Ning.

755
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,600
Why did he still

756
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,240
date Jiang Xiao Ning

757
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,720
if he can't be with anyone?

758
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,320
Wifey.

759
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,200
You know what?

760
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,880
Gu Chuan.

761
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,320
Gu Chuan will die soon.

762
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,640
What do you mean?

763
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,360
The doctor who did research on mechanical hearts

764
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,160
suddenly passed away not long ago.

765
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,920
Gu Chuan's heart

766
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,360
cannot hold on any longer.

767
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,080
And no one can

768
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,240
repair and maintain it.

769
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,600
Isn't that just frustrating?

770
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,440
They say that these things are high-tech,

771
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,880
but they can't even perform automatic upgrades.

772
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,320
So you're saying that

773
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,640
Gu Chuan can die anytime?

774
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,920
He's already preparing for
his funeral arrangements.

775
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,600
He even made a will.

776
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,440
Besides his parents,

777
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,360
he left a part of his inheritance

778
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,520
to Jiang Xiao Ning.

779
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,320
He really loves Jiang Xiao Ning.

780
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
His mechanical heart

781
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,480
has been having a lot of problems.

782
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,080
And he won't rest at home.

783
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,520
You know what he's doing?

784
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,880
He's been leaving early and
going home late recently

785
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,720
to fix

786
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,600
Jiang Xiao Ning's family house.

787
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,720
Yan Yan,

788
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,080
Gu Chuan is my best, best,

789
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,040
best friend.

790
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,840
But I can only

791
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,920
watch him die

792
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,560
and I can't do anything about it.
