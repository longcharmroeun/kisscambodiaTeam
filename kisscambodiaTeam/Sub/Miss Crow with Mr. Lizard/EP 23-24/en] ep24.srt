Mr. Gu, are you going out?

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,440
My parents are here.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,840
I'm having a meal with them.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,760
I always picked them up.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
I'll go with you.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Consider it a welcome reception

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,360
for your parents.

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,280
It's fine.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,240
Do you need anything?

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,120
Here. The new design is ready.

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,080
Leave it on the desk.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
I'll check it when I get back.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
Let's go.

Wang Kai.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,560
What?

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,720
Send me Mr. Gu's parents'

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,600
hotel information.

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,840
Am I supposed to know?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,400
Besides you, who else would know?

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,240
Hurry.

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
I bought them something. I need to send it over.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
I'll send it to you later.

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,320
Send it now.

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Meeting your parents so soon.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
I don't think it's appropriate.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
Not at all.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,120
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,360
Let's go

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,520
to the art gallery for inspection.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,880
After that,

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,920
I'll take you out

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
to have dinner with my parents.

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Sure. Whatever you say, Boss.

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,680
Who is it?

57
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,040
Uncle, long time no see.

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,040
It's you, Man Lin.

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,000
Come on in.

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,400
Uncle.

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
I've bought you some stuff.

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,920
What did you buy?

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
Why are you being such a stranger?

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
Consider it a token of apology.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
I was supposed to pick you up

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,480
at the airport.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,640
But I have been too busy recently.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
Young people

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,440
should focus on their work.

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,280
You're here, Man Lin.

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,840
Aunty.

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,760
Why are you standing here? Come and take a seat.

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,880
All right.

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Aunty.

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,560
I've bought you a gift.

76
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,440
It's right there.

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
I don't know if you'll like it.

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,440
You're being such a stranger.

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,720
Man Lin, how are you lately?

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,160
It's all good. Same old, same old.

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
Uncle and Aunty.

82
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,240
How long will you be staying this time?

83
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,920
Stay longer,

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
if you're not busy.

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,440
I was thinking to arrange

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,800
a stay at a nearby resort area

87
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
for you to relax a bit.

88
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
It's fine.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Uncle and I came back

90
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
just to visit Xiao Chuan.

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,400
Fang Yun.

92
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,560
What time

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
are we meeting Xiao Chuan?

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
Should we go now?

95
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,040
That reminded me.

96
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,880
Uncle, are you going out?

97
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,040
That's right.

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Xiao Chuan has

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,880
made a reservation for us at a restaurant

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
to welcome us back.

101
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
Man Lin, do you have any plans later?

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
No.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
That's perfect.

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,120
Come with us.

105
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,760
We can talk while we eat, right?

106
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,400
Sure, anything you say, Aunty.

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Let's go.

108
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,520
Let's go.

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Aunty, come on.

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
Aunty, have you been

111
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
to Europe before?

112
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
Have been to a few places.

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,440
-Son, here you are.
-Here you are, Xiao Chuan.

114
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880
Xiao Chuan, Man Lin

115
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,600
brought a lot of gifts

116
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,280
to the hotel to visit us today.

117
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
Well, it just so happened

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
that we are having dinner with you.

119
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
So I asked her if she has any plans

120
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,480
and she said she is free.

121
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
So we asked her

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
to come along.

123
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,040
Here, take a seat.

124
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,360
Why are you still standing there?

125
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,720
Look at you.

126
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,840
Every time we come,

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
Man Lin will pick us up and drop us off.

128
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,200
You didn't even ask her to join us for dinner.

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
The more people having dinner
together, the merrier.

130
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,480
Don't just stand there. Take a seat.

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,080
We're waiting for you to have dinner together.

132
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,000
Aunty.

133
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,360
We were talking about Europe earlier.

134
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
There's a really nice place.

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
Where is it?

136
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
Norway.

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,560
My friends have been there before

138
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,400
and they said

139
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,160
the aurora is spectacular.

140
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,320
If there's a chance,

141
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,760
how about going there together?

142
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Sure.

143
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,440
That's awesome.

144
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,240
Back then, when Xiao Chuan graduated,

145
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
we were planning to go.

146
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,280
It's a deal then. Let's go together.

147
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Sure.

148
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,200
Waiter.

149
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,480
Aunty, do you need to refill some hot water?

150
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll do it.

151
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Are you alright?

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,680
Are your hands okay?

153
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Are you alright?

154
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
It's alright.

155
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,600
This isn't something

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
that you should be doing.

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,400
Get the waiter.

158
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,200
Man Lin, sit.

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,320
Boss, it's alright.

160
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,080
Be careful.

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
Waiter!

162
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
Aunty, are you full?

163
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,360
Yes, it's delicious.

164
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,480
That's great.

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,920
Come and find us when you have time.

166
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Sure.

167
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,880
Uncle and Aunty,

168
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,080
let me drive you home.

169
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,280
Okay.

170
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,160
Mr. Gu,

171
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll drive Uncle and Aunty home then.

172
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,280
Okay. Drive safe.

173
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
See you, Uncle and Aunty.

174
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,560
-All right. See you.
-See you.

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,440
Let's go.

176
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,360
Let's go.

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,960
Let's go.

178
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,760
I was the one who almost got scalded.

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,360
Why are you being so upset?

180
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,960
It's easy to get emotional.

181
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
Everything about you

182
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,240
affects my heart.

183
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,920
How can I not be mad?

184
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,960
I'm fine, aren't I?

185
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,480
The purpose of the dinner

186
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
was to tell my parents about us.

187
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
You should have given me a heads up.

188
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
At least, I can dress up.

189
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
It's not like they haven't seen you before.

190
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
My status is different now.

191
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
It should be more formal.

192
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,160
It's all good enough

193
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
when you're being yourself.

194
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,760
Well, there's still room

195
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
for improvement, right?

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
Su Man Lin was there just now.

197
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,040
It was hard for me to tell them

198
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,320
about us with an outsider around.

199
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,960
Next time,

200
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll find a chance

201
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,920
to have a meal with my parents

202
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,640
and tell them about us.

203
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,240
Actually, I never understand

204
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,840
why people tend to avoid

205
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,039
office romance.

206
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,760
Well, it would be awkward if things didn't work out.

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
It's fine if they stay together.

208
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,640
But if not,

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
you'll have to meet often

210
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,000
because of work.

211
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,160
It's like a scar on your body breaks open

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,040
over and over again every day

213
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
and it will never heal.

214
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,680
Why think about

215
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
breaking up?

216
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,480
I'll never leave you.

217
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,440
All right then.

218
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,200
Tomorrow, I'll go to the office

219
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,160
and announce

220
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,520
our relationship to all.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,720
No.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
That would be awkward.

223
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,320
I also feel awkward

224
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,720
hiding around every day.

225
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,760
From tomorrow onwards,

226
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm not going to hide anymore.

227
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
See you. Be safe.

228
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Bye.

229
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,920
(Xiao Ning.)

230
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,920
(Why don't you wait for me anymore?)

231
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,380
(Yang Chun Alley)

232
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,960
(Design Director Chuan)

233
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,600
Come in.

234
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
What's up?

235
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,520
My university lecturer called me.

236
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,360
He is now the Associate Dean,
responsible for student affairs.

237
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,560
He wants me

238
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
to lead the graduates

239
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,240
to redesign the library

240
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,200
and gymnasium.

241
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,600
That's good news.

242
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,480
Do you want to take some time off?

243
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,840
I haven't decided yet.

244
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,040
Besides, I'm just helping out.

245
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
I don't want it to affect my work.

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,480
Although I'm doing it for free,

247
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,760
in exchange,

248
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,960
I requested

249
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,120
a spot

250
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
to undertake advanced studies.

251
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Advanced studies?

252
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,520
You've always lauded Jiang Xiao Ning, right?

253
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,480
I think she has the potential.

254
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,120
But she must go through

255
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,320
systematic learning.

256
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,960
It's not sure

257
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,600
if she can earn her degree

258
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,600
in the exit examination.

259
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
If the result isn't satisfactory,

260
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
this will give her

261
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,240
the chance

262
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,560
to study for a few years

263
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,120
before returning to the company to work.

264
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,800
There's no need for that.

265
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
This is a rare opportunity.

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
You should know that

267
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
architecture majors rarely offer

268
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
a spot for advanced studies.

269
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,800
She will pass the exam.

270
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
I mean, just in case.

271
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
That won't happen.

272
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll tutor her myself.

273
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,720
What?

274
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,240
You don't have faith in me?

275
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,240
Never mind.

276
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,840
Give me another one of this, too.

277
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,600
Drinking to heal your broken heart?

278
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
Says who?

279
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
It's written all over your face.

280
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,120
Are we that close?

281
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
You don't even know me.

282
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
There's no need to.

283
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,720
Are you saying

284
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,080
that

285
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm easy to read?

286
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,120
It's because you're too stubborn.

287
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,920
You thought

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you hid it well.

289
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Anyone with a discerning eye

290
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,160
can see

291
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
your feelings for Gu Chuan.

292
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,480
But I think

293
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
he's not going to marry you.

294
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,600
What are you trying to say?

295
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,200
You can be

296
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,280
good working partners

297
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,200
and you can talk about everything.

298
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,640
But there are no sparks

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
between the two of you.

300
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,200
I've put so much effort into it.

301
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,120
And I'm worse

302
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
than Jiang Xiao Ning?

303
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,640
You should know

304
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,160
that love isn't an exchange.

305
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,520
You don't get

306
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
what you give.

307
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
You can talk the talk.

308
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,720
Aren't you a loser yourself?

309
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,160
I'm different from you.

310
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,000
There's no difference.

311
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
Jiang Xiao Ning and I

312
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,480
grew up together.

313
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,960
Although our relationship

314
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,120
did not evolve from friendship to love,

315
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,000
at least,

316
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
I didn't change anything for her.

317
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,600
And you?

318
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,880
You gave up your world

319
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,400
for Gu Chuan,

320
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,960
didn't you?

321
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,240
Well, at least, I tried.

322
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,280
Unlike you.

323
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
A coward.

324
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,680
It depends on what you measure it against.

325
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,080
Let me ask you.

326
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,720
Is Gu Chuan

327
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,040
your only measure of happiness?

328
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
It is to me.

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,520
Look.

330
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,920
This is the key difference

331
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,120
between us.

332
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,200
To me,

333
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll not use anyone

334
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,600
to measure myself.

335
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
So every step that I take now

336
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,440
is to accomplish

337
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,520
my own goal.

338
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm a winner.

339
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,760
And you?

340
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
To you, getting Gu Chuan

341
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,560
is your goal.

342
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,400
You're a loser.

343
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Tang Xu, what are you looking so smug about?

344
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,720
Chill.

345
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,120
I just find it unfair for you.

346
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,960
You've been with him for so long

347
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
and you've loved him for years.

348
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
But you don't even get the chance

349
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,720
to confess your feelings.

350
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
You are so poor.

351
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
(You gave up your world)

352
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
(for Gu Chuan,)

353
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,040
(didn't you?)

354
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,680
(To you, getting Gu Chuan)

355
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
(is your goal.)

356
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,840
(You've been with him for so long)

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,280
(and you've loved him for years.)

358
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,560
(But you don't even get the chance)

359
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,600
(to confess your feelings.)

360
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,160
(You are so poor.)

361
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,600
Gu Chuan.

362
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,120
Gu Chuan.

363
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,920
Gu Chuan, open up!

364
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,000
Gu Chuan!

365
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,040
Here.

366
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,320
Drink some water.

367
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,440
Right now,

368
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I look like a joke, right?

369
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,600
Indeed, it's not the one that I'm familiar with.

370
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,920
I want to stop pretending

371
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,760
to be perfect and proud.

372
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,240
So you're going to

373
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,839
make yourself like this?

374
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
Perhaps, I've reached the limit.

375
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,280
If I don't say it out,

376
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,840
it might suffocate me.

377
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
Some things

378
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,080
are better left unsaid.

379
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,320
I like you.

380
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,840
Su Man Lin.

381
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,280
You're drunk.

382
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
Go home and get some rest.

383
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,886
When you wake up tomorrow,

384
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,880
you won't

385
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
do drunk talk again.

386
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
Gu Chuan.

387
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,000
All these years, can't you tell?

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,840
Can't you feel it

389
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
at all?

390
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
We are just

391
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,800
partners,

392
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,120
colleagues,

393
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,520
and friends.

394
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
Since I joined the company,

395
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,800
I have moved my seat

396
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,680
to the opposite side of your office.

397
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,600
That way,

398
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,200
I get to see you every day.

399
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,200
I'll observe

400
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,520
if you sleep

401
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,080
or eat well,

402
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,000
and if you're in good mood.

403
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,160
I hope

404
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,240
that whenever you need something,

405
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,280
I'll be able to show up

406
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,680
in front of you immediately.

407
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,960
I changed

408
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,560
your assistant over and over again

409
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,320
not because I'm petty

410
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,960
or jealous.

411
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,160
It's because I was worried

412
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
that they couldn't take good care of you.

413
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,880
We go to work together,

414
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,520
eat together,

415
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,120
and pick up your parents together.

416
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,840
My concerns for you

417
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
are far beyond the scope of my work.

418
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,920
Can't you feel it?

419
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,240
To me,

420
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,920
we're just

421
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,640
good partners

422
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,560
and good friends.

423
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,160
I don't want to be your friend.

424
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,160
Why can't we

425
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,040
take a step forward?

426
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,520
I think

427
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,600
I am different from others.

428
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,480
If I did something

429
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,440
that gave you the wrong idea,

430
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
I'll apologize

431
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,160
to you.

432
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,880
Since

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
I have said it out,

434
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,560
just be quick

435
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
and give me an answer.

436
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,280
There's no answer.

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
None of this

438
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
should happen.

439
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,000
But it already happened.

440
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,280
Are we going to pretend

441
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,800
that nothing has happened?

442
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
Go home and sleep.

443
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,120
When we wake up tomorrow,

444
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,080
I'll pretend

445
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,920
that none of this has happened.

446
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,840
Just tell me!

447
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,480
Do you like me or not?

448
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,040
No, I don't.

449
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,640
Why?

450
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,200
As a partner and a friend,

451
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,720
you're irreplaceable.

452
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,640
But if you want

453
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,840
something more,

454
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,960
that's impossible.

455
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
It's so cruel of you.

456
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,480
At times like this,

457
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,960
it's either being cruel or promiscuous.

458
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,280
I'd rather

459
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
if you can be promiscuous with me.

460
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,040
Why do you want

461
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
to turn yourself into this?

462
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,320
Su Man Lin.

463
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,640
Where did

464
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,640
your pride go?

465
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,480
All I want is you.

466
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,240
How is Jiang Xiao Ning

467
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,520
better than me?

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,840
Both of you

469
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,000
are two different people.

470
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,120
There's no way

471
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
to compare the two of you.

472
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,560
Why did you choose her and not me?

473
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,240
Stop asking

474
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,240
such lame questions.

475
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,280
What kind of spell

476
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,960
did she put you under?

477
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
In just a few short months,

478
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,720
she made you fall head over heels in love with her.

479
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,840
And me?

480
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,200
I've waited for a good six years

481
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,360
and this is what I got.

482
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
You're drunk.

483
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,920
Go home and sleep.

484
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,080
But she's not good enough for you.

485
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,800
She is a girl

486
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,240
who didn't even graduate from university.

487
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,800
Such an unprepossessing girl

488
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,800
with no family background

489
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,080
is not good enough for you!

490
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,920
Su Man Lin!

491
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,960
If you keep this going,

492
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,720
things are going to get really ugly.

493
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,400
What's said is said.

494
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,880
I can't take it back.

495
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,520
How about this?

496
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,400
You can go home

497
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
and take a few days off.

498
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,120
Think it through

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,280
and pull yourself together.

500
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,160
You can go now.

501
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,520
How did I lose to her?

502
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,760
There's no winning or losing.

503
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,520
You just picked the wrong guy.

504
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,280
Xiao Ning.

505
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,120
Give this to Sister Man Lin.

506
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
She's not here.

507
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,360
I think she went out.

508
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
I didn't see her since morning.

509
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,000
I have a lot of documents

510
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,240
for her to sign.

511
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,160
Wang Kai.

512
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,960
Where's Sister Man Lin?

513
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,880
I don't know.

514
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm looking for her as well.

515
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Is she on leave?

516
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,920
That's not possible.

517
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,240
She's an iron woman.

518
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
Besides being hospitalized,

519
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,200
I haven't seen her take time off

520
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,200
since she started working here.

521
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
What should I do about this?

522
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,800
Well, show it to Mr. Gu then.

523
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,880
All right then.

524
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,400
Did something

525
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,240
happen to Su Man Lin?

526
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,360
This is very unusual.

527
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,960
Give her a call

528
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,560
and ask her.

529
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,680
Look how concerned you are.

530
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,240
Cheng Dong.

531
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
Call her.

532
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
She's your colleague. Show some concern.

533
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,920
I didn't bring my phone.

534
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Jia Jia.

535
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,520
Mr. Cheng wants you to take a look at this.

536
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,320
Give me a second.

537
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,880
Here.

538
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,000
This is for you.

539
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Is this a gift?

540
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,360
It's from my mom.

541
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,360
From Aunty Fang?

542
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,640
Well, she felt sorry

543
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,320
about the dinner.

544
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,280
So she...

545
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,120
Is it okay for me to take it?

546
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,720
Besides,

547
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,240
I was the one who wasn't careful.

548
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,320
What should I give her in return?

549
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,280
No need for that.

550
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,520
Just keep it.

551
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,000
By the way,

552
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,600
why didn't Sister Man Lin come to work?

553
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,720
She has been working hard lately.

554
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,840
So I gave her

555
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,720
a long break

556
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,080
to get some rest.

557
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,880
Well, I'll get back to work.

558
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,800
Hi, Xiao Ning.

559
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,000
When do you have time

560
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,600
so we can meet and have a talk?

561
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,520
Aunty.

562
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
Sorry, I'm late.

563
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,240
It took me so long

564
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,440
to find this place.

565
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,680
It's all right.

566
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,600
This is where

567
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,360
your Uncle and I had our first date.

568
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,320
Look.

569
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
A lot has changed over the years.

570
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Well, that makes sense.

571
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,840
We're old now.

572
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,760
Not at all.

573
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,640
You still look young.

574
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
Thank you.

575
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,960
Xiao Ning.

576
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,080
Actually,

577
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,880
when I first met you,

578
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,600
I've been very fond of you.

579
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,000
You have pure eyes

580
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,680
and a dazzling smile.

581
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,320
I can tell

582
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,920
that you're nice to Xiao Chuan.

583
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
So

584
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,080
if you two are together,

585
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,680
you have my blessing.

586
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
Thank you, Aunty.

587
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,760
Look at you.

588
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,800
You're not shy at all.

589
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,560
My boss said the same.

590
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,680
You're very outstanding.

591
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
But Xiao Chuan's case

592
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,480
is a different one.

593
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,080
I know.

594
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,840
Gu Chuan has told me all about it.

595
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,640
You knew?

596
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,880
From the looks of it,

597
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,920
Xiao Chuan thinks you're the one.

598
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,000
All right then.

599
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,560
I'll go ahead and say it.

600
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,640
Go ahead, Aunty.

601
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,320
Actually,

602
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,160
as you can see,

603
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,080
we're not close.

604
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,840
Since he had

605
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,280
the heart surgery,

606
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,240
he has started

607
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,520
to alienate himself from us.

608
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,800
Such estrangement

609
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,120
is fatal to family relationships.

610
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,400
Which is why

611
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,840
I really hope

612
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,440
that we can clear the air

613
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,040
if there is any misunderstanding.

614
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,960
That's because

615
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,280
we're getting older.

616
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
We won't be able

617
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,440
to travel back and forth as often.

618
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,920
Aunty.

619
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,360
Gu Chuan is just not good at expressing himself.

620
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,280
I believe

621
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,800
if you talk things out,

622
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,000
there's no misunderstanding

623
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,960
that cannot be resolved.

624
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
Today,

625
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,120
I have something important

626
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,680
to tell you.

627
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,680
Dad. Mom.

628
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,080
I was at fault

629
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,120
and I apologize to you.

630
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,600
I'm sorry.

631
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,200
Silly kid, we're family.

632
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,640
There's no need to apologize.

633
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,400
Back then, I kept alienating myself from you.

634
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I thought

635
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,040
if I had been more annoying,

636
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,160
and when I was gone,

637
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,440
you wouldn't get so upset.

638
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,280
Nonsense.

639
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,120
No parents

640
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,320
will actually

641
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,600
hate their own children.

642
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,800
Even if you used worse ways

643
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,160
to hurt us

644
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,200
over and over again,

645
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,040
I know deep down

646
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,240
you felt worse than any of us.

647
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,440
Xiao Chuan.

648
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,160
Since your heart surgery,

649
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,400
your personality

650
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,720
has changed tremendously

651
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,200
and you once refused

652
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,520
to be taken care of

653
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,720
by me and your mom.

654
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,800
So I couldn't help thinking

655
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,960
that it would get harder

656
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,880
for us

657
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
to communicate with each other.

658
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,200
In the end,

659
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,280
I've started to even accept

660
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,440
the estrangement

661
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
from you.

662
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
But Xiao Chuan,

663
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,120
remember this.

664
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Your mom and I

665
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,560
have never thought

666
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,080
about giving up on you.

667
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
It was too selfish of me.

668
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,920
Xiao Ning told me

669
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,160
that my action

670
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,360
was only to fulfill my goal

671
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,280
and I've neglected your feelings.

672
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
Now that I think of it,

673
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,840
how can I

674
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
deny the whole world

675
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
just because of a mechanical heart?

676
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,200
After all,

677
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,520
I have you.

678
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,920
You little brat.

679
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,000
Think about it.

680
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,240
If you got silly and left

681
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,280
back then,

682
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,160
where could you

683
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,440
find such a good girlfriend?

684
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,400
Not even in your next lifetime.

685
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
Meeting Xiao Ning

686
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,240
is my greatest blessing.

687
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Xiao Ning, thank you.

688
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,080
Aunty.

689
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,240
I didn't do anything.

690
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
All I did was

691
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,320
blurting out a few words.

692
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
I hope you won't mind that I talked too much.

693
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,200
Why did the atmosphere

694
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,240
become so tensed

695
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,800
all of a sudden?

696
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,840
Son.

697
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,240
Drink with me.

698
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,520
Sure.

699
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,240
I'll drink with you today.

700
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Boss.

701
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,960
You can't drink.

702
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,680
It's fine.

703
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
I drank the other time too, right?

704
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
An alcohol level of 3%.

705
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,080
I can take it.

706
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,800
Don't worry.

707
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,920
It has a low alcohol level.

708
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,200
Besides, it's a wooden table.

709
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,040
It's not conductive.

710
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
Even if it is,

711
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
the bill is on you, Dad.

712
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,720
Isn't it?

713
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,080
Yes, it's on me.

714
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,480
But the money is with your mom.

715
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,680
Knock it off.

716
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,200
Xiao Ning, drink up.

717
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,120
Here.

718
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,960
Here, son.

719
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,040
Here, Xiao Ning.

720
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,280
You're back.

721
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,080
It's been a long day.

722
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,840
Why are you working so late today?

723
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,440
I'm so exhausted.

724
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,320
Eat something first.

725
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,640
I have heated the food up three times.

726
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,520
What's wrong?

727
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,360
Not feeling well?

728
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,240
Perhaps, I caught a cold.

729
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,560
My head hurts.

730
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,960
Hold on. I'll make you some cold remedies.

731
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Here, drink it.

732
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,720
I used warm water. It's not too hot.

733
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,720
Warm and thoughtful.

734
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Eat up.

735
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,640
Try my cooking.

736
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,680
If it's not to your liking,

737
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,520
I'll order delivery for you.

738
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,600
Still feeling unwell?

739
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,760
I was just thinking

740
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm quite blessed

741
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,920
to have someone waiting to have dinner
with me after coming home from work.

742
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,480
This is nothing.

743
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,680
There's more than this.

744
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,880
You seem pretty experienced.

745
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,920
Of course.

746
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,840
Yan Yan, that's not what I meant!

747
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,960
I've never cooked for other girls.

748
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,120
The food is cold. Reheat it.

749
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,740
(Cohabitation Agreement)

750
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,920
Whether you're in the right or wrong,

751
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,800
the man should take the initiative
to cheer the girl up.

752
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Once serious consequences are caused,

753
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,640
the man will be held responsible.

754
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
Never walk away from a fight.

755
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,800
Even if you do, never step out of the community.

756
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,320
It's a must to bring your phone and never turn it off.

757
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,600
Do you have a problem with that?

758
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,840
Can I add another one?

759
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,880
What is it?

760
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,960
No kicking the other person out

761
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,080
or getting physical during a fight.

762
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,520
Anything else?

763
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,520
And...

764
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,159
Based on the principle of equality
and mutual assistance,

765
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,400
(Whether or not the objection is accepted,)
I strongly suggest that

766
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,960
(the woman reserves the final explanation right.)
this one should be removed.

767
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,840
Appeal dismissed.

768
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,159
You don't have to sign it if you don't want to.

769
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,800
I'll sign it.

770
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
You reserve the final explanation right.

771
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,719
So you agree to that one too?

772
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,840
Which one?

773
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,120
The fifth one.

774
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,239
Give up your status as a rich second generation

775
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,840
and be an ordinary person.

776
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Is being rich a bad thing?

777
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,159
I don't want others

778
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,960
to think

779
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
that I covet your family property.

780
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,080
I don't want to be branded a money-grubber.

781
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,280
That way,

782
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,920
your dad will have nothing to worry about.

783
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,760
My dad will probably kill me.

784
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
Xu Cheng Ran.

785
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,639
Do you dare to give up

786
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,639
on your luxury cars, mansions,

787
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,480
and the fancy lifestyle

788
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,400
that you used to have?

789
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,200
Just live a simple life with me

790
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
in this small apartment.

791
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,760
I dare to.

792
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,360
Aunty.

793
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,280
My boss said you have airsickness.

794
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,800
This is the medication

795
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,760
in case

796
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,160
you don't feel well.

797
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,200
Xiao Ning, come and visit me.

798
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,560
I'll cook for you.

799
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,880
Thank you, Aunty.

800
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,320
Dad.

801
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,960
Cut down on drinking.

802
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,120
Xiao Ning and I will find more chances

803
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,320
to visit you two.

804
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,560
I know.

805
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,520
Not going to hug?

806
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,840
Be well, son.

807
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,360
You can go back.

808
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,640
Safe journey.

809
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,200
Bye, Uncle and Aunty.

810
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,400
Okay, you can go back.

811
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm leaving.

812
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,040
Take care of yourself.

813
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,680
All right now. Just go back.

814
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,600
Thank you.

815
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,680
Boss,

816
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,760
you're welcome.

817
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,120
Yes, pack everything in.

818
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,120
Send them to Director Su's new office?

819
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,880
Yes.

820
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,800
Send it over there.

821
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,400
All right.

822
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,000
Why the sudden change

823
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,120
of seating position?

824
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,360
She had it changed before too, right?

825
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,120
You men are so slow-witted.

826
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,200
Su Man Lin

827
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,480
has never changed her seat in the last six years.

828
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
She has moved into her own cubicle now.

829
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,720
You're overthinking it.

830
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,960
She's a senior staff

831
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,720
and the vice president of the company.

832
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,720
Isn't it normal

833
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,640
to move into her own cubicle?

834
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,840
The point is

835
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,920
the one taking over her place

836
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,560
is Jiang Xiao Ning.

837
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,160
Xiao Ning is an assistant too.

838
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,960
Mr. Gu can see her

839
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,360
when he looks up.

840
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,720
It's more convenient to call her.

841
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,880
You're really hopeless.

842
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,160
How so?

843
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,880
Sister Man Lin, you're here.

844
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,840
Where's all my stuff?

845
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,960
It's moved into the cubicle.

846
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm not moving.

847
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,160
I'll take the same position.

848
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,920
I'm sorry.

849
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,040
It's Mr. Gu's arrangement.

850
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,520
Since I joined the company,

851
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,640
I have moved my seat

852
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,360
to the opposite side of your office.

853
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,360
That way,

854
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,863
I get to see you every day.

855
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,887
To me,

856
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,600
we're just

857
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,280
good partners.

858
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
Where's the room?

859
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
The one on the left

860
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,440
at the end of the corridor.

861
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,280
Brother Kai.

862
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,200
I'm not going to

863
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,200
take Sister Man Lin's seat.

864
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
I'll just stay at my own place.

865
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,600
Well, Mr. Gu only told me

866
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,280
to arrange a room for Su Man Lin.

867
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
Whether or not you're going to take the seat,

868
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,560
it's all up to you.

869
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,320
Director Xu.

870
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,120
Take a look.

871
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,720
This new project

872
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,080
is going to start soon.

873
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,392
The initial plan

874
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,200
is to build

875
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,920
a large comprehensive community.

876
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,520
You are responsible

877
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,560
for this tender.

878
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
Thank you for your trust.

879
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,960
I've learned a lot

880
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
from you

881
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,800
and gained a lot of experience.

882
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,080
Don't worry.

883
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,360
I'll get it done.

884
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,080
That's great.

885
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,880
Do you think

886
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,320
you should give the project plan

887
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,920
directly to your brother?

888
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,520
I heard

889
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,560
that Gu Chuan from his company

890
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,600
is a sought-after designer.

891
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,760
Director Xu.

892
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,480
I know where you're coming from.

893
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,400
But our group

894
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,720
has our own long-standing partners.

895
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,040
If we were to change them,

896
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,840
wouldn't that

897
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,920
make their hearts sink?

898
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,200
What's more, this is a big project.

899
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,840
I don't think it's a good idea

900
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,320
to give up on bidding.

901
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,600
As for Gu Chuan,

902
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
he's a very capable guy.

903
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,160
Even if he bids openly,

904
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,560
he'll win for sure.

905
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:11,631
That way,

906
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,160
it won't give people something to talk about.

907
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,640
You seem to know Gu Chuan really well.

908
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,560
He just won an award

909
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,800
and has a good reputation

910
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,800
in the industry.

911
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,680
I've been keeping tabs on him.

912
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,560
Very well.

913
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,400
Very well.

914
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,560
Director Xu...
