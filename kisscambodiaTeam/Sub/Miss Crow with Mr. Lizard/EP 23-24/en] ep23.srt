=Episode 23=

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,440
Did you write everything down?

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Yes.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
And if construction continues at this pace,

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,480
we should be able to finish ahead of schedule.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,840
From what I see,

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,920
it seems you've become pretty close

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,800
with the staff on site.

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,600
Because I come here often.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,400
I've only come here a few times.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,880
I always come here secretly.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,120
And sometimes, I'd come

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,120
and stay for a while

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,840
at the weekend.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
To do what?

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Nothing.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
Just watch things quietly.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Seeing something being built from nothing

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
is very fulfilling.

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,720
This emotional?

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,080
This is the first project

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
I've ever taken part in.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,800
There were a few twists and turns along the way,

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
which I also treasure.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,560
This is my first starting point.

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
During this project,

46
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,640
I learned a lot

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
and grew a lot.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,640
You were the one

49
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
who gave me these opportunities.

50
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,400
You earned them yourself.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,480
Even if

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
you were to work at other companies,

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,240
you would've achieved

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,320
the same results.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
You won't even scold me now.

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,440
It depends.

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
If you make work-related mistakes,

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll scold you of course.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,280
Got it.

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,960
Let's go.

61
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
Not working overtime today?

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
No overtime today.

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,840
Now that we're off work,

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,200
you're not my boss,

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
but my boyfriend, right?

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
What?

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
I just want to know

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,800
how it works.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
You're not going to discharge electricity
right away, are you?

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,160
Although the mechanical heart

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
doesn't operate through beating,

72
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,000
it has

73
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,680
a theoretical performance index.

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
If something causes

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
the heart rate to elevate,

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,040
it will work faster.

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
When heart rate goes up,

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,720
so does the theoretical index,

79
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
causing electric discharge.

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,080
This means that

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,040
whenever I come close to you,

82
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
your heart rate goes up,

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,040
which in turn, causes you to discharge electricity.

84
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,000
It depends.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,840
When you came close just now,

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
I didn't discharge any electricity, right?

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
If something more

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,760
"stimulating" were to happen,

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,920
then I may

90
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
discharge a bit of electricity.

91
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
Will discharge cause any damage to it?

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,120
Right now, yes.

93
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
But, everything will be okay

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,200
in three months.

95
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
Oh, so endure it for three more months.

96
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,400
Don't let me "stimulate" you

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,400
in these three months.

98
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,160
But,

99
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,960
holding hands is fine.

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
I've held these hands

101
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,800
ten years ago.

102
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,400
You were so withdrawn earlier,

103
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,640
like a cold-blooded animal.

104
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,360
That must have been so hard for you.

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
If I hadn't met you,

106
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I probably would have

107
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,320
ended my own life

108
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
after winning the Jin An Award.

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,280
No way!

110
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,280
Never say something

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
like that again.

112
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
That was my plan before I met you.

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,840
You shouldn't think that way
even if you didn't meet me.

114
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,800
People

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,160
run into accidents,

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
warmth,

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
and endless hope

118
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,480
when they don't have any plans.

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,320
Meeting you

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,920
gave me a new

121
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,040
goal in life.

122
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
What goal?

123
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
To be with you.

124
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Boss,

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,960
could you say more

126
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
things like that in the future?

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
Why do things like that sound

128
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,400
so good coming from you?

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
You like hearing it?

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Of course.

131
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
You don't think

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
it's too cheesy?

133
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,240
With a face like yours,

134
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,120
it works no matter how cheesy it is.

135
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,200
Then, what will be my reward?

136
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,120
Your reward will be

137
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,200
treating me to a feast.

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,160
Let's go.

139
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,060
♪Am I abnormal or are you shining♪

140
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,060
♪Woo~~♪

141
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,160
♪Falling in love is having you by my side♪

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,600
Here,

143
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
have this.

144
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,320
If you like it,

145
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
we can order more.

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,760
Boss,

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,360
you're suddenly so generous towards me,

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm not used to it.

149
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,000
Was I really stingy before?

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
You were the boss before.

151
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,760
I was too embarrassed

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
to order more.

153
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
As long as you're happy,

154
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,440
there's no need to care about
other people's opinions.

155
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,120
My dad said

156
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,800
the same thing before.

157
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,440
Really?

158
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,080
When I was little,

159
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,280
my dad loved

160
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
celebrating my mom's birthday.

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
Every year, I looked forward to

162
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
my mom's birthday too.

163
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,640
Because the three of us

164
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
would go eat at a fancy restaurant,

165
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,680
where there'd be someone playing the piano.

166
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
Right then, I thought

167
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
people who can play the piano

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,480
are pretty

169
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
and elegant.

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,280
I even wanted to learn how to play.

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,800
And then?

172
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,120
Why didn't you learn to play?

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
And then, I thought about it.

174
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
My hands are

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,080
only meant for moving bricks.
[*"Moving bricks" is a Chinese slang for working.]

176
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,480
Your hands are also meant for holding mine.

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,440
Boss,

178
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,280
you're really getting the hang of it.

179
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,440
Have some of this.

180
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,720
Although you haven't

181
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
dated in ten years,

182
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
you really know

183
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,040
what to say.

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,560
I searched things up

185
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
on the internet recently.

186
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Why didn't you ask

187
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,080
the King of flirts, Mr. Xu?

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
Is he trustworthy?

189
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,160
Him?

190
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,080
Fair enough.

191
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,920
Although this is

192
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,120
the first time I'm dating someone,

193
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
I think

194
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
you should let the person you like

195
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,560
feel that you like them.

196
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,080
Love should be expressed boldly.

197
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
After girls start a relationship,

198
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,240
shouldn't they be more reserved

199
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,360
or talk less?

200
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,559
Actually, I'm not talking that much now.

201
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,640
Fair.

202
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,440
Your starting point

203
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,000
is higher than others,

204
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,240
so when you talk less,

205
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,679
others can't really feel the difference.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
You're talking a lot more than before.

207
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,880
Really?

208
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm the same as I've always been.

209
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,000
When you get excited,

210
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,920
your body will discharge electricity.

211
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,280
But

212
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,240
when we hold hands or hug,

213
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,360
I can't feel anything.

214
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,680
Does this mean that sometimes

215
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,040
you don't like me that much?

216
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
Of course not.

217
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,600
It's because

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,920
you're insensitive.

219
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,200
I can feel that

220
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,040
you like me.

221
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,720
I find that you're really

222
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,280
getting bolder

223
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,640
and bolder now.

224
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,160
Humans should make bold attempts.

225
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,160
But

226
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
you have to keep your feelings

227
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,680
towards me under control.

228
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
Otherwise, discharging electricity too often

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
would be bad for your heart, right?

230
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Excessive discharge

231
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,400
would cause discomfort

232
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
to the body.

233
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,560
In addition,

234
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,840
I have to charge my heart.

235
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,920
If my heart runs out of power,

236
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,280
a twenty-percent

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
back-up power

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
will be activated automatically.

239
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,560
Sort of like

240
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
when cellphones run out of battery.

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,440
Sounds pretty cool.

242
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
The little guy inside you,

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,840
is it the only

244
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
mechanical heart in the world?

245
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,040
There are others who use it,

246
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,400
but not many,

247
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,040
since it hasn't been perfected yet.

248
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,720
Unless

249
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
there are really no other options,

250
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,560
it wouldn't be used.

251
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,160
Also,

252
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,240
there are side effects.

253
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,600
Think about it.

254
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,640
Who can control

255
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
their emotions perfectly?

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
I'll be good from now on.

257
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
We'll do everything as you say.

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,960
I'll never make you angry.

259
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
I find having this little guy

260
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,440
is quite handy.

261
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,400
Careful not to get too excited.

262
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,600
It'll discharge.

263
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,560
Eat.

264
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,160
Eat.

265
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,720
I've got it under control.

266
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,280
Eat.

267
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,360
I've really got it under control.

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,160
We got back so soon.

269
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
I have to cherish the time I have right now.

270
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
When I pick you up tomorrow,

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,720
you'll be my boss again.

272
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
I never expected that office romance

273
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,960
would feel like this.

274
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,040
What did you think

275
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,160
it was going to feel like?

276
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
I've never fantasized about

277
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,400
an office romance before.

278
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,240
Then what did you fantasize about?

279
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,000
With a university upperclassman

280
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,120
who is really smart

281
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,240
and gets good grades.

282
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Whatever I ask him,

283
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,520
he'll always have the answers.

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,200
Knows everything and does everything.

285
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
Gentlemanly

286
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,640
and wear a pair of glasses.

287
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you know

288
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,200
what those upperclassmen know,

289
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,080
I know;

290
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
and what they don't, I know too.

291
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,880
I know.

292
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
Why are you two here?

293
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,240
I didn't see you when I went to

294
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,080
take out the garbage just now.

295
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,040
Look at me.

296
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,600
Getting old and blind.

297
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,120
Aunty.

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,040
It's late,

299
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
so Boss dropped me off.

300
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,840
Mr. Gu,

301
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,040
you're so nice to Xiao Ning.

302
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,960
You haven't eaten yet, right?

303
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,520
Come upstairs with us.

304
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,800
Aunty will make dumplings for you.

305
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,360
Aunty,

306
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,160
I've eaten already.

307
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,400
Girls should be more careful

308
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
when walking alone at night.

309
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
In the future, if Mr. Gu isn't busy,

310
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,640
it would be good if you could drop
Xiao Ning off more often.

311
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,320
Aunty,

312
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I'll leave now then.

313
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280
Speaking of which,

314
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,280
as an aunt,

315
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
I've been a little careless.

316
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I should have exchanged

317
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,440
contact information with Mr. Gu earlier,

318
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,160
right?

319
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,600
Thinking about it,

320
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,280
her parents passed away years ago.

321
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,040
I'm her only legal guardian.

322
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,960
So,

323
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,680
as her guardian,

324
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,680
if something were to happen to her,

325
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
I should communicate

326
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
with her bosses.

327
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,920
Right.

328
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,920
Aunty...

329
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,640
Mr. Gu,

330
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,880
you don't mind, do you?

331
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,200
No, I don't.

332
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,240
Here, Aunty.

333
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,840
Thank you.

334
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,200
You got it?

335
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,400
Yes.

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,200
I got it.

337
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,480
Alright. If you have time,

338
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
make sure to come over for dinner.

339
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,000
It's a deal then.

340
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay.

341
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,520
Aunty, I'm leaving then.

342
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,240
Okay.

343
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,400
We won't see you off.

344
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,280
Bye now. Come on.

345
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Bye.

346
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,680
Hurry up.

347
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,320
Go on.

348
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,080
Let's go, Xiao Ning.

349
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
Up you go.

350
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,200
Bye-bye.

351
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
You're still watching?

352
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,400
Aren't your eyes tired?

353
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Aren't you ashamed?

354
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
You're bold enough to date

355
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,680
without telling me, huh?

356
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,640
No,

357
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,440
I just haven't gotten around to telling you yet.

358
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,040
You're really in a relationship?

359
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,680
Nice going, Xiao Ning.

360
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,680
Right?

361
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
That Gu...

362
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,440
Chuan.

363
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,800
Yes, Gu Chuan.

364
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,800
Gu Chuan is pretty exceptional,

365
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,680
really difficult to find.

366
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,920
So,

367
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,880
our Xiao Ning is pretty exceptional too.

368
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,440
Right?

369
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
Nice.

370
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
Speaking of which,

371
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
your age difference

372
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,720
is kind of...

373
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,560
You don't mind?

374
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,520
Of course, I don't mind.

375
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
Because I like him.

376
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Alright, alright.

377
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,480
You like him that much?

378
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,080
Yes,

379
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,160
I like him a lot.

380
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,080
Hello?

381
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,440
Is this Mr. Gu?

382
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,160
Hello,

383
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,560
this is Xiao Ning's aunt.

384
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,120
Aunty.

385
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Hi, Aunty.

386
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,560
What's wrong?

387
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,080
Are you busy?

388
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,520
Are you at work?

389
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,680
Am I bothering you?

390
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
No, I'm not busy right now. Please go on.

391
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,920
It's nothing really important.

392
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm near your company,

393
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,120
how about I treat you to lunch?

394
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,520
Xiao Gu,

395
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,360
we've already met

396
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
many times,

397
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,800
but Aunty feels like

398
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Aunty doesn't know you very well.

399
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,760
Aunty,

400
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,800
if you'd like to know anything,

401
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
just ask directly.

402
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,920
It's nothing, really.

403
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Just chatting.

404
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,960
Don't take it to heart.

405
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,760
Which university did you go to?

406
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,680
UCL.

407
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
U what L?

408
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,480
It's a university in the UK.

409
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,880
I heard that

410
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
you graduated with double Masters?

411
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

412
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
What do your parents do for a living?

413
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
Both my parents are university professors.

414
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,840
They used to work in research facilities.

415
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,800
But these years,

416
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,240
they've been living abroad,

417
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,160
so they're not around much.

418
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,520
Then you must own houses.

419
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,920
Where are they located?

420
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,960
One in the New District,

421
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
one in the CBD,

422
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,400
and

423
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,720
one in the resort area by the lake.

424
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,480
Aunty, Aunty.

425
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,280
I'm okay.

426
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,400
If this is the case,

427
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,080
then Aunty is

428
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,520
a little confused.

429
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,360
Look at you,

430
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,480
you check all the boxes

431
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
and you can be with any girl.

432
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,840
Why weren't you dating?

433
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,320
Aunty,

434
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,680
of course

435
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,600
I've dated before.

436
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
But I've been having some health issues

437
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,920
in recent years,

438
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,400
so I haven't been dating.

439
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
You have health issues?

440
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,640
What issues?

441
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,960
Are they treatable?

442
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,080
There's the possibility

443
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,920
that I’ll be cured.

444
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,640
In other words,

445
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,720
there's the possibility that you won't be cured?

446
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,560
Mr. Gu,

447
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,640
I just remembered that

448
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,880
I have to deal with something at home.

449
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,200
I have to go. I have to go now.

450
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,880
Sorry.

451
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,280
My bad.

452
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,960
Aunty.

453
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
Aunty, you haven't eaten anything.

454
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,520
Next time.

455
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:27,920
Zhao Yan.

456
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,680
Mr. Tang.

457
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,600
Getting off work?

458
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,000
How's Xiao Ning these days?

459
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,360
Pretty good. Things at her new job

460
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,360
are going well.

461
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,640
Okay.

462
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,640
Hey, godson.

463
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,480
What do you want from my girlfriend?

464
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
See you later.

465
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,520
Bye, Mr. Tang.

466
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,040
Take care.

467
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,880
What's with your attitude?

468
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,640
Why are you so hostile towards him?

469
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
You're afraid he'll take your dad's company?

470
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,320
I'm afraid he'll

471
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
take advantage of you

472
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
at work if he knows about us.

473
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,080
What do I have to do with you?

474
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,920
Again?

475
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,560
I have a heart condition.

476
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,440
Can't deal with you

477
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,400
doing this to me.

478
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,920
Go have your condition checked out.

479
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
You care about me so much?

480
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,760
Are you sick?

481
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,120
I am.

482
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm sick with an illness

483
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,720
called "can't live without you".

484
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,200
That's easy to cure.

485
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,560
It can't be cured. It's terminal.

486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,080
Hello?

487
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,040
Okay.

488
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,280
I'll be right there.

489
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,280
See you soon.

490
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,320
Who are you going to see?

491
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,920
A real estate agent. I'm looking for a place to live.

492
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,960
Looking for a place to live?

493
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,000
My lease is up.

494
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,440
Is finding a new place a problem?

495
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,240
I'll go with you.

496
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,240
What does this have to do with you?

497
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm looking for a place too.

498
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,640
There's no need to pick another day.

499
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Today is the day.

500
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,240
Hello. We're coming now.

501
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,840
My phone.

502
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Xu Cheng Ran.

503
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,760
Look at the decoration of this apartment.

504
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,360
So refined.

505
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,360
It has a spacious living room,

506
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,360
two bedrooms,

507
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,240
open kitchen,

508
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,520
and a huge French window.

509
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,480
It's a great choice for couples like you two.

510
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,680
We are not a couple.

511
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,920
It'll just be me.

512
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,520
We're not a couple yet, but soon.

513
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,000
If you live here by yourself,

514
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,200
this apartment is a little big for you.

515
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,200
Do you also want to

516
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,960
see the apartment next door?

517
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,560
Okay.

518
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
I think this one really suits you.

519
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Suits what?

520
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,160
I'll be living by myself.

521
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,680
Why do I need such a huge apartment?

522
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
You'll have friends to visit you.

523
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,200
Doesn't Jiang Xiao Ning

524
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,240
love to sleep over with you?

525
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Also,

526
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,960
if your relatives come to visit,

527
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,800
it'd a waste of money to

528
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
ask them to stay at a hotel.

529
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,920
Right.

530
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
How dare you say

531
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,120
staying at a hotel is a waste of money.

532
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,720
He lives in a hotel every day.

533
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,560
Bro,

534
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,480
you live in a hotel every day?

535
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,600
Reduce the rent in half.

536
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,120
I'll pay for the other half.

537
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,320
Okay, no problem.

538
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,320
Miss Zhao, if you're

539
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,040
satisfied with this apartment.

540
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,600
I'll call the landlord to negotiate

541
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,040
the rent.

542
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,120
I guarantee it'll be cheaper than

543
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
the one you had rented before.

544
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,320
Really?

545
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,600
Really.

546
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,520
But I need to

547
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,160
tell you something.

548
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,040
Someone died

549
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,160
in this apartment.

550
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
That's why it's so cheap.

551
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,800
Otherwise, you'd never be able to

552
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,760
rent such a high-quality apartment

553
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,680
with this price.

554
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm okay with it.

555
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,040
Not a problem.

556
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
There is another workaround.

557
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,480
If a male were to

558
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,840
live here,

559
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,960
everything would even be better.

560
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,600
Do you need any help?

561
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Why are you looking at me?

562
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,000
Well.

563
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
I can live here to suppress the misfortune.

564
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,240
Do you know what I dislike the most about you?

565
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,320
What?

566
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,920
You have a glib tongue.

567
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,760
You sound like you don't care

568
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,040
about anything when you talk.

569
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,840
Okay.

570
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,760
You can treat me as air.

571
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,880
I won't talk.

572
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,480
Do you have time tomorrow?

573
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm going to move tomorrow. Come if you want to.

574
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,160
I'll be there for sure. What time?

575
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
I thought you weren't talking to me?

576
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,600
How dare I.

577
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,680
Make a peace sign.

578
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,520
Be quick.

579
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,240
What happened?

580
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,360
There was a camera.

581
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,440
I want to poke your eyes out.

582
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,920
You're so annoying.

583
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,480
So cute.

584
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,880
Chuan, what do I need

585
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,520
to get a marriage certificate?

586
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,760
I think

587
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,240
I'll get married soon.

588
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
You know what?

589
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,920
Not only did she ask me out,

590
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,000
but she also asked me

591
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,960
to view the apartments with her today.

592
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Such a private matter.

593
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,120
Sorry.

594
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,680
I can't come to

595
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,520
visit you often anymore.

596
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,600
I'll have my own place soon.

597
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,920
Don't need to live in a hotel anymore.

598
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,360
She's starting to need my company

599
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,920
and starting to need my protection.

600
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,080
Companionship is the longest confession of love.

601
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,120
Protection is the most silent companionship.

602
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,960
Chuan, do you get it?

603
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
I'm talking to you.

604
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,840
Why are you ignoring me?

605
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,280
What are you sending?

606
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
"I miss you a little."

607
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,160
Miss what?

608
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,720
You've made huge progress.

609
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,720
I thought not being in a relationship for ten years

610
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
would make you rusty.

611
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Mind your own business.

612
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,160
Close the door

613
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
when you leave.

614
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
You can't match my progress

615
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,920
no matter how fast you go.

616
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
"I miss you a little."

617
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,120
I know what I should do.

618
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm home.

619
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,280
Jiang Xiao Ning.

620
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,320
Come here.

621
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
I have something to tell you.

622
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Aunty, what's the matter?

623
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,160
You must break up with Gu Chuan now.

624
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,240
Why?

625
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,080
Stand up.

626
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,200
You guys don't match.

627
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,200
What was your parents'

628
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
biggest wish?

629
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,240
They hoped you would be happy.

630
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,080
Now that they're gone,

631
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm responsible for taking care

632
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
of you.

633
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,600
Aunty.

634
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,400
Why do you always bring up my parents?

635
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,200
It's like I did

636
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,160
something heinous.

637
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,760
Didn't you like Gu Chuan?

638
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,000
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

639
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,040
Don't ask.

640
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,680
Anyway,

641
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,560
break up.

642
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,200
What happened?

643
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
Don't you know about

644
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,640
his physical condition?

645
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,760
Did you talk to him?

646
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,760
Of course, I needed to

647
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,840
check him for you.

648
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
It's good that I asked.

649
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,720
Otherwise, there will be huge issues.

650
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,640
Think about it.

651
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,320
He's in poor health when he's still young.

652
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,640
If he gets sick again

653
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,760
after you guys are together,

654
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,640
you'll be his personal nanny?

655
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,320
What else did he tell you?

656
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,440
Nothing else.

657
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
Don't ask again.

658
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,960
He really didn't tell

659
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,360
you anything special?

660
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,800
What special things could he tell me?

661
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,400
No.

662
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,000
Then listen to me.

663
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,120
Break up with him now.

664
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,120
I'll never break up with him.

665
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,960
I'll explain

666
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,480
things to you later.

667
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,720
I don't want any explanations.

668
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,200
Break up with him now.

669
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm going to bed.

670
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,400
You should rest too.

671
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,440
I'll wait until you calm down.

672
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,360
Kid,

673
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,120
I haven't finished talking.

674
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,640
Don't you know manners?

675
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,300
(What do men think when they are in love?)

676
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,880
Hope you take the lead.

677
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,560
Sometimes, in a relationship,

678
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,440
the people who take the lead

679
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
feel they are putting more effort into it.

680
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,640
They'll also feel tired if they always take the lead.

681
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,040
(What are you doing?)

682
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,920
(I'm...)

683
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,280
(I'm studying.)

684
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
(Shouldn't he tell me)

685
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,440
(Aunty went to talk to him?)

686
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,880
(Okay, you keep studying.)

687
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,440
Fine, I won't bring it up if you don't mention it.

688
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,480
Jiang Xiao Ning, hold back.

689
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,720
Must hold back.

690
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,320
You can do it.

691
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,000
Hold back.

692
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,480
Let's see when you will contact me.

693
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Why are you here?

694
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,680
I came here

695
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,360
to check if you're actually studying.

696
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,640
Of course.

697
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,840
You know I'm studying...

698
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,840
You woke up so early during the weekend?

699
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
I couldn't fall asleep.

700
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,040
If you can't fall asleep,

701
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,920
why don't we take a walk outside?

702
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
Great.

703
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,520
Somebody said he would come to help me.

704
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,160
I was helping you clean up

705
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,480
the apartment this whole time, right?

706
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,880
Look how clean

707
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,760
and how organized it is.

708
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,640
Why can't I get the door open?

709
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,560
Why did you take my key?

710
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,320
Whose things are these?

711
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,800
They're all mine.

712
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,000
Xu Cheng Ran, you are way out of line.

713
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,520
I'm not.

714
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,520
The master bedroom is yours.

715
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,720
The second bedroom belongs to me.

716
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,840
We can share the living room and the kitchen.

717
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,560
Well-planned.

718
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,800
Did you ask for my input?

719
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,560
Also,

720
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,240
you're rich.

721
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,840
Why bother to

722
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,320
share an apartment with me?

723
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,240
Yan Yan.

724
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,920
I think you shouldn't have

725
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,320
bias against me.

726
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm actually a thrifty

727
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,800
and economical young man.

728
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,520
I don't like to

729
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,920
live a wasteful lifestyle.

730
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,360
Sharing an apartment saves us money.

731
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,720
We can also accompany each other.

732
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,720
The layout of this apartment

733
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,720
is very good.

734
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,960
With the living room in the middle

735
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,400
and bedrooms across from one another,

736
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,920
we won't bother each other.

737
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,720
Also,

738
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
I can stay here to suppress the misfortune.

739
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,400
You'll have a sense of safety.

740
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,840
I'll have a sense of happiness.

741
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,240
It's perfect.

742
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,760
Are you serious?

743
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm sharing the apartment with you for sure.

744
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,480
Things have changed so much around here.

745
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,920
It feels different every time

746
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,200
I come back.

747
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,280
This town has become

748
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,400
a tourist attraction.

749
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,480
More people come to visit.

750
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,800
After the construction

751
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
of the old house is done,

752
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,280
I want to bring Grandma and Aunty here.

753
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
That way,

754
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,560
I can visit Grandma and Aunty

755
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
when I come

756
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,320
to pick you up.

757
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,280
You'll also get to eat

758
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,840
dumplings made by Aunty.

759
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,600
Didn't Aunty ask you anything?

760
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,760
You finally asked me.

761
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,720
What did you talk about?

762
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,120
Did you

763
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,040
tell her about

764
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,160
the mechanical heart?

765
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,040
I didn't.

766
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,680
I just told her

767
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,000
I have some health issues.

768
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
You don't really need to tell her.

769
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,760
How can I not?

770
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,440
You dislike cheating the most.

771
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,640
You can be more strategic.

772
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,720
Does Aunty have a strong attitude?

773
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,680
No.

774
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,520
Don't overthink it.

775
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,240
Aunty just cares about me too much.

776
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,520
It's also my first time

777
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,360
being in a relationship.

778
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,280
I can understand why she's worried.

779
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
Actually, her worries

780
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,200
make sense.

781
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,360
They don't.

782
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,800
I won't allow anyone to say anything bad about you.

783
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,520
Eyes on the road.

784
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,000
You're letting me move in

785
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,320
without a second thought?

786
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,680
No other requirements

787
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,080
or other schemes?

788
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,840
Why don't you eat a self-heating hot pot first?

789
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,040
You...

790
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,320
Stay if you want.

791
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,640
If you don't want to stay, get out right now.

792
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,180
♪You're the haze in my sky♪

793
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,840
♪A disaster for my clear blue sky♪

794
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,760
Tell me the truth.

795
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,920
Do you like me?

796
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,680
If I don't like you,

797
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,520
why would I let you move in?

798
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,520
How much do you like me?

799
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,560
A little bit

800
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,440
of a fleeting like.

801
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,360
A little bit is enough.

802
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,040
I'll keep working at it

803
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,800
until I reach where

804
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,600
Gu Chuan is at.

805
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,560
Oh right,

806
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,480
I have a secret

807
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,400
to share with you.

808
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
About Gu Chuan and Jiang Xiao Ning?

809
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,960
I know.

810
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,680
You know too?

811
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,920
Am I the last person to find out?

812
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,440
It's delicious.

813
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,920
This garden used to be pretty.

814
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,960
We planted all kinds of

815
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,680
flowers in the garden.

816
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,680
My dad also

817
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,000
built a swing for me.

818
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,680
I spent all my summer breaks here

819
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,280
when I was young.

820
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,040
Unfortunately,

821
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,200
everything got burned down.

822
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,040
I'll work hard to

823
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,920
save enough money

824
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,800
to rebuild this house.

825
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
I can help you out.

826
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
This way, you'll have

827
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,200
less pressure.

828
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,840
Of course, I hope

829
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
someone could help me.

830
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,080
It'll certainly

831
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,400
relieve some of my pressure.

832
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,240
But,

833
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,840
since I promised my dad,

834
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,280
I'll rely on my own efforts to

835
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,920
rebuild the house.

836
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,120
My dad's dream was

837
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,640
to design everything on his own.

838
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,400
To build

839
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,480
a house that

840
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,680
can bring all family members together.

841
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,840
Now that I've taken over

842
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,240
my dad's dream,

843
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,280
I'll do the same.

844
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,080
Although I don't know

845
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,960
when I'll have enough money,

846
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
I'll work harder and harder

847
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,400
and earn more and more money at your company

848
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,000
to rebuild the house.

849
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,920
I want to do something for you.

850
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,480
You've helped a lot.

851
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,280
I know you don't mind,

852
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,480
but I do.

853
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,240
When we eat out,

854
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,760
I can't afford to pay

855
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
even if we split the bill.

856
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,600
So,

857
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,920
I accept the fact that

858
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,560
you pay for my meals.

859
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,960
However, I still want to be your equal,
as equal as possible.

860
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
Because only when we're equal,

861
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,760
can I love you

862
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
with confidence.

863
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,480
Okay, show me around.

864
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,560
Sure.

865
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,480
Look at this door.

866
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,720
Be careful.

867
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,440
Spider webs everywhere.

868
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,360
I really didn't expect

869
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
the little girl back then

870
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,960
to become like this today.

871
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,560
Become what?

872
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
Become pretty.

873
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,960
What else?

874
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,679
Besides being pretty,

875
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,400
what other strengths do I have?

876
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,679
Maybe you're so pretty

877
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,159
that I end up ignoring your

878
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,400
other strengths.

879
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,760
You're indeed Mr. Xu's friend.

880
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,719
You must have

881
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,800
hidden it too well.

882
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,560
It seems that

883
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,360
I need to get to know you again.

884
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,600
No rush.

885
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,000
We have plenty of time.

886
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,440
These days,

887
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,440
I feel like

888
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,280
things are a little unreal.

889
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,800
Taking a walk

890
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,920
with the person I like.

891
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,040
Looking at the stars in the sky.

892
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,280
The weather is nice too.

893
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
Feels like I'm living in a dream.

894
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,280

Aunty, you're still up.

925
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,160
I saw your boss

926
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,360
dropping you off.

927
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,720
Aunty asked you to break up for your sake.

928
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,360
Why don't you

929
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,560
listen to me?

930
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,040
Aunty, I've grown up.

931
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,080
I know what is good

932
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,360
and what is bad.

933
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,440
You're independent, right?

934
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,120
You don't need Aunty anymore?

935
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,720
Aunty, you know

936
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,840
that's not what I mean.

937
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,880
I went to the old house today.

938
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,520
Gu Chuan brought me back.

939
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,840
I know

940
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,480
he is good to you.

941
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,320
If he is

942
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,600
healthy,

943
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,320
there is no way

944
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,720
Aunty will say no.

945
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,120
Do you know why

946
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,080
he has health issues?

947
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,720
I don't want to know.

948
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,360
It's because of me.

949
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,480
Don't talk nonsense.

950
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,400
How could it have anything to do with you?

951
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,640
Gu Chuan is the big brother

952
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
who got hurt saving me ten years ago.

953
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,920
Sorry I made you worry.

954
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,840
It's okay.

955
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,400
I'm just afraid you'll

956
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,840
have a hard time because of me.

957
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Not at all.

958
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
I must let Aunty know how much

959
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,560
you deserve to be loved.

960
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,880
How lucky am I

961
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,160
to have met you.

962
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Charging completed.

963
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,520
You have health issues?

964
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,600
What issues?

965
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
Are they treatable?

966
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,320
There's the possibility

967
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,280
that I’ll be cured.

968
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,000
In other words,

969
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,360
there's the possibility that you won't be cured?

970
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,700
(Dr. P mobile)

971
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,900
(Heart rate: You've received a message)

972
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,520
Your phone has been buzzing.

973
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,280
What's this?

974
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,640
This is an app I got

975
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,120
that can help locate my friend.

976
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll call him.

977
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,760
Chuan, are you okay?

978
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,120
I'm fine.

979
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,120
Are you sure you're okay?

980
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,920
I'm really okay.

981
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,840
Is that Gu Chuan?

982
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,240
Is everything okay?

983
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,240
He said he's fine.

984
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,880
Don't worry about him.
