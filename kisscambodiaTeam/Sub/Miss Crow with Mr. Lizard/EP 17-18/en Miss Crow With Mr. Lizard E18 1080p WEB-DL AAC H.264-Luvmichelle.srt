21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,400
(Defendant Chen Yun)

(and fled the scene afterward.)

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
(Chen Yun to be sentenced today for Hit-and-run)
(His action resulted in two people dead)

25

(He shall be charged for his action,)

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
(and because the consequences are severe,)

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
(he shall be punished according to law.)

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,000

(He will be sentenced to ten years in prison.)

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
Hello.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,960
Where is

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,680
the Chairman's office?

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,400
On the 45th floor.

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,280
Take the elevator,

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,000
there will be an escort waiting.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,720
Hello.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,760
Zhao Yan.

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,400
It's one floor up, right?

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,640
Thank you.

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,180
(Reindeer Group)

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,400
Not bad.

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,920
It looks natural.

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,320
Without checking the original account,

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,480
nothing is suspicious.

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,480
Director Xu.

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,920
I think

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,720
we will be in serious trouble

53
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,480
if our business partner

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
finds out about this.

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,160
Working for me,

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,360
you have nothing to worry about.

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,720
Great undertakings

58
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,000
requires unwavering will,

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,120
a great opportunity,

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
and strong endurance.

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,320
In my eyes,

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,920
anything that hasn't happened

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
is not a fact.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,760
Is that clear?

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes.

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,160
What conspiracy

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,880
are you two brewing this time?

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,840
Elder brother.

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,440
What brings you here?

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,160
You've barely come

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,640
after we relocated here.

72
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
You pay no attention to our family business

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,440
but waste your time

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
on your puny little

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,760
designing studios.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
What's the point?

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,040
Whose family business?

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520
Mine or yours?

79
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,920
Who knows you will

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,360
give the whole business

81
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
to me or your godson.

82
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,200
Elder brother.

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,400
You two carry on.

84
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
I should get going.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Thank you

86
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,080
for your contribution to this family.

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,320
You're an adult.

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Stop talking

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,080
like a jealous brat.

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,280
So

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
what brings you here?

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,440
This person.

93
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
Do you know him?

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
No.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,760
I told you,

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,760
this was the man who attacked me.

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
Are you sure?

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,080
Absolutely.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,200
Alright.

100
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,920
If you're sure,

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,440
I'll send my men to investigate it.

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,760
Is that all?

103
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,640
My mother asked me to tell you

104
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,160
she is coming back next month.

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,080
She wants to know

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
your schedules

107
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,040
and see whether you need her

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
to attend some social occasions

109
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,920
to put up an act or not.

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,080
If not,

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,000
she will go straight to Hainan

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,120
for a vacation.

113
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,680
How should

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,160
I know about the future?

115
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,520
She can go

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,760
wherever she wants for a holiday.

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
She asked you to deliver one message in person?

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,400
She could've

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
just called.

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,360
She said she didn't want to talk to you.

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,280
She wouldn't let me call you either

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
insisted that I must come in person.

123
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,040
I think

124
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,360
she wants you to come here

125
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,760
as often as you can.

126
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,960
Your mother is...

127
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Even now,

128
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,880
all her little wit

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,560
is spent on you and the company.

130
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
Silly.

131
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
I've brought you the message.

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
So long.

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,720
Why was he

134
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
at the company?

135
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
He gambled and lost again

136
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
so he came asking for money.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,480
But I sent him away.

138
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,080
Ran Ran took a photo

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,280
of you being with him.

140
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
Don't be so sloppy next time.

141
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,120
At this rate,

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,360
we'll run into trouble.

143
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
Figure something out.

144
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,640
Understood

145
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,920
Well?

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,320
Am I not efficient?

147
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,840
The person in the picture you sent me

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,920
is called Chen Ao.

149
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,400
The driver who crashed

150
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
your car

151
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
was his twin brother.

152
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,520
The twins

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
were both involved in robbery and burglary.

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,320
The elder brother Chen Yun

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,640
ran away after he hit

156
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
your car.

157
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,600
But he was arrested soon.

158
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,720
He died from illness

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,400
in prison soon afterward.

160
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
This means that Chen Ao

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,920
has nothing to do with my accident.

162
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
It seems so.

163
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
I still need to collect

164
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,400
more evidence.

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
This guy Chen Ao

166
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
may not be involved in my accident,

167
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,440
but I can't let him

168
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,760
harm Xu Cheng Ran again.

169
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,520
Mr. Huang,

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
do you have Chen Ao's record?

171
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,960
(Verdict of Chen Ao from Court of First Instance)
His record, address,

172
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
(Verdict of Chen Ao from Court of First Instance)
and even his current lifestyle

173
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,320
(Verdict of Chen Ao from Court of First Instance)
are all here.

174
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,320
No one else must know.

175
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
Understood.

176
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
Well then.

177
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,000
I should get going if there's nothing else.

178
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,680
By the way, Mr. Huang,

179
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
how is the progress with the foundation?

180
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,240
There are some procedures

181
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,320
to follow.

182
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
Be patient.

183
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,040
I'll keep you posted.

184
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
Thank you.

185
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,960
Good morning.

186
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Boss, why are you here?

187
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm taking care of a patient today.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,840
Did you drove here

189
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,560
to pick me up?

190
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm feeling

191
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,800
much better already.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can drive.

193
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you sure?

194
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,440
Do you need another day off?

195
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,400
That's not necessary.

196
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm lively and full of spirit.

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,120
Do I look like a patient to you?

198
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Not to mention

199
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,919
you took a great risk for me.

200
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,120
The more I think about it,

201
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,799
the more I blame myself.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
I barely slept last night.

203
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,200
Very well.

204
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,039
Get on the car.

205
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,640
Did you have your breakfast?

206
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,320
Let's go get some drink.

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
Did I hear it right?

208
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,440
You told me

209
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,480
a pleasant drink

210
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,120

I must apologize.

214
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I need your signature on this.

281
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,080

284
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
bought my smile.

286
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,800
your smile?

287
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,200
Sister Wen Wen.

288
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,160
I've explained

289
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
what happened that day to Gu Chuan.

290
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,880
But all and all,

291
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,600
I caused everything.

292
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,720
I must apologize to you again.

293
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,600
It's fine, Sister Wen Wen.

294
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,920
It wasn't your fault.

295
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,880
It was merely my bad luck.

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
A show of goodwill from me.

297
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
Never mind.

298
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,120
I said you don't have to apologize.

299
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,000
There's no need to send me a gift.

300
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
It's not exactly a gift.

301
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,640
Consider it

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,760
a souvenir.

303
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,160
A souvenir?

304
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,560
This album contains

305
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,280
some photos Gu Chuan
took for National Geographic

306
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
ten years ago.

307
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,080
There are also

308
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,840
some photos from his younger days.

309
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,040
I don't think I should

310
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,080
keep them.

311
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,680
I think

312
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,880
you should have it.

313
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,940
(July 21st 2008, Cuba)

314
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,500
(January 20th 2009, Spain)

315
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
He took all these photos?

316
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,880
I hope you can

317
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,800
know more about his past.

318
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,160
I...

319
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,840
Do I have the right?

320
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,800
Trust me,

321
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,880
no one is more qualified than you are.

322
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm leaving

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,640
for Australia tomorrow.

324
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,480
Many animals there are endangered

325
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,560
because of the wildfire.

326
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,360
I want to be there

327
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,840
to capture their images.

328
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,520
It might not take long,

329
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,360
but maybe I'll take quite a while.

330
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,680
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

331
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,520
What about the film festival?

332
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,560
Are you giving up on that?

333
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm not giving up.

334
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,720
When I'm back,

335
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,320
you still need to handle the design for me.

336
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,080
The best thing that has happened to me

337
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,080
since I came back

338
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,760
was meeting you.

339
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,880
Thanks to you,

340
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
I get to know Gu Chuan again.

341
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,600
So...

342
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,000
Jiang Xiao Ning,

343
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,800
take care of him.

344
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,480
Sister Wen Wen,

345
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
are you leaving

346
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,960
because of me?

347
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,960
Don't think so highly of yourself.

348
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
It was too sudden,

349
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,640
so I overthink a little.

350
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,280
Gu Chuan

351
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,000
is more of a

352
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,560
stubborn person.

353
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,680
Once he makes a decision,

354
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
no one can change his mind.

355
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,480
But I believe

356
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,240
you're the only one that can change him.

357
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,760
You two have something in common.

358
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,320
You both have a passionate heart.

359
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,440
I do hope

360
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,720
you can be happy together.

361
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,960
If you don't miss the chance,

362
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,480
you won't have any regret.

363
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,040
I've already found my happiness.

364
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Don't forget to work on yours.

365
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,200
Thank you, Sister Wen Wen.

366
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
Thank you.

367
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,280
Enjoy your food.

368
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,640
We only ordered one can of wine.

369
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,200
Please...

370
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Never mind.

371
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,520
It's not that strong.

372
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,640
I can handle it.

373
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
Don't drink too much.

374
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,800
Leave the rest to me.

375
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,760
OK.

376
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,520
Boss.

377
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,800
I thought you never liked having late-night meals.

378
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,680
I feel hungry at night lately.

379
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,320
The bill is on me to return your favor.

380
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,440
Eat as much as you want.

381
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,920
How generous of you.

382
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,480
The food here is incredible.

383
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,720
When I was working part-time,

384
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,840
the happiest thing for me

385
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,280
was to eat as I could here

386
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,880
on my payday.

387
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,000
The lady here is a great cook.

388
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,880
Her cooking is on par
with Michelin-starred restaurant.

389
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
I've never

390
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,760
been to one anyway.

391
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,960
But this restaurant

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,520
is Michelin-starred to me.

393
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,480
I'll give it three stars.

394
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,360
No.

395
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,720
Five stars!

396
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,520
They don't give out so many stars.

397
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,080
You have a point.

398
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,680
Let me ask you something.

399
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,160
Are you always

400
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
so optimistic?

401
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,200
I control my mind with my will.

402
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,840
Every day when I wake up,

403
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,680
I brush my teeth with positivity;

404
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
I finish my meals with positivity;

405
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,120
I work with positivity;

406
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,840
I even take showers with positivity.

407
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,560
I stack positivity endlessly.

408
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,800
This practice will surely

409
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,960
make you happy every day of your life.

410
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
What about when you're upset?

411
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Do you force yourself to smile?

412
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,600
Not really.

413
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,480
Maybe I've got used to it.

414
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,360
I've always been

415
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,440
very unlucky.

416
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,480
I have had

417
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,640
many unpleasant memories.

418
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,320
After going through so much,

419
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,560
I somehow coped with it.

420
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,000
Just as my aunt said,

421
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,080
"Every day is a new day."

422
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,680
"There is no way for us

423
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
to turn back time."

424
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,120
When I think about it,

425
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,080
I feel much better.

426
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
Having some wine here

427
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,800
makes my life even more enjoyable.

428
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,440
Cheers.

429
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,119
♪Happy birthday to you♪

430
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,400
♪Happy birthday to you♪

431
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
♪Happy birthday to you♪

432
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,319
Honey,

433
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,839
today is your birthday.

434
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,200
Stand up, make a wish.

435
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,920
Make a wish.

436
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,040
Great!

437
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,560
Happy Birthday!

438
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,359
Great.

439
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,119
Your birthday is around the corner.

440
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,319
How do you know?

441
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,040
I saw your ID card

442
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,560
when I got you the boarding pass.

443
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,160
I see.

444
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,680
It's been a long time

445
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,200
since I last celebrated my birthday.

446
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,600
Why?

447
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,760
It's just a date,

448
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
another usual day.

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,760
It's not different

450
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,120
from other days.

451
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
What matters the most

452
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,280
is to live happily

453
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,600
every day.

454
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,240
Do you agree?

455
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,240
You're right.

456
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,200
Well,

457
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,120
I must try the food you treat me to.

458
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,600
(Are you home yet?)

459
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,020
(Wife)

460
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,900
(Wife)

461
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,400
Sir,

462
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,640
you have a phone call.

463
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,620
Sorry, sir.

464
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:38,880
(Missed call from Wife)

465
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,560
(Missed call from Wife)
Did it annoy you?

466
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,780
(Missed call from Wife)

467
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,680
It was my wife.

468
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll turn off the phone.

469
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,480
It's all right.

470
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,760
Could it be

471
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,680
an emergency at home?

472
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,080
Perhaps, you should call her back first.

473
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,080
It's nothing serious.

474
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,760
Every night when she is going to bed,

475
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
she will call me.

476
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,120
She's been doing that for seven years.

477
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,920
I've got used to it.

478
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
You and your wife

479
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
are very close.

480
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,120
I think so.

481
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,760
People always joke about the "seven-year itch",

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,640
but I think

483
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,320
we are closer

484
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,360
than we ever were.

485
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,440
You know,

486
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,080
she is five years older than me.

487
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,160
I've never felt

488
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,120
there's actually an age difference between us.

489
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,160
Sometimes,

490
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
she would get all clingy

491
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,240
like a little girl.

492
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,360
Isn't that interesting?

493
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,920
Is that so?

494
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,000
It's just my opinion.

495
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,360
I think that

496
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,880
to maintain

497
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,440
a healthy relationship,

498
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,760
men should learn

499
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
how to give.

500
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
We must learn

501
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,320
to understand our partners.

502
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,320
If our girl

503
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,160
is interested

504
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
in anything,

505
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,960
we should try our best

506
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,880
to present it to her

507
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,200
and let her know we care

508
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,720
and that we're willing to give.

509
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,720
That's how we maintain

510
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
a healthy relationship.

511
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,640
But surely there are times

512
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,640
that we quarrel a little,

513
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,560
but I do my best

514
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,720
to cheer her up.

515
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,240
When we were

516
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,320
still dating,

517
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,280
we fought sometimes.

518
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,280
My solution

519
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,480
back then was to

520
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,840
give her a kiss and try to cheer her up,

521
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,600
or maybe give her a hug.

522
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,120
Do you know

523
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,280
what the best solution is

524
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
nowadays?

525
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,440
Clear out her shopping cart.

526
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
(I'm home.)

527
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,360
(Boss.)

528
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,400
(You paid behind my back again.)

529
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,400
(So I still owe you)

530
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
(a treat.)

531
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,280
(OK.)

532
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,800
Sir.

533
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,120
You can pull over for a while

534
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,640
and answer the call from your wife.

535
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,640
Don't worry.

536
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
I don't want to take up your time.

537
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,880
It's fine.

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,960
Answer the call first.

539
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,120
OK.

540
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,720
Thank you.

541
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,240
I'll pull over.

542
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,100
(You have one new message.)

543
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,400
(Ice-cream also wants Jiang Xiao Ning)

544
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
(to spend her every waking moment)

545
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
(happily.)

546
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,280
Jiang Xiao Ning.

547
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,240
Why are you

548
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
staying up so late?

549
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,520
Did you take a shower?

550
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,480
I'll go take a shower now.

551
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,200
Such a mess!

552
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,920
Let me clean it for you.

553
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
Don't put the scissors on your bed!

554
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,880
Brother.

555
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,800
Sister-in-law.

556
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,160
Xiao Ning is all grown up now.

557
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,440
She's become very sensible.

558
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,880
Don't you worry.

559
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,320
She is doing well.

560
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,160
But this young lady

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,920
misses you so.

562
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,720
Is she here?

563
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,640
Your hair is a mess.

564
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Iced Americano. Thanks.

565
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,520
Darling.

566
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,440
Darling?

567
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,200
Take another bite.

568
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,640
No.

569
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,480
I'll get fat

570
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
and you wouldn't like me anymore.

571
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,760
No way.

572
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,200
No matter how you've become,

573
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,240
you're the most beautiful lady to me.

574
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,440
Good girl.

575
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,840
Delicious.

576
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,760
Thanks.

577
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
Naughty!

578
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,280
You and your fancy words!

579
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
You're such a nice guy,

580
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,920
not to mention you're rich and handsome.

581
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,800
How can I ever leave you?

582
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,200
If any woman is foolish enough
to ditch you,

583
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,600
she must be blind as a bat!

584
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,360
You're correct.

585
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,800
But not every woman

586
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
is as brilliant as you.

587
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,560
Someone simply doesn't know
how to cherish my love.

588
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,800
Is this fun, Xu Cheng Ran?

589
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm dating, of course it's fun.

590
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Sorry, you wouldn't understand.

591
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,640
I don't care if you're dating.

592
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,080
But mind your manner.

593
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Keep it down.

594
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,360
You're repelling the other customers here.

595
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,040
Who's the repulsive one here?

596
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,800
Ran Ran!

597
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,880
Some single lady

598
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,880
is jealous of our love.

599
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,280
Let's go

600
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,840
somewhere else.

601
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,880
We...

602
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,880
should stay.

603
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,440
We don't have to hide from her.

604
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,160
We'll stay.

605
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,280
Drop the act.

606
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560
Miss, do you study performance art?

607
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,240
We're not acting.

608
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
Darling, give me a kiss.

609
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,040
Muah!

610
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
That's all?

611
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,480
Fine.

612
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,240
Ran Ran.

613
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,680
How dare you kiss my boyfriend?

614
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,560
You study performance art, right?

615
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,760
That was a demonstration.

616
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,840
Carry on.

617
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
Fine! We'll carry...

618
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,320
on.

619
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,640
Let's save it for another day.

620
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,440
That's all for now.

621
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,400
I don't...

622
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,640
I don't want her to hurt you.

623
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm not afraid of it.

624
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,560
I can handle

625
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,440
this woman.

626
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,360
Go on.

627
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,000
I'll leave you be then.

628
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,920
Be cautious

629
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,600
when you're out there.

630
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,120
Got it.

631
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,960
Bye.

632
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
I wasn't acting!

633
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,120
Put on a play if you want,

634
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,840
but don't drag the girl into it.

635
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,280
Who said we were acting?

636
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,680
Do you take me as a fool?

637
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
Even a little kid could tell.

638
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,920
A little kid can't have a date.

639
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,040
Hello.

640
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,600
The Chairman passed out.

641
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,040
He's in the hospital.

642
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,320
Come here now!

643
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,080
The hospital?

644
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
OK, I'll be right there.

645
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,200
What is it?

646
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,480
My father passed out.

647
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,280
He's in the hospital.

648
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,360
I can drive you there.

649
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,920
Thanks.

650
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
How is my father?

651
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,720
He pulled through.

652
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,000
He's having a rest.

653
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,720
What happened?

654
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,280
It was in a project negotiation.

655
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,080
We agreed he wouldn't be drinking.

656
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,280
But Mr. Xu

657
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,560
drank too much.

658
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,000
Then he passed out on the table.

659
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,240
What were you doing?

660
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,760
Why didn't you stop him?

661
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
I tried

662
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,880
but I couldn't.

663
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,520
You couldn't?

664
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,960
Didn't you know

665
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,640
what your job was?

666
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,960
Didn't you know he couldn't take it
with his health conditions?

667
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Get lost!

668
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
We're in a hospital, calm down.

669
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,520
Drink!

670
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,160
Keep on drinking!

671
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,280
You were always lecturing me

672
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,960
but you can't even

673
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
look after yourself.

674
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
If you fail again,

675
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,320
hand in your resignation.

676
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,360
So Director Xu is your father.

677
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,760
Why didn't you tell me?

678
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,240
This isn't

679
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,520
something to be proud of.

680
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,480
You obviously care about him.

681
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,320
Why didn't you stay

682
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
to keep him company just now?

683
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,320
Maybe you should just

684
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,680
move back to your home.

685
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,720
Who cares about the old man?

686
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,520
I don't care what becomes of him.

687
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,160
You've shown

688
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,360
all your love back there.

689
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,800
What did I do?

690
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,760
You're frustrated when you care!

691
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm not.

692
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,760
Whatever.

693
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,920
Trust me,

694
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,320
that is a hospital.

695
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Mind your manner

696
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,040
when you're there.

697
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,480
Agitation can be bad

698
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
for patients.

699
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Even if he wasn't a patient,

700
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,080
it wasn't right

701
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,200
to talk to him that way.

702
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,920
Fine.

703
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,240
I got it.

704
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,600
He will be fine.

705
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,040
Boss.

706
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,840
Sister Qi Hong needs your signature.

707
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,200
Boss.

708
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
I need to answer the call.

709
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,240
Hello, Aunty.

710
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,320
Xiao Ning.

711
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,320
Grandma...

712
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Grandma is missing!

713
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,280
She went missing again!

714
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
I've searched everywhere for her!

715
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,400
Aunty.

716
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,200
Calm down.

717
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,040
I'll be right back.

718
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,760
Calm down.

719
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,880
Wait for me.

720
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,520
Don't worry.

721
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,560
We will find your grandmother.

722
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,400
Chuan.

723
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,160
Xiao Ning's grandmother went missing.

724
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,600
Help us look for her.

725
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,880
OK.

726
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,880
I'm with Zhao Yan.

727
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We'll go together.

728
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,600
What's wrong?

729
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,760
Xiao Ning's grandmother went missing.

730
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Let's go there and help.

731
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,040
Hello.

732
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,800
Have you seen an old lady this tall?

733
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,760
Grandma!

734
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,560
I'll look over there.

735
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,840
How was it?

736
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,000
We've contacted the police station.

737
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,520
They will inform us

738
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,840
if there is any update.

739
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Thanks.

740
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,920
Where could she be?

741
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,400
She doesn't have strong legs.

742
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,120
Right?

743
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,800
Well...

744
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,600
She couldn't

745
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
have gone too far.

746
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,240
Right?

747
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,880
Don't worry, Aunty.

748
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,680
Don't worry.

749
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,640
But

750
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,640
the old lady is out there all alone.

751
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,760
What if something bad

752
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
happens to her?

753
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,880
Don't worry.

754
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,040
Take a rest.

755
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,280
Thank you.

756
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,920
What is this?

757
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,160
Your parents' photo is gone.

758
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,880
I put it in this frame, didn't I?

759
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,600
When I was making lunch,

760
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,880
someone delivered us some daisies

761
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,600
and placed them here.

762
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,560
That's gone too.

763
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
Grandma is at the cemetery.

764
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,040
She must be at the cemetery.

765
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,760
Let's look for her there.

766
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,880
Someone must stay here.

767
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,920
What if she comes back?

768
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,280
I'll stay with Aunty.

769
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,320
No.

770
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,120
I must go.

771
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,000
I must find her.

772
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,560
Don't worry.

773
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Leave it to me.

774
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,480
Are you sure?

775
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,040
OK.

776
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,800
I'll keep you company.

777
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,360
Well,

778
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,920
Xu Cheng Ran

779
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
can check with the police station again.

780
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,480
Please.

781
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,360
Go on.

782
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,720
Aunty, I'll go with Xiao Ning.

783
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,560
Are you sure?

784
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,360
We can handle it.

785
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,720
Gu Chuan, take care of her.

786
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,360
Sure.

787
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,640
Aunty, don't worry.

788
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,960
They will find her.

789
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,440
Take some rest.

790
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,400
Grandma.

791
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,800
Grandma, you scared me.

792
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,840
I was so worried I couldn't find you.

793
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,560
I...

794
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
I miss them

795
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,080
so I came by myself.

796
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,920
Grandma.

797
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,880
It's a two-hour trip.

798
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,720
How did you get here?

799
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,120
I've been

800
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,080
keeping this photo.

801
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,320
I know

802
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,320
I'm forgetful.

803
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,200
So

804
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,880
(Qinglongshan Cemetery)
I wrote the address on the back.

805
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,400
With this,

806
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,720
I'll always remember.

807
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,560
I'm sorry,

808
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,639
Xiao Ning.

809
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm sorry

810
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,199
that I made you worry.

811
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,600
It's all right, Grandma.

812
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
I don't blame you.

813
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,080
This isn't your fault.

814
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,840
I miss them.

815
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,840
I'm worried that one day

816
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,880
I might forget them.

817
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
All right, Grandma.

818
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,000
All right.

819
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,360
Xiao Ning.

820
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,000
Grandma.

821
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,960
Guang Da.

822
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
Stay a few days longer this time.

823
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,960
Don't always stay at the construction site.

824
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,080
Your wife,

825
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,720
why isn't she back with you?

826
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,440
I'm here!

827
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,200
My signature dish, Dapanji, is here.

828
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,320
It's not spicy.

829
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,880
Xiao Ning's Dapanji is super delicious.

830
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,560
You're lucky today.

831
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,880
Guang Da.

832
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,720
See?

833
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,480
Xiao Ning is already a young lady!

834
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,000
Grandma!

835
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,560
He is my boss,

836
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,560
not your son

837
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
nor my father.

838
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,920
If we were to be related,

839
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,400
he would be my uncle master.

840
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,720
Grandma.

841
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,320
Who do you think

842
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,320
I am?

843
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,240
Xiao Ning.

844
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,000
Trust me,

845
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,960
no puppy love.

846
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,840
The school doesn't allow that,

847
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,640
OK?

848
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,200
Grandma.

849
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,120
He is Yan Yan's boyfriend,

850
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,760
not mine.

851
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,080
Don't be silly.

852
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
He is not my boyfriend.

853
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,320
He's more like

854
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,560
a baron's foolish son.

855
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,440
Good.

856
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,560
That is good.

857
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,360
Guang Da.

858
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,560
Xiao Ning is a good girl.

859
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,760
She is so nice.

860
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,800
Yes.

861
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,880
Xiao Ning

862
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,800
is the best daughter

863
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,880
in this world.

864
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,080
Here comes the last dish,

865
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,560
fish filets in hot chili oil.

866
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,240
Guang Da.

867
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,360
Your wife is such an incredible cook!

868
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,640
Mother, stop fooling around.

869
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,440
Give me a break.

870
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,080
Aunty.

871
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,160
This is too much food for us.

872
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,880
We don't really

873
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
need a feast.

874
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,640
That won't do.

875
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,400
See?

876
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:14,920
After Xiao Ning

877
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,880
met friends like you,

878
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,880
she's been so happy.

879
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm glad for her.

880
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,520
And thank you

881
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,480
for helping us today.

882
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,840
Grandma is finally found.

883
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,600
Happy!

884
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,280
Come on.

885
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,840
Let's have a toast

886
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,560
to Aunty's feast.

887
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,400
Thank you, Aunty.

888
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,240
Stop!

889
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,200
I just remembered

890
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,400
that I forgot something.

891
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,320
I haven't bought it for ten years.

892
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,880
Today

893
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,200
is Xiao Ning's birthday.

894
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,240
Ning Ning.

895
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,000
I understand.

896
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,320
You feel upset

897
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,320
whenever it's

898
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,040
your birthday.

899
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,440
But you

900
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,320
must stop dwelling on

901
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,200
the accident from ten years ago.

902
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,480
Be grateful.

903
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,760
It was a miracle that you survived.

904
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,520
Grandma and I

905
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,000
got to see you grow up.

906
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,160
By the way,

907
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,440
it's been years

908
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,200
since your parents' passing.

909
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,960
Learn to move on.

910
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,240
I think that

911
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,280
your life

912
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,200
should have

913
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,160
a new start.

914
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,040
Right?

915
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,760
Come, Xiao Ning.

916
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,120
Happy Birthday.

917
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,160
Thank you.

918
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,720
Happy Birthday, Xiao Ning.

919
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,360
Thank you.

920
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,080
Happy Birthday to my dear Xiao Ning.

921
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,880
Thank you, Grandma.

922
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,280
Don't forget about me.

923
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,880
My sweet Xiao Ning.

924
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,240
Happy Birthday.

925
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,320
Happy Birthday.

926
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,400
Thank you.

927
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,480
Aunty.

928
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,400
Do you have a lighter?

929
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,200
Sure.

930
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,040
I got it ready.

931
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Do the honor.

932
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,280
See?

933
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,160
I was so thoughtful

934
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,240
not to show your age by the number of the candles.

935
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,080
Make a wish.
