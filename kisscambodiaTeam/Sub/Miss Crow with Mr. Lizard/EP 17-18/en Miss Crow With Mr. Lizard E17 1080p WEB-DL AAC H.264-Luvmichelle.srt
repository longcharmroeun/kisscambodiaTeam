21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,360
Hello?

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
Thank God.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,120
You finally picked up.

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
We got so worried

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,360
when we couldn't reach you.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone is looking for you.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
I left early.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,320
That's okay.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
As long as you're okay.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,320
By the way, I have some things to deal with.

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,800
I won't be going to the office for a while.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
Help me take care of things.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,720
Chuan,

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,480
you don't sound okay.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
How about I get Jiang Xiao Ning

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,600
to keep you company?

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
Or else I'll worry.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,160
No need,

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm fine.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,520
If something happens,

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll call you.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,640
Okay then.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Wang Kai,

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,520
why would Boss skip work for no reason?

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,120
This is the first time.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,400
He had even never

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,200
been late before.

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
You don't get it.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
If you don't come to work, it's called
skipping work.

50
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
If Boss doesn't come to work,

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,040
that's just called...

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
just called not coming to work.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm just curious.

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,600
I'll ask around for you.

55
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,400
Xiao Ning,

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
you're on good terms with Mr. Gu.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
Do you know why he didn't come?

58
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,560
No, I don't.

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,120
She doesn't know.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
(Is it because of me?)

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,920
(Did he not come to work because)

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,640
(he didn't want to see me?)

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,720
Jiang Xiao Ning,

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,680
come over here and take notes.

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,320
Okay.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Tell me your thoughts.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
She wants to do the exhibition

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,200
on the top floor

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,640
mainly because of the night scenery.

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,240
So I intend to turn the east-facing side

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,000
into a one-way mirror completely.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
That way the inside is see-through

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,400
and the exterior is glass.

74
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,080
Yep.

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
This way, we can ensure privacy

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,160
and...

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,600
Jiang Xiao Ning,

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,680
did you take down

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,640
what we just discussed?

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
I...

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,160
Where was I just now?

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,120
Oh yes, about the direction.

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Sorry,

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,800
Sister Wen Wen is calling me.

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Can I take the call?

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,520
Of course.

87
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,160
Venture capitalist is calling,

88
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,760
of course you need to pick up.

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,800
Hurry up, don't make her wait.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
Take the call, it's okay.

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,880
Hello, Sister Wen Wen.

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,640
Hello, Xiao Ning, are you busy?

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,920
Sorry to disturb you.

94
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
I have something to talk to you about.

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
How about we have lunch together

96
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,079
during your lunch break?

97
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,959
My treat.

98
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,720
Sure.

99
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,680
I'll bring you

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,160
the design proposal then.

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay.

102
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll send you the address in a bit.

103
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,840
See you at noon.

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
Chen Wen Wen asked you out?

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,360
For a meal.

106
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,840
Just you alone?

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
Without Chen Dong?

108
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,120
I want to eat with a pretty girl too,

109
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,680
but she didn't ask for me.

110
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not too sure either.

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,120
But don't worry,

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,240
I can explain our proposal

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
to her thoroughly.

114
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,160
Let's continue.

115
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,640
Okay.

116
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,880
So it's all about

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
the night scenery.

118
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,400
It's super beautiful.

119
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,720
It sets a certain kind of mood.

120
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,600
Sorry,

121
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,560
I got caught up

122
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,560
sorting out some files.

123
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,360
It's okay.

124
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
You'll improve very quickly

125
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,120
working at Gu Chuan's studio.

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,760
And I'm very confident about

127
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
leaving this project to you.

128
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
I can't compare

129
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
with you guys.

130
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm sometimes still not used to

131
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
interacting, getting to know,

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
and working with you guys.

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
You have your own strengths.

134
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
You're warm and cheerful,

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
persistent and hardworking.

136
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,160
Everyone can see that.

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,480
I like you a lot.

138
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,800
I think you're very sincere

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,720
and cute.

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,160
From the first time I saw you,

141
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
I thought you were really pretty.

142
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
After spending time with you,

143
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,440
I think you're really outstanding.

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,320
Not arrogant

145
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,520
and very empathetic.

146
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,360
I'm a girl and I like you.

147
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,720
But if I were a boy,

148
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,880
I would definitely like

149
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,000
a girl like you too.

150
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
You want to talk about Gu Chuan, right?

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,240
You don't need to have your guard up against me.

152
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,680
I'm not your enemy.

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,000
Su Man Lin told you, right?

154
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,040
I don't want to comment

155
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
on people I don't know,

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,920
but I'm not sure why

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
she told you about something

158
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
that happened so long ago.

159
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm Gu Chuan's ex-girlfriend.

160
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
I don't deny that.

161
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,200
But when I first met you,

162
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,200
I really didn't know about

163
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,520
your relationship with him.

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
I also never expected that

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
it would cause you trouble.

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,520
Sister Wen Wen,

167
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,920
you didn't cause any trouble.

168
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
It's my problem.

169
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,680
I can feel

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,960
your sincerity towards him.

171
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
I can't really get involved with the two of you,

172
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
but if you were affected

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,040
by me,

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,960
I hope to clear things up with you.

175
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,520
No, I'm not.

176
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Should I show you the blueprint now

177
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
or later?

178
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,680
Let's go to the site later.

179
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,120
You can explain it to me while we're there.

180
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,720
It's easier to understand this way.

181
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,160
My imagination isn't great.

182
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,480
Maybe that's why I can

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
only do photography

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
and not design.

185
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay.

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,200
Hello, your food.

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,120
Thank you.

188
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Let's talk while eating.

189
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
See if the food here

190
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,200
suits your appetite.

191
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,760
Okay.

192
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
I initially didn't want to

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,440
take on your case.

194
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,240
Is it because of who I am?

195
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't have animosity towards you.

196
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm just slightly afraid to see you.

197
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Simply put,

198
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm running away.

199
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,640
I don't deny that I once loved him.

200
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,160
Actually, after so many years,

201
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,240
I still admire

202
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
and respect him.

203
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,560
I hope we can all find

204
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,800
our own happiness.

205
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,040
This is me being open with you.

206
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
I did once regret

207
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,520
leaving him,

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,880
leaving this city,

209
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,960
during his darkest days.

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,440
But now that I think about it,

211
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,360
maybe this was all meant to be.

212
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,280
We cannot accept

213
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
each other as we are right now,

214
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,760
do you know what I mean?

215
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
How's your relationship with your ex-boyfriend?

216
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
I don't have an ex-boyfriend.

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,840
I haven't dated anyone yet.

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
Then let me share a secret

219
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
with you.

220
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
Don't fall in love with a man

221
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
because he loves you.

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,120
What does that mean?

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,480
If a man, by nature, is

224
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,679
cold,

225
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,880
emotionless, and hot-tempered,

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
or has some flaws which

227
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,559
you cannot accept,

228
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,240
but he temporarily disguises them

229
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,679
because of you,

230
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,120
don't ever be with him.

231
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,760
If there's another guy,

232
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,160
whom you feel even if you're not
in a relationship with,

233
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,560
or if you were dating

234
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,640
and you went your separate ways,

235
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
but you still admire him,

236
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,360
respect him,

237
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,400
and don't regret loving him,

238
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,720
then that is a relationship

239
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,280
worth having.

240
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,640
Sister Wen Wen, you put it so well.

241
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,360
I almost fell for you.

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,440
I hope Gu Chuan

243
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,480
can find his happiness.

244
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,720
When I was in my 20s,

245
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,760
I didn't fight for my love.

246
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
It took me a while to

247
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
get over that.

248
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,840
But I don't have any regrets.

249
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,400
I hope you won't miss it.

250
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Fight for what you want.

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,760
You're already doing great.

252
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,360
No one can stop you.

253
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Hello, Lawyer Huang,

254
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
are you busy?

255
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
Yes, I'm sorting out the documents

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you gave me previously.

257
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,080
I want to set up a fund.

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
For yourself?

259
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,040
There are a lot of

260
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
outstanding university students

261
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,240
who are unable to attend university
for various reasons.

262
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,000
I want to set up a fund

263
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,520
to help these underprivileged students

264
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,000
finish their studies.

265
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,160
Of course,

266
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
I know our country is doing a lot

267
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,880
on this front,

268
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,800
which is why I want to set up this fund

269
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,600
for the architectural industry.

270
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
Okay, I'll look into it for you.

271
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
Also...

272
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
my wills.

273
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,520
I've discussed this matter with you

274
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,760
every single time.

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
I already know that

276
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,080
you won't change your mind.

277
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
I'll follow your instructions.

278
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
I want to make some changes

279
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,080
to my wills.

280
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,960
You don't need to notarize it for now.

281
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,520
Let me think about it.

282
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,520
I'll give you a call

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,520
once I've thought about it.

284
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,520
Sure, contact me anytime.

285
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,840
Bye-bye.

286
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,440
Actually,

287
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,080
I've already confessed to Boss.

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
And?

289
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,800
And then he asked me to stop talking.

290
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,880
This is tricky.

291
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,360
It doesn't sound like him...

292
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
but it also sounds like something he would do.

293
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,000
But I think

294
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
you need to trust him.

295
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,840
Believe that the man you love

296
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,040
is someone who is mature.

297
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,280
He has his considerations.

298
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,960
When the time is right,

299
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,120
he will share his thoughts

300
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
with you.

301
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
Thank you, Sister Wen Wen.

302
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,880
Really.

303
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,600
I feel really lucky to have met you.

304
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Well then,

305
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,280
cheers!

306
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,320
Keep pushing.

307
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
Absolutely.

308
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,840
Xiao Ning?

309
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Xiao Ning,

310
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,480
we're here.

311
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
Sorry, Sister Wen Wen.

312
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,200
I didn't sleep well last night.

313
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm too tired.

314
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,840
How could I fall asleep

315
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
while going to the site with a client?

316
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm sorry.

317
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,400
That's so unprofessional of me.

318
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,560
It's okay.

319
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,720
It shows that

320
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
you really trust me.

321
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,400
For sure.

322
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,480
Let's go.

323
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:56,920
Okay.

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,000
This place

325
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,120
is going to be renovated too right?

326
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
Yes, it will be renovated.

327
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,160
I heard Sister Man Lin and Brother Dong

328
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,640
talking about it at the office.

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Okay.

330
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,200
Be careful.

331
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,720
We're here.

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
I want to shoot

333
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,880
the night scenery here tonight

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,160
to give the designers a reference.

335
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Their design

336
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
incorporates the night scenery here.

337
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,800
I think it's great.

338
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Sure.

339
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Need me to help you take pictures?

340
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,040
It's okay,

341
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,800
Even having you press the shutter

342
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
would cost a lot.

343
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,600
It's so high up.

344
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
I feel a little scared standing up here.

345
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,840
Are you scared of heights?

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,320
Not really.

347
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,320
Compared to heights, darkness is even scarier.

348
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
It's lit at night.

349
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,960
Okay.

350
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,360
Hello?

351
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,000
What happened?

352
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,200
Wait for me.

353
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
I'll head over to pick you up.

354
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
My cellphone is running out of battery.

355
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,480
Send me your location,

356
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,680
so I can tell the driver.

357
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,840
It's going to rain soon.

358
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,680
Wait for me.

359
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay.

360
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Xiao Ning,

361
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,120
my husband's car

362
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,880
got submerged under the bridge.

363
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,000
I have to go pick him up.

364
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I'll leave the keys at the door.

365
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,880
Remember to lock the door

366
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,600
when you leave.

367
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,480
Sure, don't worry.

368
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,080
I'll lock the door.

369
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,720
Be careful.

370
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,320
Okay.

371
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,560
No way.

372
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,840
Such bad luck?

373
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,440
Hello,

374
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,600
the number you've just dialed is switched off.

375
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,880
Sister Wen Wen.

376
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,120
Is anyone there?

377
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,680
Is… is anyone there?

378
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone.

379
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,080
Hello?

380
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Boss,

381
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
can you come over to open the door for me?

382
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,000
I didn't want to bother you initially,

383
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,240
but I really couldn't find

384
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,200
anyone else.

385
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
What's going on?

386
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,960
Where are you?

387
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
An Tai Building.

388
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,840
I came here with Sister Wen Wen.

389
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,680
She left first because she had something to do.

390
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,880
I… I'm stuck on the roof.

391
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,400
I can't get out.

392
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,360
You're on the rooftop while it's raining?

393
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
That's too dangerous.

394
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,880
Find a shelter and wait for me.

395
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,680
Wait for me.

396
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,480
Okay, I'll wait for you.

397
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,560
Hello,

398
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,320
the number you've just dialed is switched off.

399
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,560
The number you've just dialed is switched off.

400
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,700
(An Tai Building)

401
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,560
Hello, Sir. How may I help you?

402
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,720
Hello.

403
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,000
My friend is stuck on the roof.

404
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,400
Please go up and take a look immediately.

405
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,120
Are you sure it's this building?

406
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sure.

407
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,760
Follow me.

408
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Where's the key?

409
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,960
It was at the security office.

410
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,440
But the roof was rented out,

411
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,400
it should be with the tenant.

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,320
Isn't there a spare?

413
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,480
That's at the headquarters.

414
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,560
But it's too far from here.

415
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,440
We can't deliver it here.

416
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,960
Hurry, call the police now.

417
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,160
We've already called the police.

418
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,200
They should be here soon.

419
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,280
We don't have enough time.

420
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,680
Could you please

421
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,000
lock the elevator on the first floor

422
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,560
and make sure it stays there?

423
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,840
Don't let anyone touch the elevator.

424
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,120
Sir, you're...

425
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,200
Every elevator

426
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,160
has a maintenance floor.

427
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,720
I can enter from the elevator shaft

428
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,120
and exit from the maintenance floor.

429
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,840
I can reach the rooftop

430
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,600
this way.

431
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,200
That's too dangerous, Sir.

432
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,720
If anything were to happen to you,

433
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,560
I can't take the responsibility.

434
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,600
If something were to happen
to the person on the roof,

435
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
will you take the responsibility then?

436
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,840
That's not what I meant.

437
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,560
What I meant was

438
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,360
the firemen are coming soon.

439
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,560
I can't wait any longer.

440
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm an architectural designer,

442
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,360
so I'm very familiar with

443
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,800
the whole structure of this building.

444
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,600
As long as you keep a lookout for the elevator,

445
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,120
nothing

446
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,760
will happen to me.

447
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
The most important thing right now

448
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,680
is to save that person.

449
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,360
That girl

450
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,320
is very important to me.

451
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,920
Please.

452
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,800
Okay, Sir.

453
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
Be careful.

454
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,880
I'll keep a lookout for the elevator.

455
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,760
Thank you.

456
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,160
Jiang Xiao Ning!

457
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,960
Boss!

458
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Are you okay?

459
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm fine.

460
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
The door is locked.

461
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,800
Get out of the way.

462
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,320
No, Boss.

463
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
You'll hurt yourself.

464
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,880
Stay away.

465
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,880
Now.

466
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,880
No.

467
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,600
No.

468
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,320
Are you okay?

469
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
Boss.

470
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,960
I knew you'd come.

471
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,080
Jiang Xiao Ning!

472
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,200
Jiang Xiao Ning!

473
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,760
This bag is for Jiang Xiao Ning.

474
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,720
Ask her to drink one

475
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,840
when she wakes up.

476
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,760
Now,

477
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,880
you know how important it is for me to stay with you.

478
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Thanks.

479
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,840
Knock it off.

480
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,320
How is she?

481
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,240
It's all my fault.

482
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,040
She got scared and got an electric shock.

483
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,280
You saved her, okay?

484
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,240
If you weren't there,

485
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,960
the thunderbolt

486
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,600
might have struck her directly.

487
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,160
Strangely enough,

488
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,360
Jiang Xiao Ning always gets involved in accidents
when there is a thunderstorm.

489
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,160
You two

490
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,400
make quite a match.

491
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm just kidding.

492
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,760
Are you thinking about

493
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,320
something weird again?

494
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,560
What weird things can I think about?

495
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,200
Once you're fully charged,

496
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
go back and reset.

497
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,360
I'll take care of her.

498
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,680
I want to stay with her.

499
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,720
Your body

500
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,160
won't be able to go on like this.

501
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,160
It's okay.

502
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,800
I know what I'm doing.

503
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,400
What are you doing?

504
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Do you know what people need

505
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,160
the most when they catch a cold?

506
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,080
What?

507
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,080
Cold medicine.

508
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,280
Do you know

509
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,120
what you need the most right now?

510
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
Cold medicine?

511
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,440
You need me.

512
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,880
You stay with her.

513
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,760
I stay with you then.

514
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,040
I owe it to you.
(*in a sarcastic way)

515
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,960
Boss.

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,160
You're awake.

517
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,080
Boss, are you okay?

518
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm okay.

519
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Don't move.

520
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
You just reduced your fever.

521
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,240
The doctor said you need to rest.

522
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm fine.

523
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,280
I told you not to move.

524
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
Why don't you listen to me?

525
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,400
Boss.

526
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,240
I just want to get up to drink some water.

527
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,160
I'll get it for you.

528
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,440
Have I been paralyzed

529
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,920
by the electric shock?

530
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,000
Boss.

531
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,920
Did you stay with me this entire time?

532
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,720
How do you feel now?

533
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,800
Does it hurt?

534
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,600
No.

535
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm just a little weak.

536
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,400
You should rest for a couple more days.

537
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,040
Boss.

538
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,880
Do you have

539
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,440
superpowers?

540
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
What do you mean?

541
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,160
People around you will get hit

542
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,480
by thunderbolts when there is a thunderstorm.

543
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,440
Last time, He Sheng got hit too.

544
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,920
Maybe, I'm a human lightning conductor.

545
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,480
My body produces a greater amount of power.

546
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,920
Maybe

547
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,680
I swear too much?

548
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,480
You flatter more than

549
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,960
you swear.

550
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,700
♪His hair was for you♪

551
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
Thank you, Boss.

552
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,900
♪But there was nothing to do♪

553
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,580
♪You will throw away all your worries♪

554
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,240
(I'm at the hospital.)

555
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,080
(Which room is Xiao Ning in?)

556
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,520
You should rest a bit.

557
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,640
I'm going to get you some food.

558
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,280
Thanks, Boss.

559
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,200
You don't think

560
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,880
I intentionally

561
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,520
locked her up on the rooftop, do you?

562
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,640
I know you.

563
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,040
You wouldn't do anything like that.

564
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm responsible though.

565
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,640
I shouldn't have left her

566
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,600
there by herself.

567
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,280
I was answering a call.

568
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
I don't remember too much detail.

569
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,720
But I'm certain

570
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,000
I didn't lock the door.

571
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,320
I also left the key

572
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,840
at the door.

573
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,720
It's okay.

574
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,920
Don't blame yourself.

575
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Oh,

576
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,160
did you mention what happened to my heart

577
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,840
to her

578
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,320
when you were eating together?

579
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,240
No.

580
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,120
You should

581
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,200
tell her about

582
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,560
these things yourself.

583
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
Thank you.

584
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,840
You like her.

585
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,240
Right?

586
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,480
Right.

587
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Then why did you turn her down?

588
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
She's a very simple girl.

589
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,160
You'll hurt her.

590
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,600
Don't say I'm overstepping.

591
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,920
I just want you to be happy.

592
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,720
But you

593
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
look

594
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,640
really terrible.

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,680
You isolate yourself by

596
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,440
running away from your true feelings

597
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,240
and hurting others.

598
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,160
Maybe I'm wrong.

599
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,760
But you look exactly the same

600
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,040
as you were ten years ago.

601
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,360
You want to leave this world.

602
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Gu Chuan.

603
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,080
Don't let Jiang Xiao Ning

604
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,880
become a second me.

605
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,000
You need her.

606
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,200
You need this relationship.

607
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
You should trust her.

608
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,680
Trust that she'll stay with you

609
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
no matter what happens.

610
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,240
It has been ten years.

611
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,520
Although I'm still alive,

612
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm just staying alive.

613
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,040
It's not that I want it this way.

614
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,560
It's because I just can't

615
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,880
live like a normal person.

616
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,760
I gave up all my hobbies

617
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,040
and even you

618
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,440
for this mechanical heart.

619
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,080
To live with it,

620
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,880
I can't laugh out loud when I'm happy.

621
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,800
I can't drink when I'm upset.

622
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,720
When I'm angry,

623
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,720
I can't touch anyone

624
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,440
or anything.

625
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,560
I've been controlling

626
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,160
my emotions all this time.

627
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,720
However,

628
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,720
it still

629
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
reminds me all the time that

630
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,960
I don't have the ability to love anyone.

631
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,320
Now,

632
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,560
this mechanical heart

633
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,640
is performing worse and worse.

634
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
The pain it brings me

635
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,960
makes me feel that

636
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,560
every day is so long.

637
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,400
I certainly had thought of

638
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,760
ending it.

639
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,480
What about Jiang Xiao Ning?

640
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,720
What about you two?

641
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,080
Jing Xiao Ning.

642
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,320
She is a real accident.

643
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,760
She interrupted all my plans.

644
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,160
The old me never expected

645
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,200
the next day

646
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,760
to come.

647
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,280
Ever since she came into my life,

648
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,160
I started to look forward to

649
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,040
going to work.

650
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,160
I look forward to seeing her.

651
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,880
I look forward to listening to her nonsense.

652
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,040
I look forward to seeing her following me around

653
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,040
and flattering me every day.

654
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,880
What will you do?

655
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,120
I'm

656
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,400
in a dilemma.

657
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,600
Ten years ago,

658
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,120
you insisted

659
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,600
on pushing me away.

660
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,160
Ten years later,

661
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,400
you want to do the same

662
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,480
to another girl?

663
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,460
(Passenger Elevator)

664
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,780
(Patient Zone No.1)

665
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,880
Yan Yan.

666
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,239
You're here.

667
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Why are you here?

668
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,400
They both got hurt last night.

669
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm worried.

670
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,000
I was going to call you,

671
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,400
but I was afraid you would worry.

672
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,679
The doctor said

673
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,159
they're both fine.

674
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,679
Then you should have called

675
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
me last night.

676
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,679
If you were worried,

677
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,280
we should be here together.

678
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,320
I didn't stay up all night for nothing.

679
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,160
So Gu Chuan climbed from the elevator shaft and

680
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,840
crashed through the glass door to save you?

681
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,960
It was super scary.

682
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,880
I'll still get scared even by thinking about it.

683
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,000
If anything happens to him,

684
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,880
I don't want to live either.

685
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,680
Stop it. What are you talking about?

686
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
You're all good now.

687
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,720
What he has done

688
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,800
has proved that

689
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,160
you're important to him.

690
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,680
This is different from

691
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,160
what you had told me before.

692
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,400
He still turned me down.

693
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,960
This is odd.

694
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,320
First of all,

695
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,320
he's not a playboy.

696
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
My playboy radar

697
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,640
didn't go off.

698
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,680
Also,

699
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,720
he hasn't been in contact

700
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,120
with other girls, right?

701
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,520
If he sees you as a backup,

702
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,600
he wouldn't have risked his life to save you.

703
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,200
Then why did he turn me down?

704
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,840
Maybe he's inexperienced?

705
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,960
He doesn't look that way.

706
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,120
He is the owner of a big company after all.

707
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,880
I think you should be more proactive.

708
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Jiang Xiao Ning.

709
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,400
You've already done something?

710
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,120
Right?

711
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,440
No, don't just make a wild guess.

712
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,800
You lied.

713
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,120
I know every single

714
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,840
thought of yours.

715
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,880
Don't think you can hide things from me.

716
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,520
Confess right now.

717
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,120
Did you kiss him?

718
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,240
Hug him?

719
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,200
Or you guys have already...

720
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
No.

721
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,400
But this time

722
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,760
I learned one thing.

723
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,160
Just like what you

724
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,480
and Sister Wen Wen had said.

725
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,440
First,

726
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,320
he is someone worth loving.

727
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,320
So I need to work hard

728
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,280
to shorten the distance between us.

729
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,920
Even if nothing happens in the end,

730
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,960
that would be because I'm not the right fit,

731
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,280
or I'm not good enough.

732
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,440
It would have nothing to do with him.

733
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,160
But if I give up now,

734
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,720
I'll regret it for sure.

735
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,920
So I plan to

736
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,000
go with the flow

737
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,720
and deal with things as they happen.

738
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,840
Look at you.

739
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,520
Spewing out words of wisdom.

740
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Looks like love

741
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,440
does make people grow.

742
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,520
What if he is a playboy?

743
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,600
Didn't you say your playboy radar didn't go off?

744
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,640
I... I...

745
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm not omnipotent.

746
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
How can I be a hundred percent accurate?

747
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,040
Then you were wrong about Mr. Xu?

748
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,320
I wasn't wrong about him.

749
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Let me tell you something.

750
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
Am I interrupting?

751
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,560
No.

752
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,360
Oh, right.

753
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,680
I have some work stuff to deal with.

754
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm leaving Xiao Ning to you.

755
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
Do you want to eat something?

756
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,760
We will do one more examination.

757
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,120
If nothing is wrong, you can go home.

758
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,640
Thank you, Boss.

759
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,560
Going home?

760
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,240
I'll drive you home.

761
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,520
No, thanks.

762
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,120
Did you drive?

763
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,320
No.

764
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:16,960
If you want to call a cab,

765
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,120
you'd better go across the street.

766
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
It's hard to park in front of the hospital.

767
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,760
Bye-bye.

768
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,040
It's really hard to ask you out.

769
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,800
Why are you here?

770
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,600
Recently, I've been

771
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,880
out of luck.

772
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,320
Come with me.

773
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,240
Director Xu

774
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,760
just gave you money not long ago.

775
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,000
And his son almost found out about it.

776
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
My brother went to prison

777
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,520
for you guys.

778
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,320
He ought to

779
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,120
give me money.

780
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,280
Don't waste my time.

781
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:20,960
I'll leave

782
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,200
once you give me money.

783
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,760
It won't look good

784
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,160
if other people see us.

785
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
What now?

786
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,920
You don't want to give me money?

787
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,080
Alright.

788
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I'll ask Director Xu.

789
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,880
Come back.

790
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,040
You cannot come here

791
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,840
anymore.

792
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,760
Do you hear me?

793
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,560
Okay.

794
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,280
I'll follow your orders.

795
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Follow your orders.

796
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
Chen Ao.

797
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,960
If I see you here again,

798
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,880
things won't end well for you.

799
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,160
Get in.

800
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,760
Shouldn't I drive?

801
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,360
I'll drive today.

802
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,240
Boss.

803
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,120
Although I got scared a little bit,

804
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,880
I should still

805
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,360
do my job.

806
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,760
Just do as I say.

807
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,120
I'll drive today.

808
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,080
Get in.

809
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,480
Come on.

810
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,240
Take it easy.

811
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,200
Sit still.

812
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,040
(Chuan,)

813
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
(do you remember me telling you)

814
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
(that someone attacked me?)

815
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
(I was able to take a photo of that person today.)

816
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,060
(712 vicious hit-and-run offender Chen Yun
being sentenced today)

817
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,680
Hello, Lawyer Huang.

818
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,720
Please do me another favor.

819
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,080
What is it?

820
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,160
Look into a person for me.

821
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,440
Find out as much detail as possible.

822
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,520
This person

823
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,160
is the truck driver

824
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,080
who hit me

825
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,120
back then.

826
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,760
Didn't he die

827
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,160
in prison?

828
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,400
My friend took a photo of him.

829
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,040
What?

830
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,400
No way.

831
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm surprised as well.

832
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,640
I'll send you the photo now.

833
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,760
Okay.

834
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,920
I'll look into him as soon as possible.

835
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
