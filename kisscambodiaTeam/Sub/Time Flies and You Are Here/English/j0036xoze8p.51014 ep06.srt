(Writing poem for the courtesan, as good

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,080
What do you think, Mr. Yan?

22
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,199
You lost all five rounds.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,959
Are you still playing?

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,760
Sure.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,919
Why not?

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,879
I have yet to win back the money I lost.

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,279
It seems like

28
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,199
you have nothing else to offer to me.

29
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,519
That's not true.

30
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,080
I have plenty of money.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,239
Here.

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,840
(Zhong)
I'll place this as my bet.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,080
Is this yours?

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,600
How can you bet this?

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,440
Mind your own business.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,080
Are you going to make a move or not?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,520
No.

38
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,960
This is Zhong Ziyan's moneybag.

39
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,520
How could you place
Zhong Ziyan's moneybag as bet?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Give it to me.

41
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:23,399
No.

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,199
Give it to me.

43
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,119
No.

44
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,039
That's enough.

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,520
Mr. Yan.

46
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,160
The lady is right.

47
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,080
Gambling with someone else's money

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,360
is inappropriate.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
What do you suggest?

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
How about this?

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,839
Whoever loses this round

52
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,320
shall remove their clothes

53
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,839
and swim a lap across the lake.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,559
What do you think?

55
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,600
- Across the lake!
- Across the lake!

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,440
Fine. Come at me.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,199
Okay.

58
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,279
Yan Boyang,

59
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,199
let's just head home.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,479
Leave me alone.

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Hurry up and make a move.

62
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
Quit rushing me.

63
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,199
Hurry up.

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,759
Come on. Make a move.

65
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,320
What are you doing?

66
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,199
Stop looking at me.
Look at the chess board instead.

67
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,000
Come with me.

68
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,759
Are you done?

69
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,399
Head of Nencao Hall.

70
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,320
Are you done writing?

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
Yes.

72
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,279
There you go.

73
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,199
Why are you in a daze?

74
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:29,880
Move out of the way.

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,880
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,119
What happened?

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,880
Nothing.

78
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,639
Do you know

79
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,080
why she'd participate in
Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition?

80
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,279
To win the fan.

81
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,000
Who is she doing it for?

82
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,360
She's not doing it for you anyway.

83
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,720
What do you mean?

84
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,119
What do you know?

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know.

86
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,360
It's just a guess.

87
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,240
Hanchen.

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Both of you are not meant
for each other.

89
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,880
Even if you make her a concubine,

90
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,960
it's still inappropriate.

91
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,079
Who is she trying to win the fan for?

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,279
Li Su.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,399
I did not expect this,

94
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,119
but

95
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,399
how would you know what
is she going to do

96
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,519
after acquiring the fan?

97
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,640
Perhaps, it's not what you imagined.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,839
It's uncertain.

99
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,839
This is for you

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,440
without charge.

101
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,839
Ask anything you want.

102
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,040
Stop moving out

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
and moving back in.

104
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,799
I'm not exactly young anymore.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,480
I can't handle the trouble.

106
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,559
This is the last move.

107
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,160
I won!

108
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,079
I won!

109
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,160
I won!

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,440
I won!

111
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,279
It's the lady by his side

112
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,839
who gave him ideas.

113
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,839
I saw it all.

114
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,200
What are you going to do?

115
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,640
Are you jumping into the lake?

116
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,559
Me?

117
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,160
You should jump into the lake instead.

118
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,480
Mr. Yan.

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
Zhao Xiaoqian protects you normally.

120
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,359
I'll not say anything about that.

121
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
For today's chess game,

122
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,119
you need to rely on a mere lady
in order to win.

123
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,279
What should we do?

124
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,480
Strip him.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Throw him into the lake.

126
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

127
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,480
How dare you?

128
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,239
Mr. Yan.

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
A man

130
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,359
needs to be protected by a lady?

131
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,920
What's going on?

132
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
Shut that foul mouth of yours.

133
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,839
I'm telling you.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
Stop regarding yourself highly.

135
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,839
Whoever lays a finger on Yan Boyang,

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm not going to go easy on you.

137
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,480
Lady,

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,200
what are you going to do?

139
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:14,920
You...

140
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,040
I...

141
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,359
Try laying a finger on her.

142
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:23,720
Attack.

143
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
I would like to see you try.

144
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm not afraid of you.

145
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,760
What are you doing here?

146
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,440
Your grandfather is here

147
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,920
to beat you up.

148
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,320
You came right on time.

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,160
The three of us brothers

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,359
have not fought
together in a long time.

151
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Come on.

152
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,239
How dare you harass others?

153
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
Do you understand?

154
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,720
Stop fighting.

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
Do you know who I am?

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,760
Stop fighting.

157
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,559
Stop fighting.

158
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,200
Stop it!

159
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,720
Sir Han.

160
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,959
You're all sons of prestigious
families of the capital.

161
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,839
How could you behave this way?

162
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,000
Good-for-nothing fops

163
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,399
will achieve nothing in the future.

164
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,440
By all of your behaviour tonight,

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,559
how could you call yourself
pillars of the future?

166
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,239
Where are the servants?

167
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,399
Where are they?

168
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,760
How dare they allow their
masters to behave recklessly?

169
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:44,760
Where are they?

170
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,000
Sir Han.

171
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,000
Shut up.

172
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,320
Xiaoman.

173
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm the assistant of
Commandery Prince of Julu.

174
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,239
I failed to watch him.

175
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
I deserve to be punished.

176
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,000
Xiaoman.

177
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:17,480
It's not her fault.

178
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,519
Where's your assistant?

179
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,040
Sir Han.

180
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,799
If the master makes a mistake,

181
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,720
the servants should be reprimanded.

182
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,119
What is

183
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,599
a befitting punishment?

184
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,039
Should all of them be flogged?

185
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:36,919
Sir Han.

186
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,599
Since both parties are at fault,

187
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,880
let's all compromise

188
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:44,919
and reduce the commotion.

189
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,080
Both assistants shall drink three cups
of wine on behalf of their masters.

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,559
This incident shall pass.

191
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,840
Today is Teacher Liu's
Poetry Competition.

192
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,640
There are still matters to attend to.

193
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Please do not allow this
to affect your health, Sir Han.

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,159
I shall be punished
on behalf of master.

195
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,960
I beg for your forgiveness, Sir Han.

196
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,280
Although His Highness is stubborn,

197
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,000
he's a man of integrity.

198
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,440
He's caught up in the moment.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,599
I seek your understanding, Sir Han.

200
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,760
I think

201
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
this matter should end here.

202
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,320
No one should bring this up ever again.

203
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,520
Listen up, both of you brats.

204
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:10,520
If you misbehave before me once again,

205
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,200
as your elder,

206
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm going to submit
the appeal to the capital.

207
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
What are you staring at?

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,880
Are you not satisfied?

209
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,080
Xiaoman, are you all right?

210
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,280
Boyang.

211
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:32,960
Congwen.

212
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,359
Calm down.

213
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:33,840
That's enough.

214
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm just a troublemaker.

215
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,119
I've caused you much trouble.

216
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,599
It will not happen again.

217
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
Xiaoman, what's wrong?

218
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,880
Did you hear something?

219
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,280
Xiaoman.

220
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
You failed

221
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,880
the task I entrusted you to.

222
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,760
Master,

223
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,359
it's not entirely my fault.

224
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,000
Should I

225
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,159
finish up on the task right now?

226
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,359
I want to go home.

227
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,119
I want to go home.

228
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,479
I want to go home.

229
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,520
I want to go home.

230
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,440
All right. I know.

231
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,599
The carriage is ready.

232
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,400
I want to go home.

233
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm dropping you home right now.

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,559
Ziyan.

235
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
I want to go home.

236
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,359
Stay here and acquire the fan.

237
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,280
I shall send her home first.

238
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,640
Don't worry.

239
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,400
Come on. Let's go home.

240
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,559
I want to go home.

241
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to go home.

242
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Hanchen.

243
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,880
I want to go home.

244
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
What happened today was my fault.

245
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,359
I want to go home.

246
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,239
I'm not feeling well.

247
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,479
All right. We're almost home.

248
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,520
I feel uncomfortable.

249
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,980
(Qingtai Gate)

250
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,159
I want to go home.

251
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,200
Mother.

252
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,919
I want to go home.

253
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,559
What happened?

254
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,760
Xu Shu!

255
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,919
Your Highness,

256
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,760
don't blame me.

257
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,559
It's your fault for insisting on
marrying the daughter of Shen Family.

258
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,200
Young Master Shen ordered me to do so.

259
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,559
I'll do anything you say in the future

260
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,520
in order to atone for my mistakes.

261
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,119
You...

262
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,640
I don't want to get married.

263
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,559
I don't want to get married.

264
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,799
Mother.

265
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,280
I don't want to get married.

266
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,760
All right. I promise you.

267
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:10,960
I object.

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,919
Nobody is allowed to marry you off.

269
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,559
All right?

270
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,599
Have a seat here.

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,479
I don't feel good.

272
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,719
I don't want to get married.

273
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,880
I've become a female attendant.

274
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,799
No one would marry me.

275
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,520
Who said so?

276
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,479
Who said no one would marry you?

277
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll break their legs.

278
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Nobody would be willing to marry me.

279
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,520
Who's going to marry me?

280
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,599
Who's going to marry me?

281
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,239
Who's going to marry me?

282
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:53,719
Me.

283
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,320
Really?

284
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,599
Zhao Xiaoqian and his female attendant

285
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,039
are still in the carriage.

286
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,359
Master.

287
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,119
Running back here

288
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,559
took four hours.

289
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,359
Not to mention, Commandery Prince

290
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,919
is stuck with a drunk brat.

291
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:26,799
Tonight,

292
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,960
he will not be able to return.

293
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,000
Not bad.

294
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Release the news tomorrow

295
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,479
that the Commandery Prince of Julu,
Zhao Xiaoqian,

296
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,080
is getting a concubine.

297
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,400
All right.

298
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:48,960
Minggu,

299
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,000
think carefully.

300
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,880
Where else could Xiaoman go?

301
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,400
I have no idea.

302
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,880
His Highness said he'd send her home.

303
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,119
However, the both of them went missing.

304
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,599
My child.

305
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,359
All right.

306
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,679
Here. Have a seat.

307
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,440
Have a seat.

308
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,280
She will not be able to get married.

309
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,239
Do not panic.

310
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,119
We don't know the details yet.

311
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't panic.

312
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:16,960
Calm down.

313
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,679
We don't know what's going on.

314
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,400
Where are you going?

315
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,080
Request for troops from the censorate

316
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,919
to search for my daughter!

317
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,799
Calm down.

318
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,080
Find her!

319
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,799
No mistakes allowed!

320
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,760
We must find His Highness.

321
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,039
Yes!

322
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,359
Move it!

323
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,119
Check that spot!

324
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,000
Over there!

325
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,520
There are news.

326
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,359
The guards mentioned that last night,

327
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
Commandery Prince's carriage left the city

328
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,159
and has yet to return.

329
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,239
Official Xie

330
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,919
should be searching for them
on the opposite street.

331
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,280
Inform him about this.

332
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,799
Remember.

333
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,159
Do not let anyone hear this.

334
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,159
Yes.

335
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,440
Someone's coming.

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,799
Someone's coming.

337
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,520
Mr. Zhong,

338
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,559
isn't that Xiaoman?

339
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,840
Why did the carriage stop?

340
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,760
Hurry up.

341
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,719
This is the Commandery Prince
of Julu's carriage.

342
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:06,680
Commandery Prince?

343
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
My father has come to our aid.

344
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,439
Get in.

345
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,439
Get in.

346
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,239
I'll check the situation out.

347
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,280
Xiaoman is going to stay
hidden in the carriage.

348
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,119
Do not disclose this, Official Xie.

349
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,719
All right.

350
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,800
Get off when
no one is around.

351
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,280
We mustn't allow anyone to see this.

352
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,359
Don't worry.

353
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm here.

354
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,920
What a mess.

355
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,800
What a mess.

356
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
(Main Hall)

357
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,040
I don't know if the child

358
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,839
was found.

359
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
Don't worry.

360
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,119
They will be home soon.

361
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,319
Look, there they are.

362
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,359
How did things go?

363
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,000
How did things go?

364
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,040
Have a seat and some water.

365
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:17,920
Here.

366
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:18,880
Have a seat.

367
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,079
Say something.

368
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,439
It's all over.

369
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,199
Xiaoman is already home.

370
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,680
She's in her room now.

371
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,280
The rest...

372
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,280
Spill it.

373
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:37,880
Say something.

374
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,119
According to the members
of Commandery Prince of Julu Mansion,

375
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,199
it was probably a set-up.

376
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,680
Last night...

377
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,599
Last night,

378
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,560
both of them

379
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,800
spent the night together
in the carriage.

380
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,439
What?

381
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,040
Both of them spent
the night in the carriage?

382
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,920
Nothing happened.

383
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,160
Our daughter still holds her reputation.

384
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,199
Well...

385
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,040
Last night,

386
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,280
the carriage stopped by
at the back gate,

387
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,199
but it left the city last night.

388
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,400
It returned this morning.

389
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,560
Many citizens of the city
witnessed this.

390
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,839
I'm not sure who spread the news.

391
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,599
They claim that Xiaoman is
the woman in the carriage.

392
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,640
Well...

393
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,520
If this matter spreads,

394
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
my daughter

395
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,319
will not be able to get married.

396
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,599
Lady Xie, open up.

397
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm here to deliver
some rice balls over.

398
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:52,920
Xiaoman.

399
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,839
Open up.

400
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,680
You need to eat something regardless.

401
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,079
I made you rice balls personally.

402
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,439
It's going to turn soggy.

403
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,319
Xiaoman.

404
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,760
Xiaoman.

405
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,079
Come in.

406
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,560
Have something to eat.

407
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,520
There you go.

408
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,560
Xiaoman.

409
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,040
Eat some of these.

410
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,160
Look. It smells good.

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I made them myself.

412
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,040
It's osmanthus filling.

413
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,439
How are my parents doing?

414
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,119
What else could it be?

415
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
They have been crying nonstop.

416
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,680
Don't worry.

417
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
We're figuring something out.

418
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,439
Everything will be all right.

419
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,199
Did you know

420
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,880
that Zhao Xiaoqian and my
departure from the city

421
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,079
was a set-up?

422
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,800
If it was a set-up,

423
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,319
I'll not be able to escape this.

424
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,199
A set-up?

425
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,439
Who did this?

426
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,599
Shen Yan?

427
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,199
Hurry up.

428
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,359
Hurry up.

429
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,280
Hanchen.

430
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,000
Where have you been last night?

431
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,040
You were nowhere to be seen.

432
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,119
Where have you been?

433
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,280
By the way,

434
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
my mother told me that

435
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
last night, Xie Xiaoman's father

436
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
requested a troop from the censorate.

437
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,000
Could the both of you...

438
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,400
A woman's reputation is at stake.

439
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
Quit joking around.

440
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,880
Hongsu.

441
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,680
You're dismissed.

442
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,400
Was Shen Yan the culprit?

443
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Xu Shu is terrible.

444
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,959
Lock him up with
the prisoners on death row

445
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,800
for a couple of days.

446
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,040
Wait.

447
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,959
Prisoners on death row?

448
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
The prison contains
dangerous criminals.

449
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,680
If you force Xu Shu into his demise,

450
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,079
Shen Yan

451
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,560
would never let this go.

452
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,640
Never let this go?

453
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,359
Let's see who's more powerful between

454
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,599
Marquess Shen and
I, the Commandery Prince of Julu.

455
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Just act according to my orders.

456
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,880
Watch Shen Yan closely.

457
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Release a warrant.

458
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,199
I'm going to finish him.

459
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,439
Hanchen.

460
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,199
Shen Yan is just there.

461
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,079
We're ready to move any time.

462
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,280
Right now,

463
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,239
the capital will be informed
of this matter soon.

464
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,160
Both the guests of the mansion

465
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:00,880
will not allow

466
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,239
you to remain at Wujiang Prefecture.

467
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,160
Hold on.

468
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
What's going on?

469
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,760
Let me get this straight.

470
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,000
Last night,

471
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,079
you and Xie Xiaoman
spent the night out there.

472
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,040
Shen Yan and Xu Shu
were the culprits.

473
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,680
If this reaches the capital...

474
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,160
What else is there to think about?

475
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,719
Shen Yan created this mess

476
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
clearly to destroy

477
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,439
the engagement between
Shen Zhaowen and I.

478
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:22,400
However, he has no idea

479
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,359
how much

480
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,880
my parents value this union.

481
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,000
Once this matter reaches the capital,

482
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
they will not annul the engagement,

483
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,280
instead they'd bring
the marriage forward.

484
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,199
Shen family is a noble family

485
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,319
that prioritises traditions.

486
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,839
Shen Yan attempted

487
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,640
to make Xiaoman and Hanchen
spend the night together

488
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,839
in order to destroy
Hanchen's reputation.

489
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,359
Shen Zhaowen is the niece
of Noble Consort Cao.

490
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,359
In the harem,

491
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,800
this will not be allowed.

492
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
The marriage will be annulled.

493
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:50,839
However,

494
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,719
they have no idea that

495
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,400
Prince Pu and Princess Consort Pu

496
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,520
would opt to destroy
Xiaoman's reputation instead.

497
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,439
Regardless if she has to bear

498
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,880
the crime of seducing Hanchen,

499
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,479
they'd do anything to
clear Hanchen's name

500
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
and force him to apologise

501
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,920
to marry Shen Zhaowen.

502
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,239
Why would they do so?

503
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,319
I have yet to settle down
at Wujiang Prefecture

504
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,760
and they are urging me
to return to the capital.

505
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,239
The imperial court is
undergoing drastic changes.

506
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
As Shen Family is an important
relative of the royal family,

507
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,680
they will be entrusted great tasks.

508
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,400
My father is clearly trying
to leech off their authority.

509
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,319
He should consider my identity.

510
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,640
If I returned,

511
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,880
all of them would be cautious of me.

512
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,680
It will only repeat the same outcome.

513
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,880
Hanchen,

514
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,040
you mustn't return.

515
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
I'll not leave.

516
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,760
Let's beat him at his own game

517
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,439
and take this to the next level.

518
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,560
Let's fulfill what Shen Yan wants

519
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,959
and make Xiaoman your concubine.

520
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,119
Do you even know what
you're talking about?

521
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,880
Of course I do.

522
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,079
We're taking advantage
of the precarious situation.

523
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,359
If we do not do so,

524
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,760
Xie Xiaoman will be implicated by

525
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Prince Pu and Princess Consort Pu.

526
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,479
The best solution right now

527
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,439
is for all of you to
be on the same side.

528
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,920
I beg for your permission,
Your Highness.

529
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,760
Let me think about it.

530
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,479
Hanchen?

531
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
How could you allow Xie Xiaoman

532
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,760
to marry Hanchen?

533
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
How could you even think of that?

534
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,479
Xingzhou.

535
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,760
What's happening?

536
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,800
His Highness is enraged again?

537
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,000
Mr. Liangji.

538
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:40,959
From the warehouse,

539
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,280
select some premium goods

540
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,319
and endowment to propose
to the Su family

541
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:45,839
and examine their intentions.

542
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,599
Enter right from the front gate.

543
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,680
There's no need to evade the crowd.

544
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,439
Wait.

545
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,760
What's going on?

546
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,959
Why would we suggest a proposal?

547
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,760
Is

548
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,520
His Highness aware of this?

549
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:56,959
Yes.

550
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,319
Don't worry.

551
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,560
Go ahead and do it openly.

552
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,880
I'll bear the consequences.

553
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,520
Well...

554
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,239
Mr. Liangji.

555
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,400
Like I said,

556
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,119
if anything happens,
I'll bear the consequences.

557
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,680
How is Xiaoman doing?

558
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,199
I'm not sure.

559
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,400
Lady Xie will not let me in.

560
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,719
I supposed she had something to eat.

561
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,479
Lady Su is keeping her company.

562
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,439
For the lady's coming of age ceremony,

563
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,439
the required manteau

564
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,680
is embroidered and ready.

565
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,880
Why did this occur?

566
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,000
For something like that to happen,

567
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,880
her reputation is gone.

568
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,479
What's the point of holding
the coming of age ceremony?

569
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,479
Don't worry.

570
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,119
This matter hasn't been concluded.

571
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,000
Besides,

572
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,560
the righteous has nothing to fear.

573
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,560
The public opinions do not matter.

574
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,599
Bad news, master!

575
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,680
Master. Madam.

576
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,319
Commandery Prince of Julu's Mansion
sent some people here.

577
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,439
They also brought along many gifts.

578
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,680
It seems like

579
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,079
he has plans to marry Lady Xie.

580
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,479
Hurry up and cast them out.

581
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,040
They brought Prince Pu's plaque.

582
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,000
We can't cast them out.

583
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,599
It's bad to get into a fight as well.

584
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,040
Xie!

585
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,439
This is bad!

586
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,239
The Commandery Prince of Julu's Mansion
sent someone here!

587
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,719
Why are they here?

588
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,280
They want Lady Xie to marry into
their family as a concubine.

589
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,319
Xiaoman.

590
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,479
- Xie!
- What are you doing?

591
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,040
Calm down!

592
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,599
Xie!

593
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,160
Xie!

594
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,000
Do not get rough!

595
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,000
Xie!

596
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,599
Xie.

597
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,920
Let's just talk things out!

598
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,439
Let's avoid conflict at all cost!

599
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's just talk it out!

600
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
We're merchants of integrity!

601
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,439
Merchants of integrity!

602
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,319
There's nothing to talk about.

603
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,680
Forget it!

604
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,040
No matter how wealthy
or affluent you are,

605
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,280
we are not enticed.

606
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,119
Return and deliver this message to
the Commandery Prince of Julu.

607
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,640
Xiaoman is clear

608
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,160
and pure.

609
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,959
In the days to come,

610
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,640
she shall marry into
a family as the first wife.

611
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Trying to make her your concubine?

612
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,400
In your dreams!

613
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,400
Get out of here!

614
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:23,760
Xie!

615
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,839
Dear, calm down!

616
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,199
Stop it!

617
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,520
What are you doing?

618
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,280
Xie,

619
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,560
they are the Commandery Prince
of Julu's subordinates.

620
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,359
If you continue on this way,

621
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,199
I'm turning my back against you.

622
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,479
Our daughter, Xiaoman,

623
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,040
is different from the ladies

624
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,319
of other families.

625
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
She has always been considerate.

626
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,800
She has never been able
to enjoy life under my care.

627
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,239
She suffers all her life.

628
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,199
She was cast out from
Xie family with me.

629
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,040
She lived with me at the countryside.

630
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,199
She grew up taking care of her

631
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,359
brothers.

632
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,800
She has to take care of
her mother and me as well.

633
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,400
I can't find a single fault in her.

634
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,160
She's considerate and brilliant.

635
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,319
If she didn't have a father
as useless as me...

636
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:11,959
Xiaoman.

637
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm not a civil official.

638
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,199
Otherwise, you have
no position to speak here!

639
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,800
Father.

640
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:17,880
Father.

641
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,239
Xiaoman.

642
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,359
Don't be afraid.

643
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,760
I'm here.

644
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,359
I've said what I needed to.

645
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,079
Our daughter, Xiaoman...

646
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,680
Xiaoman

647
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,000
will not marry into a family
as a concubine.

648
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,160
We've done nothing

649
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,520
against our conscience

650
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,520
or morality.

651
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,239
The coming of age ceremony
shall proceed as planned.

652
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,119
Unfortunately,
Commandery Prince is an outsider.

653
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:08,880
We shall spare the invitation.

654
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,920
Sir,

655
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,000
please return.

656
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:16,839
Uncle Ji.

657
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,520
Let's go.

658
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:19,880
Madam.

659
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,400
Leave.

660
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,839
Lady Xiaoman,

661
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,920
stand upright.

662
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,560
At this moment,

663
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,199
you must stand up for yourself.

664
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,880
The coming of age ceremony
shall proceed as planned.

665
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,479
Our lady

666
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
will not be berated this way.

667
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,160
All right.

668
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,400
Get back to work.

669
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,079
Yes.

670
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,560
I understand.

671
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,719
I didn't expect

672
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,959
this would bother you.

673
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,280
I...

674
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,560
I've committed a grave mistake.

675
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,079
I've thought it through.

676
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,599
After Xiaoman's coming of age ceremony,

677
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,199
her mother shall take her back

678
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,400
to Yuyangli Village until
the incident subsides.

679
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,640
Don't worry.

680
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,479
I've lived a long time.

681
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
I've seen everything.

682
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,199
About Xiaoman's incident,

683
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,319
there's no need to worry.

684
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
At this point,

685
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,400
we should stand upright.

686
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,040
Show them

687
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,439
that Xiaoman

688
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,079
isn't the type to curry
the favour of the influential.

689
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,760
It's good for you to return home
until the commotion subsides.

690
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,040
Once everything is over,
bring the child back.

691
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,479
All right,

692
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,359
madam.

693
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,319
Are you really going
to return to Yuyangli Village?

694
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
Although it's necessary to return,

695
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,800
madam is right.

696
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,920
At this point,

697
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,040
we must stand upright.

698
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,839
I gave it some thoughts.

699
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:28,760
In a few days,

700
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,199
I shall join you to attend class.

701
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,560
Well,

702
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,000
will you still attend classes?

703
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,119
Xue Yanwan and the rest of them

704
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:37,880
will slander you.

705
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm not afraid.

706
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,680
Let's seek Congwen

707
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,479
for his help.

708
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:49,839
Did you know?

709
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,760
That day back at Sizhao Pavilion,

710
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,439
Shen Yan said he saw

711
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,400
Zhao Xiaoqian and Yan Boyang
at Chunyi Boat.

712
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,199
He told me to search
for them at the boat.

713
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,560
He's lying.

714
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm returning to Yuyangli Village.

715
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,439
Congwen has been taking care of me.

716
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,800
Regardless,

717
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,120
I should bid him farewell properly.

718
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,679
How about this?

719
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,800
I'll write a letter

720
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,159
and have it delivered to Congwen.

721
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,280
I'll request for him

722
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,439
to try his best to
meet you at the academy.

723
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,080
Don't worry.

724
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,800
No matter what happens,

725
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,199
I'm on your side.

726
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,860
(Five days later)

727
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,000
Your Highness.

728
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,520
There's a letter from Hongsu.

729
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,300
(To Princess Consort)

730
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,900
(Princess Consort, prince is ready to
get Xiaoman as his concubine)

731
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,560
How absurd.

732
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:18,159
He plans to marry a concubine
before receiving the first wife.

733
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,239
He should consider

734
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,719
how much effort we placed into

735
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,639
promoting the intermarriage
with Shen Family.

736
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Look at him.

737
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,639
In the capital,

738
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,040
everyone knows how important
traditions are for Shen Family.

739
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,800
If he marries a concubine,

740
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,199
the marriage will be annulled.

741
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,239
In my opinion,

742
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,959
I'm afraid the Commandery Prince has

743
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,479
stayed at Wujiang Prefecture
for a long time.

744
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:42,959
His Highness has turned unruly.

745
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,040
Zhu Momo.

746
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,919
Yes, Your Highness.

747
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,479
Make a trip.

748
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:52,000
Eliminate Lady Xie?

749
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,399
She's nothing but a lady who's
trying to fawn over power.

750
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,520
There's nothing to worry about.

751
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,679
I want you

752
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,479
to bring Hanchen home.

753
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
What happens if

754
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,520
His Highness already
marries the wench?

755
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,879
It doesn't matter.

756
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,280
We will just cast her out.

757
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes, Your Highness.

758
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,199
Are you certain

759
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,199
that Congwen will be
at the academy today?

760
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,280
Yes.

761
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,719
I sent my servant to
pass him the message.

762
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,679
Besides, Congwen treats you well.

763
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,679
I'm sure he will show up.

764
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:37,040
Look.

765
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,879
If Congwen is willing to
speak up on your behalf,

766
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,719
perhaps, there's no need
for you to return to Yuyangli Village.

767
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,280
I thought

768
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,959
they'd engage in the gossip.

769
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,399
It seems like people here
are educated scholars,

770
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,760
and they will not engage
in pointless slander.

771
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,159
They are educated scholars?

772
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,760
I think

773
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,080
Zhao Xiaoqian might have said...

774
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,719
Do not bring him up.

775
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,919
What a disgrace to the family.

776
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,080
What did you say?

777
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,560
Minggu.

778
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,639
I need to talk to you.

779
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,760
What were you thinking?

780
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,239
There's no need to concern
yourself, Your Highness.

781
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,040
In a few days,

782
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,080
I'll be leaving Wujiang Prefecture.

783
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,639
Just pretend that I never existed.

784
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,600
Forget about me.

785
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,280
I can't!

786
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,639
Things I'm supposed to or
not supposed to remember,

787
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,479
I remember it all.

788
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,439
I'll never forget you,

789
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,080
but I do not want to force you.

790
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,679
That's why I'm asking you one last time.

791
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,679
Will you

792
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:21,919
marry me?

793
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,639
Dream on.

794
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,080
What did she say?

795
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,000
What's on your mind?

796
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,159
I don't want to force her into this.

797
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,080
If you do not make the decision,

798
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,719
your family in the capital
will force you into it.

799
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,040
Are you done?

800
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,760
What difference does it make
if I made Xie Xiaoman my concubine?

801
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,239
What will you gain from this?

802
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,280
I'm afraid you're unaware that

803
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
in a few days, someone from
the capital would drop by.

804
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,439
Your Highness will be
dragged back to the capital

805
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,239
and live by the mercy of others.

806
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,639
I'm gambling

807
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,199
my future on you.

808
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,000
Of course I'd be concerned.

809
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,679
Xingzhou.

810
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:25,560
Hanchen.

811
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,600
Hanchen.

812
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:27,760
Hanchen.

813
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,879
How could you speak to Hanchen that way?

814
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,760
Why are you forcing him to
make Xiaoman his concubine?

815
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,000
Prince Pu and Princess Consort Pu

816
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,919
are planning to use Hanchen

817
00:39:44,919 --> 00:39:46,439
as a puppet in the imperial court.

818
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,040
Hanchen was once the adopted son
of the Emperor.

819
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,040
If he returns to the capital

820
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,399
and marries the daughter
of Shen Family,

821
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,000
do you think he will be able to

822
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,199
live a peaceful life?

823
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,199
By then, he will become

824
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,639
a pest in the eyes of others.

825
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,639
I served as his assistant
since I was young.

826
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,479
I naturally hope the best for him.

827
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:09,439
It's of my own will.

828
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,080
I must help him.

829
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,520
Xie Xiaoman refuses to marry him.

830
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,760
Shen Yan will not give up either.

831
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:15,879
Once Shen Yan moves,

832
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,239
Xie family will make a move as well.

833
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,879
Seal Su Chang Ji for me.

834
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,560
Go inside on your own.

835
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:38,760
I'll wait for you by the entrance.

836
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,560
Hello, fellow scholars.

837
00:40:58,399 --> 00:40:59,600
Why are you here instead of

838
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,639
studying at the academy?

839
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm here for Congwen.

840
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,280
I would like to consult him

841
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,439
about my studies.

842
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,520
I wonder if he's available.

843
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,280
Li Su?

844
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,479
He was on leave and
left for Tongzhou some time ago.

845
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:12,520
What's the matter?

846
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:15,639
Nothing.

847
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,520
I shall take my leave.

848
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:27,760
How did it go?

849
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,760
Did you manage to meet him?

850
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,120
Sister!

851
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,239
Sister!

852
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,280
What's wrong?

853
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,639
Father was arrested by the magistrate.

854
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,879
