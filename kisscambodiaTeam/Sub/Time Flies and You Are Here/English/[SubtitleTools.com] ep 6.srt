21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
What do you think, Mr. Yan?

22
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,199
You lost all five rounds.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,959
Are you still playing?

24
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:56,760
Sure.

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,919
Why not?

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,879
I have yet to win back the money I lost.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,279
It seems like

28
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,199
you have nothing else to offer to me.

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,519
That's not true.

30
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,080
I have plenty of money.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,239
Here.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
(Zhong)
I'll place this as my bet.

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,080
Is this yours?

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,600
How can you bet this?

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
Mind your own business.

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,080
Are you going to make a move or not?

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,520
No.

38
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,960
This is Zhong Ziyan's moneybag.

39
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,520
How could you place
Zhong Ziyan's moneybag as bet?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,600
Give it to me.

41
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,399
No.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,199
Give it to me.

43
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,119
No.

44
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,039
That's enough.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Mr. Yan.

46
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,160
The lady is right.

47
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,080
Gambling with someone else's money

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,360
is inappropriate.

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,880
What do you suggest?

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,240
How about this?

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,839
Whoever loses this round

52
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,320
shall remove their clothes

53
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,839
and swim a lap across the lake.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,559
What do you think?

55
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,600
- Across the lake!
- Across the lake!

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
Fine. Come at me.

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,199
Okay.

58
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,279
Yan Boyang,

59
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,199
let's just head home.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,479
Leave me alone.

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Hurry up and make a move.

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,000
Quit rushing me.

63
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,199
Hurry up.

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,759
Come on. Make a move.

65
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,320
What are you doing?

66
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,199
Stop looking at me.
Look at the chess board instead.

67
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,000
Come with me.

68
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,759
Are you done?

69
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,399
Head of Nencao Hall.

70
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,320
Are you done writing?

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,800
Yes.

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,279
There you go.

73
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,199
Why are you in a daze?

74
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:35,880
Move out of the way.

75
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,880
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,119
What happened?

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,880
Nothing.

78
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:52,639
Do you know

79
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,080
why she'd participate in
Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition?

80
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,279
To win the fan.

81
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,000
Who is she doing it for?

82
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,360
She's not doing it for you anyway.

83
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,720
What do you mean?

84
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,119
What do you know?

85
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know.

86
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,360
It's just a guess.

87
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,240
Hanchen.

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Both of you are not meant
for each other.

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,880
Even if you make her a concubine,

90
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:21,960
it's still inappropriate.

91
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
Who is she trying to win the fan for?

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,279
Li Su.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,399
I did not expect this,

94
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,119
but

95
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,399
how would you know what
is she going to do

96
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,519
after acquiring the fan?

97
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,640
Perhaps, it's not what you imagined.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,839
It's uncertain.

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,839
This is for you

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,440
without charge.

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,839
Ask anything you want.

102
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,040
Stop moving out

103
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,880
and moving back in.

104
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,799
I'm not exactly young anymore.

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
I can't handle the trouble.

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,559
This is the last move.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,160
I won!

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,079
I won!

109
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,160
I won!

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
I won!

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,279
It's the lady by his side

112
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:36,839
who gave him ideas.

113
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,839
I saw it all.

114
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,200
What are you going to do?

115
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,640
Are you jumping into the lake?

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,559
Me?

117
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,160
You should jump into the lake instead.

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Mr. Yan.

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
Zhao Xiaoqian protects you normally.

120
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,359
I'll not say anything about that.

121
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
For today's chess game,

122
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,119
you need to rely on a mere lady
in order to win.

123
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,279
What should we do?

124
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,480
Strip him.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,920
Throw him into the lake.

126
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

127
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,480
How dare you?

128
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,239
Mr. Yan.

129
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
A man

130
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,359
needs to be protected by a lady?

131
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,920
What's going on?

132
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Shut that foul mouth of yours.

133
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,839
I'm telling you.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,440
Stop regarding yourself highly.

135
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,839
Whoever lays a finger on Yan Boyang,

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not going to go easy on you.

137
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,480
Lady,

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
what are you going to do?

139
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:20,920
You...

140
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,040
I...

141
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,359
Try laying a finger on her.

142
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:29,720
Attack.

143
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
I would like to see you try.

144
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm not afraid of you.

145
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,760
What are you doing here?

146
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,440
Your grandfather is here

147
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
to beat you up.

148
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,320
You came right on time.

149
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,160
The three of us brothers

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,359
have not fought
together in a long time.

151
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Come on.

152
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,239
How dare you harass others?

153
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,320
Do you understand?

154
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,720
Stop fighting.

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,200
Do you know who I am?

156
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,760
Stop fighting.

157
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,559
Stop fighting.

158
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,200
Stop it!

159
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:28,720
Sir Han.

160
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,959
You're all sons of prestigious
families of the capital.

161
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,839
How could you behave this way?

162
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,000
Good-for-nothing fops

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,399
will achieve nothing in the future.

164
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,440
By all of your behaviour tonight,

165
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,559
how could you call yourself
pillars of the future?

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,239
Where are the servants?

167
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,399
Where are they?

168
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,760
How dare they allow their
masters to behave recklessly?

169
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:50,760
Where are they?

170
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,000
Sir Han.

171
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,000
Shut up.

172
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,320
Xiaoman.

173
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm the assistant of
Commandery Prince of Julu.

174
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,239
I failed to watch him.

175
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
I deserve to be punished.

176
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,000
Xiaoman.

177
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,480
It's not her fault.

178
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,519
Where's your assistant?

179
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Sir Han.

180
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,799
If the master makes a mistake,

181
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,720
the servants should be reprimanded.

182
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,119
What is

183
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,599
a befitting punishment?

184
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,039
Should all of them be flogged?

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,919
Sir Han.

186
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,599
Since both parties are at fault,

187
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,880
let's all compromise

188
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:50,919
and reduce the commotion.

189
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Both assistants shall drink three cups
of wine on behalf of their masters.

190
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,559
This incident shall pass.

191
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,840
Today is Teacher Liu's
Poetry Competition.

192
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,640
There are still matters to attend to.

193
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,760
Please do not allow this
to affect your health, Sir Han.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,159
I shall be punished
on behalf of master.

195
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,960
I beg for your forgiveness, Sir Han.

196
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,280
Although His Highness is stubborn,

197
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,000
he's a man of integrity.

198
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,440
He's caught up in the moment.

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,599
I seek your understanding, Sir Han.

200
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,760
I think

201
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,880
this matter should end here.

202
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,320
No one should bring this up ever again.

203
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,520
Listen up, both of you brats.

204
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,520
If you misbehave before me once again,

205
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,200
as your elder,

206
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,840
I'm going to submit
the appeal to the capital.

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,640
What are you staring at?

208
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
Are you not satisfied?

209
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,080
Xiaoman, are you all right?

210
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,280
Boyang.

211
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:38,960
Congwen.

212
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,359
Calm down.

213
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:39,840
That's enough.

214
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm just a troublemaker.

215
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,119
I've caused you much trouble.

216
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,599
It will not happen again.

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,000
Xiaoman, what's wrong?

218
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,880
Did you hear something?

219
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,280
Xiaoman.

220
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
You failed

221
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
the task I entrusted you to.

222
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
Master,

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,359
it's not entirely my fault.

224
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,000
Should I

225
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,159
finish up on the task right now?

226
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,359
I want to go home.

227
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,119
I want to go home.

228
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,479
I want to go home.

229
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,520
I want to go home.

230
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
All right. I know.

231
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,599
The carriage is ready.

232
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,400
I want to go home.

233
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,280
I'm dropping you home right now.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,559
Ziyan.

235
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I want to go home.

236
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,359
Stay here and acquire the fan.

237
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,280
I shall send her home first.

238
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,640
Don't worry.

239
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,400
Come on. Let's go home.

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,559
I want to go home.

241
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,000
I want to go home.

242
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,000
Hanchen.

243
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,880
I want to go home.

244
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,200
What happened today was my fault.

245
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,359
I want to go home.

246
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,239
I'm not feeling well.

247
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,479
All right. We're almost home.

248
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,520
I feel uncomfortable.

249
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,980
(Qingtai Gate)

250
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,159
I want to go home.

251
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,200
Mother.

252
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,919
I want to go home.

253
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,559
What happened?

254
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:54,760
Xu Shu!

255
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,919
Your Highness,

256
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,760
don't blame me.

257
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,559
It's your fault for insisting on
marrying the daughter of Shen Family.

258
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,200
Young Master Shen ordered me to do so.

259
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,559
I'll do anything you say in the future

260
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,520
in order to atone for my mistakes.

261
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,119
You...

262
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,640
I don't want to get married.

263
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,559
I don't want to get married.

264
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,799
Mother.

265
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,280
I don't want to get married.

266
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,760
All right. I promise you.

267
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:16,960
I object.

268
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,919
Nobody is allowed to marry you off.

269
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,559
All right?

270
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,599
Have a seat here.

271
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,479
I don't feel good.

272
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,719
I don't want to get married.

273
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,880
I've become a female attendant.

274
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,799
No one would marry me.

275
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,520
Who said so?

276
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,479
Who said no one would marry you?

277
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll break their legs.

278
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,880
Nobody would be willing to marry me.

279
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,520
Who's going to marry me?

280
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,599
Who's going to marry me?

281
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,239
Who's going to marry me?

282
00:13:59,239 --> 00:13:59,719
Me.

283
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,320
Really?

284
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,599
Zhao Xiaoqian and his female attendant

285
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,039
are still in the carriage.

286
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,359
Master.

287
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,119
Running back here

288
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,559
took four hours.

289
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,359
Not to mention, Commandery Prince

290
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,919
is stuck with a drunk brat.

291
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:32,799
Tonight,

292
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,960
he will not be able to return.

293
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,000
Not bad.

294
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Release the news tomorrow

295
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,479
that the Commandery Prince of Julu,
Zhao Xiaoqian,

296
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,080
is getting a concubine.

297
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,400
All right.

298
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:54,960
Minggu,

299
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,000
think carefully.

300
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,880
Where else could Xiaoman go?

301
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,400
I have no idea.

302
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,880
His Highness said he'd send her home.

303
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,119
However, the both of them went missing.

304
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,599
My child.

305
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,359
All right.

306
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:14,679
Here. Have a seat.

307
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,440
Have a seat.

308
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,280
She will not be able to get married.

309
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,239
Do not panic.

310
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,119
We don't know the details yet.

311
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't panic.

312
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,960
Calm down.

313
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,679
We don't know what's going on.

314
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:28,400
Where are you going?

315
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,080
Request for troops from the censorate

316
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,919
to search for my daughter!

317
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,799
Calm down.

318
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,080
Find her!

319
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,799
No mistakes allowed!

320
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,760
We must find His Highness.

321
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,039
Yes!

322
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,359
Move it!

323
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,119
Check that spot!

324
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,000
Over there!

325
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,520
There are news.

326
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,359
The guards mentioned that last night,

327
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
Commandery Prince's carriage left the city

328
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,159
and has yet to return.

329
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,239
Official Xie

330
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,919
should be searching for them
on the opposite street.

331
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,280
Inform him about this.

332
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,799
Remember.

333
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,159
Do not let anyone hear this.

334
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,159
Yes.

335
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,440
Someone's coming.

336
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,799
Someone's coming.

337
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,520
Mr. Zhong,

338
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,559
isn't that Xiaoman?

339
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,840
Why did the carriage stop?

340
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,760
Hurry up.

341
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,719
This is the Commandery Prince
of Julu's carriage.

342
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:12,680
Commandery Prince?

343
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
My father has come to our aid.

344
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,439
Get in.

345
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,439
Get in.

346
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,239
I'll check the situation out.

347
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,280
Xiaoman is going to stay
hidden in the carriage.

348
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,119
Do not disclose this, Official Xie.

349
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,719
All right.

350
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,800
Get off when
no one is around.

351
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,280
We mustn't allow anyone to see this.

352
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,359
Don't worry.

353
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm here.

354
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,920
What a mess.

355
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,800
What a mess.

356
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,280
(Main Hall)

357
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,040
I don't know if the child

358
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,839
was found.

359
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,520
Don't worry.

360
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,119
They will be home soon.

361
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,319
Look, there they are.

362
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,359
How did things go?

363
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,000
How did things go?

364
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,040
Have a seat and some water.

365
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:23,920
Here.

366
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:24,880
Have a seat.

367
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,079
Say something.

368
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,439
It's all over.

369
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,199
Xiaoman is already home.

370
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,680
She's in her room now.

371
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,280
The rest...

372
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,280
Spill it.

373
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:43,880
Say something.

374
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,119
According to the members
of Commandery Prince of Julu Mansion,

375
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,199
it was probably a set-up.

376
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,680
Last night...

377
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,599
Last night,

378
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,560
both of them

379
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,800
spent the night together
in the carriage.

380
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,439
What?

381
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,040
Both of them spent
the night in the carriage?

382
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,920
Nothing happened.

383
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,160
Our daughter still holds her reputation.

384
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,199
Well...

385
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,040
Last night,

386
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:16,280
the carriage stopped by
at the back gate,

387
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,199
but it left the city last night.

388
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,400
It returned this morning.

389
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,560
Many citizens of the city
witnessed this.

390
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,839
I'm not sure who spread the news.

391
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,599
They claim that Xiaoman is
the woman in the carriage.

392
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,640
Well...

393
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,520
If this matter spreads,

394
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
my daughter

395
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,319
will not be able to get married.

396
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,599
Lady Xie, open up.

397
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm here to deliver
some rice balls over.

398
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:58,920
Xiaoman.

399
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,839
Open up.

400
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,680
You need to eat something regardless.

401
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,079
I made you rice balls personally.

402
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,439
It's going to turn soggy.

403
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,319
Xiaoman.

404
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,760
Xiaoman.

405
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,079
Come in.

406
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Have something to eat.

407
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,520
There you go.

408
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,560
Xiaoman.

409
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,040
Eat some of these.

410
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,160
Look. It smells good.

411
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
I made them myself.

412
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
It's osmanthus filling.

413
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,439
How are my parents doing?

414
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,119
What else could it be?

415
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
They have been crying nonstop.

416
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,680
Don't worry.

417
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
We're figuring something out.

418
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,439
Everything will be all right.

419
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,199
Did you know

420
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,880
that Zhao Xiaoqian and my
departure from the city

421
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,079
was a set-up?

422
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,800
If it was a set-up,

423
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,319
I'll not be able to escape this.

424
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,199
A set-up?

425
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,439
Who did this?

426
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,599
Shen Yan?

427
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,199
Hurry up.

428
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,359
Hurry up.

429
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,280
Hanchen.

430
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,000
Where have you been last night?

431
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,040
You were nowhere to be seen.

432
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,119
Where have you been?

433
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,280
By the way,

434
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,800
my mother told me that

435
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,400
last night, Xie Xiaoman's father

436
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
requested a troop from the censorate.

437
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,000
Could the both of you...

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
A woman's reputation is at stake.

439
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,040
Quit joking around.

440
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,880
Hongsu.

441
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,680
You're dismissed.

442
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Was Shen Yan the culprit?

443
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Xu Shu is terrible.

444
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,959
Lock him up with
the prisoners on death row

445
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,800
for a couple of days.

446
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,040
Wait.

447
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,959
Prisoners on death row?

448
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,000
The prison contains
dangerous criminals.

449
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,680
If you force Xu Shu into his demise,

450
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,079
Shen Yan

451
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,560
would never let this go.

452
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,640
Never let this go?

453
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,359
Let's see who's more powerful between

454
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,599
Marquess Shen and
I, the Commandery Prince of Julu.

455
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Just act according to my orders.

456
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,880
Watch Shen Yan closely.

457
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Release a warrant.

458
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,199
I'm going to finish him.

459
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,439
Hanchen.

460
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,199
Shen Yan is just there.

461
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,079
We're ready to move any time.

462
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,280
Right now,

463
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,239
the capital will be informed
of this matter soon.

464
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,160
Both the guests of the mansion

465
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:06,880
will not allow

466
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,239
you to remain at Wujiang Prefecture.

467
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,160
Hold on.

468
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
What's going on?

469
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,760
Let me get this straight.

470
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,000
Last night,

471
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,079
you and Xie Xiaoman
spent the night out there.

472
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,040
Shen Yan and Xu Shu
were the culprits.

473
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,680
If this reaches the capital...

474
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,160
What else is there to think about?

475
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,719
Shen Yan created this mess

476
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
clearly to destroy

477
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,439
the engagement between
Shen Zhaowen and I.

478
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,400
However, he has no idea

479
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,359
how much

480
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,880
my parents value this union.

481
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,000
Once this matter reaches the capital,

482
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,280
they will not annul the engagement,

483
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,280
instead they'd bring
the marriage forward.

484
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,199
Shen family is a noble family

485
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,319
that prioritises traditions.

486
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,839
Shen Yan attempted

487
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,640
to make Xiaoman and Hanchen
spend the night together

488
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,839
in order to destroy
Hanchen's reputation.

489
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,359
Shen Zhaowen is the niece
of Noble Consort Cao.

490
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,359
In the harem,

491
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,800
this will not be allowed.

492
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,800
The marriage will be annulled.

493
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:56,839
However,

494
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,719
they have no idea that

495
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
Prince Pu and Princess Consort Pu

496
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,520
would opt to destroy
Xiaoman's reputation instead.

497
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,439
Regardless if she has to bear

498
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,880
the crime of seducing Hanchen,

499
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,479
they'd do anything to
clear Hanchen's name

500
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
and force him to apologise

501
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,920
to marry Shen Zhaowen.

502
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,239
Why would they do so?

503
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,319
I have yet to settle down
at Wujiang Prefecture

504
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,760
and they are urging me
to return to the capital.

505
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,239
The imperial court is
undergoing drastic changes.

506
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,640
As Shen Family is an important
relative of the royal family,

507
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,680
they will be entrusted great tasks.

508
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,400
My father is clearly trying
to leech off their authority.

509
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,319
He should consider my identity.

510
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,640
If I returned,

511
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,880
all of them would be cautious of me.

512
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,680
It will only repeat the same outcome.

513
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Hanchen,

514
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,040
you mustn't return.

515
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,400
I'll not leave.

516
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
Let's beat him at his own game

517
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,439
and take this to the next level.

518
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,560
Let's fulfill what Shen Yan wants

519
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,959
and make Xiaoman your concubine.

520
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,119
Do you even know what
you're talking about?

521
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:58,880
Of course I do.

522
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,079
We're taking advantage
of the precarious situation.

523
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,359
If we do not do so,

524
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,760
Xie Xiaoman will be implicated by

525
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,560
Prince Pu and Princess Consort Pu.

526
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,479
The best solution right now

527
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,439
is for all of you to
be on the same side.

528
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,920
I beg for your permission,
Your Highness.

529
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,760
Let me think about it.

530
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,479
Hanchen?

531
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
How could you allow Xie Xiaoman

532
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,760
to marry Hanchen?

533
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
How could you even think of that?

534
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,479
Xingzhou.

535
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,760
What's happening?

536
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,800
His Highness is enraged again?

537
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,000
Mr. Liangji.

538
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:46,959
From the warehouse,

539
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,280
select some premium goods

540
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,319
and endowment to propose
to the Su family

541
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,839
and examine their intentions.

542
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,599
Enter right from the front gate.

543
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,680
There's no need to evade the crowd.

544
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,439
Wait.

545
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,760
What's going on?

546
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,959
Why would we suggest a proposal?

547
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,760
Is

548
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,520
His Highness aware of this?

549
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:02,959
Yes.

550
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,319
Don't worry.

551
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,560
Go ahead and do it openly.

552
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,880
I'll bear the consequences.

553
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,520
Well...

554
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,239
Mr. Liangji.

555
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,400
Like I said,

556
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,119
if anything happens,
I'll bear the consequences.

557
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,680
How is Xiaoman doing?

558
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:37,199
I'm not sure.

559
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,400
Lady Xie will not let me in.

560
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,719
I supposed she had something to eat.

561
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,479
Lady Su is keeping her company.

562
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,439
For the lady's coming of age ceremony,

563
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:50,439
the required manteau

564
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,680
is embroidered and ready.

565
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,880
Why did this occur?

566
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,000
For something like that to happen,

567
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,880
her reputation is gone.

568
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,479
What's the point of holding
the coming of age ceremony?

569
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,479
Don't worry.

570
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,119
This matter hasn't been concluded.

571
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Besides,

572
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,560
the righteous has nothing to fear.

573
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,560
The public opinions do not matter.

574
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,599
Bad news, master!

575
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,680
Master. Madam.

576
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,319
Commandery Prince of Julu's Mansion
sent some people here.

577
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,439
They also brought along many gifts.

578
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,680
It seems like

579
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,079
he has plans to marry Lady Xie.

580
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,479
Hurry up and cast them out.

581
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,040
They brought Prince Pu's plaque.

582
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,000
We can't cast them out.

583
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,599
It's bad to get into a fight as well.

584
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,040
Xie!

585
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,439
This is bad!

586
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,239
The Commandery Prince of Julu's Mansion
sent someone here!

587
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,719
Why are they here?

588
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,280
They want Lady Xie to marry into
their family as a concubine.

589
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,319
Xiaoman.

590
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,479
- Xie!
- What are you doing?

591
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,040
Calm down!

592
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,599
Xie!

593
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,160
Xie!

594
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,000
Do not get rough!

595
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,000
Xie!

596
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,599
Xie.

597
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,920
Let's just talk things out!

598
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,439
Let's avoid conflict at all cost!

599
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,000
Let's just talk it out!

600
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,560
We're merchants of integrity!

601
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,439
Merchants of integrity!

602
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,319
There's nothing to talk about.

603
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,680
Forget it!

604
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,040
No matter how wealthy
or affluent you are,

605
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,280
we are not enticed.

606
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,119
Return and deliver this message to
the Commandery Prince of Julu.

607
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,640
Xiaoman is clear

608
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,160
and pure.

609
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,959
In the days to come,

610
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,640
she shall marry into
a family as the first wife.

611
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,800
Trying to make her your concubine?

612
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,400
In your dreams!

613
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,400
Get out of here!

614
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:29,760
Xie!

615
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,839
Dear, calm down!

616
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,199
Stop it!

617
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,520
What are you doing?

618
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,280
Xie,

619
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,560
they are the Commandery Prince
of Julu's subordinates.

620
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,359
If you continue on this way,

621
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,199
I'm turning my back against you.

622
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,479
Our daughter, Xiaoman,

623
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,040
is different from the ladies

624
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,319
of other families.

625
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
She has always been considerate.

626
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,800
She has never been able
to enjoy life under my care.

627
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,239
She suffers all her life.

628
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,199
She was cast out from
Xie family with me.

629
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,040
She lived with me at the countryside.

630
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,199
She grew up taking care of her

631
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,359
brothers.

632
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,800
She has to take care of
her mother and me as well.

633
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:10,400
I can't find a single fault in her.

634
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,160
She's considerate and brilliant.

635
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,319
If she didn't have a father
as useless as me...

636
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:17,959
Xiaoman.

637
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm not a civil official.

638
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,199
Otherwise, you have
no position to speak here!

639
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,800
Father.

640
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:23,880
Father.

641
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,239
Xiaoman.

642
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,359
Don't be afraid.

643
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm here.

644
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,359
I've said what I needed to.

645
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,079
Our daughter, Xiaoman...

646
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,680
Xiaoman

647
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,000
will not marry into a family
as a concubine.

648
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160
We've done nothing

649
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,520
against our conscience

650
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,520
or morality.

651
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:07,239
The coming of age ceremony
shall proceed as planned.

652
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,119
Unfortunately,
Commandery Prince is an outsider.

653
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,880
We shall spare the invitation.

654
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,920
Sir,

655
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,000
please return.

656
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:22,839
Uncle Ji.

657
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,520
Let's go.

658
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:25,880
Madam.

659
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,400
Leave.

660
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,839
Lady Xiaoman,

661
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:39,920
stand upright.

662
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,560
At this moment,

663
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,199
you must stand up for yourself.

664
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,880
The coming of age ceremony
shall proceed as planned.

665
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,479
Our lady

666
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
will not be berated this way.

667
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,160
All right.

668
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,400
Get back to work.

669
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,079
Yes.

670
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,560
I understand.

671
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,719
I didn't expect

672
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,959
this would bother you.

673
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,280
I...

674
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,560
I've committed a grave mistake.

675
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,079
I've thought it through.

676
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,599
After Xiaoman's coming of age ceremony,

677
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,199
her mother shall take her back

678
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:33,400
to Yuyangli Village until
the incident subsides.

679
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,640
Don't worry.

680
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,479
I've lived a long time.

681
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I've seen everything.

682
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,199
About Xiaoman's incident,

683
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:50,319
there's no need to worry.

684
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
At this point,

685
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,400
we should stand upright.

686
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:58,040
Show them

687
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,439
that Xiaoman

688
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,079
isn't the type to curry
the favour of the influential.

689
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:07,760
It's good for you to return home
until the commotion subsides.

690
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,040
Once everything is over,
bring the child back.

691
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,479
All right,

692
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,359
madam.

693
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,319
Are you really going
to return to Yuyangli Village?

694
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,640
Although it's necessary to return,

695
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,800
madam is right.

696
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,920
At this point,

697
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,040
we must stand upright.

698
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,839
I gave it some thoughts.

699
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:34,760
In a few days,

700
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,199
I shall join you to attend class.

701
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,560
Well,

702
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
will you still attend classes?

703
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,119
Xue Yanwan and the rest of them

704
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:43,880
will slander you.

705
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm not afraid.

706
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,680
Let's seek Congwen

707
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,479
for his help.

708
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:55,839
Did you know?

709
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:58,760
That day back at Sizhao Pavilion,

710
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,439
Shen Yan said he saw

711
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,400
Zhao Xiaoqian and Yan Boyang
at Chunyi Boat.

712
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,199
He told me to search
for them at the boat.

713
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,560
He's lying.

714
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm returning to Yuyangli Village.

715
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,439
Congwen has been taking care of me.

716
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
Regardless,

717
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:21,120
I should bid him farewell properly.

718
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,679
How about this?

719
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,800
I'll write a letter

720
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,159
and have it delivered to Congwen.

721
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,280
I'll request for him

722
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,439
to try his best to
meet you at the academy.

723
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,080
Don't worry.

724
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,800
No matter what happens,

725
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,199
I'm on your side.

726
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,860
(Five days later)

727
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,000
Your Highness.

728
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,520
There's a letter from Hongsu.

729
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,300
(To Princess Consort)

730
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,900
(Princess Consort, prince is ready to
get Xiaoman as his concubine)

731
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,560
How absurd.

732
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,159
He plans to marry a concubine
before receiving the first wife.

733
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,239
He should consider

734
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,719
how much effort we placed into

735
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,639
promoting the intermarriage
with Shen Family.

736
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Look at him.

737
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,639
In the capital,

738
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,040
everyone knows how important
traditions are for Shen Family.

739
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,800
If he marries a concubine,

740
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,199
the marriage will be annulled.

741
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,239
In my opinion,

742
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,959
I'm afraid the Commandery Prince has

743
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,479
stayed at Wujiang Prefecture
for a long time.

744
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,959
His Highness has turned unruly.

745
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,040
Zhu Momo.

746
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,919
Yes, Your Highness.

747
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,479
Make a trip.

748
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:58,000
Eliminate Lady Xie?

749
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,399
She's nothing but a lady who's
trying to fawn over power.

750
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,520
There's nothing to worry about.

751
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,679
I want you

752
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,479
to bring Hanchen home.

753
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
What happens if

754
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,520
His Highness already
marries the wench?

755
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,879
It doesn't matter.

756
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,280
We will just cast her out.

757
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Yes, Your Highness.

758
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,199
Are you certain

759
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,199
that Congwen will be
at the academy today?

760
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,280
Yes.

761
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,719
I sent my servant to
pass him the message.

762
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,679
Besides, Congwen treats you well.

763
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,679
I'm sure he will show up.

764
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:43,040
Look.

765
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,879
If Congwen is willing to
speak up on your behalf,

766
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,719
perhaps, there's no need
for you to return to Yuyangli Village.

767
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,280
I thought

768
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,959
they'd engage in the gossip.

769
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,399
It seems like people here
are educated scholars,

770
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,760
and they will not engage
in pointless slander.

771
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,159
They are educated scholars?

772
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,760
I think

773
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,080
Zhao Xiaoqian might have said...

774
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,719
Do not bring him up.

775
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,919
What a disgrace to the family.

776
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,080
What did you say?

777
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,560
Minggu.

778
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,639
I need to talk to you.

779
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,760
What were you thinking?

780
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,239
There's no need to concern
yourself, Your Highness.

781
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,040
In a few days,

782
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,080
I'll be leaving Wujiang Prefecture.

783
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,639
Just pretend that I never existed.

784
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:06,600
Forget about me.

785
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,280
I can't!

786
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,639
Things I'm supposed to or
not supposed to remember,

787
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,479
I remember it all.

788
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,439
I'll never forget you,

789
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,080
but I do not want to force you.

790
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,679
That's why I'm asking you one last time.

791
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,679
Will you

792
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:27,919
marry me?

793
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,639
Dream on.

794
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,080
What did she say?

795
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,000
What's on your mind?

796
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,159
I don't want to force her into this.

797
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,080
If you do not make the decision,

798
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,719
your family in the capital
will force you into it.

799
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,040
Are you done?

800
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
What difference does it make
if I made Xie Xiaoman my concubine?

801
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,239
What will you gain from this?

802
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,280
I'm afraid you're unaware that

803
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
in a few days, someone from
the capital would drop by.

804
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,439
Your Highness will be
dragged back to the capital

805
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:13,239
and live by the mercy of others.

806
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,639
I'm gambling

807
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,199
my future on you.

808
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,000
Of course I'd be concerned.

809
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,679
Xingzhou.

810
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:31,560
Hanchen.

811
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,600
Hanchen.

812
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:33,760
Hanchen.

813
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,879
How could you speak to Hanchen that way?

814
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,760
Why are you forcing him to
make Xiaoman his concubine?

815
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,000
Prince Pu and Princess Consort Pu

816
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,919
are planning to use Hanchen

817
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,439
as a puppet in the imperial court.

818
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,040
Hanchen was once the adopted son
of the Emperor.

819
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
If he returns to the capital

820
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,399
and marries the daughter
of Shen Family,

821
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,000
do you think he will be able to

822
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,199
live a peaceful life?

823
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,199
By then, he will become

824
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,639
a pest in the eyes of others.

825
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,639
I served as his assistant
since I was young.

826
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,479
I naturally hope the best for him.

827
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,439
It's of my own will.

828
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,080
I must help him.

829
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,520
Xie Xiaoman refuses to marry him.

830
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,760
Shen Yan will not give up either.

831
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:21,879
Once Shen Yan moves,

832
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,239
Xie family will make a move as well.

833
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,879
Seal Su Chang Ji for me.

834
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:43,560
Go inside on your own.

835
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:44,760
I'll wait for you by the entrance.

836
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,560
Hello, fellow scholars.

837
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,600
Why are you here instead of

838
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,639
studying at the academy?

839
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,280
I'm here for Congwen.

840
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,280
I would like to consult him

841
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,439
about my studies.

842
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,520
I wonder if he's available.

843
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,280
Li Su?

844
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,479
He was on leave and
left for Tongzhou some time ago.

845
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:18,520
What's the matter?

846
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:21,639
Nothing.

847
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,520
I shall take my leave.

848
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:33,760
How did it go?

849
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,760
Did you manage to meet him?

850
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,120
Sister!

851
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,239
Sister!

852
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,280
What's wrong?

853
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,639
Father was arrested by the magistrate.

854
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,879
What?

855
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,620
♪Ask the moon whether it has seen♪

856
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,700
♪The other end of the earth♪
