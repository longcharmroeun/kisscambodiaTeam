(The flowers and willows seen everywhere
should be able to empathize with me)

00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,700
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,080
Zhao Mao,

23
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,160
look!

24
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,630
What are these?

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,630
Let me tell you.

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,040
Xie Xiaoman gave these to me.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,040
Smell them.

28
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,040
This is the peach blossom shortbread.

29
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,720
It is said that
during the Cold Food Festival,

30
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,120
women give this kind of pastry to men

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,680
as a token of love.

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,880
Do you think she fancies me?

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,910
Is she after my family's property?

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,670
No. No.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,520
I am not the Crown Prince.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,630
What can she gain from me?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,720
What's more,

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,670
Xie Xiaoman is not that kind of person.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,270
Zhao Mao.

40
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,630
Spit it out.

41
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,110
I haven't eaten any of them yet.

42
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,440
You bad horse!

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,630
You left none to me.

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,830
Come over.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,880
Come over.

46
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,630
You, you are so bad.

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,270
Welcome to come again.

48
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,800
Come in, please.

49
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,390
Sir, take care.

50
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,320
Please come again.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,800
Mr. Li,

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,520
(Little Zhangtai)
nice to see you.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,520
Come in, please. Come in, please.

54
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,030
Take care.

55
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,720
OK. OK. OK.

56
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,160
Today is the Cold Food Festival.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
(Zhu Yu, pet name Yanniang)
I was wondering whether you would come.

58
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,600
But I still set time aside for you.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,830
I actually didn't harbor much hope.

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,670
Except the academy and my home,

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
in Wujiang Prefecture,

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,160
I have nowhere else to go.

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,160
You became Principal Yang's disciple

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,190
two years ago.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,960
Have you ever thought about

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,670
when to take the spring exam?

67
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,880
On such a festive day,
let's not talk about that.

68
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,030
I know you have a lofty character,
dislike the officialdom

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,160
and have no interest
in an official career.

70
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,800
But if you don't take the spring exam,

71
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,110
how could you

72
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,360
get me out of this place

73
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,190
being only a student of Yang Chidao?

74
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,030
I can help you out

75
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
even if I am not an official.

76
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,750
Yanniang,

77
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,360
don't worry.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,910
There will be other ways.

79
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,670
(Fragrant and Tender Beauty)

80
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,270
My lady.

81
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,910
Someone outside wants to see you.

82
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,920
Yanniang.

83
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,510
Yanniang.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,270
Congwen is still here.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,350
Don't let him come here.

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,200
Go help me stall him.

87
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Yes, my lady.

88
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,320
Yanniang.

89
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,830
Squire Wang. Squire Wang.

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,000
There is another guest
in Miss Yanniang's chamber.

91
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not convenient for
her to see you now.

92
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,580
(Residence of the Su Family)

93
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,070
Lord Willow Twig,

94
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,640
please identify the evil spirits
and guard my home.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,760
Good morning, Xiaoman.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
What is she doing?

97
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Ask Wick by yourself.

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,600
I'm preparing for worshiping
the Goddess of Silkworm.

99
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,350
On the day of the Qingming Festival,
an altar will be put up

100
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,950
and my lady will dress up
as the Goddess of Silkworm.

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,350
You are so talkative.

102
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,600
Go mind your own business.

103
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,760
Mother.

104
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
Eat slowly.

105
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,510
Today I saw the
servants of the mansion

106
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,040
are all bustling about.

107
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,110
Wick said there would have a worship
of the Goddess of Silkworm.

108
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,040
Yes. Yes. Yes.

109
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,760
Our Su Chang Chi worships
the Goddess of Silkworm

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,480
during the Qingming Festival every year.

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,200
First, we do this to pray for blessings.

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,510
Second, people can have fun.

113
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,390
Since Minggu cut her wisdom teeth,

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,640
she has been dressing up
as the Goddess of Silkworm.

115
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,160
Dad.

116
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,720
I don't want to do that this year.

117
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,760
What nonsense are you talking!

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Tomorrow, the Imperial Silk Manufactory

119
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,790
is going to come to inspect
our Su Chang Chi.

120
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,760
Except you, who else will dress up
as the Goddess of Silkworm?

121
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,950
Be aware of your duty.

122
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,160
You are the young proprietress
of Su Chang Chi.

123
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,640
If you don't do this thing,

124
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,040
who else will do it for you?

125
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,110
I...

126
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,060
(Great works go down in history)

127
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,950
Why are you unwilling to dress up
as the Goddess of Silkworm?

128
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,830
(Wonderful music transcends time)
Who wants to?

129
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,480
To do that, I have to show around
in public all day long

130
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,760
and face the others' judgement about me.

131
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,640
They always force me with Su Chang Chi.

132
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
They should

133
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,510
be on the road now.

134
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,390
We may

135
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,230
never see them again.

136
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,160
Do you feel sad?

137
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,070
I didn't have that wishful thinking anyway.

138
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,510
He is so good at study.

139
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,320
He is bound to become the
principal graduate in the future.

140
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,230
How could he marry into our family?

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,830
If he eats your
peach blossom shortbread,

142
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,790
If he comes to know...

143
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,390
Alright, come back to reality.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,760
Didn't you say that

145
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,110
you would go work in
the Commandery Prince's Mansion?

146
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,350
They are all gone.

147
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,270
Will you still go?

148
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
No, I won't.

149
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,110
I'll look for other jobs.

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,670
I heard that by copying
the "Thousand Character Classic"

151
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,270
and selling them to the children
who just started learning,

152
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,670
one can earn 10 copper coins
on each sale.

153
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,760
But my handwriting is not beautiful.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,830
Ten copper coins.

155
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,480
Why don't you tell my mother

156
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,160
and ask her to redeem your land?

157
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,480
No, I can't ask you to do that.

158
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,110
Today

159
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,510
you'll have the last lesson

160
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,790
before the Qingming Festival comes.

161
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,070
The teachers and the Principal

162
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,160
have agreed to

163
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
give a new round of tests

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,270
after the Qingming Festival.

165
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,320
Get prepared, all of you.

166
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,950
Why?

167
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,760
Test again?

168
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,950
Stop making such a fuss.

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,640
It's very indecent!

170
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,230
Old Gao.

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,230
Don't be so grumpy.

172
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,110
Aren't you gone?

173
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,720
Why are you back?

174
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,510
I like playing the game of go with you.

175
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,040
Take a seat.

176
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
Get started, everybody.

177
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,260
(Student Wang Weicheng)

178
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,350
Hey! Go away!

179
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,110
You heard me!

180
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,350
So bossy.

181
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,000
Get started, everybody.

182
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,110
You make a move first.

183
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
What is on His Highness's mind?

184
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,030
His just made a Ferghana Horse

185
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,280
pull the millstone.

186
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,550
I just can't understand.

187
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,230
When can the horse
stop pulling the millstone?

188
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,000
It will have to pull the millstone...

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,230
According to Wang Er of the mill,

190
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,590
that will last till the Lesser Fullness.

191
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,320
This is a waste of the fine horse.

192
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,710
His Highness's thoughts

193
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,760
are not for you to guess.

194
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,520
Go. Go. Go.

195
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
Hurry to do your work.

196
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,320
Put things back where they were.

197
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,150
Exactly where they were.

198
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,080
I am also a fine horse.

199
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,710
I walk to and for every day.

200
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,840
I spent all my time for moving.

201
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,910
All right. No more complaint.

202
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,590
Hurry to go.

203
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,670
Chop-chop.

204
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,710
The test papers used
by Jingnv Pavilion last time

205
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,000
have been saved.

206
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,710
As for this make-up exam,

207
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,520
Principal Yang is worried
that there might be trouble again.

208
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,110
So he decided to give a test
on Discourse on Politics.

209
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,880
The students of the Jingnv Pavilion

210
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,880
can decide whether to take it

211
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,150
and the test is not compulsory.

212
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,400
The test will last one day.

213
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,400
Just prepare for it.

214
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,110
Don't think about cheating.

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,280
In the coming couple of days,

216
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Xingzhou will help tutor
the Discourse on Politics in my mansion.

217
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,910
You must come.

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,520
Jingnv Pavilion doesn't
need to take the test.

219
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,520
So I don't want to go.

220
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,350
Besides,

221
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,110
who is Xingzhou?

222
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,670
It is Ziyan's courtesy name.

223
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,280
My courtesy name is Zhanzhi.

224
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,110
You can call me Senior Brother Zhanzhi.

225
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,960
Zhanzhi is also fine.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Anyway, you are working in my mansion.

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,880
Keeping me company while I study

228
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,230
is also your job.

229
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,230
If you don't come,

230
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,520
I will fire you.

231
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,960
You...

232
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,280
What did you say last time?

233
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,230
You said,
"I want to continue working here.

234
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,470
Please don't fire me, Your Highness."

235
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,230
Are you threatening me?

236
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,150
I'll go.

237
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,760
No.

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,670
We'll go.

239
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,760
We'll go.

240
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,520
Claim!

241
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,060
(Learning is the basis of a career,
reading books is the basis of learning)

242
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,230
What do you want to do exactly?

243
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,640
Are you unwilling to

244
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,470
work for him

245
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
or unwilling to go over
lessons with him?

246
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,110
I want to do neither.

247
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,150
But,

248
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,520
But I have no choice.

249
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,640
I will go to the Commandery Prince's
Mansion after school.

250
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,670
I will do my work first.

251
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,910
When will you arrive?

252
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,670
I'll go meet you.

253
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,590
You will really go?

254
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,230
In my opinion,

255
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,400
I only need to ask my mother

256
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,230
to redeem the land for you.

257
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,080
It is different.

258
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,960
I have promised Mr. Liangji

259
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,230
that I'll save money
to buy back the land.

260
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,470
And he agreed.

261
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,710
(Books)
I have made the calculations.

262
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,400
I can only earn 10 copper coins

263
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,910
by selling one piece of handwritten
"Thousand Character Classic".

264
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,520
But I can earn 50 copper coins

265
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,400
by working in his mansion for one hour.

266
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,150
Moreover,

267
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,640
I did something wrong.

268
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,320
Since I promised to do it, I must do it.

269
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,350
But you mustn't tell uncle.

270
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,790
If my mother finds it out,

271
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,230
she will paddle me again.

272
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,150
Go ahead.

273
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,030
Bite it.

274
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,790
Bite it.

275
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,590
Bite it.

276
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,320
Right. Right. Right.

277
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,790
Don't run. Bite it.

278
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,670
Bite. Bite. Bite.

279
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,400
Bite it.

280
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,590
Boyang, lower your voice.

281
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,000
Got it.

282
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,110
Bite it.

283
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,080
Bite it.

284
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,880
Right, there you go. Bite it.

285
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,910
Bite it. Bite it.

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,760
Xiaoman.

287
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,110
We are kind of bound by destiny.

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,110
His Highness gave up leaving.

289
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,350
And you happen to be back.

290
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,320
Xiaoman,

291
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,150
you have been working in our mansion

292
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,150
for quite some time.

293
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,640
The Commandery Prince's Mansion
is influential and big.

294
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,590
We can't let you do
the odd job all the time.

295
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,080
How about signing a contract?

296
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,400
In the days to come,

297
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,670
you shall come to work
four of the seven days per week.

298
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,200
I will pay you on a monthly basis.

299
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,840
Hongsu.

300
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,080
Hongsu.

301
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,550
("The Commentary of Zuo")
Go find out

302
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,670
whether she signed it.

303
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,590
Yes, Your Highness.

304
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,500
(Contract with the Commandery Prince's
Mansion Prepared by Liangji)

305
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,260
(Signed by Xie Xiaoman)

306
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,320
All right.

307
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,590
You have signed it, Miss.

308
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,350
From now on, you'll be one of us.

309
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,910
So let's just call each other sister.

310
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,400
My name is Hongsu.

311
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,790
I am His Highness's maid.

312
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,280
I guess I am several years
elder than you.

313
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,840
You can call me Sister Hongsu.

314
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,590
If you have any problems
in the mansion later,

315
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,710
don't hesitate to tell me.

316
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,550
Don't be scared.

317
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,790
OK.

318
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,400
Mr. Liangji.

319
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,000
Stop the young lady from working.

320
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,000
His Highness said that

321
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,960
Miss Su would be here soon.

322
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,840
Then they will dine inside together.

323
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
Minggu is coming?

324
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,640
Then I'll go meet her.

325
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,580
("The Commentary of Zuo")

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,520
The Duke Ling of Jin
didn't rule benevolently.

327
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,400
He levied heavy taxes to pool money
for the carving of his walls.

328
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,520
Hanchen.

329
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,520
Could you lend Zhao Mao
to me for several days?

330
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,670
He shot at people
from a terrace with a slingshot

331
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,520
to see how they would dodge the pellets.

332
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,320
Well,

333
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,670
I am talking to you.

334
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,710
When his cook failed to
do the bear paws thoroughly,

335
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,280
he had the cook killed.

336
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,110
Boyang.

337
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,080
Hanchen is reading.

338
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,030
Don't disturb him.

339
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,150
He is reading?

340
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,000
Only a fool will believe that.

341
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,000
I know him very well.

342
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,790
The test on Discourse of Politics,

343
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,000
(Soaring noble spirit)
as its name suggests,

344
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,200
requires students
to comment on political issues

345
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,320
and put forward countermeasures.

346
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,590
It attaches importance
to detailed analysis,

347
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,550
solutions to problems

348
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,710
and convincing arguments.

349
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
If you want to get Grade A in the test,

350
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,910
you must give your own insighful views.

351
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,880
This time,

352
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,470
the students of the
Jingnv Pavilion will also take the test.

353
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,000
So I guess the teachers

354
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,400
won't make out questions
about irrigation works

355
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,910
or tax laws.

356
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,320
I guess they will set questions about

357
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,350
The Four Books and the Five Classics

358
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,470
like the article
"Misconduct of Duke Ling of Jin"

359
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,910
read by Hanchen just now

360
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,230
or like the topic "On Dogmatism"

361
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,200
set in the fourth reign year
of the Xining Period.

362
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,760
Emperor Wu of Jin subdued
Eastern Wu being dogmatic

363
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,200
while the dogmatic Emperor Fu Jian
failed to suppress Eastern Jin.

364
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,550
Duke Huan of Qi became the top hegemon
resorting to Guan Zhong stubbornly

365
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,230
while King Ji Kuai of Yan lost
his throne trusting Zizhi arbitrarily.

366
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,910
Why did the same doings

367
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,710
lead to different results?

368
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,760
Also, there may be questions about
"Faults of Qin" by Jia Changsha.

369
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
It is a famous article
passed down from ancient times.

370
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,030
What matters the most
is presenting the argument.

371
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,150
First, the argument must be
new and unique.

372
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,960
Also, the argument should be presented

373
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,400
in a powerful, concise,

374
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,350
trenchant and sophisticated manner.

375
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,790
Let's

376
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,520
take "Faults of Qin" as an example.

377
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,150
This article consists of three parts.

378
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,110
Part I describes

379
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,840
how the State of Qin grew stronger

380
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,400
throughout the reign from
Duke Xiao to the First Emperor.

381
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,710
Part II writes about
the crisis caused to Qin

382
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
by the Second Emperor's wrong policies.

383
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,660
(Variorum of The Doctrine of the Mean)

384
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,440
Part III depicts how Qin dealt with

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,030
its military issues

386
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,440
and political issues in the crisis.

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,550
And...

388
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,110
Boyang.

389
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,150
Why did you wake me up?

390
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,760
I was dreaming about a cricket.

391
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,230
Read this again.

392
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,790
Taste it.

393
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,160
All right.

394
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,590
Let's call it a day.

395
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,800
It's finally over.

396
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,400
I am so tired.

397
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,160
I have to go back quickly
for the cricket fight.

398
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,800
Hanchen.

399
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,420
(Soaring noble spirit)

400
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,310
I'll be off.

401
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,310
Hurry to go.

402
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,280
Go quickly.

403
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,880
Meet me after you get changed.

404
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,920
I'll wait for you in the coach.

405
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,070
So you really know the tea ceremony.

406
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,400
Of course.

407
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,040
I have learned it since childhood.

408
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,640
How come I don't know?

409
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,950
You are capable of so many things.

410
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,710
But I am capable of none of them.

411
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,710
Every person is born to

412
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,710
assume their own responsibilities.

413
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,760
Your responsibility is
to grow up properly

414
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,190
and to marry into a decent family.

415
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,520
However, my responsibility is

416
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
to become a carefree prince

417
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,350
who is Jack of all trades,
but expert of none.

418
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,230
You don't like this?

419
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,800
It doesn't matter
whether I like it or not.

420
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,310
I am a member of the imperial clan.

421
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,950
My food, clothes and daily needs

422
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,590
all come from the taxes
paid by the populace.

423
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,430
Nobody wants to hear me
say "I dislike it".

424
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,710
They only want to see

425
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,950
a virtuous and flawless prince.

426
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,710
If I believe in the Taoism,
they'll be more satisfied.

427
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,280
Watch the clouds rise

428
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,400
and don't scramble for gains.

429
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,560
This is why you left the capital

430
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,710
and came to Wujiang Prefecture.

431
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
Because there is no
freedom for you there.

432
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,280
There is no so-called
freedom in this world.

433
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,190
The men of letters made it up

434
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,710
to deceive naïve girls like you.

435
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,560
Like the tea I offered you,

436
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,950
the tea leaves gather
and disperse in a fixed way.

437
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,950
This doesn't sound like you.

438
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,710
How come?

439
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,190
You don't seem to be a person

440
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,310
who believes in destiny.

441
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,590
I must say the spring water
of Wujiang Prefecture

442
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,680
is not as good as

443
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
the clean snow water of the capital.

444
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
You used to make tea
with the snow water?

445
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,830
When I lived in the capital,

446
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,310
my family always made tea

447
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,830
with the clean snow water
collected in winter.

448
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,190
My elder brother and I ever dug out

449
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,590
the jar used by our mother
to store the snow water.

450
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,640
You must miss your brother a lot?

451
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,280
Mr. Liangji.

452
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,190
Miss Xie.

453
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,160
You listened to the Discourse
on Politics so attentively.

454
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,800
Why?

455
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,190
Though Jingnv Pavilion
doesn't give us a test about it,

456
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,350
I think it is very interesting

457
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,710
to listen to it.

458
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,560
Since you are so interested in it,

459
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,040
you should go with me to
Taiping Tavern tomorrow

460
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,680
to listen to the debate
about statecraft.

461
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,830
What about my work then?

462
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,680
Accompanying me to listen to the debate

463
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,160
is your tomorrow's work.

464
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,950
About the Cuju ball game
held on that day,

465
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,590
I was wrong.

466
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,430
I owe you an apology.

467
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,350
I am sorry.

468
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,430
From now on, I'll do my utmost

469
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,190
regarding the Studio of Artlessness

470
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,400
You can rest assured.

471
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
It is late now.

472
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,190
Go back early.

473
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,400
I heard you still live
in your uncle's home.

474
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,710
If you go back too late, he will worry.

475
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,710
Besides,

476
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,310
I accept your apology.

477
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,680
See you tomorrow.

478
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
(Gorgeous Building
Propitious Pavilion)

479
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,040
What took you so long?

480
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,680
See you in Taiping Tavern
at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

481
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,280
Also,

482
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,280
the peach blossom
shortbread is very yummy.

483
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,160
I like it very much.

484
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,560
You gave Zhong Ziyan

485
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
the peach blossom shortbread?

486
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,280
Did, did he figure out the whole thing?

487
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,920
I gave it to him.

488
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
I gave it to the manservant

489
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,520
and especially mentioned
it was for Zhong Ziyan.

490
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,760
But, Zhao Xiaoqian said

491
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,110
he would also go to
Taiping Tavern tomorrow.

492
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,400
And he asked me to go with him.

493
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,310
Xiaoman.

494
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,310
Could you replace me

495
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,830
to dress up as the
Goddess of Silkworm tomorrow?

496
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,590
I can't.

497
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,710
You can.

498
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,400
You know I have an appointment
with Zhong Ziyan tomorrow.

499
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,710
Also, my mother said that

500
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,520
the personnel of the
Imperial Silk Manufactory would come.

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,560
There must be someone
dressing up as the Goddess of Silkworm.

502
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,110
But if I agree to do it,

503
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,310
auntie will be angry with me.

504
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,230
No, she won't.

505
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,680
I'll talk to her.

506
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,520
I ensure you my mother
won't give you a hard time.

507
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,640
But I also want to watch the debate.

508
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,680
You surely do.

509
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,680
Fine. Fine.

510
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,400
I'll take your place.

511
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,350
I am only a common girl.

512
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,590
Even if I don't go tomorrow,

513
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,950
it won't make a difference.

514
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,950
But you must remember to

515
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,560
apologize on my behalf tomorrow.

516
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,800
No problem.

517
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,680
Just leave it to me.

518
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,260
"Faults of Qin"

519
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,460
(Studio of Artlessness)

520
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,190
Hanchen.

521
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,560
All is set for

522
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,430
tomorrow's debate.

523
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,350
Are you sure you will take
Xie Xiaoman with you?

524
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,230
Yes.

525
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,230
You see she is a little beef-brained.

526
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,590
I have to teach her

527
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
so that she won't bring disgrace to me.

528
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,400
Why do you care so much about her?

529
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,190
Don't you think a
wooden-headed girl like her

530
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,400
is very cute?

531
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,430
Well,

532
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,160
tomorrow my mother will take
A'Yun to visit our folks in hometown.

533
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,680
They will pass by Wujiang Prefecture.

534
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,040
Because they are travelling
with other people,

535
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,590
they will only stay here
for about two hours.

536
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,560
So, tomorrow,

537
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
I won't go to Taiping Tavern with you.

538
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,680
You won't go?

539
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,880
All right.

540
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,160
Remember to ask Mr. Liangji

541
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,430
to prepare some tonic food
for your mother.

542
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,310
Your mother is bringing up A'Yun alone.

543
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,520
It's not an easy thing.

544
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:20,920
I got it.

545
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,000
Then I'll be off.

546
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,350
What do you think? Do I look good?

547
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,880
You look beautiful.

548
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,310
The first course

549
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,350
is Fried Quail with Flowers
and Pork Kidney.

550
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
The second course is...

551
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,680
Not everyone is here.

552
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,760
Take them away.

553
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,880
You may all withdraw.

554
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,800
The two sirs taking part
in the debate are here.

555
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,040
Your Highness,

556
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,430
when will the debate be started?

557
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,520
Let's wait for her to arrive.

558
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,680
Do you think that

559
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,350
I applied the powder evenly today?

560
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,070
Yes. Yes. Yes.

561
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,110
My lady, what's on your mind exactly?

562
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,280
Why did you refuse to dress up
as the Goddess of Silkworm

563
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,800
and let the naughty girl Xiaoman
take your place?

564
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,760
Don't say such words about Xiaoman.

565
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,160
She is my cousin.

566
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,950
You said this about her first.

567
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,520
Now you changed your mind.

568
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,640
Nonsense!

569
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,980
(Budian Curtains)

570
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,760
Come on, A'Yun.

571
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,190
Don't pamper her all the time.

572
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,160
She is a big girl now.

573
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,000
But she doesn't know how to behave.

574
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,560
You see,

575
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,800
(Zhong Ziyan's younger sister Zhong Yun)
she didn't greet you.

576
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,880
Don't criticize A'Yun, mother.

577
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,430
It has been a long time
since we met last time.

578
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,350
It's natural that she
doesn't feel close to me.

579
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,760
(Zhong Ziyan's mum Mrs. Zhong)
Why am I

580
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,640
putting myself through so much?

581
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,830
Because I hope

582
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,000
our family can foster
another principal graduate.

583
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,640
Well, mother.

584
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,310
These are the silver

585
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,040
I have earned recently.

586
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,400
Take them.

587
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,710
I am not short of money.

588
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,640
You only need to take
good care of yourself.

589
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,880
Mum.

590
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
The Commandery Prince is generous.

591
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
You have nothing to worry.

592
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,040
So take them.

593
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,710
Keep them well.

594
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,110
Mrs. Zhong.

595
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,070
It's not early now.

596
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,280
Let's set out.

597
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,880
We are coming.

598
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,830
You must study hard

599
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,160
while serving the Commandery Prince.

600
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,710
Do take care of yourself.

601
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,430
Stop eating. Let's go.

602
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,950
You promised to buy me the milk cake.

603
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,280
Why do you like eating so much?

604
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,520
Mum.

605
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,280
It's not like we can't afford that.

606
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,920
Let's buy it for her.

607
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,880
You go buy a piece of milk cake
and take it to her.

608
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,040
Hurry.

609
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,640
People are waiting for us.

610
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,400
Such a willful girl.

611
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,160
You leave her alone.

612
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,920
Don't pamper her.

613
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,040
Let's go. Hurry.

614
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,590
My lady bought this for you.

615
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,400
It's the milk cake.

616
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,310
Thank you, Miss.

617
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,470
Your brother and I

618
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
study in the same academy.

619
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,590
Xingzhou is very famous in our academy.

620
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,190
The teachers like him a lot.

621
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,310
All people are
impressed by his learning.

622
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,920
Today I gave you the milk cake

623
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,190
as a goodwill gesture to your brother.

624
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,470
So just enjoy it.

625
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,280
Yan'er, work hard in your study.

626
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,190
Don't care about us.

627
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,520
I can manage our family well.

628
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,070
You take care of yourselves as well.

629
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,880
Goodbye, Miss.

630
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,560
Xingzhou.

631
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,190
I know your life is not easy.

632
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,470
I also know that

633
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,430
you have studied so hard

634
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,640
just to make your mother and family

635
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,590
live a better life.

636
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,680
I know that you don't feel good

637
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
being the prince's school companion.

638
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,590
In the future...

639
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,560
What does it have to do with you?

640
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,590
It is indecent for you
to eavesdrop on us.

641
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,470
Today I will let that go.

642
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,760
In the days to come,

643
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,000
please don't cross the line again.

644
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,400
Why did you

645
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,110
talk to my lady like this?

646
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,000
Sir, where are your manners?

647
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,560
The Commandery Prince is still

648
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,640
waiting for your cousin
in Taiping Tavern.

649
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,640
You'd better hurry.

650
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,190
Do you mean that

651
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,950
the Commandery Prince
wrote the letter to Xiaoman?

652
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,470
What letter?

653
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,470
Your Highness.

654
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,310
Well.

655
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,310
What time is it now?

656
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,950
It's already over 6 p.m.

657
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,400
Where is she?

658
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,520
I have sent people to find it out.

659
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,590
I am afraid that Miss Xie

660
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,830
won't make it here today.

661
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,520
She is still in her dwelling now.

662
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,710
Your Highness, you indulged her so much

663
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,470
that she forgot her position.

664
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,950
She is only a maid.

665
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,280
Get the horse ready.

666
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,710
Let's go to the
Residence of the Su Family.

667
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,660
(Residence of the Su Family)

668
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,400
Thank you. Thank you.

669
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,950
Congratulations.

670
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,560
Thanks. Thanks.

671
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,190
Many thanks.

672
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,280
Thanks. Thanks.

673
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,000
Welcome. Welcome.

674
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,160
Lord Chang.

675
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,350
Greetings. We're waiting for you.

676
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,520
Mr. Meng, greetings.

677
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,460
(Invitation Chang Huaipu Grand Supervisor
of Wujiang Silk Manufactory)

678
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,230
Lord Chang.

679
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,230
Madam Su.

680
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,190
Lord Chang, go in, please.

681
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,590
This way. This way.

682
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,920
Come in, please.

683
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,560
Hurry.

684
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,230
Greetings, Lord Li.

685
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,830
Welcome. Welcome.

686
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,000
Congratulations to you. Congratulations.

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
Hold the balance arm.

688
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,760
Cut the wick.

689
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,350
Spread the flower powder.

690
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,110
Cut the wick.

691
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,190
Congwen.

692
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,950
Today you are dressing up
as the Goddess of Silkworm?

693
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,070
Minggu is not available today.

694
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,350
So I took her place.

695
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,040
I did this without prior preparations.

696
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,400
Please don't laugh at me.

697
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,070
OK. I won't.

698
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,520
Why are you here today?

699
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,590
The Grand Supervisor who came today

700
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,560
is my father's old friend.

701
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
So I came to visit him.

702
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,950
How are you progressing with
your Discourse on Politics?

703
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
I have no clue at all.

704
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,920
It doesn't matter.

705
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,230
Like what I said back then,

706
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,920
just say whatever you like.

707
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,800
My lady.

708
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,680
It's time

709
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,520
for us to make appearances.

710
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,350
You look so beautiful today.

711
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,430
Put on a good show
on the stage in a while.

712
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,350
If you have any problems
with the Discourse of Politics,

713
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,560
you can come to me at any time.

714
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,760
I am

715
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,640
always available.

716
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,000
The divinity resides in the silkworm.

717
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,950
We farmers worship
the Goddess of Silkworm.

718
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,230
We plant mulberry trees
to raise silkworms.

719
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,470
Thanks to the goddess
for bestowing the silk cloth on us.

720
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,040
She did a very good job.

721
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,590
Yes.

722
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,220
(Crouching Stone Pavilion)

723
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,080
You broke your promise.

724
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,320
Did your School Brother Li
teach you this?

725
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,950
If a person doesn't honor her words,

726
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
I don't know what he or she can achieve?

727
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,360
If the carriage,
big or small has no yokes,

728
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,630
how can it travel?

729
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,760
It's just a few words.

730
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,950
Everybody is capable of that.

731
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,800
All guests came at the invitation.

732
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,630
You came without being invited.

733
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,950
You committed the sin of
trespassing on others' property.

734
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,390
Trespassing on others' property?

735
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,470
All right.

736
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,470
All right.

737
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,080
The Commandery Prince of Julu
is present here.

738
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,120
Greetings to Your Highness!

739
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,120
School Brother Li,

740
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,230
you are only a commoner.

741
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,950
How could you ignore the etiquette

742
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,870
and not kneel down before me?

743
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,120
Is it because your father is
an official of the third rank?

744
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,120
Your Highness came
without being invited.

745
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,230
Did your blood of the imperial clan
give you the authority?

746
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
You humiliated all people present.

747
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
How could you do this?

748
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,950
Humiliate?

749
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,040
I am afraid you don't know

750
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,630
what is the real humiliation.

751
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,120
Today is very important
for Su Chang Chi.

752
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,560
Why are you making a scene here?

753
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,470
I am making a scene?

754
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,560
Then you tell me

755
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,320
why you didn't keep our
appointment today.

756
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,710
And why did you

757
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,600
give me the peach blossom shortbread?

758
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,320
It's not for you.

759
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,000
What did you say?

760
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,120
I said that

761
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,630
the peach blossom shortbread
was not for you.

762
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,870
So stop causing trouble here.

763
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,800
Liangji.

764
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,040
Here.

765
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,430
Take her to my mansion.

766
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,120
You...

767
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,950
Zhao Xiaoqian.

768
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:54,910
You...

769
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,470
Xiaoman.

770
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,280
Sorry that I have to do this.

771
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,470
Today His Highness is...

772
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,280
I'll talk to you later.

773
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,600
Guards, take her away.

774
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,430
Be gentle. Don't hurt her.

775
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,120
Congwen.

776
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,870
What, what are you doing?

777
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:05,950
Let go of me.

778
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,390
Xiaoman.

779
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,950
Let go of me.

780
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,040
Let's talk about it.

781
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,630
Help me go back.

782
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,430
Mother.

783
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,120
Ma'am.

784
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,560
Su Wei.

785
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,120
What is going on?

786
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,120
When did Xiaoman offend the prince?

787
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,800
He defied human and divine.

788
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,120
Lord Chang.

789
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,760
The Commandery Prince of Julu
kidnapped the common girl.

790
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,390
I beg your Lordship to lend me the army.

791
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,630
Well...

792
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,820
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

793
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
You signed the contract in private.

794
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,950
But you dare not tell others.

795
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,910
Why?

796
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,000
Do you think it is a shame

797
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,320
working in my mansion?

798
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,360
Say something.

799
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,630
Since Your Highness thinks
I did something wrong,

800
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,600
I'll kneel here

801
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,910
till you are not angry.

802
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,600
Good.

803
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,870
Then tell me

804
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,390
what is the wrong thing you did.

805
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,000
I was wrong

806
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
to sign the contract with
Your Highness in private.

807
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,630
How dare you!

808
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,800
Xiaoman.

809
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,800
His Highness is pissed now.

810
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,560
You'd better give in and apologize.

811
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,560
I won't.

812
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,560
Right.

813
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,080
I was wrong to

814
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,040
have stood His Highness up.

815
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,470
But His Highness bullied
us using his power

816
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,390
and caused trouble to Su Chang Chi.

817
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,360
This is not my fault.

818
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,870
Open the gate!

819
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,940
(Fresh and Gentle Wind)

820
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,430
Your Highness!

821
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,520
Your Highness!

822
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,630
Your Highness!

823
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,360
Our mansion got besieged.

824
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,800
Xingzhou.

825
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,080
Go ask Arms Instructor Qin
to lead the army into the city.

826
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:26,710
Yes, Your Highness.

827
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,820
(Shuntian Gate
Wang's Zuiliuxiang Noodle House)

828
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,660
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

829
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,520
The prince is young and ignorant.

830
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,000
Are you the same, Lord Qin?

831
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,670
I don't care about that.

832
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,040
I only know that

833
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,420
(Yamen)
the imperial clan ordered me

834
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,630
(Yamen)
to protect His Highness.

835
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,080
So, whether His Highness is
young and ignorant

836
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,280
or experienced and prudent,

837
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,560
I'll have to protect him.

838
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,470
Congwen.

839
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,560
The Commandery Prince of Julu is
a member of the imperial clan.

840
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,320
Don't mess up with him.
