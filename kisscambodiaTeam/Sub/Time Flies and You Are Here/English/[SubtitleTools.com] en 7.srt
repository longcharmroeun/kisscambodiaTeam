(Residence of the Su Family)

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,239
Mother!

23
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,800
Mother!

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
- Xiaoman.
- Mother.

25
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,480
Calm down.

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,360
What happened?

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,519
Why was father arrested?

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,919
Your father...

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
They said your father

30
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,599
transferred people from
the censorate on his own.

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,519
It's an act which is beyond his powers.

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,599
Just now,

33
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,879
he was brought away before noon.

34
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,360
This must be Zhao Xiaoqian's doing.

35
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,519
I'm going to look for him.

36
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,160
Xiaoman, don't.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,040
Calm down first.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,519
Your uncle

39
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:15,160
went to check with the magistrate
early this morning.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,919
Let's hear what he has to
say when he comes back.

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,600
That's right.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,479
Something bad happened!

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,720
Madam,

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,520
master was arrested.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,919
Suchangji was sealed.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,759
Lady,

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,679
Commandery Prince said
he's waiting for you at Taiping Tavern.

48
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,800
Xiaoman, you mustn't go.

49
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:34,679
The messenger who came said

50
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,559
if she doesn't show,

51
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,440
we'll never see the two
old masters again.

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,279
Mother.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,279
They are too much.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,240
Calm down first.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
Don't tell madam about it for now.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,279
We don't want her to worry.

57
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,919
I'll go and meet him.

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,360
Xiaoman,

59
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,520
you mustn't go.

60
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,960
They must be up to something.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Don't worry.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,000
Since things have come to this,

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,720
there's nothing else to
be afraid of anymore.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,600
Xiaoman!

65
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:07,919
Xiaoman!

66
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:08,800
Xiaoman!

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,399
Xiaoman!

68
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,080
Where's Zhao Xiaoqian?

69
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,240
He's not in.

70
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,559
For certain things,

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,880
you just have to discuss with me.

72
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,919
Discuss with you?

73
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,960
Are you able to make decisions?

74
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,520
I can't,

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,839
but you can.

76
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,759
You and Hanchen spent
the night together,

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,039
and Commandery Prince's Mansion
kept it a secret for you.

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,559
As you can see when you
went to the academy earlier,

79
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,039
no one dare mention it.

80
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,080
However, within Wujiang Prefecture,

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
it's still become a scandal.

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,679
Even if Commandery Prince's Mansion
is powerful,

83
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,520
we cannot stop
these people from gossiping.

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Do you know why?

85
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,880
It's Shen Yan's doing.

86
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,520
Shen Yan and Hanchen were
enemies since they were kids.

87
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,240
In order to break Zhao and
Shen's marriage engagement,

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,639
he came up with this plot.

89
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,960
Even your father's matter,

90
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,240
it's also Shen Yan's doing.

91
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:18,960
What about my uncle?

92
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,600
Is it also Shen Yan's doing?

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,239
It's me.

94
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,760
So, what else do you have to say?

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,359
I just want to tell you that

96
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,000
although Commandery Prince's Mansion

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,959
isn't a peaceful place,

98
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,799
we can still protect you,

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,519
Su Family as well as
Xie Family from harm.

100
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,359
If you marry Hanchen as a concubine,

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,720
your father, your uncle

102
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,480
and even your brother, Xie Xun,

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
who is currently in the capital,

104
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,160
we'll be able to help.

105
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,399
If you aren't willing,

106
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,279
other than Xie Yu's

107
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,079
and Suchangji's future,

108
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,799
even for Xie Xun,

109
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,160
his father is jailed.

110
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,920
Did you know, for the family members of
the imperial examination's attendees

111
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,320
had such a thing
happen in their family,

112
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,119
they are barred from the exam

113
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,160
forever?

114
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,559
You're threatening me?

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,640
That's right.

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
I need to see Zhao Xiaoqian.

117
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,799
I need to see Zhao Xiaoqian!

118
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,559
It's all my doing.

119
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,440
Xingzhou has nothing to do with it.

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,799
Why did you do this?

121
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,440
Because I'm selfish.

122
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,399
I don't want to return to the capital.

123
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:33,480
That's why I could only use you.

124
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,880
What about me?

125
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,119
What did I do?

126
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,040
What did I do wrong?

127
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,799
Why are you so selfish?

128
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,279
Did you consider

129
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,200
my feelings even once?

130
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,119
It's as if I was some sort of goods

131
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,440
which you all handled as you wished.

132
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:00,839
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,559
You're sorry?

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,519
That's my entire life!

135
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,600
That's my entire life!

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,119
Two years.

137
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,799
Give me two years.

138
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,880
Become my concubine for two years,

139
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,519
and I'll order them

140
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,839
to release your father and uncle.

141
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
Suchangji will naturally be fine.

142
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:19,799
Didn't you want money

143
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,239
to redeem your land in Yuyangli?

144
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,079
I promise.

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,600
I'll sign a flexible contract with you.

146
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,320
You'll be free after two years,

147
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
and I'll give you 200 taels of silver.

148
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,839
I'll also return to you

149
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,119
your family's mulberry field.

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
I'll let you return to Yuyangli.

151
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,440
I slapped you

152
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,600
because you owed me that.

153
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,279
I promise you.

154
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,399
Hanchen!

155
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,359
Hanchen!

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,200
Xiaoman.

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,880
They didn't hurt you, did they?

158
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,559
Mother,

159
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,239
I'm fine.

160
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,600
They'll release father

161
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,160
and uncle.

162
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,640
Suchangji

163
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,200
will also be fine.

164
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:21,959
Why did His Highness

165
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,559
suddenly become so kind?

166
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,239
Xiaoman,

167
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,799
is it because you
promised him something?

168
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,720
Don't bother about
the coming-of-age ceremony.

169
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:37,600
Mother,

170
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm going to marry him.

171
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,960

I'm going to marry him.

175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,960
Smile as I'm getting married.

176
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,960
I have to be

177
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,599
a joyful bride.

178
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,559
Xiaoman.

179
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,200
Mistress,

180
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,000
those from Commandery Prince's
Mansion are here again.

181
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,280
Greetings, ladies.

182
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,840
Isn't it as you wished?

183
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,400
This is Commandery Prince of Julu's gift

185
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,599
for you.

186
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,679
His Highness said

187
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,320
your coming-of-age ceremony
will go on as planned.

188
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,840
He also found

189
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,039
Teacher Liu from Bailu Academy

190
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,840
to be your honoured guest.

191
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,440
Teacher Liu had been
traveling prior to this.

192
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,719
She'll return to the academy
in few days.

193
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,200
She's talented in composing poems.

194
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,559
Even in the capital itself,

195
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,400
she's also known as
a gifted female scholar.

196
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,799
Asking her to be
Xiaoman's honoured guest,

197
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,239
you all don't have to worry.

198
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,400
His Highness also said

199
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,320
what's needed for
Xiaoman's ceremony

200
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,520
will all be prepared accordingly.

201

about the lessons taught in the book.

"teach men but not women,

290

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,000
Although "Admonitions for Women"
were lessons for women,

which was for men and women

304

Even after you get married,

305
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,640
you must also remain strong
despite the circumstances,

306
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,199
and never let your
initial ambition falter.

Although you'll be in
Commandery Prince's Mansion,

308
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,839
you can also learn knowledge

and be a prolific reader.

310
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,199
That way,

311
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,479
you won't get caught

312
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,959
in the typical complaints by females

313
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,439
or the troubles of daily life.

314

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
Serve the tea.

336
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,959
Filial to the parents, take care
of the juniors with kindness.

337
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,400
Temperate, kind, courteous,
restrained and magnanimous.

338
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,400
Don't get conceited or arrogant.
Don't slander or deceive.

339
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,239
Traditional lessons are a
formality which you must keep.

340
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,640
(I hope everything will go well
for Xiaoman from now on.)

341
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,479
(For the family of three)

342
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,719
(to be happy always.)

343
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,780
(Lotus Garden)

344
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,920
What's wrong?

345
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,040
Are you afraid?

346
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,199
Who says I'm afraid?

347
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,319
Playing chess is my hobby, that's all.

348
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,280
If it's in the past,

349
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,719
I'll let you take two steps first.

350
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,079
Too bad today's your wedding day.

351
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,680
The circumstances don't favour me.

352
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,479
I won by half a chess piece.

353
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,800
Go ahead.

354
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,599
Let's play another game.

355
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,199
Let's play another game.

356
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,599
Come on. Come on.

357
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,359
Hurry.

358
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,360
Stop.

359
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,959
Let them go.

360
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
(Lotus Garden)

361
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,880
Move aside.

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
Mistress asked me to toss coins
and dried fruits at the bed.

363
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,400
Do you know the rules or not?

364
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,520
Don't touch those.

365
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,160
If you're hungry,

366
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,599
I'll cook you a bowl of noodles.

367
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
No need.

368
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,640
I'm not hungry.

369
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,680
Let me tell you.

370
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,880
It's not that my lady
doesn't want me anymore.

371
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm going back to the Residence
of the Su Family soon.

372
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:10,800
Wick,

373
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,280
tell me.

374
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,880
Will he

375
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,319
want to

376
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,400
consummate with me?

377
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,920
What's wrong with that?

378
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,160
For a married couple,

379
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,599
it's just normal.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,839
Haven't you heard of those words before?

381
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,479
Toss coins and dried fruits at the east,

382
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:30,239
a lovely pair of lotuses
embroidered on the bed.

383
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,479
Toss coins and dried fruits at the west,

384
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,959
a pair of golden roosters
embroidered on the bed.

385
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,280
Toss coins and dried fruits
at the north,

386
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,520
the couple will have children easily.

387
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,400
Toss coins and dried fruits
at the south,

388
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,599
there'll be an abundance of offspring.

389
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,199
I'll even have to give birth to a child?

390
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:39,959
Of course.

391
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,680
If the newlyweds sleep
on the same side,

392
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,160
they'll have a pair
of children next year.

393
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,959
The son will be the principal graduate
in the palace examination

394
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,400
and the daughter will be
a princess consort.

395
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,560
What princess consort?

396
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,920
The daughter will be a princess consort.

397
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,800
Which is to say, if Your Highness

398
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,199
has a daughter with Lady Xiaoman,

399
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,280
she'll become a princess consort
in the capital.

400
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,040
Wick.

401
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,119
Well said.

402
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,319
Go and get a reward from Liangji.

403
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,239
Thank you, Your Highness.

404
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,719
Did you get into a fight again?

405
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,040
I thought you won't
talk with me anymore.

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
I've promised you.

407
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,839
If I keep on giving you an attitude,

408
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I'd also feel bad.

409
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,520
Are you hungry?

410
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,280
I saw you busying
yourself the entire day

411
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,719
and didn't seem to eat anything.

412
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,520
I prepared some venison jerky for you.

413
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
If you're hungry...

414
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,280
Don't come over.

415
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:54,959
I have to sit down

416
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,439
or it's against the manners.

417
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,420
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

418
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,560
Where's Commandery Prince of Julu?

419
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,400
His Highness...

420
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,000
Zhu Momo.

421
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,000
Where's Commandery Prince of Julu?

422
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,400
His Highness is inside.

423
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,400
She's sent here from the capital.

424
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,860
(Lotus Garden)

425
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
Don't come over.

426
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,400
Go ahead and shout.

427
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,920
Why aren't you shouting anymore?

428
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,479
Shouted yourself hoarse, haven't you?

429
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:50,760
Come over.

430
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,839
You...

431
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,000
Come and drink
this wedding toast with me.

432
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,319
People do that when
they marry their wives.

433
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,439
I'm just a concubine.

434
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,400
Draping red ornaments
all over your room,

435
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,199
people might say I have no manners.

436
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,880
Why do you bother?

437
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,640
I was worried you'll be wronged.

438
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:18,680
Take it.

439
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,400
That's the rule.

440
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,760
Come over.

441
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,439
If one of the cups faces upward
and the other downward,

442
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,199
it's an auspicious sign
with symbolic meaning.

443
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,599
The crowd will then offer
their congratulatory wishes.

444
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,920
That's a good sign.

445
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,439
In the future, we'll

446
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,239
lead a good life.

447
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,839
Don't go overboard!

448
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,719
This time, it's our master.

449
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,040
Zhu Momo's here.

450
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,000
What she's doing here?

451
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,839
Hurry up! Hurry!

452
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,319
Who is she?

453
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,400
The housekeeper.

454
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,359
Hurry!

455
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,959
Greetings, Momo.

456
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,400
All these ornaments in the house

457
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,239
are too improper.

458
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,400
Commandery Prince of Julu
doesn't know the customs.

459
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,319
Liangji,

460
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,839
you're from Prince of Pu's Mansion.

461
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,079
Don't you know the customs?

462
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,079
Pardon me.

463
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,439
Inform Commandery Prince of Julu that

464
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,560
I'm here.

465
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,599
Zhu Momo's here.

466
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,719
Greetings, Zhu Momo.

467
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,680
Zhu Momo?

468
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:05,400
What's wrong?

469
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,000
Someone came from the capital.

470
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,359
She's my mother's nanny.

471
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,560
Don't speak later.

472
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
(Lotus Garden)

473
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,119
I've disturbed Your Highness's rest.

474
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
Please forgive me.

475
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,599
Zhu Momo,

476
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
why are you here?

477
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,599
Your Highness's willful actions

478
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,640
caused some trouble in the capital.

479
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:43,079
Her Highness wanted me to bring
this message to Your Highness.

480
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,680
Since you're getting a concubine,

481
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,760
why?

482
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,800
The bride's in a red costume.

483
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,719
Is she going to be the duchess?

484
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,920
I told them to make the wedding dress.

485
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
It has nothing to do with Xiaoman.

486
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,119
Come at me if there's anything.

487
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,439
His Highness doesn't
know the customs.

488
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,640
Liangji,

489
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,599
are you also not aware of it?

490
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,400
His Highness is a royal.

491
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,000
Therefore, he should follow the rules.

492
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,680
Today, the concubine's
wearing a red costume.

493
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,079
In the future, when the duchess
marries into the family,

494
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,239
what's she going to wear?

495
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,160
Zhu Momo,

496
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
we weren't considerate enough.

497
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,079
Lady Xie was our classmate.

498
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,160
Hanchen's getting a concubine

499
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
and everyone's happy.

500
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:50,079
In fact, this isn't exactly red either.

501
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:51,439
We told them

502
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,719
not to make it bright red.

503
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,000
We added mauve colour

504
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:55,880
to differentiate

505
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:58,000
as well as to add to the festivities.

506
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,680
That's right. Mauve colour was added.

507
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,920
All right, that's that.

508
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,439
Since she's married into the family,

509
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:08,760
I won't pursue what
happened in the past.

510
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:11,479
However,
I was sent here by Her Highness.

511
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,160
So, I should follow
Prince of Pu's Mansion's rules.

512
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,760
Since Lady Xie is the concubine,

513
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:19,319
within the mansion,

514
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,400
she's just a maidservant.

515
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:25,680
Prince of Pu's Mansion never allowed
a person with no manner to stay.

516
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,880
Lady Xie,

517
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,479
show me your courtesy.

518
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,079
Zhu Momo, you came all
the way from the capital.

519
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,000
It must be a tiring journey.

520
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,280
Why don't you take a rest first?

521
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,040
Carry it properly.

522
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,119
Zhu Momo!

523
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,719
This is Commandery Prince's Mansion,

524
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
not Prince of Pu's Mansion!

525
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,040
Since you're now a prince,

526
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,520
you should be cautious with
your words and actions more.

527
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,319
Let's not talk about
Prince of Pu's Mansion.

528
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,280
Even at Zichen Palace in the capital,

529
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,520
which of the ladies has no manners?

530
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,680
Since you're from Zhao Family

531
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,560
and respected by the people,

532
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,719
you should follow the people's rules.

533
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,719
Tomorrow,

534
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,399
Lady Xie will rise at 5.45 a.m. to

535
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,280
learn manners from me first.

536
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,040
But I have to go to
the academy tomorrow.

537
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:44,760
Lady Xie,

538
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,199
you're so naive.

539
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,479
No married woman

540
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,919
can leave her mansion freely.

541
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,159
Moreover,

542
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,760
now that you're married,

543
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,800
you don't have to go to
the academy anymore.

544
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,800
What's the purpose of
going to the academy anyway?

545
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,040
It's to...

546
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,679
From today onwards,

547
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,760
Lady Xie will stop going to the academy.

548
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,919
You'll learn manners from me first.

549
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,320
Hanchen,

550
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,040
don't act rashly.

551
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,879
Lady Xie should go and rest first.

552
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,000
Early tomorrow morning,

553
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,879
I'll wait for you here.

554
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,560
What's the purpose

555
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:56,840
of studying?

556
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Guess what she's here for?

557
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,959
It seems like your parents

558
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,120
haven't given up on the idea of

559
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,439
your marriage with
the daughter of Shen Family.

560
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,120
They want to chase Xiaoman away

561
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,560
for me to marry Shen Zhaowen instead.

562
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,000
What wishful thinking.

563
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,919
They've never bothered much
about me since young,

564
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,639
and now when they realise
I'm useful for them,

565
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,879
they quickly

566
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
take actions without taking
my opinion into consideration.

567
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,639
So, what do you plan to do?

568
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,879
Anyway,

569
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,719
let's not alert our opponent first.

570
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,120
I have my own way.

571
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,719
Zhao Xiaoqian,

572
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:51,639
what's going on?

573
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:52,879
I heard that

574
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,439
someone came to your mansion last night

575
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,719
and advised you not
to let Xiaoman study.

576
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,560
Who is that person?

577
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,879
Zhu Momo is here.

578
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:58,959
Who?

579
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,479
Zhu Momo?

580
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,199
She even interfered
with Hanchen's affairs?

581
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,560
That's right.

582
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,159
She was sent by my mother,

583
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:07,879
a Momo at Prince of Pu's Mansion.

584
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,399
She said, since Xiaoman
married into my family,

585
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,479
it'll be against the rules
if she goes elsewhere.

586
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,120
She even said it's our family's
internal rules for discipline.

587
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
In fact, it's just my mother's

588
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,959
idea to deal with me.

589
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,120
She's Princess Consort of Pu's nanny,

590
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,840
the most powerful elder
servant in the family.

591
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:24,879
It's not just Hanchen either.

592
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,719
Even Prince and Princess Consort of Pu

593
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,719
respect her.

594
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,399
We can't openly

595
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,560
disobey her words.

596
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,479
So, what should we do now?

597
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,520
Do we shrug Xiaoman's matter off?

598
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,800
Who says we're shrugging it off?

599
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,840
It just depends on
how we'll handle it.

600
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:38,919
After school today,

601
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,080
you'll go and keep Xiaoman
company at the mansion.

602
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,239
This old, stubborn servant
is not easy to deal with.

603
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,000
Tell Xiaoman not to oppose her.

604
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,320
What do you mean by
"it depends on how we'll handle it"?

605
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
Exactly what do you plan to do?

606
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,199
Tell her to trust me this once.

607
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,560
But there has to be a solution.

608
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,239
Yes.

609
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,239
Hanchen.

610
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:00,840
Hanchen.

611
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,439
Xingzhou.

612
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,840
That night,

613
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:07,719
were you all right?

614
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,159
I drank that day

615
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,399
and spoke nonsense.

616
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:12,959
Please don't mind.

617
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,080
Oh, right.

618
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
I went to the academy earlier

619
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,080
and realised Xiaoman wasn't there.

620
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,439
Everyone else was
acting kind of strange.

621
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,239
What's wrong?

622
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,520
It's indeed strange.

623
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,320
You can say it's unheard of.

624
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,679
That day during
Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition,

625
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:38,800
she

626
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:41,360
went on Commandery Prince's
horse carriage

627
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,840
and they somehow left the city,

628
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
and didn't come back the entire night.

629
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,479
So, when everyone heard of it,

630
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,520
she could only marry him.

631
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:50,879
Talking about this matter,

632
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,439
it also saddens me actually.

633
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,080
Lady Xie is quite studious.

634
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,239
Last time, I was the honoured guest at
her coming-of-age ceremony.

635
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,280
I found out she even read
"Esteemed Documents" before.

636
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:03,479
Yet, she's getting married.

637
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,000
Such a pity.

638
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,420
(What an amazing poem
that you've written)

639
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,080
Hit the tea whisk with force.

640
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,560
Use your force.

641
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,560
If you don't, the tea leaves
won't be leveraged.

642
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,679
Tea ceremony is
the basic skill for women.

643
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,280
Lady Xie, your poor skills

644
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
must mean you lacked
training since young.

645
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,180
(Siqi Hall)

646
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,959
Zhu Momo,

647
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,760
Lady Xie's maternal cousin,

648
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,679
Lady Su is here to visit.

649
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,199
One without manners
becomes anxious easily.

650
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,560
Continue.

651
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,239
She's only been married here for a day.

652
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,000
What's there to visit?

653
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,280
Ask her to go home.

654
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,320
Momo,

655
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,399
my cousin was closest with me

656
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,560
before I was married.

657
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,080
Please let me see her.

658
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,560
Momo,

659
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,239
Lady Su said

660
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,959
Commandery Prince gave his permission.

661
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,000
So...

662
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
Forget it, Hong Su.

663
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,679
Bring some ginger slices and plum

664
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,080
for them

665
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:16,800
to have some tea with the snacks.

666
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,080
See me in an hour's time.

667
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,320
Thank you, Momo.

668

(Siqi Hall)

00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,479
Come on.

670
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,840
Hong Su,

671
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:37,879
can you tell Momo that

672
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,080
I'll learn the tea ceremony today

673
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,080
as well as the etiquette.

674
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,560
After I learned all these,

675
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,879
can I go back to studying?

676
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
Don't worry, Lady Xie.

677
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,360
Momo may be stringent,

678
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
but she still hopes for your best.

679
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,320
However,

680
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,080
in terms of studying,

681
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,719
I agree with Momo.

682
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,239
You don't see married women
attending an academy.

683
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,239
Isn't it good for you
to just stay at home?

684
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,080
Did they torture you

685
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,399
and stop you from studying?

686
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,080
Lady, you should bring me back quickly.

687
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:21,000
Lady Xie gets the unfair treatment
at home.

688
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
Momo punished her,

689
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,239
and I also suffered.

690
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:27,080
Let me see.

691
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,000
Let me see.

692
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,280
Did they hit you?

693
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,080
Don't worry about that now.

694
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,360
I just want to go back
to my studies now.

695
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,560
Have you thought about other ways?

696
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,479
Isn't Zhao Xiaoqian going to help you?

697
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,399
You're still mentioning him.

698
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,360
Whenever he saw Momo,

699
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,560
he dare not utter a single word.

700
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,959
Look, today,

701
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,439
he doesn't even come back after school.

702
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:52,919
Men's words

703
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:54,000
can never be trusted.

704
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:56,560
Why do you keep talking?

705
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:57,560
Get down.

706
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,439
Although I don't know

707
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,719
why we have to learn knowledge,

708
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:04,040
I don't wish

709
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,239
to be trapped here

710
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,520
like a bird in the cage.

711
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,280
Don't give up.

712
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,080
Zhao Xiaoqian won't help you,

713
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,800
but I will.

714
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,199
I'll help you to think of a way.

715
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:22,879
Let's go to Teacher Liu for help.

716
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,760
Teacher Liu?

717
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,439
That's right.

718
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,919
I'm talking about Teacher Liu.

719
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,199
She gave us homework today.

720
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:31,560
Dragon Boat Festival
is in two days' time.

721
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,239
She told us to write
Qu Yuan's poetry and prose,

722
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,439
and answer it on the day of the test.

723
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,439
You'll also prepare a copy at home,

724
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,239
and I'll help you bring it to
Teacher Liu

725
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:39,800
so she could plead for your sake.

726
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,959
What do you think?

727
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,080
When is the test?

728
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,959
Let me think.

729
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,560
It's the day
you'll visit your own family.

730
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,080
Support the teacup with your left hand.

731
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Be steady.

732
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,080
Exert force with your right wrist.

733
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:02,560
How many times have I told you?

734
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,840
Flick with strength.

735
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:07,439
Use your force.

736
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,260

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,679
Where's your manner?

738
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:25,040
Your hands.

739
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:32,800
