You can just call me grandma,

25

that's...

28

It's impolite to refuse an elder.

I want you to have it.

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000

Thank you, Your Ladyship.

How dare you call her grandma?

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,270
There is a saying

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,240
that gifts blind the eyes.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,270
What about the case

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,110
of living in someone else's house?

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,800

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,030
You got bad grades for the big exam.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
You don't have the credit
to judge Xiaoman.

47

Get on your knees.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
you're all on the way

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,520
of becoming a bad girl.

58
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,520
You don't get to
eat your breakfast today.

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Remain on your knees here.

Ugh...

63

Are you here to report me?

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
You burned my test paper.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
And you burned my receipt.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
I have all the reason to report you.

It seems

74
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,550
(Receipt)
you were looking for this last night.

75
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,670
Give it back to me!

76
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,920
Give it back to me!

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,670
Listen,

78
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,760

79
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200
you'll never get this back.

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,070
How dare you!

81
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,880
You're crazy.

82
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,230
You heard its sound.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,350
You know what you should do.

84
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,160

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,640
even if I don't tear this paper apart,

86
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,350
you'll never

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,160
get to see it again.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,720
You filthy rat!

89
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,950
There are many things

90
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,880
that I chose not to do.

91

If I really am a filthy rat,

92
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,350
do you think you'll make it here today?

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,350
What are you doing?

94
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
It's your call.

95
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,000
You...

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,550
What's going on here?

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,880
Nothing.

98
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,390
I'm here to ask
about the Spring Banquet.

99
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,270
Come with me.

102
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,390
is all about pure thoughts.

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,350
The Spring Banquet
is a traditional occasion

104
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,920
for commenting on poems.

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
You're new here.

106
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,350
Perhaps you don't have enough time

107
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,720
for this.

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,790
Poems are not necessarily
made up of fancy words.

109
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,040
Pure thoughts,

110
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,110
it means gentlemen are always honest

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
and honorable.

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,670
They say

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,880
what they mean.

114
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,720
They do what they want.

115
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,000

118

I checked your test paper.

119
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,230
You got B.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,350
I had problems
understanding many things.

121
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
You need to work on it.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
I surely will.

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,670
Also,

124
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,830
I will prove myself innocent.

125
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,110

The pattern...

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,350
Xiaoman,

130
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,440
don't touch it.

131
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,350
(Is he Commandery Prince of Julu?)

132
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,350
Put it down.

133
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
Are you Commandery Prince of Julu?

134
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,350
I am asking you to put it down.

135
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,440
Give me my receipt first.

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,420
(Receipt)

137
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,230
Are you

138
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,600
looking for this?

139
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,790
You...

You...

142
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,080
The sword tassel is a keepsake
of Hanchen's brother.

143
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,760
Hanchen was close to Dalang.

144
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,590
After Dalang's death,

145
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,590
Hanchen came to Wujiang Prefecture
for recovery.

146
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,320
It has been four years.

147
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,470
These keepsakes

148
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,150
mean the whole world to him.

149
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,440
He was impolite to you today.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,110
Please don't be offended.

151
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,200
If these receipts

152
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,230
are very important to you,

153
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,960
I will have them repaired

154
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,790
and delivered to your residence.

155
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,670
Keepsakes?

156
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,880
He can't be
the Commandery Prince of Julu.

157
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,710
Check this paragraph out.

158
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,960
I really am a genius!

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
One should have good manners.

161
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,400
It's impolite to lose one's manners.

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,550
Where is your demeanor?

163
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,000
The Prince is mad at someone.

164
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,470
What happened?

165
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,640
He has been practicing archery
all this afternoon.

166
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,320
He looks very mad.

167
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,150
Sanniang,

168
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,350
was she who
got the Commandery Prince mad?

169
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,110
- Sanniang
- It's none of our business.

170
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,910
Let's focus on our embroidery.

171
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,230
Get over there.

172
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,790
Hurry up.

173
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't be afraid.

174
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,710
You're not in trouble.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,230
Besides, you're here to comfort him.

176
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,790
He is the Commandery Prince.

177
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,030
I'm the daughter of a sub-prefect.

178
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,030
I...

179
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,400
I dare not.

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
Would you do it for me?

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,110
I...

182
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,350
Miss Xue,

183
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,470
please bear this in mind.

184
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,590
I see.

185
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,910
It was Xie Xiaoman, the newcomer,

186
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,670
who offended you.

187
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,080
Hanchen, let's go.

188
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,000
She will pay for that.

189
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,350
I'd like

190
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,080
to hear your plan.

191
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,960
Her father Xie Yu is my uncle,

192
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,350
the second son of my grandfather.

193
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,880
Upon my grandfather's death,

194
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,520
his father wanted
to separate and live apart.

195
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,440
Now her father does the paperwork.

196
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,550
Back then,

197
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
her father was a coroner.

198
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,080
Let's go.

199
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,580
(Jingnv Pavilion)

200
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,960
Sanniang.

201
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,110
Check this out.

202
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,200
It's said he used to be a coroner.

203
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,520
He turned to paperwork

204
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,790
because he wanted his son to succeed.

205
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
How did a coroner's daughter
make it here?

206
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,280
A coroner?

207
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,910
That means dealing with the dead bodies.

208
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,550
She could be

209
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,280
a jinx.

210
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,200
What's wrong being a coroner?

211
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,640
Maybe it is all
due to your own ignorance.

212
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,440
The debris in spring rain.

213
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,140
(Xiaoman's poem)

214
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,550
What's that about?

215
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
That's so cheesy.

216
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,320
You don't deserve to make poems.

217
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,640
That's right.

218
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,670
Indeed.

219
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,340
(Bailu Academy)

220
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,760
Young lady,

221
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,000
you're still here.

222
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,470
I thought you left

223
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,960
with the Su family.

224
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,320
So what?

225
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,840
My father used to be coroner.

226
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,200
Your Highness,

227
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,550
do you want to belittle me, too?

228
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,550
There's nothing wrong with
being a coroner.

229
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,320
Are the noble people
born with their standing?

230
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,550
Being the daughter of a coroner

231
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,350
is nothing to be ashamed of.

232
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Listen,

233
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,320
no matter who you are,

234
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,000
you and I

235
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,640
are enemies.

236
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Let's go.

237
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,230
What got into you?

238
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,880
How could you make such a big mistake?

239
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,640
My apologies.

240
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,790
I'll make sure

241
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,230
it won't happen again.

242
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,470
Please give me a second chance.

243
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,440
Okay.

244
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,960
You will not have a second chance.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,790
Take care, My Lord.

246
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,000
Take care.

247
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,790
Mao...Maoya.

248
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,030
Dad.

249
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,880
You...

250
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,080
What are you doing here?

251
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,280
Where is Minggu?

252
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,470
We got separated.

253
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,320
I wanted to take a walk.

254
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,790
How did you get separate?

255
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,280
Hey,

256
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,840
what happened to your eyes?

257
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,230
Are you alright?

258
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,840
There was dust in my eyes.

259
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,790
I rubbed my eyes.

260
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,150
I see.

261
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,080
Did you eat?

262
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,640
It's my payday today.

263
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,840
Tell me what you want to eat.

264
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,000
I want to have noodles.

265
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,200
Let's go.

266
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,400
Dad.

267
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,520
- Have more.
- Have more.

268
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,910
You mom said,

269
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,520
I'm getting too fat

270
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,790
to have meat.

271
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,520
You have it, come on.

272
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,670
Come on.

273
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,910
Come on.

274
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:01,960
Come on.

275
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,710
Dad,

276
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,030
can I ask you one question?

277
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,350
Sure, go ahead.

278
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,640
Did you become a coroner

279
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,880
because you have passion for this job?

280
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,910
Seemed like a weird question.

281
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,910
In today's world,

282
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,470
I'd like any job

283
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,110
as long as it enables me
to support my family.

284
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,790
"Are the noble people
born with their standing?"

285
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,400
What does that mean?

286
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,200
Well,

287
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,790
it means warriors come in
all shapes and sizes.

288
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,670
A person is not to be judged
by his family background.

289
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,350
Why do you ask?

290
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,640
You heard this sentence back at school?

291
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,030
Hurry up and eat.

292
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,200
You'll go back soon,

293
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,200
or your uncle and auntie
will get worried.

294
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,960
Hurry up.

295
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,350
Miss Xie.

296
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,190
Miss Xie is back.

297
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,640
It's too late.

298
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,110
Please come back earlier next time.

299
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,040
We don't have strict rules
in this house.

300
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,040
But coming back home late
is not good for you.

301
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,680
I see, nanny.

302
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,470
It was my dad who sent me back.

303
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,520
That's reassuring.

304
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,710
Nanny,

305
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,160
can I have an embroidery book?

306
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,540
(Gentleman tassel)

307
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,400
It's called gentleman tassel.

308
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,430
(Bailu Academy)
What about your poems?

309
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,190
Needless to say,

310
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,520
I'll get grade A.

311
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,040
What about the Spring Banquet?

312
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Are you well-prepared?

313
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,920
Certainly.

314
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,470
- Let's go.
- Right.

315
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't think so.

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,160
She is your cousin, after all.

317
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,560
Besides,

318
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,950
if words got around,

319
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,430
your reputation will be at stake.

320
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,190
Reputation?

321
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,280
Her father wanted to separate
and live apart from us.

322
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,400
They were being shameless.

323
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,760
Why should I care?

324
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,470
Look.

325
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,520
Dear Xiaoman.

326
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,040
There is no free lunch.

327
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,400
You must be up to something.

328
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,880
There are Spring Banquet refreshments
in the kitchen.

329
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,000
Get some for me.

330
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,680
Ruying, I'm not your slave girl.

331
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm elder than you.

332
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,430
You should do as I say.

333
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,040
If you won't do it,

334
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,950
I'll tell grandma later on.

335
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,070
By then,

336
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,710
your parents will be suffering.

337
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,520
Anyone there?

338
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,040
Did you see Xie Xiaoman?

339
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,310
Not that I recall.

340
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,640
Spring breeze, beautiful trees,

341
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,830
stable sound, falling flowers,

342
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,920
days are passing.

343
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,520
Sigh "how time flies"
by depicting spring scenery,

344
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520
clever stroke.

345
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,000
Replace "days are passing"

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,110
with "time is speeding by",

347
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,640
that will be a nicer way

348
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,040
to depict the profound laws of nature.

349
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,470
Thank you, Sir.

350
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,430
Precisely.

351
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,350
Where is Xie Xiaoman?

352
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,400
Why should I know?

353
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,950
You sent her to the kitchen
to fetch refreshments.

354
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,350
She hasn't come back yet.

355
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,520
You should know where she is.

356
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,640
I wrote a poem a few days ago.

357
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,040
Have you heard about it?

358
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,280
It seems Director Xu

359
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,710
has reported our grades

360
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,310
to our parents.

361
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,230
Really?

362
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,350
Yeah.

363
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,710
Did you tell them on me?

364
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,310
Did you set me up

365
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,160
because you were afraid

366
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I'd tell parents

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,760
that you burned the test papers?

368
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,830
Xie Xiaoman,

369
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
good for you.

370
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
Good for you.

371
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,190
(Did I misunderstand her?)

372
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,350
(She wasn't a snitch.)

373
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,680
(How dare you burn the exam papers?)

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,560
(I didn't.)

375
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,310
You tried to cheat in the exam in vain,

376
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,280
so you burnt the papers.

377
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Who else could have done it
if it weren't you?

378
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
I didn't. I'm telling the truth.

379
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,710
You actually did burn my receipt?

380
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,710
Yes.

381
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,880
I threw it into the fire.

382
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,160
So what?

383
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,070
Kneel down!

384
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
Kneel and apologize!

385
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,520
Minggu.

386
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,350
Xiaoman.

387
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,520
You...

388
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,400
You...

389
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,880
What happened to you?

390
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,590
You...

391
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,230
You might need this.

392
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,070
The Spring Banquet is about to begin.

393
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Wipe this down.

394
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
Otherwise,
the teacher will lecture you again.

395
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,520
Thank you.

396
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,430
I don't need you to be grateful.

397
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,880
You were silly

398
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,800
for trusting Xie Ruying
and her sidekicks.

399
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,800
Now, get yourself cleaned.

400
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,190
Use the water

401
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,310
and wash yourself.

402
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,520
It wasn't me

403
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,560
who reported you.

404
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,190
I know.

405
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,110
Wang Weicheng?

406
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,070
Here.

407
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,590
Lang Mengzi?

408
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,230
Here.

409
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,950
Xie Xiaoman?

410
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,760
Xie Xiaoman?

411
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,310
Xie Xiaoman?

412
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,350
Absence will be considered
as abstention.

413
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,180
(Principal of Bailu Academy,
Yang Chidao)

414
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,110
I'm here.

415
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,560
It's rude

416
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,470
to appear like that.

417
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,190
According to Historical Records,

418
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,710
sometimes, it's unwise to focus too much

419
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
on the smallest details.

420
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,470
We're having the Spring Banquet today,

421
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,310
of which the theme is creating poems.

422
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,070
Let's get over trivial things.

423
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,640
May I hear your poem?

424
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,760
Endless spring, sleepless willows,

425
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,800
the lonely crescent
and the lonely stars.

426
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,800
I will always be nostalgic

427
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,560
about Yuyangli, my hometown.

428
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,310
That's it?

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,430
Actually, I wrote a complete poem.

430
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,950
Congwen told me
honorable people have pure thoughts

431
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,640
and would say whatever they mean.

432
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,310
I was thinking about this.

433
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
So, I wrote about this.

434
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,000
You are excused.

435
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,590
I have something to say.

436
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,710
Go ahead, please.

437
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
What I want to say is

438
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,520
Yuyangli is my hometown.

439
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,040
I was born

440
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,310
and raised in Yuyangli.

441
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,190
It is not a well-known place.

442
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,830
But never did I think

443
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,560
being born in Yuyangli

444
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,760
is something inferior
to those born in Wujiang.

445
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,280
Honorable people
have nothing to be ashamed of.

446
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,680
I'm an upright person.

447
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,350
I'm not afraid of what people say.

448
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,560
It is great ambition
that makes a man great.

449
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,350
It means,

450
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,280
a person is not to be judged
by his family background.

451
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,880
Each of you

452
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,760
is from a prestigious family

453
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,110
and is well-educated.

454
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,520
However,

455
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,000
talking about people behind their back,

456
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,640
is that what you learn

457
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,520
from the books?

458
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,230
If you act like this,

459
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,280
how are you gonna carry forward
the power of wisdom

460
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,190
and bring peace to the world?

461
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,400
Well said!

462
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,350
- Well said!
- Well said!

463
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,230
Brilliant!

464
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,230
What are you doing?

465
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,560
We villagers believe in

466
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,470
"an eye for an eye".

467
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,190
You splashed ink powder on me.

468
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,040
I will pay you back with ink.

469
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,800
You don't want to do this.

470
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,830
Barbarian.

471
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,520
Well,

472
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,950
I'm not you.

473
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
I won't do those barbaric things

474
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,830
like you.

475
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,230
My father used to be a coroner.

476
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,280
It seems you look down on him,

477
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,520
and talk ill of him

478
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,280
because of his job.

479
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,110
However, my father doesn't steal or rob.

480
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,350
He supported
the whole family on his own.

481
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,920
He is a perfectly honest man.

482
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,920
He is respectful.

483
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,040
Gentlemen have pure thoughts.

484
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,830
Bravo!

485
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,640
Principal.

486
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,640
Xiaoman.

487
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,190
Let me take you
to wash those ashes away.

488
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,190
Being knowledgeable,
asking good questions,

489
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,190
reflecting carefully,
knowing the difference,

490
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
practicing earnestly,

491
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,880
these are the underlying principles
of this academic institution.

492
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,310
I want you to become
that kind of person.

493
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,280
That's the end of it.

494
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,160
Don't make the same mistake again.

495
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,560
You made a wonderful poem today.

496
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,590
You got A for that.

497
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,470
Get yourself cleaned.

498
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,220
(Principal Office)

499
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,070
You go.

500
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,800
Now I got to come clean.

501
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,430
I burned the test paper.

502
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,430
I knew about this.

503
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,070
What else do you want to say?

504
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,640
It seems you knew this all along.

505
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,430
But you just let it go.

506
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,560
You talk too bluntly.

507
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,760
You and Xiaojie have nothing in common.

508
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,760
We were not the same type.

509
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,350
Your father wants you
to go back to the capital

510
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,680
and enroll in the Imperial Academy.

511
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,560
I know.

512
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,950
If you want to tell on me,

513
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,400
I will not disagree.

514
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,230
And you? Do you want me to tell?

515
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,280
I was invited to the palace

516
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,350
to teach you and Xiaojie.

517
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,520
A naughty kid,

518
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,230
you were capable of
reciting the Great Learning.

519
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,470
Being an honest man

520
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,040
means always being honest to oneself.

521
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,350
You're a grown man now.

522
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,000
You have your own problems to solve.

523
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,950
Xiaoman.

524
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,400
Uncle Liangji,

525
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,680
(Catalog for Books)
I didn't touch the sword tassel.

526
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,760
I made a new one.

527
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,560
When the weaver comes,

528
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,950
she can have it repaired
based on my model.

529
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,040
I always think you're ingenious.

530
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,560
It turns out I'm right.

531
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,710
How much do I owe you?

532
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,950
It's for free, Uncle Liangji.

533
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,950
I owe this to you.

534
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,520
And this.

535
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,400
I made this booklet.

536
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,070
It tells you

537
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,280
where to put the books.

538
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,190
Just let me know

539
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,310
when new books have arrived.

540
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,310
I will write new books
in the blank space.

541
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,020
(Catalog for Books)

542
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,310
There are many books I can't figure out.

543
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,470
I'm not sure how to classify them.

544
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,640
So, I write them in the last column.

545
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,040
Good, good.

546
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,400
That's really good.

547
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,560
It's getting late.

548
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm going back home,

549
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,830
or my family will worry about me.

550
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,420
(Keep Calm And Stay Focused)

551
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,160
I owe this to you?

552
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,310
Your Highness.

553
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,070
Your Highness.

554
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,310
Look at the sword tassel.

555
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,920
They look exactly the same.

556
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,800
It's made by a new maid

557
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,920
in our house.

558
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,880
She is good at this.

559
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,800
Who made this?

560
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,880
The new maid in the study.

561
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,350
She just left.

562
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,880
Where are you going?

563
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,580
(Be Courteous, Be Silent)

564
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,110
I'm here. I'm here.

565
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,070
Why you?

566
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,110
I want to reclaim our farmland.

567
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,680
It turns out you're endowed
with the farmland.

568
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,400
So, I'm here to work for your family.

569
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,560
Do you know the name
of that sword tassel?

570
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,350
It's called the gentleman tassel.

571
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,800
According to Confucius,

572
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,160
a gentleman has three qualities:

573
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,710
carefree because he is benevolent,

574
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,880
confident because he is wise,

575
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,230
fearless because he is brave.

576
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,400
Your Highness,

577
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,400
it seems you have a long way to go.

578
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,230
You...

579
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,880
Your Highness,

580
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,120
I'm sorry for being rude.

581
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,670
I've done my job

582
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,190
to solve our past issues.

583
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,390
Your Highness, I will start working here

584
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,840
and your tolerance will be appreciated.

585
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,870
I want to reclaim our farmland,

586
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,600
exactly as it was.

587
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,760
You're so skinny.

588
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,340
(Bailu Academy)

589
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,390
It's Wujiang Prefecture School again.

590
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,670
It's nothing but a cuju competition.

591
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,000
We're just scholars.

592
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,280
It's going too far.

593
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,840
That's right.

594
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,230
That's way out of the line.

595
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,390
Putting white flags in our ground.

596
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,150
The cuju competition.

597
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,670
That's right.

598
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,520
Bailu Academy
versus Wujiang Prefecture School.

599
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,870
I heard that Wujiang Prefecture School
is a government-run school.

600
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,670
That's right.

601
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,190
They just won't leave us alone.

602
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,000
They cause so much trouble.

603
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,320
Xu Shu.

604
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,670
My Lord.

605
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,980
(Shen Yan, courtesy name Junxia)

606
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,840
Where is Zhao Xiaoqian?

607
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,000
Why isn't he here yet?

608
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,560
Well.

609
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,870
(Xu Shu, son of the transportation
officer of Western Zhejiang Province)

610
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,230
He slept in.

611
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,780
(Wujiang Prefecture School)

612
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,840
Release!

613
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,040
Okay.

614
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,670
Wonderful!

615
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,360
Hanchen, good for you.

616
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,840
You got your guards here.

617
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,870
Mr. Qin,

618
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,040
His Highness is being childish.

619
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,520
You play along as well?

620
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,190
His Majesty sent us

621
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,150
to Wujiang Prefecture

622
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,390
to look after His Highness,

623
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,390
making sure

624
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,840
no one can bully him.

625
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,230
There are only about
one hundred people here.

626
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,150
Nothing can go wrong.

627
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,840
But,

628
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,600
you're too mature for such a young age.

629
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,190
You don't act like a young man at all.

630
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,080
Maybe you should learn
from His Highness.

631
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,870
Your Highness,

632
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,600
it has been done.

633
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,870
We should leave now.

634
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,190
People will get scared if we stay here.

635
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,670
Good job.

636
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,760
You're having additional meat

637
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,040
for today's supper.

638
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,760
Thanks, Your Highness.

639
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,710
- Thanks, Your Highness.
- Thanks, Your Highness.

640
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,600
Let's go.

641
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,520
Hanchen,

642
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,520
is it true that you're leaving?

643
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,040
If so,

644
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,870
I want to have your horse
for a few days.

645
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,760
Boyang,

646
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,760
it's a ferghana horse

647
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,360
from Dawan,

648
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,390
a gift from His Majesty.

649
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,150
It has been with Hanchen
back from the capital.

650
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,870
That's right.

651
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,280
How dare you

652
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,150
ask me for it?

653
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,870
Come on, what's the big deal?

654
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,040
You're so mean.

655
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,120
Are you going back to the capital

656
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,870
to get married with Shen Zhaowen?

657
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,870
In that case,

658
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,670
Shen Yan is your brother-in-law.

659
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,840
How can you do that to him?

660
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,150
Who told you that I'm getting married?

661
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,040
Are you out of your mind?

662
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,280
Hey,

663
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,360
are the meals of our house terrible

664
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,320
these days?

665
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,800
The maids,

666
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,870
are becoming skinny.

667
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,000
Who?

668
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,560
Who are getting skinny?

669
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,320
I found my study messy

670
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,230
after today's school.

671
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,000
Ask Liangji to get Xie Xiaoman

672
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,840
to work for me.

673
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,840
Aye.

674
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,560
Hey,

675
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,670
Xie Xiaoman,

676
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,000
the girl of the Bailu Academy,

677
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,870
is working for you?

678
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,670
It's none of your business.

679
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,120
When did Xie Xiaoman
start working for you?

680
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,820
(Delicacy Restaurant)

681
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,080
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

682
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,670
Nope.

683
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,040
(Student Lang Mengzi and Aying)
Are you Xie Xiaoman,

684
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,760
the lady at the Spring Banquet?

685
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,230
You did a really brilliant job

686
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,600
that day.

687
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,600
That's right.

688
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,630
You were being so brave!

689
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,760
You're nothing like the ladies

690
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,670
in this academic institution.

691
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,190
Will you make refreshments

692
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,870
in the school kitchen tomorrow?

693
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,670
Make refreshment?

694
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,840
The day after tomorrow
marks the Cold Food Festival,

695
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,630
by which time there will be
a cuju competition.

696
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,670
You didn't know that?

697
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,870
That's a tradition here.

698
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,390
The boys will be playing the ball game
on the Cold Food Festival.

699
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,630
The girls will prepare refreshments
for them,

700
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,870
to cheer them up.

701
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,320
The Cold Food Festival
bears many meanings.

702
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,870
Some girls will try to impress her crush

703
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,760
by offering refreshments.

704
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,840
Some will express their gratitude
to their elders.

705
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,080
It depends on the recipients.

706
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,630
Go ask him. Go ask him.

707
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,560
Or else it'll be too late.

708
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,670
May I ask

709
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,560
what kind of dessert you like?
