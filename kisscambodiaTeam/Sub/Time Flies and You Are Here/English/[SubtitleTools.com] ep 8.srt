(Siqi Hall)

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Where are your manners?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,319
Your hands.

24
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,120
Hanchen.

25
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,039
Did you forget what you said?

26
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,800
We mustn't alert the opponent.

27
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,000
Momo, do not

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,039
be aggravated.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
She's just a mere concubine.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,839
She's not capable of anything.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,039
You should get some rest.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Your Highness is right.

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
She's but a concubine.

34
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,880
In this world,

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,199
there are many who
don't know their places.

36
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,639
A concubine may be favoured right now,

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
and she wants to pursue her studies.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,479
Not long after that,

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
she's going to covet after
the position as the first wife.

40
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,880
Who knows?

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
You're right, Zhu Momo.

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,839
She will not get what she wants.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
Continue the learning tomorrow.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Continue.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,479
Did you manage to figure something out?

46
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:16,720
Yes.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Mother wants me to marry Shen Zhaowen.

48
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,039
We cannot offend Shen Family.

49
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,520
Are you going to beg Shen Yan?

50
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:22,839
Who said I'm going to beg him?

51
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,919
We're exchanging terms.

52
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,559
By the way, Mr. Liangji,

53
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,320
are the gifts to welcome
Xiaoman's return

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,199
prepared?

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,839
I'll select some goods
from the inventory.

56
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm not sure about the specifications.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,639
The specifications to marry a wife.

58
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,199
I'll return with her when the day comes.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,039
Also,

60
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,759
fetch me some ointment.

61
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,080
I'm going to check on her.

62
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:44,600
All right.

63
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,240
Hanchen.

64
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,800
Although we owe Xiaoman big time,

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
you need to bear a sense of propriety.

66
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,360
You mustn't

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,839
treat her like the first wife.

68
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,119
If such a hope is evoked in her,

69
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,559
it's only going to harm her.

70
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,199
There are things

71
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,759
I owe her.

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,559
Whatever she seeks, within my means,

73
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,320
I'll fulfil them.

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,039
Do you understand?

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,200
The moment you can rely on a man

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,799
is when sows are able to climb trees.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,679
Sows are able to climb tree?

78
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,559
Climb a tree and show me.

79
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,440
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,640
Show me your hands.

81
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,359
I'm applying the medication for you.

82
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,760
Your hands.

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,480
Did you come just to do this?

84
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,640
Yes.

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
You're such a fool.

86
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,720
You should butter Zhu Momo up.

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,559
Say something flattering.

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,839
You'd willingly go through
the troubles she caused you.

89
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
She was wrong.

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,279
Why should I compromise?

91
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,440
Did you know

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,480
for married women to return
to the academy,

93
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,920
they'd turn into a laughing stock?

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,200
A laughing stock?

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,920
Pursuing studies will be made a joke,

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,679
but attending to
trivial matters of the house

97
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:27,880
is more important?

98
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,320
Both of us are married by contract.

99
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,399
After two years,

100
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,799
we no longer have anything
to do with each other.

101
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,359
If I'm not concerned of
my future right now,

102
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,079
after two years,

103
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,839
do you want me to end up

104
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,559
from one backyard to another?

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,839
We shall go our own ways
after two years?

106
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:47,959
Fine.

107
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,880
Forget about the academy.

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,320
You...

109
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,239
Wick was right.

110
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
The moment you can rely on a man

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
is when sows are able to climb trees.

112
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,940
(Qu Yuan's Poem)

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,600
Congwen.

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,519
You're dismissed.

116
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,679
I heard about Xiaoman

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
and His Highness's incident.

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,839
Xiaoman was absent
from the academy today.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,279
I figured something
must have happened.

120
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,559
I came to see

121
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,000
if there's anything I can do to help.

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,239
On the day of Xiaoman's wedding,

123
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,760
I sent someone to deliver
a message to you

124
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
at the brothel.

125
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,799
However, you did not show up.

126
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,519
I was unaware of this matter.

127
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,480
Well,

128
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,559
it no longer matters now.

129
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,399
Xiaoman is married now.

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,320
Besides, she has a huge
trouble to deal with right now.

131
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,720
Zhu Momo came from the capital.

132
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,320
She forbade Xiaoman from
pursuing her studies.

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,760
I wanted to take her

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,200
to meet Teacher Liu on
the day of examination

135
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,720
and seek help from Teacher Liu.

136
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,799
However, it seems like...

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,119
Even Teacher Liu wouldn't
be able to help her.

138
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,359
At this point,

139
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,279
Principal Yang is the only
one that could help her.

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,559
On the day of the examination,

141
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,839
try your best to help Xiaoman

142
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,200
take the test at the academy.

143
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,079
I'll submit Xiaoman's test papers

144
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,119
to Principal Yang Chidao.

145
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,279
Principal Yang is highly respectable
in Wujiang Prefecture.

146
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,799
Back at the palace,
Commandery Prince of Julu

147
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,160
was tutored by Principal Yang.

148
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
In the whole of Wujiang Prefecture,

149
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,399
Principal Yang is the only one who can

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
control Zhao Xiaoqian.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,839
Leave it to me.

152
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,440
All you have to do is bring
Xiaoman to the academy.

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,119
What's the matter?

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,600
Nothing.

155
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:26,760
I shall thank you

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,959
on Xiaoman's behalf, Congwen.

157
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,399
I'm going to

158
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,559
deliver a message to
Commandery Prince's Mansion right now.

159
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,860
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

160
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,479
Lady.

161
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,440
Since you've

162
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,479
gained His Highness's
grace to return home,

163
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,039
you should enjoy your time there.

164
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,239
I informed

165
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,599
Zhu Momo about this.

166
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,559
There's no need for you
to return urgently.

167
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,919
Spent some time with your family.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
The gifts

169
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,359
are all packed up by Mr. Liangji.

170
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,400
Lady Xie, hurry up.

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,760
I'm coming.

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,840
I'll return as soon as possible.

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,479
Lady Xie did not bring
any attendants along.

174
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,239
Xie Family will be troubled

175
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,159
to carry the gift on their own.

176
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,679
Tag along and help with the goods.

177
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,080
Yes.

178
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,400
Stop the carriage.

179
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,159
Go ahead.

180
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,080
My sister will be waiting for me here.

181
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,799
Zhu Momo ordered for us

182
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
to send you right to your door step.

183
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:43,880
Besides, there's a carriage of goods...

184
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,479
How about this?

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,919
Go ahead and return.

186
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,440
My sister and I are going
to buy some baked bread.

187
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,039
It's my father's favourite.

188
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:50,640
After that,

189
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,359
my sister and I will return home
on her carriage.

190
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:53,559
All right.

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,119
I would like some baked bread, too.

192
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,520
You should leave first.

193
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,599
After Xiaoman and I are done,

194
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,440
we will come to you.

195
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,400
Go on.

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,440
My mother could barely wait.

197
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:13,760
Let's hurry.

198
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,559
Otherwise, we wouldn't make it.

199
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,119
You haven't told me

200
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,599
why I should take
the examination at the academy.

201
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:18,599
It doesn't matter.

202
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,719
I'll not cause you harm.

203
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,599
Where's our carriage?

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,559
It's arriving soon.

205
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,119
Give it a moment.

206
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,260
(Brothel)

207
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,599
Get on.

208
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,280
Gnaw on it.

209
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,559
Give it a bite.

210
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,440
Bite on it.

211
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,679
Bite on it.

212
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,599
Yes, attack.

213
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,159
Bite it.

214
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,320
Come on.

215
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,719
Zhao Xiaoqian,

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,679
what happens if you lose?

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,359
It's your call

218
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,559
under one condition.

219
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,479
You're troubling me
with the matters of your family.

220
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,960
You insist to play a bet with me.

221
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,440
If it wasn't for your brother's sake,

222
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,479
I couldn't be bothered.

223
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,200
Shut up.

224
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,719
If it wasn't for you,

225
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,799
things wouldn't have ended up this way.

226
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,239
Don't worry though.

227
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm one to concede defeat.

228
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,599
Same goes to you.

229
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,479
Attack.

230
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,039
That's right.

231
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,799
Jin Guo, advance.

232
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,200
Advance.

233
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,479
Ming Guan.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Good job!

235
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,840
Zhao Xiaoqian.

236
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,559
It's your turn

237
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,919
to obey me now.

238
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,479
Come on.

239
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,479
Come on.

240
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,599
Shen Yan.

241
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,719
Do not carry this too far.

242
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,039
Are you refusing me?

243
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,679
Fine.

244
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,479
The one who said he'd concede defeat

245
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,719
wasn't me anyway.

246
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,679
Let's go.

247
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,960
Hold up.

248
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,039
I concur.

249
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,679
I admit my defeat this time.

250
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,840
However, if you failed to

251
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,119
accomplish the task I ordered you to,

252
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:51,400
the conflict between us
will not be easily

253
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,320
resolved at the racing ground.

254
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,719
I know what the old servant of yours

255
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:55,840
is thinking.

256
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,559
She wants to make me your relative.

257
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,479
Dream on.

258
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,840
If my sister is married to you,

259
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
my name is no longer Shen Yan.

260
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,599
Zhao,

261
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,799
what are you doing over there?

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,960
Hurry up and get ready.

263
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,440
Leave

264
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,239
the rest to me, Master Shen.

265
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:27,799
We'll see.

266
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,599
Hurry up.

267
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,919
We're running out of time.

268
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,840
The class is commencing.

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,840
We're running late. Hurry.

270
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,280
Hurry.

271
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,460
(Jingnv Pavilion)

272
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,559
Xiaoman.

273
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,479
Don't worry.

274
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,840
No one would find out.

275
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,760
This is the best solution for now.

276
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,760
Don't think about anything else.

277
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,599
Just take the test.

278
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,400
Don't worry about the rest.

279
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,320
Leave it to me.

280
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,359
We shall head on inside then.

281
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,840
Let's go.

282
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,500
(Jingnv Pavilion)

283
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,760
Return to your seats.

284
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:28,919
What is she doing here?

285
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
She's shameless.

286
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,520
Cut it out.

287
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,520
All right. Everyone is present.

288
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,000
Fellow ladies,

289
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,159
you may begin.

290
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,320
Hongsu.

291
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,640
Hongsu.

292
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,239
What's the matter?

293
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,479
Has Lady Xie returned?

294
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,520
No.

295
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,599
I witnessed with my own eyes.

296
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,080
Lady Xie did not return home.

297
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,559
She went straight to Bailu Academy.

298
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,239
Head to the academy

299
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
and inform master about this.

300
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,479
Don't let master make an empty trip.

301
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,280
All right.

302
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:45,799
Hongsu.

303
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Why are you in a daze?

304
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,080
You look troubled.

305
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,320
Don't worry.

306
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,359
Lady Xie

307
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,119
will not be able to last any longer.

308
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,799
Master doesn't care about her.

309
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
She will be gone in a few days.

310
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,799
By then, once we return to the capital,

311
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,640
great fortune and wealth
will be awaiting you.

312
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,159
Momo.

313
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,340
(Delicacy Restaurant)

314
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,359
This bowl of quail soup is horrendous.

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,760
It's nothing compared to the
one from Taiping Tavern.

316
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,119
In my opinion,

317
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,119
it's time to switch out

318
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,080
the chef of Delicacy Restaurant.

319
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,159
You should recruit
my family's chef instead.

320
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,719
My mother hired the chef all
the way from Hangzhou for me.

321
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,599
His dish, West Lake Fish in
Vinegar Gravy is extraordinary.

322
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:41,719
Are you attempting to
hog things from home?

323
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,239
Bring it over.

324
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,280
That's enough.

325
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,599
By the way,

326
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,799
Zhao,

327
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,039
what did you promise Shen Yan?

328
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,719
After speaking to him,

329
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,919
he exerted arrogance.

330
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,080
It's irritating to watch.

331
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,799
Try addressing me by Zhao once more.

332
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,080
I was wrong.

333
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,119
Brother Zhao.

334
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,840
What did you promise him?

335
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,919
It's none of your concern.

336
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,880
A great man knows when to yield.

337
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm making a compromise for my wife.

338
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,559
Leave it.

339
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,320
Yes.

340
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,679
Don't you find it strange?

341
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,559
Zhu Momo

342
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,039
wouldn't listen to a
single word you say.

343
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,880
Why would she listen to Shen Yan?

344
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,159
Zhu Momo wants Hanchen

345
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,039
to marry Shen Zhaowen.

346
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,440
Shen Yan

347
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
is the biological brother
of Shen Zhaowen.

348
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,359
To Zhu Momo,

349
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,080
Shen Yan is Hanchen's brother-in-law.

350
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,479
Zhu Momo may offend anyone

351
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,840
but the Shen Family.

352
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,479
If Shen Yan claims that

353
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,880
his sister enjoys studying,

354
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:39,760
and hopes the same

355
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,280
for the rest of the women of the family,

356
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,080
that way,

357
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,559
Zhu Momo will no longer stop

358
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,440
Xiaoman from pursuing her studies.

359
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,640
Do you understand?

360
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,719
Not bad, Zhao Xiaoqian.

361
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,000
You have a way of messing
with the elders.

362
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,719
Please enlighten me.

363
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,799
I'll be able to deal
with my father then.

364
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,000
Master.

365
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,320
Lady Xie did not return home.

366
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,559
She went straight to Bailu Academy.

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,520
Hanchen.

368
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,479
Wait, we're not finished yet.

369
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,980
(Jingnv Pavilion)

370
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,000
Your Highness.

371
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,319
This is the academy,

372
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,959
not the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

373
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,640
Zhao Xiaoqian.

374
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,719
What's going on?

375
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,599
They are all maidens of nobility.

376
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,839
If you barge in,

377
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,880
it'd be inappropriate.

378
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,839
You're secretly dating my concubine.

379
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,520
Is that appropriate?

380
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,839
You may treat her as whoever you want.

381
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,199
However, this is the academy.

382
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,760
She's just a student.

383
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,680
Your claims of dating
in secret are baseless.

384
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,760
How did he manage to find me here?

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,839
One must keep calm in order
to accomplish great things.

386
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,160
Are you admitting

387
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,040
to dating Xie Xiaoman in secret?

388
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,319
Nothing is going on between both of us.

389
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,839
I just want to help her.

390
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,160
For what purpose?

391
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,439
For her to pursue studies.

392
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,959
I completed half of the discourse.

393
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,760
I have yet to complete the rest.

394
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,599
I'm sorry to let you down.

395
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:54,880
Hanchen.

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,880
Let go.

397
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Let go.

398
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,000
Are you done?

399
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,199
Thank you.

400
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,640
I did my best.

401
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,000
Why didn't you tell me

402
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:18,400
about heading to the academy?

403
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,239
Did you think I wouldn't
be able to help you?

404
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,040
Say something.

405
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:23,959
Yes.

406
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,839
Did you think he will be
able to help you instead?

407
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
He's just a mere scholar.

408
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,760
Are you underestimating me
or overestimating him?

409
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,599
My apologies.

410
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,160
Fine.

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,760
Xie Xiaoman.

412
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,400
Keep this in mind.

413
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,839
I'm your husband.

414
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,400
Send her home.

415
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
Let's go, Lady Xie.

416
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,959
Finish your article.

417
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,000
Congwen.

418
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
This is their family matter.

419
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,040
Congwen,

420
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,400
I'll be fine.

421
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,199
Xiaoman.

422
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,280
I must speak to you.

423
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,719
Did you think by marrying you,

424
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,000
I have to submit to you completely?

425
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,239
Qu Yuan sang of the
two goddesses of Xiang.

426
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,479
They were transfigured
into divine beings.

427
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:46,160
They promised to meet by the Lake
of Dongting as the wind blows.

428
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,040
It was a moment of liberation

429
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,119
that the lovers lived for.

430
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,000
She used two of the
Nine Songs of Qu Yuan,

431
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,199
"God of the Xiang" and
"Lady of the Xiang"

432
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,959
to express the virtues of a woman.

433
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,839
That's impressive.

434
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,839
If she was a man,

435
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,119
she may be able to challenge your work.

436
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,359
It's a rarity for a woman
to be able to do so.

437
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,479
As women,

438
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,479
certain things are beyond your control.

439
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,400
I understand

440
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,119
you value your school mates.

441
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,839
I'm her senior.

442
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,199
It's my obligation to help my juniors.

443
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,040
Besides,

444
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,439
I'm indebted to her parents.

445
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,760
It's customary to help one of your own.

446
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,040
A grateful man is a man of honour.

447
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,959
However, you're not her husband.

448
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,400
Involving yourself in
helping her constantly

449
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,239
violates tradition and customs.

450
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,000
You seem intelligent,

451
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
yet you often engage in folly.

452
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm not going to intervene.

453
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,439
You need to figure it out yourself.

454
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,479
If you were Commandery Prince of Julu,

455
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,520
what will you do?

456
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,000
I understand.

457
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,719
Deliver this article
to Commandery Prince of Julu.

458
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,479
Yes, sir.

459
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,640
I read your article.

460
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:32,839
First class.

461
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,959
Li Su delivered the text to
Principal Yang.

462
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,400
I believe he'd deem it
excellent as well.

463
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,280
Are you saying that

464
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,359
Principal Yang would give me a hand?

465
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,520
As the saying goes,

466
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,439
nothing is more valuable

467
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,680
than studies.

468
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,760
However, the society believes

469
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,760
it's pointless for women to be educated.

470
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,680
Women are forced to cultivate
homemaking skills

471
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,160
in order to marry a good man.

472
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,239
Both of us are women

473
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,439
who sought education and knowledge.

474
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,520
However, we're obstructed by norms

475
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
and criticism of the society.

476
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,040
It's unfair.

477
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:09,959
Honestly,

478
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,280
when my parents asked me

479
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,640
what am I studying for,

480
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,880
before I could come to a realisation,

481
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,760
I was married off.

482
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,359
I already possess

483
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
a wealthy and comfortable life.

484
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,760
What's the point of pursuing studies?

485
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,280
The title of your article

486
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,760
evoked some thoughts in me.

487
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,000
If women are literate and educated,

488
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,040
that would indicate the flourishing
of education and arts.

489
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,119
A legacy will be formed
for generations to come.

490
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,160
Bravo.

491
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm thirsty.

492
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,560
Lady Xie

493
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,760
is pretty brilliant.

494
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,160
What does it mean?

495
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,160
For all knowledgeable bureaucrats,

496
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:56,920
they deserve

497
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,760
a woman of equal calibre as a wife

498
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,280
in order to advance civilisation.

499
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
Not bad at all.

500
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,800
Impressive.

501
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,079
The current sovereign
promotes culture and literature.

502
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:07,319
Cultivation of respectable scholars
has been ongoing for centuries.

503
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,959
The talents produced

504
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,560
could surpass both
Han and Tang Dynasty

505
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,439
at their prime.

506
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,000
However,

507
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,920
women of such calibre are rare.

508
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,599
If a woman is proficient literature

509
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,439
and composition,

510
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,719
the advancement of culture and arts

511
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,079
will surpass any dynasty

512
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,239
in history

513
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
without a single thread of regret.

514
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,000
Ziyan, you're impressive as usual.

515
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,280
You're knowledgeable.

516
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,880
Look.

517
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,239
The government values
scepticism and discernment.

518
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,400
Scholars were cultivated
over the century.

519
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,800
The birth and progress of talents will
surpass Han Dynasty and our forefathers.

520
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,239
Women of wisdom

521
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,599
are indeed rare.

522
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,719
You understood it yourself.

523
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,479
There's no need for me
to explain further.

524
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,239
Whether Principal Yang permits
you to return to school or not,

525
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,680
I hope you will never stop studying,

526
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,319
speculating and reasoning.

527
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,119
Beauty will not last.

528
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,400
Delicacies and luxuries

529
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,560
are just physical necessities.

530
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,800
Only conviction and thoughts

531
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,160
will guide you for
the rest of your life.

532
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,199
Peril can only be evaded through
constant improvement and progress.

533
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,959
I understand.

534
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,760
I'll keep your words
engraved in my heart.

535
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,079
If it's possible,

536
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,719
I would like to

537
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,760
be a wise teacher like you

538
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,079
to guide and enlighten others.

539
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,300
(Fengxue Pavilion)

540
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,599
This is a splendid discourse.

541
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,319
She dreams to become a female tutor.

542
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,920
Does she really enjoy reading so much?

543
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,319
To each their own.

544
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,959
Just like you enjoy
archery and horse riding.

545
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,680
Why?

546
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
To understand the truth.

547
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,560
She's unreasonable,

548
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,280
what's the truth she seeks?

549
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,560
Ban Zhao was educated

550
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,520
and produced the Book of Han.

551
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,719
Cai Yan was adept in devout discipline

552
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,079
and was coronated by the Emperor.

553
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,040
All right.

554
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,800
We're meeting Shen Yan.

555
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,119
It seems like my wife

556
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,160
is going to make history.

557
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,239
Meet Shen Yan?

558
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,400
Hold on.

559
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,680
Hanchen.

560
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,319
Why would you meet Shen Yan?

561
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,239
What did you promise Shen Yan?

562
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,719
Xingzhou, hurry up.

563
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,239
Lady Xie.

564
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,280
Shideng.

565
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,040
Master wants me to send
you back to your family.

566
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,040
No matter what happens,

567
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,000
I must send you to your doorstep.

568
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,000
Time doesn't matter.

569
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,239
He will handle things
with Zhu Momo.

570
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,719
Where is he?

571
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,280
I'm not sure either.

572
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,119
He probably has matters to attend to.

573
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,280
Hurry up and check this out.

574
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,839
His Highness is leading
Master Shen's horse.

575
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,239
Hurry up and check it out.

576
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,680
This feels

577
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,719
amazing.

578
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,680
Zhao.

579
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,839
This is one grand display.

580
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,040
Look.

581
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,199
I prepared this street all for you

582
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,920
so you may

583
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,479
perform well.

584
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,079
Look. Look.

585
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,439
The scenery up here

586
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,079
sure is different.

587
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,359
Move out of the way.

588
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,280
Do not rush.

589
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,040
Take it easy.

590
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,560
There's no rush.

591
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,800
His Highness is leading the horse
for Master Shen.

592
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:36,880
Look.

593
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,959
They are watching a puppet show.

594
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:38,560
Look.

595
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,040
How interesting.

596
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,599
Dear, look.

597
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,319
Well...

598
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,439
Don't say anything.

599
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,119
A commandery prince

600
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,719
is made into a
horse-leading attendant.

601
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,040
Shen Yan

602
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,400
is despicable.

603
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,079
I can't believe he could come up
with something like this.

604
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,520
Zhao Xiaoqian

605
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,199
will be made a joke of the century.

606
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,560
How embarrassing.

607
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,640
The scenery up here

608
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,119
is pretty good.

609
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,400
All done?

610
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,599
Zhao.

611
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,040
You should marry
a couple more concubines.

612
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
I had a better time riding the horse

613
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,880
than I did listening to
Courtesan Zhu's performance.

614
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,040
Are you satisfied?

615
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,880
Of course.

616
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
I led your horse

617
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,000
and threw all pride away.

618
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,479
I'm sure you know

619
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
what you should do next.

620
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,479
What was your request again?

621
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,680
Oh, right.

622
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:54,920
Don't worry.

623
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:55,959
This afternoon,

624
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,719
I already spoke

625
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,839
to Zhu Momo.

626
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,199
You

627
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,520
did well and pleased me.

628
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,199
I had the urge to marry my sister off

629
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,000
to you.

630
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,400
Zhao.

631
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:07,040
You're a man of your word.

632
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,079
Shut up.

633
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm off.

634
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:11,760
Zhao.

635
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,040
By tomorrow,

636
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,040
you may bring your wife...

637
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,599
Rascal.

638
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,760
back to school.

639
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm going to break your legs next.

640
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,400
Be careful not to trip and fall.

641
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,439
Who was present

642
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,880
to tease me?

643
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,800
Remember them all!

644
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
Don't worry.
I remember every single one of them.

645
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,160
Also,

646
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,400
do not

647
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,000
tell Xiaoman about this.

648
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,319
Does he treat you well?

649
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,599
Yes.

650
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,719
It's all my fault.

651
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:03,599
Otherwise...

652
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,079
Father.

653
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,079
Don't say that.

654
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
He treats me well.

655
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,119
We're commoners anyway.

656
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,520
We can't afford to offend them.

657
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,680
Don't worry.

658
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,439
I'm doing well.

659
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,920
If he treats you well,

660
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,319
why didn't he return home with you?

661
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,319
Who said I'm not coming?

662
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,680
I'm late.

663
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,000
I beg your pardon, father-in-law.

664
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,599
Have you eaten?

665
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,599
I'll grab another set of utensils.

666
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,400
Yes.

667
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,959
Hurry up.

668
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:32,439
Stand upright.

669
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,439
Have a seat.

670
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:38,800
Here.

671
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,599
Have a seat.

672
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:40,439
All right.

673
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:43,640
Father-in-law.

674
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,640
Are things busy with
the government office?

675
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,839
Well...

676
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,680
Well, not exactly.

677
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,599
If you have time,

678
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,400
the Dragon Boat Festival
is around the corner.

679
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,040
We may rent a boat

680
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,000
and sail across Lake Tai.

681
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,119
I heard that Dragon Boat Race
will be held on that day.

682
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,280
I'm sure Li'er would enjoy that.

683
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,760
Can I go?

684
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,079
No way.

685
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,079
Of course you may.

686
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,119
Also,

687
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,119
for the gifts along with
the visit this time,

688
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,359
I included the Mahoraga
specially for you.

689
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
They are tributes

690
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,079
supplied to the palace.

691
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,280
Really?

692
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,400
That can't be true.

693
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,160
It's too expensive.

694
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,079
We dare not accept it.

695
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:17,920
Don't worry about it.

696
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,359
I also brought over

697
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,880
various jewellery and silk.

698
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,880
Xiaoman has been living
under Su Family's roof.

699
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,000
As her husband,

700
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,119
I should express my gratitude.

701
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,079
I may have to trouble you

702
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,839
to select a few goods
to be delivered to Su Family

703
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,319
as my token

704
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,959
of gratitude for taking
care of Xiaoman.

705
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,959
You're too kind.

706
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:35,880
Sorry for the wait.

707
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,479
Thank you, mother-in-law.

708
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,199
You're welcome.

709
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,599
Let's eat.

710
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,280
All right.

711
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,199
Make yourself at home.

712
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,239
It's been a long time since

713
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,359
the entire family gathered for a meal.

714
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,319
Here.

715
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,640
A toast to all of you.

716
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,680
All right.

717
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:55,959
All right.

718
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,119
Let's eat.

719
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,079
Here, Li'er.

720
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,119
Aren't you mad?

721
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:11,880
Don't worry.

722
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,479
You will be able to return
to the academy tomorrow.

723
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,380
(Yan's Mansion)

724
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,479
Flip each book open.

725
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,439
Those books there

726
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,359
and the one on the side.

727
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,520
Inspect them.

728
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:45,880
Mother.

729
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,479
Zhao Xiaoqian

730
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,719
neglected his friends
after marrying a wife.

731
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,439
We agreed to play a game of Polo.

732
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,839
Look at him.

733
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,599
He did not even show up.

734
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,839
Don't be ridiculous.

735
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,920
He did not marry a wife,

736
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,959
he married a concubine instead.

737
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,079
That's right.

738
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:05,560
When will I be able to
find a concubine for myself?

739
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,119
I'm feeling lonely.

740
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,800
Quit the nonsense.

741
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Are you the Commandery Prince?

742
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,800
No proper family would marry a
concubine before the first wife.

743
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,239
He's all grown up.

744
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,560
He's looking for a wife.

745
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,920
He's embarrassed to bring this up.

746
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,239
Boyang,

747
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,119
look.

748
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,680
What do you think of the daughter
of bureaucrats, Xie Family?

749
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,800
Xie Ruying?

750
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,199
What?

751
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,959
You're asking me to marry Yan Boyang?

752
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,280
Xie Xiaoman was married
to the Commandery Prince.

753
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:36,920
Yan Boyang is but a scholar's assistant.

754
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,520
Are you asking me to marry him

755
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,800
to serve Xie Xiaoman?

756
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,319
Ruying.

757
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,839
Xie Xiaoman is just a concubine.

758
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,479
In plain terms, she's just a servant.

759
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
If you marry Yan Boyang,

760
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,680
you will be the first lady

761
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,959
of Yan Family.

762
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,680
I refuse.

763
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,520
You're acting arbitrary.

764
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,800
I think

765
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,959
I shouldn't have allowed
you to attain education.

766
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,280
You're grounded from dinner today.

767
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,920
Fan Su.

768
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,359
Escort the lady back to her room.

769
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,280
Ruying.

770
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:11,880
Ruying.

771
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,079
Lady.

772
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,040
Lady,

773
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,159
if you head outside,

774
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,479
you would be reprimanded
by Madam Xie.

775
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,479
It doesn't matter.

776
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,120
They are forcing me to
marry that fool, Yan Boyang.

777
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm not going to marry him.

778
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,080
What can you do, lady?

779
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,879
Are you going to...

780
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,600
(Residence of the Li Family)

781
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,800
If I were to marry,

782
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,120
I'll only marry men like

783
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,040
Li Su.

784
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,159
It's believed

785
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
that a hero once exist
during the Tang Dynasty.

786
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,360
A hero?

787
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,239
He conquered the south
and defeated Wang Shichong.

788
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,239
Head north,

789
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:47,199
he captured Pi Keneng.

790
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,360
He crossed the seas
and conquered the east.

791
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
The enemies surrendered.

792
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,879
Emperor of Tang appeared victorious,

793
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,360
forcing the enemy to retreat.

794
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,360
I don't know why.

795
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,560
They haven't talked all morning.

796
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,239
You did me a great favour?

797
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:22,800
It wasn't me.

798
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,879
It was Congwen.

799
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,280
It's the monsoon season.

800
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Mosquitoes will increase in numbers.

801
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,159
I'll make you a sachet
to repel the bugs.

802
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,360
All right?

803
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,199
Good morning, Mr. Yan.

804
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:43,639
Good morning.

805
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,879
Good morning.

806
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,840
Good morning.

807
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,239
Good morning.

808
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,199
What's going on today?

809
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,600
You're in a good mood.

810
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,239
There's something I'd like to find out.

811
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,280
Do you know the daughter
of Xie Family, Ruying?

812
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,120
What's the matter?

813
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,199
Did she humiliate you?

814
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,000
Shut up.

815
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
What are you talking about?

816
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,600
Ruying

817
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
is gentle and kind.

818
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,679
Do not spew nonsense.

819
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,980
(Bailu Academy)

820
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,000
Hanchen is here.

821
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:23,879
Good morning.

822
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,800
Good morning.

823
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,120
How was the visit back to Xie Family?

824
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,360
Tell us. How did it go?

825
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,320
What's going on between the both of you?

826
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,719
Have you reconciled yet?

827
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,199
His Highness has a great temper.

828
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,000
He has been ignoring me for days.

829
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,040
According to Mr. Xu,

830
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,800
in a few days,

831
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,360
he'd take us to Tangjiao Village
to inspect the crops.

832
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,760
Apparently, there's a temple
on Mount Kunyan.

833
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,120
It's particularly effective.

834
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
You should take Zhao Xiaoqian with you.

835
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,840
I'm not going.

836
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,679
Even if I do,

837
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:57,840
I'm not taking him with me.

838
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,879
Hanchen.

839
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,879
Hanchen, where are you going?

840
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm looking for Xu Zi.

841
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:14,760
Xingzhou.

842
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,159
Here's your handkerchief.

843
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,679
Thank you.

844
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:19,879
Isn't Xu Zi

845
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:21,840
the governor of the Zhexi Troops?

846
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,520
What's his relationship
with Zhao Xiaoqian?

847
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,280
He's Hanchen's master.

848
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,679
Hanchen's horse-riding and archery

849
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
were taught by him.

850
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,879
Hanchen is in a bad mood today.

851
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,520
Do not blame him.

852
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,719
It's fine.

853
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,120
Idiot.

854
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,600
Do you enjoy Xiang Zhu?

855
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
I'm heading for class.

856
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,159
Let's go.

857
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:52,719
What are you looking at?

858
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,280
Let's go.

859
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,360
Why did you hit me?

860
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,360
Hanchen, this is...

861
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:06,360
What's wrong with Xiongjie Camp?

862
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:08,159
Are you not going to participate?

863
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,360
With my status,

864
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,000
I can't go into war.

865
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,800
Master, you've been
around for a long time.

866
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,840
Don't you understand?

867
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:16,560
I just find it a pity.

868
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,360
I taught you over the years.

869
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,879
You wouldn't join the war.

870
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,120
This is my destiny.

871
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,360
The status of the Commandery Prince

872
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,239
is nothing but a cage

873
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,600
to restrict me.

874
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,679
I've been your master for a long time.

875
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,120
I know

876
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,479
you pretty well.

877
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,520
Despite being confined in
Wujiang Prefecture for years,

878
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,639
your horse-riding skills and archery

879
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,679
never deteriorated.

880
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,000
I know you have an ambition in you.

881
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,520
You have

882
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,360
yet to reach for it.

883
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,879
Be the master of your fate.

884
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,879
Shoot.

885
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,199
Didn't you hear?

886
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
In three days,

887
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Principal Yang said,

888
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,679
be it from the Luming Pavilion

889
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,760
or the Jingnv Pavilion,

890
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,679
everyone must learn of
the adversities of farming.

891
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,360
Thus, every year, he will lead

892
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,679
the students of the academy

893
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:34,600
to observe the crops.

894
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,520
Will Luming Pavilion
join the expedition?

895
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,159
According to the seniors,

896
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,159
it seems like

897
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,000
we will be residing in
different courtyards there.

898
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,239
Also,

899
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
along the route up the hills

900
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,840
lies the Mount Kunyan Temple.

901
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,879
Behind the Mount Kunyan Temple,

902
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,679
it's connected to a lake.

903
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,479
That is known as Lake Nanming

904
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,080
as depicted in "Carefree Wandering".

905
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,360
The sea in the south
is a natural beauty.

906
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:00,280
Legend says,
krakens are spotted there.

907
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,760
Has anyone seen one?

908
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm not sure.

909
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,639
Poet Bai Juyi once said,

910
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,719
One who is well-fed without striving

911
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,479
isn't any different from
the guardian cranes.

912
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,239
The academy's practice

913
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,040
sure is brilliant.

914
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,840
We're to observe the crops once a year.

915
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,719
Ruying.

916
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,320
What's wrong?

917
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,679
My father wants me to marry Yan Boyang.

918
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,360
Yan Boyang?

919
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,560
The follower of
Commandery Prince of Julu?

920
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,879
Yan Boyang's father, Yan Nengfu

921
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,320
continued Jia Zhixing's
poem of treason at the brothel.

922
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,000
Whether his position is secure,

923
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,879
it's another story to tell.

924
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,239
I can't believe my father

925
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,320
wants me to marry that loser.

926
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,879
What do you mean by loser?

927
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:45,679
Xie Ruying,

928
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,040
watch your words.

929
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,320
Watch my words?

930
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,719
Am I wrong?

931
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,560
Convey this message to Yan Boyang.

932
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,040
Even if I were to shave
and become a nun,

933
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,879
I'll never marry him.

934
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,679
Xie Family sure is arrogant.

935
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:58,199
Even if you shaved

936
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:58,879
with the attempt to become a nun,

937
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,600
no temple would be
willing to accept you.

938
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,120
You...

939
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,679
Calm down.

940
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:03,600
You don't have to marry him.

941
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,560
You don't have to marry him.

942
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,360
You don't have to marry him.

943
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:07,639
Sanniang.

944
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,239
Will you help me?

945
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,479
How can I help you?

946
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:18,399
Have you heard about
Yan Boyang's proposal

947
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,600
to marry Xie Ruying?

948
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,239
Don't concern yourself
with such matters.

949
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,000
Consider your own predicament.

950
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,879
What are you going to do

951
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:24,879
with Zhao Xiaoqian?

952
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,320
I can't be bothered.

953
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,360
I did everything I could.

954
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,120
He refused to reconcile.

955
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,760
I'll just leave it be.

956
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,479
After two years,

957
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,879
I'll regain my freedom anyway.
