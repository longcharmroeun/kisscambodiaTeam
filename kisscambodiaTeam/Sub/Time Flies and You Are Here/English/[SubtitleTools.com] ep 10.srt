=Episode 10=

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,716
(The reality and the past
are totally different)

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,500
(Bailu Academy)

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,960
Food is served.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,800
The Wuhou mackerel

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,040
is made from the mackerel

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
caught from Lake Tai.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
The fish head is sliced in half.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,120
Along with the skin,
the body is split into four.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,040
It's cooked on low heat for 15 minutes

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,680
until the gravy thickens.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
It will then be cooked in bamboo.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
By such techniques,

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,840
the taste is much sweeter.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,120
By the way,

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
the chef also

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,040
prepared a pot of pear milk.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Give it a try.

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Isn't this just Peng Cake?

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,080
I can make it myself.

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,880
It can be done with just
rice flour and barley sugar.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,320
By the way,

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,680
why isn't Minggu attending class?

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,600
Do not call her courtesy name.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,120
That incident

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
enraged her mother.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,680
Minggu is grounded at home.

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,320
She was forced to
master Bian Embroidery.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,000
Bian Embroidery?

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,080
She...

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
What's going on?

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Will she be married off?

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
Of course not.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Don't be ridiculous.

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
Minggu is the successor of Su Chang Ji.

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
She has to master such skill.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
You're right.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,200
Why are you so concerned about her?

57
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,240
Don't tell me you leaked

58
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,160
the incident out.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
Of course not.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,840
I...

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,120
I'm...

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm just casually asking.

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Let's eat.

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,400
Let's eat.

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
That night back at Lake Nanming
on Mount Kunyan...

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
This is delicious.

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
I couldn't have done it better myself.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,480
I couldn't recall

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,520
what happened on the other night.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Really?

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,360
How could you not recall it?

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,720
I just couldn't.

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,920
Didn't you say

74
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,480
that we'd suffer from hysteria
if we consume fruits?

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
I couldn't recall anything.

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,760
Fine.

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,320
You couldn't recall anything at all.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,200
It's okay.

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
What do you know of it?

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
Qixi Festival is coming soon.

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,400
I shall ask Mr. Liangji to

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,760
send you some clothes and accessories.

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Let's have fun together.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
Yes, let's do it.

85
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Minggu...

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,440
No.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
Is Su Wei going, too?

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,760
I have no idea.

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,560
I shall check it out for you

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
at aunt's place tonight.

91
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,760
I shall go with you.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,320
Yes.

93
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,600
I shall go, too.

94
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,600
Yan Boyang!

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's eat!

96
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,260
(Main Hall)

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,520
Since

98
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
Xiaoshu has ended,

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
you must surely be missing me.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,680
So here I am to see you.

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
Yes, I am.

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,840
I miss you every day.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
How has your life been

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,600
in the Commandery Prince's Mansion?

105
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Is the Commandery Prince good to you?

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes, he is.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,640
He even brought me to try some new food.

108
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,760
It's

109
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,200
Yuguanfei,

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,280
right?

111
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,440
Yes.

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,680
I shall make you that tomorrow.

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes.

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,080
Everyone in the family

115
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,480
misses you so much.

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,720
I heard

117
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,200
that the Commandery Prince has
brought along lots of supplements.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
There are a handful of ginsengs alone.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,560
These are good for boosting your health

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,320
so that you'll have a grandchild
next year.

121
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,320
Sure.

122
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,960
Xiaoman.

123
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
Aren't you here to see Minggu?

124
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Don't just stand there.

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Go have fun together with her.

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,400
Your Highness.

127
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Hanchen,

128
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,400
do you want to

129
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,480
have a drink?

130
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,200
Well...

131
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
Well...

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,720
The imperial troops headed
by Governor Xu Zi

133
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,800
are stationed beyond
the south of Wujiang.

134
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
I was wondering

135
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,480
if you're learning
from Xu Zi, Your Highness?

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm learning from him occasionally.

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Here.

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,720
Your Highness.

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,760
Cheers.

140
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,880
Cheers.

141
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Master.

142
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
It's done as you wanted.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
I shall send it to your room.

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,560
What's this?

145
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,920
Well...

146
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,040
Old Madam

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
got to know an ancient remedy.

148
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
Isn't Qixi Festival coming soon?

149
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
Planting some corns in a pot

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,160
allows you...

151
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,840
Enough.

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,920
What can it do?

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,160
It can let you have a son.

154
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,720
Old Madam

155
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,600
has been wanting
master and mistress

156
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
to have a son.

157
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,480
They've tried various remedies.

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,720
But, it all comes down to fate.

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,280
So,

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
old madam is trying her luck again.

161
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Enough. Leave now.

162
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
Have another drink, Your Highness.

163
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,560
Here.

164
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,080
There is a box of antlers
among the things

165
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
I bought along.

166
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

167
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,720
They boost your virility.

168
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
My lady,

169
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
I'm glad to see you again.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
My lady,

171
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,360
I miss you so much.

172
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,720
The Commandery Prince's Mansion is
reputable and full of rules.

173
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
Lady Xie failed to
live up to expectations.

174
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,400
I've been having a hard time there.

175
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,320
I really suffered a lot.

176
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,840
My lady,

177
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,400
please take me back home.

178
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,200
Stop talking nonsense.

179
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,280
Why are you here?

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
I wanted to know, too.

181
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,960
Even Zhao Xiaoqian is here.

182
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
Something big has happened to you.

183
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
You're just keeping it to yourself.

184
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,400
Aunt has really grounded you.

185
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Now,

186
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
it isn't just that.

187
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
My mother wanted me to
learn Bian Embroidery.

188
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm not allowed

189
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
to step out of the house
until I've learnt it.

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
You're still doing the embroidery.

191
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,160
Isn't Qixi Festival coming
in another two days?

192
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Initially, I was thinking
of giving Zhong Ziyan this

193
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,720
as a gift.

194
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
You're giving him a pouch

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,240
as a gift on Qixi Festival?

196
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Are you really...

197
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,320
Aunt was so upset

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,400
about Yan Boyang's case.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,960
You're giving Zhong Ziyan a gift.

200
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,840
That's not appropriate.

201
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
Aunt is going to beat you for that.

202
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,800
It could be worse.

203
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,560
If my mother knows about this,

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,360
she could even send me to a convent.

205
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,200
So you must never

206
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,360
tell anyone about this.

207
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,640
Even if all of them
don't know about this,

208
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,240
you still must learn Bian Embroidery.

209
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,640
Aunt won't

210
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,360
let you out of the house
if you haven't learnt it.

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,240
Now that you must focus
on learning that,

212
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,040
how are you going to meet Xingzhou?

213
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,120
This is what

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
bothers me the most.

215
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
I actually know

216
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,240
that I couldn't possibly
be together with Zhong Ziyan,

217
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
but I just can't let it go.

218
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,840
If I don't say it,

219
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,240
I think he'll...

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,920
My lady,

221
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
His Highness

222
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,720
is urging you to go back.

223
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,560
Qixi Festival is coming in three days.

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
I shall

225
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,120
hand over you the fan
on that day itself.

226
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,000
I have to go now.

227
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,880
Xiaoman.

228
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Don't tell

229
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,360
Zhao Xiaoqian about this first.

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,200
I'm afraid Xingzhou

231
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
would guess what I'm going to do.

232
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,360
Don't worry.

233
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,000
You can count on me.

234
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,960
I'll go now.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,120
Why aren't you leaving?

236
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,920
Just take good care of Xiaoman.

237
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,700
(Lotus Garden)

238
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,340
(Lotus Garden)

239
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,440
Mr. Liangji.

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
What is His Highness doing?

241
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
Who do you think

242
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,480
he learned that from?

243
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,040
Let me ask you.

244
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,000
Find a clay pot before Qixi Festival.

245
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,640
Plant some corn seeds

246
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,000
and see them grow.

247
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,800
Do you know what this means?

248
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
Wishing for a son by planting the seeds.

249
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,840
His Highness is wishing for a son?

250
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,440
Keep your voice down.

251
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,000
It'll embarrass him

252
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
if others know about this.

253
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,120
Do you know you could

254
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
get yourself killed?

255
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,480
Let's go.

256
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,920
What kind of embroidery is this?

257
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:45,682
I've never seen this before.

258
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,880
I don't know.

259
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
I have no idea.

260
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
Are you hungry, my lady?

261
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,040
If you're hungry,

262
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,560
I can cook you some noodles.

263
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
Why are you so nice to me today?

264
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,120
You'll surely be thinking

265
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
I'm being mischievous if it was before.

266
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,040
If you're nice to my lady,

267
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,160
I shall do the same to you.

268
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,640
Let me cook you some noodles.

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,760
Where are you going?

270
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,160
I'm going to cook my lady some noodles.

271
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,080
Why aren't you wearing the jewelry

272
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
that Liangji gave you?

273
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,200
Have you really forgotten everything?

274
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
What are you talking about?

275
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,360
I just remember that I ate some fruits.

276
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,760
And that's all I can recall.

277
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
What are we going to do?

278
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,920
Today, Old Madam Su was even mentioning

279
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
that we're giving birth to a baby boy.

280
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,400
She didn't say that.

281
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,920
Aunt said it and that was nonsense.

282
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't take it seriously.

283
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,840
What have you

284
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,000
brought home today?

285
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,000
It's nothing.

286
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,840
When

287
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
you're going to the academy tomorrow,

288
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,440
wear the rhino horn hairpin.

289
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,240
I love to see you wearing
the gift I gave you.

290
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,220
(Residence of the Su Family)

291
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,920
Sir,

292
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,240
you are...

293
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm Yan Boyang from the Bailu Academy.

294
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,680
My courtesy name is Zhanzhi.

295
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm your lady's classmate.

296
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,480
Our teacher has given us some homework.

297
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm here to inform her.

298
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Look.

299
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,320
You're Mr. Yan.

300
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,160
Yes.

301
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
The men

302
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,440
are learning needlework in the academy?

303
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,800
Yes.

304
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,120
The picture of a wonderful country

305
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,880
is made by needlework,

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,480
right?

307
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,760
Just a moment, Mr. Yan.

308
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
I'll inform my lady.

309
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,080
- I won't be long.
- Just go.

310
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,080
What brings you here?

311
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,720
I was just passing by.

312
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,560
So I thought of dropping by to see you.

313
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
You still have the audacity to see me.

314
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
You almost got me into trouble.

315
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,720
Your mother won't stop you
from going to the academy, will she?

316
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,760
No.

317
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,560
So,

318
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
what should we do?

319
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,800
No worries.

320
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
So long as I can go out

321
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,200
and make a wish on Qixi Festival,

322
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,120
then she'll let me go to the academy.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,440
Make a wish?

324
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,960
You're lying to me again.

325
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,880
Yes, I lied to you.

326
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,320
My mother dotes on me.

327
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
How could she stop me
from going to the academy?

328
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,800
So long as

329
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,360
you and Director Xu don't say a word,

330
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,040
then it'll be fine.

331
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,840
Don't worry.

332
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,240
Well,

333
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,560
let's go out and have fun
on Qixi Festival, too.

334
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,960
What would you want to do the most

335
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
if you're allowed to go out?

336
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,240
I want to to go for the lantern riddles.

337
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Lantern riddles?

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,320
Why are you asking me this?

339
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,680
You'll be late for the class.

340
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,280
Go now.

341
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,240
There are actually

342
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,040
many famous poems about Qixi Festival.

343
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,920
Xie Tiao of Southern Dynasty
wrote an ode above Qixi Festival.

344
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,480
I lament the short moment
of Qixi Festival,

345
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,120
and how I wish we could
spend more time together."

346
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,000
There's a famous
quote from Yang Yi, too.

347
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
"On the peaceful Qixi Festival,

348
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,880
the heavenly carriage appears
in the love-filled occasion.

349
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,440
Silk is weaved on the loom,

350
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,920
and sent as gifts
to the people on earth."

351
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
Qixi Festival

352
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,320
isn't only celebrated by lovers,

353
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
it's also a time where
weavers pray to their goddess.

354
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,640
Since you're all ladies,

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,280
you should know something
about this occasion.

356
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,480
The tradition of showing off your
needlework and cooking skills.

357
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,800
Can anyone tell us about this?

358
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,480
There's a story about the lucky spider.

359
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,840
On the seventh day of the seventh month,

360
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,640
a tiny spider is caught
and kept in a little box.

361
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,760
The box is opened up at dawn,

362
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,400
and the spider web is observed.

363
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Its thickness is judged to
determine the level of blessing.

364
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,760
A thick one means one is blessed
with good needlework skills.

365
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
On a lesser scale, one isn't
blessed as much as the former.

366
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Worst, one isn't blessed at all.

367
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
There's another story where all
ladies hold colourful threads

368
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,760
and attempt to thread
the needles under the lamp.

369
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,520
Whoever can thread seven
needles continuously

370
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,880
shall be blessed.

371
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
What about those who can't do this?

372
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,120
They won't be so lucky.

373
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,760
There's a poem that goes like this.

374
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,400
"It's easy to thread a
needle under the moon,

375
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,000
but not so in a windy situation.

376
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Let's wait till the following day

377
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
and we shall know who's the best."

378
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,680
There was even a case

379
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,640
where the ladies would visit each other

380
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,120
the following day

381
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,800
to comment on their skills.

382
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,240
Xiaoman.

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Tell us about it.

384
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,600
There's a tradition

385
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
in my hometown.

386
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,280
On Qixi Festival,

387
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,800
we hang some wild
flowers on cow horns.

388
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,760
We call that the cow's birthday.

389
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,920
Legend has it

390
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
that the cowherd and weaver girl
were separated by heaven.

391
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,920
The old cow let the cowherd

392
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,320
strip off its skin,

393
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,600
and he stepped on the skin
to reunite with the weaver girl.

394
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,080
Doesn't it sound laughable?

395
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,840
Exactly.

396
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,400
It's so hilarious.

397
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,160
Come look for me after the class.

398
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,160
Sit down.

399
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,160
You've never been distracted in class.

400
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
What happened?

401
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Tell me about it.

402
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,480
Minggu is grounded at home by my aunt

403
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,280
to learn Bian Embroidery.

404
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
I wish to learn it, too.

405
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,880
I want to help her.

406
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Just look at yourself.

407
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,800
So young

408
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,040
yet full of tricks.

409
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,920
How about this?

410
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,320
Remember Zhu Momo?

411
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,160
She used to be a rich man's daughter
in the capital.

412
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,800
She is skillful in Bian Embroidery.

413
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,560
If you want,

414
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,680
I can try persuade her

415
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,760
to teach you.

416
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,840
Really?

417
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,760
Did I ever let you down?

418
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Whether it's Bian

419
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,560
or Shu Embroidery,

420
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,400
I'm glad to be of help.

421
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,920
Don't forget your purpose

422
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,360
of attending the academy.

423
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,320
Don't neglect your studies
because of that.

424
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,600
Got it.

425
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,840
Thank you, Congwen.

426
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,400
Little Xie!

427
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,400
Let me see.

428
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,400
Don't call me that.

429
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,160
Then what should I call you?

430
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,920
You got a name

431
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,080
during the coming of age,

432
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
and it's Fu An, right?

433
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,400
Fu An.

434
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Fu An.

435
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,160
Nice name.

436
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,840
Well, let's go then.

437
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,400
There's a water puppetry show
at Taiping Tavern.

438
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
I shall take you there.

439
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,520
No!

440
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,400
What's wrong?

441
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm meeting Minggu today.

442
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,680
Su Family will send
a carriage to pick me up.

443
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,560
I have to keep her company at home.

444
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,680
Really?

445
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,480
Fine.

446
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,360
Let me send you there.

447
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,680
It isn't safe for you

448
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,480
to be alone here.

449
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,400
Anything can happen...

450
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,040
It's okay.

451
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,920
Don't worry about me.

452
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,560
Just go and have fun.

453
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm not a child anymore.

454
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,160
When my mother was at my age,

455
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,320
she had given birth to my older brother.

456
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,520
- But...
- Anyway,

457
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,120
I'm yours.

458
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
No one will dare hurt me.

459
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,280
Just go now.

460
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,240
If you want a brother,

461
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,760
I can fulfil your wish.

462
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,240
- You're a lecher.
- Let's go.

463
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,040
He took advantage of me.

464
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,280
Why am I married to a lecher?

465
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,400
Xiaoman.

466
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,120
Congwen.

467
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,480
(Bailu Academy)
Let's go.

468
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,580
Please give way.

469
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,300
Please give way.

470
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,260
Please give way.

471
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,260
Please give way.

472
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,320
Please give way.

473
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,880
Are you all right?

474
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
Thank you, Congwen.

475
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,040
Come and take a look!

476
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,760
Xie Xiaoman?

477
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080
Why is she together with Congwen

478
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,280
here at an entertainment site?

479
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,400
What is she doing here?

480
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,840
Stop.

481
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,740
(Brothel)

482
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,680
Sir.

483
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,760
Welcome.

484
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,400
This way, please.

485
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,520
Xie Xiaoman is a married woman.

486
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,600
She's also just a concubine,

487
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
but she's always sticking to Congwen.

488
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,280
No.

489
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,760
I have to tell the Commandery Prince.

490
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,280
No.

491
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,640
You're a lady.

492
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,680
You better not let others know

493
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,800
that you're telling tales.

494
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,140
(Brothel)

495
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,040
You had

496
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,400
better be smart.

497
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,480
You'll see.

498
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,360
I won't get myself into trouble

499
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,440
and I can make the Commandery Prince

500
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,080
completely detests Xie Xiaoman.

501
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,280
Master.

502
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,880
She is...

503
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,680
Master.

504
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,520
I'm the daughter of Magistrate Xie Jing
of Wu County,

505
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,280
Xie Ruying.

506
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,120
It happened that when
I was about to check out

507
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,840
the silk at Su Chang Ji with my friends,

508
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,800
I accidentally saw your good pal.

509
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,040
The Commandery Prince's concubine
was here, too.

510
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,000
She dropped her hairpin.

511
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
She left in a hurry,

512
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
and I wasn't able to catch up with her.

513
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,400
Master,

514
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
since you're a good friend
of the Commandery Prince,

515
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,520
perhaps you can return this to her.

516
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,280
Isn't the Commandery Prince's concubine

517
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,880
attending Bailu Academy?

518
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,400
Why can't she just hand it over to her

519
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,360
first thing tomorrow morning?

520
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,120
It's a lady's method.

521
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
A simple person like you
won't understand it.

522
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,200
Let's go to

523
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,200
Taiping Tavern.

524
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,520
Mr. Li.

525
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,760
Yanniang.

526
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,760
Lady Xie.

527
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,840
Congwen used to always mention you.

528
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,160
I didn't expect that

529
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,080
you're such a lovely person.

530
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,160
I saw her fiddling a fan

531
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
in the class today.

532
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,560
I found out that

533
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,880
she's keen in learning Bian Embroidery.

534
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,320
Since you're a master in embroidery,

535
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,440
so I've brought her here
to learn from you.

536
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,360
Mr. Han

537
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,240
is just next door.

538
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
Why don't you go greet him?

539
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,400
Mr. Han is here?

540
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,680
I shall go see him.

541
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,040
You may go ahead and study.

542
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,560
Sit down.

543
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,600
Bring me threads and needles,
Qiongqiong.

544
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,160
Yes.

545
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,720
I heard that you're married to
the Commandery Prince of Julu.

546
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,240
Is he nice to you?

547
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,360
Yes, he is.

548
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,200
He may look arrogant,

549
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,160
but he's actually a sincere man.

550
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,600
He treats me well.

551
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,840
Lady Xie's just fine.

552
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,120
Let's worry about

553
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,920
Mr. Li, okay?

554
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,840
What happened to Congwen?

555
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,120
I'm sure you've heard about the case

556
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,560
where Jia Zhixing wrote
a poem on the boat.

557
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,160
His poem

558
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
has certainly displeased

559
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
Sir Xu Qiaozhu,

560
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,800
the chancellor.

561
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,320
Now he's in jail.

562
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,560
Being a nostalgic person,

563
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
Congwen just wanted to be helpful.

564
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,440
Now isn't the time

565
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,160
to have a finger in the pie.

566
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Moreover, he's dealing with
Chancellor Xu

567
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
who's a powerful official.

568
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm worried

569
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,200
that he's got himself into trouble...

570
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Yanniang.

571
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,560
Don't tell anyone

572
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,480
about me.

573
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,460
(Water Puppetry)

574
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
I won't join you

575
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
on Qixi Festival.

576
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,840
I have something on.

577
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,040
Really?

578
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,000
What's it?

579
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,800
Tell me about it.

580
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,520
It's just that

581
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,480
I have something on.

582
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,240
You're all here.

583
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
Get up.

584
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,520
You...

585
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,080
Boyang.

586
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,120
Your Highness.

587
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
Where's your sweetheart?

588
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,000
Get lost.

589
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,880
Any idea what this is?

590
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,000
What's this?

591
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
This rhino horn hairpin

592
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,040
is Hanchen's gift to Xiaoman

593
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,320
for attaining adulthood.

594
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,440
Where did you get it?

595
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,960
A pretty lady may have dropped it

596
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,600
so I kept it.

597
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,120
You don't say.

598
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,480
This place is certainly
full of brothels.

599
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,400
The Commandery Prince's concubine

600
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,760
is absolutely attractive.

601
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,840
I agree with you.

602
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,320
Give me the hairpin.

603
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,200
Don't tell anyone

604
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,000
about this.

605
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,520
Sure.

606
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,240
Drink eight cups of wine.

607
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
Then I'll return the hairpin to you.

608
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,160
Hanchen.

609
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,760
Hanchen.

610
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,280
I won't tell anyone

611
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,520
about the hairpin.

612
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,400
But you, Zhao Xiaoqian,

613
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,960
the adopted son of an official,

614
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,880
the Commandery Prince of Julu.

615
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,000
His Majesty has personally bestowed
the name, Hanchen, upon you.

616
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
You've been a genius since young.

617
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
You could recite
the Classics of Confucius

618
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
since you were seven.

619
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,840
Don't you remember

620
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,440
that we even made a deal

621
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
to join the army?

622
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,480
Now we've become men.

623
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,040
But we're spending our time on a lady.

624
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,840
It's pathetic

625
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,560
and ridiculous.

626
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,480
Duke of Yongguo

627
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
could hardly recognise you

628
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,200
with the way you look now.

629
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,840
Nobody could sleep well at war.

630
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,440
The general has a full head of
Grey hair after years of war.

631
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
The soldiers weep as
they're all homesick.

632
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,160
Lady Xie.

633
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,480
Zhu Momo.

634
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,800
Wait.

635
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,240
I heard that the Commandery Prince
wanted you to go out with him

636
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,480
by wearing the rhino horn hairpin
a couple of days ago.

637
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,960
I wonder why

638
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,200
you aren't wearing it now.

639
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,760
Where is it?

640
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,360
Hurry.

641
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,480
Get him some tea to sober up.

642
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,400
Hanchen.

643
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
What did Zhu Momo say just now?

644
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,880
She wanted to know

645
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,200
the hairpin's whereabouts.

646
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,560
Where is it?

647
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,600
I was visiting Minggu today, right?

648
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,080
She liked it.

649
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
So she asked to keep it

650
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,120
in order to make a same one for herself.

651
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,640
Really?

652
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,600
Hanchen.

653
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,360
No one shall follow me.

654
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,600
Let go of me.

655
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,680
Come over here.

656
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,400
Come here!

657
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,280
Take off my clothes.

658
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,600
You..

659
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,560
You don't know your place.

660
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,240
Let me show you

661
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,080
things that a concubine should do.

662
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Take off my clothes

663
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,440
and bathe for me.

664
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,840
Do you hear me?

665
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
Bathing me and helping me get changed

666
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,240
is what you should do

667
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,320
as my concubine.

668
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,400
What?

669
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,760
What's the problem?

670
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,800
Do you think you can
just excuse yourself?

671
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,120
Let go of me.

672
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,040
Really?

673
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,520
I think I've been too kind to you.

674
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,240
Others' concubines

675
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,080
are always finding ways

676
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,840
to serve their husbands well.

677
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,760
And you, Xie Xiaoman?

678
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,200
What have you done besides lying to me?

679
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
Have some water.

680
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,400
Just calm down.

681
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,200
Here.

682
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,200
You two had a fight?

683
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,520
Sometimes, I just think

684
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,840
that our marriage is a farce.

685
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,680
What has it got to do with me?

686
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,240
But sometimes, he's really nice to me.

687
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,920
We actually shouldn't hold

688
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
the responsibility for each other

689
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,400
in our marital agreement.

690
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,840
That makes me rethink

691
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
whether I should be

692
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,920
nice to him, too.

693
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,800
And whether I should really

694
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,040
treat him like my husband.

695
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,640
However,

696
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,920
things aren't as simple as we think.

697
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,960
I was truly nervous

698
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,680
when I looked at him today.

699
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,360
Enough of that.

700
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,960
What about you?

701
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,440
Have you finished making
the pouch for Zhong Ziyan?

702
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,480
It's almost done.

703
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,480
Do you know anything about
the poem written by Jia Zhixing?

704
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,720
I know a little bit about it.

705
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,720
According to my elders at home,

706
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,960
he did it on impulse

707
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,440
and displeased the chancellor.

708
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,040
He's got himself into trouble

709
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,320
at this critical juncture.

710
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
It also seems to have something to do

711
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
with Chancellor Xu's involvement
in the disaster relief.

712
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,880
The matter has got worse.

713
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,960
He's likely

714
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,280
to get executed.

715
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,880
What about

716
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,160
Congwen...

717
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,920
Congwen?

718
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,560
What about him?

719
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,600
There's a hearsay.

720
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,880
He seems to be implicated.

721
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,920
He's actually helped me
a couple of times.

722
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm a little worried about him.

723
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Well, Xiaoman,

724
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,480
Hu Momo has given me something.

725
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,520
Let me show you.

726
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,920
Look.

727
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,600
See how cute it is.

728
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,560
It's striving

729
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,960
to make a web.

730
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,400
Haven't I given you Wick?

731
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,560
I've given it a new name.

732
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,320
Guess what it is.

733
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,160
It's Deng Qiao'er.

734
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,600
How do you like it?

735
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,960
Just take a look of it.

736
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,160
Just forget about the unhappy things.

737
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,180
(Brothel)

738
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,960
Well,

739
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,600
you were talking about Congwen.

740
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
What's going on with him?

741
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,680
It's nothing actually.

742
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,680
Don't worry.

743
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,640
I'm sure you know about the poem

744
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,480
written by Jia Zhixing.

745
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,000
Mocking Chancellor Xu is a big deal.

746
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,200
That really affects

747
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
the victims' impression on him.

748
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,680
The victims are feeling
disturbed due to that.

749
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Worse still,

750
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,520
some are even taking the chance
to take down their opponents.

751
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm afraid they're stirring up trouble.

752
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,960
Now the rumours are
shrouded in mystery.

753
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,080
Fear is everywhere.

754
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
The only thing I'm worried is that

755
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,480
he might insist on helping
Jia Zhixing no matter what.

756
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
You know Congwen well.

757
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
He's kind of an egghead.

758
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,920
If the matter gets worse,

759
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
he might land himself in jail.

760
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,880
That's impossible.

761
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,080
Congwen has a close relationship

762
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,800
with the officials.

763
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
Does that matter?

764
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,600
Self-interest is the only thing
that matters

765
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,600
in politics.

766
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,880
He's ignorant of this

767
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,960
and yet he wants to
intervene in Jia Zhixing's case.

768
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,680
Now,

769
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,640
we shall have to leave it to chance.

770
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,600
We must do something.

771
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,960
You need to talk him out of it.

772
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,760
He has to wash his hands off it.

773
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm but just a courtesan.

774
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,160
How would he listen to me?

775
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,000
It has to be you.

776
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,600
Me?

777
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Do you know that your husband,

778
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,280
Commandery Prince of Julu,

779
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,080
gets the official intelligence
in advance every seven days?

780
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,120
I have an idea.

781
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,280
Copy and bring me the intelligence.

782
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,680
Then I'll know

783
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
what the imperial court thinks
about the case of Jia Zhixing.

784
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,040
This also gives Congwen
a way to counteract it.

785
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,160
What do you think?

786
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,160
Does it work?

787
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
But Commandery Prince...

788
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Do you really

789
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,160
want to see Congwen go to jail?

790
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,480
All you need to do is just
copy and bring the intelligence

791
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,360
to me.

792
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,660
(Studio of Artlessness)

793
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,560
(Zhao Xiaoqian,)

794
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,160
(I know)

795
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,160
(I shouldn't have done this
behind your back,)

796
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,480
(but this is a matter of
life and death for Congwen.)

797
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
(I hope you'll understand.)

798
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,640
(I shall make it up to you one day.)

799
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,320
Is there anyone around?

800
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,560
The coast is clear.

801
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
I shall keep an eye out
for anyone that comes.

802
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,160
Just go ahead and copy it.

803
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,000
Was he truly upset with me?

804
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
Yes.

805
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,120
He had a sleepless night.

806
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,680
Did he mention anything about me?

807
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,080
Did he say anything

808
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,680
about banishing me?

809
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,880
Why would he do that?

810
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,320
Shi Deng'er dare not do that.

811
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,280
You mean, Shi Deng'er?

812
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,040
Didn't you ask about him?

813
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,360
He was sulking yesterday.

814
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,600
He kept on sulking the whole night.

815
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,000
You're talking about Commandery Prince?

816
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,480
He's caught a cold.

817
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,040
It was quite serious.

818
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,880
Mr. Liangji was taking care
of him the whole night.

819
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
Did he get sick?

820
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,680
Zhu Momo.

821
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,080
Hongsu?

822
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,360
She's home? How dare she!

823
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,000
She's never left

824
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,440
Studio of Artlessness
since she was home.

825
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,880
I wonder why.

826
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,160
Where's Commandery Prince?

827
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,680
He's resting in the room.

828
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,000
Go.

829
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
Bring some men and come with me.

830
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,680
Let's see what Xie Xiaoman

831
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,040
is up to.

832
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,520
I'm seeing Zhao Xiaoqian now.

833
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,600
You mustn't tell anyone here

834
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,400
that I'm back,

835
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,320
especially Zhu Momo.
