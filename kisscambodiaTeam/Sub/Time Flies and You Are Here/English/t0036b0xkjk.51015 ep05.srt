(Too bad the long song is
wasted in the evening)

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,040
What is it?

22
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,519
Are you going to reprimand me
on behalf of His Majesty?

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,519
I'm Xie Xiaoman's senior.

24
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,160
I'm also an old friend of her.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,599
Since she's an old friend,

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,119
I must protect her.

27
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,119
A woman's reputation is everything.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Your Highness,

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,399
on whose authority that you detain her?

30
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,559
Whose authority?

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,020
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

32
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,600
(Commandery Prince's Mansion Contract)
A system is governed by law.

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,240
Humans are governed
by personal contracts.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,360
The daughter of Xie household,
Xiaoman signed a personal agreement

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,559
with the Commandery Prince's Mansion

36
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,800
as a female attendant.

37
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,119
The contract lasts for two years long.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,919
What?

39
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,440
Xie Xiaoman signed
an agreement with me.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,679
She's now an attendant of mine.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,600
What's the matter?

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
Do you want to meddle in

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,839
with the matters of my household?

44
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:00,919
Congwen.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,199
She created this mess herself.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Even if we reported this matter
to Sir Yan,

47
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,000
it wouldn't make sense.

48
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,000
Congwen,

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,479
His Highness is enraged.

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,919
You should return.

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,279
I'll send her back tomorrow.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm staying here today.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,039
Early in the morning tomorrow,

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,479
I'll send Xiaoman back home.

55
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,279
Sorry

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,919
for the trouble, Sir Chang.

57
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,479
I shall beg for you pardon
personally next time.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,119
Well,

59
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,039
I'll leave Xiaoman to your care.

60
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,080
Your Highness,

61
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,360
we should prioritise peace and harmony!

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,559
About the incident today,

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,519
are you aware of your mistake?

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
You should know

65
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,040
how important today is

66
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,839
to my uncle.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,079
You're the Commandery Prince.

68
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,320
You have the authority over everyone.

69
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,440
You may exercise power
over everyone else.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,399
I'm just a regular commoner.

71
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,839
There's nothing I can say.

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
You disdained my reputation.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Fine.

74
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,640
Very well.

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,519
I'm telling you.

76
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,000
I loathe you.

77
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,720
You have no respect for others.
I hate you.

78
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,119
You're adamant and cocky. I hate you.

79
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,720
I hate you the most

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,839
for trampling on the pride of others.

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,239
You're the Commandery Prince.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,480
You're superior.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm as insignificant as dust.

84
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,880
I plead of you to leave me alone.

85
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,320
Live your life as
the Commandery Prince.

86
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,959
I shall live mine as a humble commoner.

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,920
From now on, I shall do my best

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
to attend to the matters
of the household.

89
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,720
However,

90
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,279
you and I no longer have
anything to do with each other.

91
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,760
You...

92
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,359
Fine.

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Since you are so stubborn,

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,679
kneel before the Zhuiyuan Hall

95
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,079
until you're willing to repent!

96
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,559
It's humid at night. This is...

97
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,679
Hanchen.

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,760
Xiaoman.

99
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,399
Xiaoman.

100
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,839
Xiaoman.

101
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,040
Back then,
the Emperor did not bear a son.

102
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,679
When Hanchen was five,

103
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,799
He was brought to the palace
with his old brother.

104
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,279
They were both adopted,

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,279
but they didn't have a good time here.

106
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,679
However, we both know

107
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,600
what life in the palace is like.

108
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,480
When he was seven,

109
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,839
his brother passed away
at the East Palace.

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,959
When Xiaojie passed away,

111
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,079
Hanchen stayed by his body

112
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,959
for a day and night before
the attendants discovered them.

113
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,359
Afterward,

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,959
His Majesty was given a son,
the current crown prince.

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,279
For the Emperor,

116
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,399
Hanchen became insignificant then.

117
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,920
Four years after Xiaojie's death,

118
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,519
Hanchen was sent out of the palace.

119
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
When he left the palace,

120
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
he was already 11 years old.

121
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,279
Prince Pu had many heirs,

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,079
but the children do not get along.

123
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,359
Hanchen entered the palace
when he was young.

124
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,839
He was abandoned and
neglected by his parents.

125
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,359
Why did you think

126
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,160
he'd come all the way to
Wujiang Prefecture to recuperate?

127
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
He didn't come to recuperate,

128
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,040
he came to avoid all

129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,480
the political strife.

130
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,200
Can you imagine

131
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,600
how difficult his life was back then?

132
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,760
A young boy

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
surviving in the palace all alone.

134
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Once he left the palace,

135
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,279
he thought he'd finally feel
his family's warmth.

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,160
Instead, he was lonelier.

137
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,279
That's why

138
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,559
he may behave unreasonably.

139
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,519
I hope for

140
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,279
your understanding.

141
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,880
He has his hardships.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,799
I understand that.

143
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,200
However, it doesn't justify him

144
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,640
to inflict pain upon others.

145
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,440
I have my load of hardships, too.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,640
Excuse me.

147
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,740
(Zhuiyuan Hall)

148
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,359
You silly girl.

149
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,780
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

150
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,919
Xiaoman.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,559
Xiaoman.

152
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,919
Are you all right?

153
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,960
You can take a day off from school.

154
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,919
You were up all night.

155
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,080
I took a leave from the principal
on your behalf.

156
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,039
Allow me to send you home.

157
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Your family must be concerned.

158
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,760
Over the years since the establishment
of Bailu Academy,

159
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,039
the academy sought to cultivate

160
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,039
men as true scholars.

161
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,679
You should know,

162
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,119
those who seek to advocate
morality of the world,

163
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,080
should first govern one's country.

164
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,080
Those who seek to govern one's country,

165
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,919
should first manage one's household.

166
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,640
Those who seek to manage
one's household,

167
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,520
should first rectify one's character.

168
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,320
Rectify the thoughts,
and purify one's heart.

169
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,799
Expand one's knowledge

170
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,760
(Dongguan Building)
before peace could befall the state.

171
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,559
A gentleman's heart knows no limits.

172
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,400
His patience is boundless and vast.

173
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,000
This is the question of the day.

174
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,479
What defines a gentleman?

175
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,380
(Capital)

176
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:25,919
Hanchen is not coming back again?

177
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,119
Yes.

178
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,440
It's a letter from Principal Yang.

179
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,080
Apparently, the prince attempts to study

180
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,640
Spring and Autumn Annals from
him at Wujiang Prefecture

181
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,440
before returning.

182
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,960
Spring and Autumn Annals?

183
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,760
(Zhao Xiaoqian's mother,
Princess Consort Pu)

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
He's rather diligent.

185
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,039
It's a pity.

186
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,760
His diligence is in vain.

187
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:45,280
He can't possibly

188
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,960
plan to become an imperial official.

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
(Princess Consort Pu's nanny,
Zhu Momo)

190
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,719
Deliver a letter to Wujiang Prefecture

191
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,559
with the prince's seal.

192
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,280
Inform Hanchen

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,359
that he's no longer young.

194
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,119
Shen family cannot afford
to wait for him anymore.

195
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,000
It's time for him to get married.

196
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,400
Yes.

197
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,960
I shall attend to it immediately.

198
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,860
(Zhiwei Hall)

199
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,640
I heard that your sister

200
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,239
was in great trouble a few days ago.

201
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,159
She has brought shame to the family.

202
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,080
She's truly

203
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,599
unruly and adamant.

204
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,799
She believes if she becomes an attendant
at the Commandery Prince's Mansion,

205
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,239
she'd be able to win over
the Commandery Prince himself.

206
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,000
Gossiping behind one's back.

207
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,359
Both of you

208
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,039
are truly despicable.

209
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,359
Despicable?

210
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
A woman

211
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,039
drawing attention to
herself out in public

212
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,679
already shows profligacy.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,880
She resorted to
becoming an attendant

214
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,679
of the prince.

215
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,880
The female students of our academy

216
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,119
are of prestige and nobility.

217
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,400
Some of us are related to
influential households.

218
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,200
We're classmates.

219
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,400
She is not one of us.

220
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,239
You might not be afraid.

221
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm afraid I get implicated.

222
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,479
You're gossiping about me.

223
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,599
Both of you sure are bold.

224
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,559
If I hear this again in the academy,

225
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
regardless of who it is,

226
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,599
both of you will be cast out.

227
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,520
I have a question.

228
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,559
How is she doing?

229
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,119
Why wouldn't you check on her yourself?

230
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,400
Xiaoman is sick.

231
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,640
I came to apply a leave on her behalf.

232
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,799
If there's nothing else,

233
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:40,960
I shall take my leave.

234
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,820
(There's no shortcut and no end
to studying)

235
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,719
We utterly

236
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,039
offended them.

237
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,359
What are you going to do?

238
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,960
How will you apologise?

239
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,119
Why should I apologise?

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,760
I did nothing wrong.

241
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,479
Let's go to class.

242
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,840
Hanchen.

243
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,119
Let's put Xiaoman's matter aside.

244
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,440
Another letter came from the capital.

245
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,919
This time,

246
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,840
it's a personal letter
with the prince's seal.

247
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,719
Is he pestering me to
marry Shen Zhaowen?

248
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,159
That depends if Shen family

249
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,039
would agree to the marriage.

250
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Things at Wujiang Prefecture

251
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,159
are rather peaceful for now.

252
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
If the Emperor passes away,

253
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,719
(Family letter)
I'll be the first sacrifice

254
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,000
for the new emperor.

255
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,119
Wait, you...

256
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,280
Prepare a variety of textile
and tonics tonight.

257
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,520
I need them.

258
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,559
Well...

259
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,080
Why did he tear the letter apart?

260
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,039
Come here.

261
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,359
Xiaoman.

262
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
In my opinion, you should forget it.

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,960
At this point,

264
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,159
it's useless to think about it.

265
00:15:59,239 --> 00:15:59,880
Listen to me.

266
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,840
Attend class with me tomorrow.

267
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,960
Ignore them.

268
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,440
Director Xu said,

269
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,479
Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition
will be held in two days.

270
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,599
It will take the load off your mind.

271
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,679
What is that?

272
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Lady, it's your turn.

273
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,520
Don't you know who Teacher Liu is?

274
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,440
That's Liu Sanbian.

275
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,919
Every year,
the performers of Wujiang Prefecture

276
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,119
are obligated to participate
in Teacher Liu's competition.

277
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,039
Last year, Congwen

278
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,760
led the academy into victory.

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,559
However, last year,

280
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,200
the top prize wasn't attractive.

281
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Apparently, this year,

282
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,479
the reward is a fan with a poem
of Teacher Liu.

283
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,719
Does Congwen admire Teacher Liu?

284
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,840
Of course.

285
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,039
This year,

286
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,239
I heard that Congwen

287
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,640
has to perform the zither
for Courtesan Zhu.

288
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,039
He isn't able to participate
in the competition.

289
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,440
It's a pity.

290
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,559
Congwen once said

291
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,799
that he really wants a fan
with Teacher Liu's poetry

292
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,799
as a part of his collection.

293
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,760
Xiaoman,

294
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,400
I saw Zhao Xiaoqian today.

295
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,839
Ladies.

296
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,359
The master and mistress of Xie family
have arrived.

297
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,839
Oh no.

298
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,239
I am doomed.

299
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,160
Commandery Prince of Julu.

300
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,439
You caused me great embarrassment.

301
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,439
You...

302
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,760
Because of you, your uncle's house

303
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,920
is in a huge mess. Are you aware?

304
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:32,280
It's your fault that

305
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
he can no longer run his business.

306
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,520
Calm down.

307
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,520
Early in the morning,

308
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,880
I took care of it.

309
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,800
Everything is all right now.

310
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,800
Our household lacks in
resources in the beginning.

311
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,400
It has nothing to do with Xiaoman.

312
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,359
Sister-in-law.

313
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,160
What's important right now

314
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,760
is to terminate the contract

315
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,680
with Commandery Prince's Mansion.

316
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,880
I read the contract.

317
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,079
The contract cannot be
redeemed with money.

318
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
If we annul the contract personally,

319
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,719
if His Highness is aggravated

320
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,599
and sues Xiaoman
to the magistrate,

321
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,719
what should we do?

322
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,439
Do not panic.

323
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,719
There's always a solution.

324
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,479
She's still young.

325
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,280
It's inevitable for her
to make mistakes.

326
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,839
Isn't that right?

327
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,079
You brat.

328
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,119
How could you do such a thing?

329
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,479
If your reputation is ruined,

330
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,800
what should you do in the future?

331
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,800
Forget it.

332
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,400
I do not care.

333
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,040
There's nothing I can do anyway.

334
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,520
I provide you with an education

335
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,959
so you could marry into
a respectable family.

336
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,040
I can't believe you caused such a mess.

337
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,520
The whole of Wujiang Prefecture
is criticising you.

338
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,520
Tomorrow,

339
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,000
I shall request your father

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,280
to drop by the academy
and speak to the tutor.

341
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,520
You should quit school

342
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,680
and stay at home.

343
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,000
Just get ready for marriage.

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,079
What are you talking about?

345
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,000
Look.

346
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,359
This is the case.

347
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:47,920
Su family

348
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,119
has a relative named Su Tingshan.

349
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,119
He manages the store
for us at Tongzhou.

350
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,959
He's considered the shopkeeper
of Tongzhou.

351
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,719
He has a young son.

352
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,920
We're planning an intermarriage.

353
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,520
That way, in the future, you may...

354
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,000
No.

355
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,040
No matter what you say,
I'm not getting married.

356
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,800
You never told me that

357
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,239
you want me to get married.

358
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,959
You never told me that

359
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,760
you sold the family's property.

360
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,560
You never told me about moving to

361
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,040
Wujiang Prefecture or
attending Bailu Academy either.

362
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,359
Even now, without telling me anything,

363
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,520
you insist me to drop out.

364
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,000
I gave you an education

365
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,479
just so you could marry
into a respectable family.

366
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,479
You're now a laughing stock.

367
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,560
Nobody would marry you now!

368
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,719
I'm studying to discern
between right and wrong!

369
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:29,599
What are you talking about?

370
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:30,680
You're not a nun!

371
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:32,800
After marrying,

372
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,760
you're enclosed to a small estate!

373
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,599
There's no point

374
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,520
in gaining knowledge!

375
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,239
I'm not getting married!

376
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,199
You have to!

377
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,319
No matter what you say,
I'm not getting married!

378
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,359
If you force me...

379
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:40,920
No, stop it.

380
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:42,680
If you insist,
I'm going to jump off the river!

381
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,239
You...

382
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:43,760
Xiaoman.

383
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:44,839
Xiaoman.

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,959
Go ahead and jump!

385
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,479
Xiaoman.

386
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,839
Let me check her.

387
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,239
Hurry.

388
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:48,599
Xiaoman.

389
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,280
After her.

390
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,119
Look at your daughter.

391
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,839
She's your daughter as well.

392
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,359
That's enough.

393
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,520
Quit the banter.

394
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:57,680
Xiaoman.

395
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,119
Xiaoman.

396
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,199
Xiaoman.

397
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,959
I refuse to get married.

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,599
I know.

399
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,199
I don't want to leave the academy.

400
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,760
I know that as well.

401
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:09,800
Look.

402
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,040
If I'm able to acquire
Teacher Liu's fan,

403
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:12,959
would I be able

404
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,599
to ask for Congwen's favour?

405
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,280
My mother

406
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,839
would definitely listen to Congwen.

407
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,119
If Congwen would speak up

408
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,119
on my behalf,

409
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,239
would I be able to pursue my studies?

410
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,839
I can take you to
Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition.

411
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,719
However, only men are
allowed to participate.

412
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,000
We're not allowed to.

413
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,760
The silk is of premium quality.

414
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,199
It's a shame.

415
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,940
(Residence of the Su Family)

416
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,240
Look at the cosmetics.

417
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,000
Look at you.

418
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,719
You were boasting just now.

419
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,359
Great.

420
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,760
You're carrying all these goods.

421
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,119
People might mistake this
for a proposal.

422
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,760
Shut up.

423
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,599
Let me ask you.

424
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:58,800
Are you going inside?

425
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,760
I...

426
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,920
Stop putting up an act.

427
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,560
Do not interrupt one's business.

428
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,520
Hurry up and leave.

429
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,119
Move it.

430
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,680
I...

431
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,119
Who said I was going to apologise?

432
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,000
You should apologise.

433
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,280
No.

434
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,680
Hurry up.

435
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,319
I'll walk on my own.

436
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:36,959
Quit standing around.

437
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,560
Come on.

438
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,280
Go on. Let's eat.

439
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,599
What are you doing

440
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,760
with all these goods?

441
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,520
It's...

442
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,359
It's for Yan Boyang's father's
birthday celebration.

443
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:51,959
We're going to greet him.

444
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,560
Really?

445
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,119
I think so?

446
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:01,839
What's the use of

447
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,239
these cosmetics?

448
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,359
Let me see.

449
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,239
Let me see.

450
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,119
Let me see.

451
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,520
Well...

452
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,719
Yes.

453
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,680
My father has a hobby.

454
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,800
It's private.

455
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:28,439
Zhao Xiaoqian,

456
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
I need to talk to you.

457
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,500
(Auspicious All Around)

458
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:48,719
Someone

459
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,319
did not show up for work
at my place today.

460
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,959
Do not look at me.

461
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,479
I...

462
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,280
I've never apologised
to anyone in my life.

463
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,560
I don't think I did anything wrong,

464
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:12,920
but

465
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,599
I don't want you to be mad at me.

466
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,520
I don't know why either.

467
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,079
I probably lost my mind.

468
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,479
When you're mad

469
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,119
or upset,

470
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,959
I'm in distraught.

471
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,040
In extreme distraught.

472
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,400
Are you still mad over

473
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,160
the peach blossom shortbread?

474
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,719
Yes,

475
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm extremely mad.

476
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
I apologised.

477
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,800
How annoying.

478
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,040
Let me read your palm.

479
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Are you well-versed in palmistry?

480
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:57,959
Of course.

481
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,119
I'm well-versed in many things.

482
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,640
If you want to cultivate some crops,

483
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,839
you may consult me as well.

484
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,439
Let me have a look.

485
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,880
You're

486
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,160
headstrong.

487
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,920
However, you're not a bad person.

488
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,119
Next?

489
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:22,040
You may behave like a child sometimes.

490
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,199
You're unaware of hurting others.

491
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,280
However, I know that

492
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,280
it wasn't intentional.

493
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,479
You're just unaware of it.

494
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,280
Engage in good deeds.

495
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,119
Taishang Laojun
will pardon your mistakes.

496
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,040
What?

497
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
Did you learn this

498
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,560
from Taishang Laojun?

499
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm Taishang Laojun's disciple.

500
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,880
If you harass me again,

501
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,040
I'll tell my master.

502
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,599
I would ask him

503
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,479
to turn you into an old cow
in your next life.

504
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:00,800
Well,

505
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
about work...

506
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,280
Don't worry about work.

507
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:08,959
The contract is still valid.

508
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,839
I need

509
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,119
to help me with something.

510
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,599
Go ahead.

511
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,040
Please help me acquire
Teacher Liu's fan.

512
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,560
Sure.

513
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,479
Great.

514
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Great wine.

515
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,719
Master,

516
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
a letter from the capital.

517
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,313
(Princess Consort Pu is discussing about
the prince's marriage with Zhaowen)

518
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,000
What's it?

519
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,079
Does Prince Pu

520
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:52,880
expect my sister

521
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
to marry Zhao Xiaoqian?

522
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,599
In regards to the matters
of the capital,

523
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:56,760
I'm unaware as well.

524
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,439
Recently,

525
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,160
according to the brothers who
returned from there,

526
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
the marriage of
Commandery Prince of Julu

527
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,479
caused a great commotion.

528
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,479
Commandery Prince of Julu refuses
to return to the capital.

529
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,920
It brought shame to Shen family.

530
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,839
He's nothing but trash
abandoned by the palace.

531
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,319
How dare he attempts
to marry my sister?

532
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:11,839
Fine.

533
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Since Zhao Xiaoqian

534
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,719
showed no respect for my sister,

535
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,680
we're not obligated to
show him respect as well.

536
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,640
The marriage...

537
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
At Teacher Liu's Poetry
Competition tomorrow,

538
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,760
is Zhao Xiaoqian attending as well?

539
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,719
Shen family values one's conduct.

540
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
If Zhao Xiaoqian

541
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
spends the night with
Courtesan Zhu,

542
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,239
what do you think will happen?

543
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,040
You shall be the scholar's
assistant for the day.

544
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,119
Don't worry.

545
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,119
I'm here.

546
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,479
I'm going to greet some acquaintances.

547
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,719
I'll see you later.

548
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,119
In Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition
this time,

549
00:26:59,319 --> 00:26:59,959
we must...

550
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,479
Sir Han.

551
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,359
(Great scholar of Guanwen Hall, Han Qi)
It's been a while.

552
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,439
Hanchen.

553
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,040
You're all grown up.

554
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,439
When I saw you,

555
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,959
I could barely recognise you.

556
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,160
I once learned calligraphy
from you when I was young.

557
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,280
I still hold memories of it now.

558
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,079
You criticized me for
being too mischievous.

559
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,560
You almost gave up.

560
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,599
Master Han.

561
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,280
Back then, Master Han

562
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,000
taught me calligraphy as well.

563
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,400
You said, although Hanchen is cheeky,

564
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,760
his techniques exceed mine.

565
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,280
Are you really going to help Congwen

566
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,239
win the fan?

567
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,839
Isn't it too difficult of a task?

568
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Are you trying to acquire
Teacher Liu's fan

569
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,199
for Li Congwen?

570
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,439
Do not poke your nose
into other's business.

571
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,239
Have you heard of that?

572
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,319
Do not tell anyone.

573
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,119
Otherwise, I'd give you an earful.

574
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,319
Fine, I can keep it a secret.

575
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,560
However, you have to tell me

576
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,439
why you're doing this for Li Congwen.

577
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,719
The gazebo is chosen.

578
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,760
Chunhui Pavilion.

579
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:12,880
Let's head over there.

580
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,239
It's for her to study.

581
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:14,680
Let's go.

582
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,000
Boyang.

583
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:17,880
Where's Hanchen?

584
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,439
Here he comes.

585
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,479
These are the rules of
Flying Flower Game.

586
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:38,560
Let me take a look.

587
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,520
For this quarter's poetry competition,

588
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,760
(The rules of Flying Flower Game)
there are two sets of rules.

589
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,959
The first is Flying Flower Game.

590
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,400
The second is the ability
to compose poems.

591
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,599
The theme for
the Flying Flower Game is

592
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:46,880
"flowers".

593
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,520
All of you shall answer in order.

594
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,640
Write down the correct verses

595
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,839
and present them.

596
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,719
I'm not going to stay for long.

597
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,400
Thus, I prepared a few
verses for all of you.

598
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,160
You may memorise them

599
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,199
and ponder upon them

600
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
to be inspired.

601
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Xingzhou.

602
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,719
Xingzhou, where are you going?

603
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:14,160
Ignore him.

604
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,880
He's always like that.

605
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,680
He's eccentric.

606
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,640
Xingzhou.

607
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,520
How could you steal
Zhong Ziyan's moneybag?

608
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:29,959
You're wrong.

609
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,560
I did not steal.

610
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,079
I'm keeping it for him.

611
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,000
I'll return it to him later.

612
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,400
Assistant.

613
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,479
Have some tea.

614
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,319
Thank you.

615
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,079
Fellow scholars.

616
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,239
Let us begin.

617
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,640
Sun Kaikai of Liulian Pavilion.

618
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,239
Night has come,
the swallow has yet to return.

619
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,079
The scenery cast with rain and
fog seemed wretched and delicate.

620
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,439
Not bad.

621
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,400
The great poet of Tang Dynasty,

622
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,160
Dai Shulun's Shuxi Pavilion.

623
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,560
Reward him the flower.

624
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,719
Bravo!

625
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,640
Bravo!

626
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,520
(Shen Yan of Xiaoyue Pavilion.)

627
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,199
(Despite the urge of the night breeze,)

628
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,959
(the boat only floats by the shallows.)

629
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,239
Hold on.

630
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,239
Do not go.

631
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,599
Allow Boyang to present instead.

632
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:20,920
Boyang.

633
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:22,319
Hurry up.

634
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,520
What?

635
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:26,920
Why?

636
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,199
You're clumsy.

637
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,599
Do not ruin my brush and ink.

638
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,800
Allow Boyang to go instead.

639
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,520
Take a break.

640
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,160
My father is still here.

641
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,839
I can't go.

642
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,119
You're my assistant.

643
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:37,959
Why can't you go?

644
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,040
You're so disobedient today.

645
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,079
Assistant?

646
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,319
Aren't we brothers?

647
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:41,959
Yes, we are.

648
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,079
That's why you need to help me out.

649
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,319
Hurry up.

650
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,359
Go on.

651
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,880
Yan Boyang

652
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,199
is moping around.

653
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,439
Are you sure it'd work?

654
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,680
Xingzhou is here.

655
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,359
Don't worry.

656
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,319
Zhao Xiaoqian of Chunhui Pavilion.

657
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,680
In the tranquil mountains,
the osmanthus falls.

658
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,119
Loneliness echoes
through the placid night.

659
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,400
This young man shows great technique.

660
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:21,920
Award him with flower.

661
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,560
Bravo!

662
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,640
Bravo!

663
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:41,839
Father.

664
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,160
Hanchen invited me here today.

665
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,199
He doesn't harbour ill intentions.

666
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,820
(Magistrate of Wujiang, Yan Nengfu,
Yan Boyang's father)

667
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:48,920
You were right.

668
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,560
I said, what you did was right.

669
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,439
Currently,

670
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,959
the situation in
the imperial court is unstable.

671
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,199
You

672
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,880
are doing the right thing today.

673
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,479
You should plan for yourself.

674
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,920
Do not be swayed by
the opinions of others.

675
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,319
Take hold of your own future.

676
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,400
Father,

677
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,319
what are you talking about?

678
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,199
Hanchen and I are brothers.

679
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,640
Look at you.

680
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,520
Are you a fool?

681
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,800
He's Commandery Prince of Julu.

682
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,680
You expect to be his friend?

683
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,079
You should know your position.

684
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:23,479
No, father.

685
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,239
This...

686
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,000
That's enough.

687
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:25,920
You should get back.

688
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,319
Go on.

689
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,959
I heard of a young man
who came from the west.

690
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,280
He claims to be

691
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,040
the Head of Nencao Hall.

692
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,000
He writes poetry for others

693
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,239
for a tael of silver.

694
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,199
Many noble men and ladies

695
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,119
consult him.

696
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,640
Isn't this the second son of Yan family?

697
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,839
Since when did he

698
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,640
become a male attendant just like us?

699
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,479
You have no idea.

700
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,680
The second son of Yan family

701
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,280
has always been
the assistant of the Commandery Prince.

702
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,959
He pleased the Commandery Prince.

703
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,520
He has a great future ahead of him.

704
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
He's different

705
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,640
from the rest of us.

706
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
What are you talking about?

707
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,439
Mind your words.

708
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,399
Assistant.

709
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,239
Come here.

710
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,520
Have some tea.

711
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,959
I don't want any.

712
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,760
Commandery Prince shouldn't
pour tea for the attendant.

713
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,520
What are you afraid of?

714
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,840
I even fed Zhao Mao...

715
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
What did you feed him?

716
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,959
It's none of your business.

717
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,239
I'm leaving these here.

718
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,159
I'm leaving.

719
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,520
What's wrong with Boyang?

720
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,879
I'll check out on him.

721
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,600
Zhanzhi.

722
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:58,479
Zhanzhi.

723
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,399
What's wrong with him?

724
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,399
Zhanzhi.

725
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,439
What's going on?

726
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,439
Is something wrong?

727
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,479
We came here together.

728
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,840
The last round isn't over yet.

729
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,479
Why did you leave on your own?

730
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,520
Am I going to stay here

731
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,479
and be ordered around
as an assistant?

732
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,479
What are you talking about?

733
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,800
What else can I say?

734
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,760
I came to my senses today.

735
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,919
I've finally learned the reality.

736
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,719
I'm telling you.

737
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,000
Your Highness,

738
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,879
may you enjoy the view.

739
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,280
What's going on with you?

740
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,199
I had no idea

741
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,360
Your Highness were concerned
about Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition.

742
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,639
Xiaoman wants the fan.

743
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,080
Everyone is helping her out.

744
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,000
Xiaoman wants the fan?

745
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,080
Are you a fool?

746
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,000
Xiaoman isn't going to
give the fan to you.

747
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,439
The fan is for Li Su!

748
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:54,840
What's the matter?

749
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,520
Are you going to hit me?

750
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,679
Go ahead and hit me here.

751
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,399
You're the Commandery Prince after all.

752
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,840
I can take it. Go ahead and hit me.

753
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,959
Come on.

754
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,199
Why wouldn't you hit me?

755
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,679
What's wrong with Yan Boyang?

756
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,159
Why do you need Teacher Liu's fan?

757
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,600
I...

758
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,199
Do you take me as a fool?

759
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
By making me participate
in the competition,

760
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,199
winning the fan,

761
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,679
and gifting it to Li Su instead.

762
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,199
Does it please you?

763
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:38,959
No.

764
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:40,919
Xie Xiaoman,

765
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,199
good for you.

766
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,520
I'm Commandery Prince of Julu,

767
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,040
yet I was completely fooled by you.

768
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,199
Well done.

769
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,159
Zhao Xiaoqian.

770
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,520
Let me explain.

771
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,800
Do not touch me.

772
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:01,479
Xiaoman,

773
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,199
where are you going?

774
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,479
He brought me here.

775
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,199
I need to explain the situation.

776
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:06,800
At this point,

777
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,199
it's a waste if you're leaving.

778
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,199
How about this?

779
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,520
I'll look for him on your behalf

780
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,800
and clear the air.

781
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,679
Don't worry.

782
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,159
I'm off.

783
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,040
Master.

784
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,560
How are the things going?

785
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,560
The boat is ready.

786
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,360
Once he enters the boat,
he will not be able to leave.

787
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:29,479
Good job.

788
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,800
You're dismissed.

789
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,840
All right.

790
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,199
Xie Xiaoman?

791
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:45,679
What are you doing here?

792
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,679
I came to tell you

793
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,840
that Yan Boyang

794
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,120
is trapped in the boat.

795
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,120
Master

796
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,679
wants me to inform His Highness

797
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,520
so he may head to his rescue.

798
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,399
If

799
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,199
Yan Boyang is trapped for long,

800
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,879
what should we do if
something goes wrong?

801
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,600
That's why you should
inform him quickly.

802
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,120
Zhao Xiaoqian.

803
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:20,560
Attendant.

804
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,199
Excuse me,

805
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,040
have you seen Yan Boyang?

806
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,199
I'm not sure.

807
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,360
Look, that's him.

808
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,120
Based on the appearance,

809
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,639
it doesn't resemble
a son of a noble household.

810
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
It resembles a woman.

811
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Whatever.

812
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,679
We took the money for this.

813
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:36,600
Let's go.

814
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,520
Handsome man.

815
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,639
Let's drink to our heart's content.

816
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,560
Let's go, handsome.

817
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:44,879
Let's go.

818
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:45,399
Let go of me.

819
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:45,840
Have a cup.

820
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,639
No, I'm not going.

821
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,520
Let's go.

822
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,040
How did it go?

823
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,639
I couldn't find the Commandery Prince,

824
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,320
but I met his female attendant.

825
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,439
I ordered her to
inform Zhao Xiaoqian.

826
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,679
With my identity,

827
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,320
he'd grow suspicious.

828
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,520
However, do not worry.

829
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Once Zhao Xiaoqian

830
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,800
enters the boat,

831
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,080
even if nothing happens,

832
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,679
we can spread rumours about it.

833
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,679
If this incident was made known,

834
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,959
his reputation will be tarnished.

835
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,080
Great.

836
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,520
Master,

837
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,199
isn't that Mr. Yan?

838
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,399
I don't know what's wrong with him.

839
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,840
He played three rounds
of chess here

840
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,639
and wouldn't leave.

841
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,199
He walked directly into the trap.

842
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,479
I shall play a few rounds with him.

843
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:33,959
Mr. Yan.

844
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,679
Get out of my way.

845
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,679
What's the matter, Mr. Yan?

846
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,600
Let's play a couple of rounds.

847
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,159
It'd be fun if money is placed at stake.

848
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,639
Come on.

849
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,040
I'm not afraid of you.

850
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,679
Please.

851
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,959
Let me go. I need to leave.

852
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Are you kidding?

853
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,919
Your skin is tender and smooth.

854
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,560
There isn't any like you
who'd enter the boat

855
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,840
and leave hastily.

856
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
You may leave if you want to,

857
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,199
but there are rules.

858
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,479
One must drink once
they enter the boat.

859
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,360
If you finish three cups,

860
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,000
we will let you out of here.

861
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,199
I do not drink.

862
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,479
You don't want to?

863
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,479
You won't be able to get out of here.

864
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,800
I'm not drinking.

865
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,679
Let me go!

866
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,479
Fine then.

867
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,679
You're not getting out of here.

868
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,879
Today,

869
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,679
we shall have fun until the sun rises.

870
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,320
Yes.

871
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,679
You...

872
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,439
Come on.

873
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,120
Fine.

874
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:34,199
I'm done.

875
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,600
Let me out of here.

876
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,600
Have some patience.

877
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,040
There are two more cups.

878
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Courtesan Zhu is coming out.

879
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,679
-Courtesan Zhu.
-Courtesan Zhu.

880
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,360
This young man

881
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,399
is probably captivated
by Courtesan Zhu.

882
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,320
Courtesan Zhu isn't someone who'd

883
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,679
serve the likes of you.

884
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,679
Mr. Li Su

885
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,439
and Courtesan Zhu have developed

886
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,679
a sound relationship.

887
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:00,439
Bravo!

888
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
A few days ago,

889
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,080
you requested a troop
of soldiers from Sir Chang

890
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,199
and headed to
the Commandery Prince's Mansion?

891
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,360
Was it for a lady of your academy,

892
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,479
Xie Xiaoman?

893
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,199
Yes.

894
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,399
Back at Yuyang Alley,

895
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,800
I met her once.

896
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,919
She's a great kid.

897
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,159
Your status is significant.

898
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,199
People of the capital

899
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,879
are eyeing on you here
at Wujiang Prefecture.

900
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,600
How could you act recklessly?

901
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:30,199
Besides, she's just a mere lady.

902
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,520
What you did

903
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
would taint her reputation.

904
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,479
Stay out of

905
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:36,399
her matters from now on.

906
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:39,000
I know you're worried about me.

907
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:40,199
Don't worry.

908
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:41,360
It will not happen again.

909
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,199
Congwen.

910
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,199
If I left one day,

911
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,639
no one would be around
to remind you anymore.

912
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,080
When that happens,

913
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,879
you must be cautious.

914
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,000
Yanniang,

915
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,199
why have you been talking about

916
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,840
leaving recently?

917
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,000
I can promise you anything

918
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,679
but the idea of separating.

919
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,399
My identity...

920
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,840
About redeeming your freedom,

921
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,199
I requested help from Sir Chang.

922
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,800
He promised to help me.

923
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,600
It will happen soon.

924
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,199
All right.

925
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:34,919
