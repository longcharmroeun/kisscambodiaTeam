listening to the rain)

(Residence of the Su Family)

Mother!

Mother!

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,160
- Xiaoman.
- Mother.

25
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:52,480
Calm down.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,360
What happened?

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,519
Why was father arrested?

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,919
Your father...

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,040
They said your father

30
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,599
transferred people from
the censorate on his own.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,519
It's an act which is beyond his powers.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,599
Just now,

33
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,879
he was brought away before noon.

34
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,360
This must be Zhao Xiaoqian's doing.

35
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,519
I'm going to look for him.

36
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,160
Xiaoman, don't.

37
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,040
Calm down first.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,519
Your uncle

39
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,160
went to check with the magistrate
early this morning.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,919
Let's hear what he has to
say when he comes back.

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,600
That's right.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,479
Something bad happened!

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,720
Madam,

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,520
master was arrested.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,919
Suchangji was sealed.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,759
Lady,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,679
Commandery Prince said
he's waiting for you at Taiping Tavern.

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,800
Xiaoman, you mustn't go.

49
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,679
The messenger who came said

50
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,559
if she doesn't show,

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,440
we'll never see the two
old masters again.

52
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,279
Mother.

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,279
They are too much.

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,240
Calm down first.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Don't tell madam about it for now.

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,279
We don't want her to worry.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,919
I'll go and meet him.

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Xiaoman,

59
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,520
you mustn't go.

60
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,960
They must be up to something.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,360
Don't worry.

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Since things have come to this,

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,720
there's nothing else to
be afraid of anymore.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Xiaoman!

65
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:01,919
Xiaoman!

66
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:02,800
Xiaoman!

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,399
Xiaoman!

68
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,080
Where's Zhao Xiaoqian?

69
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,240
He's not in.

70
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,559
For certain things,

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
you just have to discuss with me.

72
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,919
Discuss with you?

73
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,960
Are you able to make decisions?

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
I can't,

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,839
but you can.

76
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,759
You and Hanchen spent
the night together,

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,039
and Commandery Prince's Mansion
kept it a secret for you.

78
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,559
As you can see when you
went to the academy earlier,

79
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:45,039
no one dare mention it.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,080
However, within Wujiang Prefecture,

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,440
it's still become a scandal.

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,679
Even if Commandery Prince's Mansion
is powerful,

83
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,520
we cannot stop
these people from gossiping.

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Do you know why?

85
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,880
It's Shen Yan's doing.

86
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,520
Shen Yan and Hanchen were
enemies since they were kids.

87
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,240
In order to break Zhao and
Shen's marriage engagement,

88
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,639
he came up with this plot.

89
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,960
Even your father's matter,

90
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,240
it's also Shen Yan's doing.

91
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,960
What about my uncle?

92
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,600
Is it also Shen Yan's doing?

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,239
It's me.

94
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,760
So, what else do you have to say?

95
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,359
I just want to tell you that

96
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,000
although Commandery Prince's Mansion

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,959
isn't a peaceful place,

98
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,799
we can still protect you,

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,519
Su Family as well as
Xie Family from harm.

100
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,359
If you marry Hanchen as a concubine,

101
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
your father, your uncle

102
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,480
and even your brother, Xie Xun,

103
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
who is currently in the capital,

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,160
we'll be able to help.

105
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,399
If you aren't willing,

106
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,279
other than Xie Yu's

107
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,079
and Suchangji's future,

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,799
even for Xie Xun,

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,160
his father is jailed.

110
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,920
Did you know, for the family members of
the imperial examination's attendees

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
had such a thing
happen in their family,

112
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,119
they are barred from the exam

113
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,160
forever?

114
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,559
You're threatening me?

115
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,640
That's right.

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
I need to see Zhao Xiaoqian.

117
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,799
I need to see Zhao Xiaoqian!

118
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,559
It's all my doing.

119
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,440
Xingzhou has nothing to do with it.

120
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,799
Why did you do this?

121
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,440
Because I'm selfish.

122
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,399
I don't want to return to the capital.

123
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,480
That's why I could only use you.

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
What about me?

125
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,119
What did I do?

126
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,040
What did I do wrong?

127
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,799
Why are you so selfish?

128
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,279
Did you consider

129
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,200
my feelings even once?

130
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,119
It's as if I was some sort of goods

131
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,440
which you all handled as you wished.

132
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,839
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,559
You're sorry?

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,519
That's my entire life!

135
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,600
That's my entire life!

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,119
Two years.

137
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,799
Give me two years.

138
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,880
Become my concubine for two years,

139
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,519
and I'll order them

140
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,839
to release your father and uncle.

141
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,640
Suchangji will naturally be fine.

142
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:13,799
Didn't you want money

143
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,239
to redeem your land in Yuyangli?

144
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,079
I promise.

145
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll sign a flexible contract with you.

146
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,320
You'll be free after two years,

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
and I'll give you 200 taels of silver.

148
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,839
I'll also return to you

149
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,119
your family's mulberry field.

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
I'll let you return to Yuyangli.

151
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,440
I slapped you

152
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,600
because you owed me that.

153
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,279
I promise you.

154
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,399
Hanchen!

155
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,359
Hanchen!

156
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,200
Xiaoman.

157
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,880
They didn't hurt you, did they?

158
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,559
Mother,

159
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,239
I'm fine.

160
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,600
They'll release father

161
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,160
and uncle.

162
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,640
Suchangji

163
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,200
will also be fine.

164
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,959
Why did His Highness

165
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,559
suddenly become so kind?

166
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,239
Xiaoman,

167
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,799
is it because you
promised him something?

168
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,720
Don't bother about
the coming-of-age ceremony.

169
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,600
Mother,

170
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,440
I'm going to marry him.

171
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,960
Mother,

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
why are you crying?

173
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,400
I'm going to marry him.

174
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,039
Smile.

175
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,960
Smile as I'm getting married.

176
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,960
I have to be

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,599
a joyful bride.

178
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,559
Xiaoman.

179
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,200
Mistress,

180
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,000
those from Commandery Prince's
Mansion are here again.

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,280
Greetings, ladies.

182
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,840
Isn't it as you wished?

183
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,400
This is Commandery Prince of Julu's gift

185
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,599
for you.

186
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,679
His Highness said

187
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,320
your coming-of-age ceremony
will go on as planned.

188
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,840
He also found

189
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,039
Teacher Liu from Bailu Academy

190
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,840
to be your honoured guest.

191
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,440
Teacher Liu had been
traveling prior to this.

192
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,719
She'll return to the academy
in few days.

193
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,200
She's talented in composing poems.

194
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,559
Even in the capital itself,

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,400
she's also known as
a gifted female scholar.

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,799
Asking her to be
Xiaoman's honoured guest,

197
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,239
you all don't have to worry.

198
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,400

but it doesn't mean I don't
want others to get married.

are whom they depend on,

280
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,080
but in the end, they should depend on

281
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,039
themselves.

When I was your age,

284
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:48,679
I also read "Admonitions for Women".

285
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,400
What do you think?

286
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,640
I've long forgotten

287
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,880
about the lessons taught in the book.

288
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,559
However, that sentence,

289
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,280
"teach men but not women,

290
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,359
isn't that also bigotry?"

291
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:04,520
left a lasting impression to me.

292
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,359
Ban Zhao edited "Book of Han",

293
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,880
which means he wasn't
a short-sighted person.

294
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,000
Although "Admonitions for Women"
were lessons for women,

295
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,680
it's possible to glimpse the first light

296
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,400
between the lines.

297
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,560
It's the hopes of Ban Zhao

298
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,000
which was for men and women

299
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
to learn courtesy and knowledge.

300
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,079
That's why you

301
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,160
decided to teach women knowledge.

302
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,760
Xiaoman,

303
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
remember this.

304
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,239
Even after you get married,

305
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,640
you must also remain strong
despite the circumstances,

306
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,199
and never let your
initial ambition falter.

307
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,920
Although you'll be in
Commandery Prince's Mansion,

308
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,839
you can also learn knowledge

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
and be a prolific reader.

310
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,199
That way,

311
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,479
you won't get caught

312
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,959
in the typical complaints by females

313
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,439
or the troubles of daily life.

314
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,040
Only with ambition will a woman

315
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,239
not be affected by external factors.

316
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,800
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

317
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,479
I'll definitely keep your
teachings in mind

318
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,239
so I could be like you

319
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,119

Since the ceremony is ready,
on this joyous day,

330
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,359
you'll be given a formal name.
It's a great name,

331
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,800
which goes well with the scholar.
A suitable name is the topmost priority.

332

lifetime. You shall be called Fu An.

Filial to the parents, take care
of the juniors with kindness.

Temperate, kind, courteous,
restrained and magnanimous.

338
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,400
Don't get conceited or arrogant.
Don't slander or deceive.

339
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,239
Traditional lessons are a
formality which you must keep.

I'll let you take two steps first.

350
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,079

351

The circumstances don't favour me.

352
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,479
I won by half a chess piece.

353
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:41,800
Go ahead.

No need.

368
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm not hungry.

369
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,680
Let me tell you.

370
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,880
It's not that my lady
doesn't want me anymore.

371
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm going back to the Residence
of the Su Family soon.

372
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:04,800
Wick,

373
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,280
tell me.

374
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,880
Will he

375
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,319
want to

376
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,400
consummate with me?

377
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,920
What's wrong with that?

378
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,160
For a married couple,

379
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,599
it's just normal.

380
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,839
Haven't you heard of those words before?

381
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,479
Toss coins and dried fruits at the east,

382
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,239
a lovely pair of lotuses
embroidered on the bed.

383
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,479
Toss coins and dried fruits at the west,

384
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,959
a pair of golden roosters
embroidered on the bed.

385
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,280
Toss coins and dried fruits
at the north,

386
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,520
the couple will have children easily.

387
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,400
Toss coins and dried fruits
at the south,

388
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,599
there'll be an abundance of offspring.

389
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,199
I'll even have to give birth to a child?

390
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:33,959
Of course.

391
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,680
If the newlyweds sleep
on the same side,

392
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,160
they'll have a pair
of children next year.

393
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,959
The son will be the principal graduate
in the palace examination

394
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,400
and the daughter will be
a princess consort.

395
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,560
What princess consort?

396
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,920
The daughter will be a princess consort.

397
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,800
Which is to say, if Your Highness

398
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,199
has a daughter with Lady Xiaoman,

399
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,280
she'll become a princess consort
in the capital.

400
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,040
Wick.

401
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,119
Well said.

402
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,319
Go and get a reward from Liangji.

403
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,239
Thank you, Your Highness.

404
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,719
Did you get into a fight again?

405
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,040
I thought you won't
talk with me anymore.

406
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
I've promised you.

407
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,839
If I keep on giving you an attitude,

408
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I'd also feel bad.

409
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,520
Are you hungry?

410
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,280
I saw you busying
yourself the entire day

411
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,719
and didn't seem to eat anything.

412
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,520
I prepared some venison jerky for you.

413
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
If you're hungry...

414
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,280
Don't come over.

415
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:48,959
I have to sit down

416
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,439
or it's against the manners.

417
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,420
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

418
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,560
Where's Commandery Prince of Julu?

419
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,400
His Highness...

420
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,000
Zhu Momo.

421
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,000
Where's Commandery Prince of Julu?

422
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,400
His Highness is inside.

423
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,400
She's sent here from the capital.

424
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,860
(Lotus Garden)

425
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,400
Don't come over.

426
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,400
Go ahead and shout.

427
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,920
Why aren't you shouting anymore?

428
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,479
Shouted yourself hoarse, haven't you?

429
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:44,760
Come over.

430
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,839
You...

431
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Come and drink
this wedding toast with me.

432
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,319
People do that when
they marry their wives.

433
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,439
I'm just a concubine.

434
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,400
Draping red ornaments
all over your room,

435
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:05,199
people might say I have no manners.

436
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,880
Why do you bother?

437
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
I was worried you'll be wronged.

438
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,680
Take it.

439
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,400
That's the rule.

440
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,760
Come over.

441
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,439
If one of the cups faces upward
and the other downward,

442
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,199
it's an auspicious sign
with symbolic meaning.

443
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,599
The crowd will then offer
their congratulatory wishes.

444
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,920
That's a good sign.

445
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,439
In the future, we'll

446
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,239
lead a good life.

447
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,839
Don't go overboard!

448
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,719
This time, it's our master.

449
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,040
Zhu Momo's here.

450
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:16,000
What she's doing here?

451
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,839
Hurry up! Hurry!

452
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:18,319
Who is she?

453
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,400
The housekeeper.

454
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,359
Hurry!

455
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,959
Greetings, Momo.

456
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,400
All these ornaments in the house

457
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,239
are too improper.

458
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,400
Commandery Prince of Julu
doesn't know the customs.

459
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,319
Liangji,

460
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,839
you're from Prince of Pu's Mansion.

461
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,079
Don't you know the customs?

462
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,079
Pardon me.

463
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,439
Inform Commandery Prince of Julu that

464
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,560
I'm here.

465
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,599
Zhu Momo's here.

466
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,719
Greetings, Zhu Momo.

467
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,680
Zhu Momo?

468
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,400
What's wrong?

469
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,000
Someone came from the capital.

470
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,359
She's my mother's nanny.

471
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
Don't speak later.

472
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
(Lotus Garden)

473
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,119
I've disturbed Your Highness's rest.

474
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,040
Please forgive me.

475
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,599
Zhu Momo,

476
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,800
why are you here?

477
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,599
Your Highness's willful actions

478
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,640
caused some trouble in the capital.

479
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:37,079
Her Highness wanted me to bring
this message to Your Highness.

480
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,680
Since you're getting a concubine,

481
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,760
why?

482
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,800
The bride's in a red costume.

483
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,719
Is she going to be the duchess?

484
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,920
I told them to make the wedding dress.

485
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
It has nothing to do with Xiaoman.

486
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,119
Come at me if there's anything.

487
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,439
His Highness doesn't
know the customs.

488
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,640
Liangji,

489
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,599
are you also not aware of it?

490
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,400
His Highness is a royal.

491
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,000
Therefore, he should follow the rules.

492
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,680
Today, the concubine's
wearing a red costume.

493
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:27,079
In the future, when the duchess
marries into the family,

494
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,239
what's she going to wear?

495
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,160
Zhu Momo,

496
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
we weren't considerate enough.

497
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,079
Lady Xie was our classmate.

498
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,160
Hanchen's getting a concubine

499
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
and everyone's happy.

500
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,079
In fact, this isn't exactly red either.

501
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,439
We told them

502
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,719
not to make it bright red.

503
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,000
We added mauve colour

504
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:49,880
to differentiate

505
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,000
as well as to add to the festivities.

506
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,680
That's right. Mauve colour was added.

507
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,920
All right, that's that.

508
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,439
Since she's married into the family,

509
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,760
I won't pursue what
happened in the past.

510
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:05,479
However,
I was sent here by Her Highness.

511
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,160
So, I should follow
Prince of Pu's Mansion's rules.

512
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,760
Since Lady Xie is the concubine,

513
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,319
within the mansion,

514
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,400
she's just a maidservant.

515
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,680
Prince of Pu's Mansion never allowed
a person with no manner to stay.

516
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,880
Lady Xie,

517
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,479
show me your courtesy.

518
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,079
Zhu Momo, you came all
the way from the capital.

519
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,000
It must be a tiring journey.

520
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,280
Why don't you take a rest first?

521
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,040
Carry it properly.

522
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,119
Zhu Momo!

523
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,719
This is Commandery Prince's Mansion,

524
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
not Prince of Pu's Mansion!

525
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,040
Since you're now a prince,

526
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,520
you should be cautious with
your words and actions more.

527
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,319
Let's not talk about
Prince of Pu's Mansion.

528
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,280
Even at Zichen Palace in the capital,

529
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,520
which of the ladies has no manners?

530
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:02,680
Since you're from Zhao Family

531
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:05,560
and respected by the people,

532
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,719
you should follow the people's rules.

533
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,719
Tomorrow,

534
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,399
Lady Xie will rise at 5.45 a.m. to

535
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,280
learn manners from me first.

536
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,040
But I have to go to
the academy tomorrow.

537
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:38,760
Lady Xie,

538
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,199
you're so naive.

539
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,479
No married woman

540
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,919
can leave her mansion freely.

541
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,159
Moreover,

542
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:50,760
now that you're married,

543
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,800
you don't have to go to
the academy anymore.

544
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
What's the purpose of
going to the academy anyway?

545
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,040
It's to...

546
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,679
From today onwards,

547
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,760
Lady Xie will stop going to the academy.

548
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,919
You'll learn manners from me first.

549
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,320
Hanchen,

550
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,040
don't act rashly.

551
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,879
Lady Xie should go and rest first.

552
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,000
Early tomorrow morning,

553
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,879
I'll wait for you here.

554
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,560
What's the purpose

555
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:50,840
of studying?

556
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Guess what she's here for?

557
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,959
It seems like your parents

558
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,120
haven't given up on the idea of

559
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,439
your marriage with
the daughter of Shen Family.

560
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:17,120
They want to chase Xiaoman away

561
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,560
for me to marry Shen Zhaowen instead.

562
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,000
What wishful thinking.

563
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,919
They've never bothered much
about me since young,

564
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,639
and now when they realise
I'm useful for them,

565
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,879
they quickly

566
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,560
take actions without taking
my opinion into consideration.

567
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,639
So, what do you plan to do?

568
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,879
Anyway,

569
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,719
let's not alert our opponent first.

570
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,120
I have my own way.

571
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,719
Zhao Xiaoqian,

572
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:45,639
what's going on?

573
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:46,879
I heard that

574
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,439
someone came to your mansion last night

575
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,719
and advised you not
to let Xiaoman study.

576
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,560
Who is that person?

577
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,879
Zhu Momo is here.

578
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:52,959
Who?

579
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,479
Zhu Momo?

580
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,199
She even interfered
with Hanchen's affairs?

581
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:57,560
That's right.

582
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,159
She was sent by my mother,

583
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,879
a Momo at Prince of Pu's Mansion.

584
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,399
She said, since Xiaoman
married into my family,

585
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,479
it'll be against the rules
if she goes elsewhere.

586
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,120
She even said it's our family's
internal rules for discipline.

587
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
In fact, it's just my mother's

588
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,959
idea to deal with me.

589
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,120
She's Princess Consort of Pu's nanny,

590
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,840
the most powerful elder
servant in the family.

591
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:18,879
It's not just Hanchen either.

592
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,719
Even Prince and Princess Consort of Pu

593
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,719
respect her.

594
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,399
We can't openly

595
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,560
disobey her words.

596
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,479
So, what should we do now?

597
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,520
Do we shrug Xiaoman's matter off?

598
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,800
Who says we're shrugging it off?

599
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,840
It just depends on
how we'll handle it.

600
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:32,919
After school today,

601
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,080
you'll go and keep Xiaoman
company at the mansion.

602
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,239
This old, stubborn servant
is not easy to deal with.

603
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,000
Tell Xiaoman not to oppose her.

604
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,320
What do you mean by
"it depends on how we'll handle it"?

605
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,760
Exactly what do you plan to do?

606
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,199
Tell her to trust me this once.

607
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,560
But there has to be a solution.

608
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,239
Yes.

609
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:53,239
Hanchen.

610
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:54,840
Hanchen.

611
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:56,439
Xingzhou.

612
00:37:58,959 --> 00:37:59,840
That night,

613
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,719
were you all right?

614
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,159
I drank that day

615
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,399
and spoke nonsense.

616
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,959
Please don't mind.

617
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,080
Oh, right.

618
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
I went to the academy earlier

619
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,080
and realised Xiaoman wasn't there.

620
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,439
Everyone else was
acting kind of strange.

621
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,239
What's wrong?

622
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,520
It's indeed strange.

623
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,320
You can say it's unheard of.

624
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,679
That day during
Teacher Liu's Poetry Competition,

625
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:32,800
she

626
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:35,360
went on Commandery Prince's
horse carriage

627
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,840
and they somehow left the city,

628
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
and didn't come back the entire night.

629
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,479
So, when everyone heard of it,

630
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,520
she could only marry him.

631
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:44,879
Talking about this matter,

632
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,439
it also saddens me actually.

633
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,080
Lady Xie is quite studious.

634
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,239
Last time, I was the honoured guest at
her coming-of-age ceremony.

635
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,280
I found out she even read
"Esteemed Documents" before.

636
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,479
Yet, she's getting married.

637
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,000
Such a pity.

638
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,420
(What an amazing poem
that you've written)

639
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,080
Hit the tea whisk with force.

640
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,560
Use your force.

641
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,560
If you don't, the tea leaves
won't be leveraged.

642
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,679
Tea ceremony is
the basic skill for women.

643
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,280
Lady Xie, your poor skills

644
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
must mean you lacked
training since young.

645
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,180
(Siqi Hall)

646
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,959
Zhu Momo,

647
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,760
Lady Xie's maternal cousin,

648
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,679
Lady Su is here to visit.

649
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,199
One without manners
becomes anxious easily.

650
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,560
Continue.

651
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,239
She's only been married here for a day.

652
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,000
What's there to visit?

653
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,280
Ask her to go home.

654
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,320
Momo,

655
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,399
my cousin was closest with me

656
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,560
before I was married.

657
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,080
Please let me see her.

658
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,560
Momo,

659
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,239
Lady Su said

660
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,959
Commandery Prince gave his permission.

661
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,000
So...

662
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
Forget it, Hong Su.

663
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,679
Bring some ginger slices and plum

664
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,080
for them

665
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,800
to have some tea with the snacks.

666
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,080
See me in an hour's time.

667
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,320
Thank you, Momo.

668
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,660
(Siqi Hall)

669
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,479
Come on.

670
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,840
Hong Su,

671
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,879
can you tell Momo that

672
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,080
I'll learn the tea ceremony today

673
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,080
as well as the etiquette.

674
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,560
After I learned all these,

675
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,879
can I go back to studying?

676
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
Don't worry, Lady Xie.

677
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:42,360
Momo may be stringent,

678
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
but she still hopes for your best.

679
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,320
However,

680
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,080
in terms of studying,

681
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,719
I agree with Momo.

682
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,239
You don't see married women
attending an academy.

683
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,239
Isn't it good for you
to just stay at home?

684
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,080
Did they torture you

685
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,399
and stop you from studying?

686
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,080
Lady, you should bring me back quickly.

687
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,000
Lady Xie gets the unfair treatment
at home.

688
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,560
Momo punished her,

689
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,239
and I also suffered.

690
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,080
Let me see.

691
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,000
Let me see.

692
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,280
Did they hit you?

693
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,080
Don't worry about that now.

694
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,360
I just want to go back
to my studies now.

695
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,560
Have you thought about other ways?

696
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,479
Isn't Zhao Xiaoqian going to help you?

697
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,399
You're still mentioning him.

698
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,360
Whenever he saw Momo,

699
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,560
he dare not utter a single word.

700
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,959
Look, today,

701
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,439
he doesn't even come back after school.

702
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:46,919
Men's words

703
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,000
can never be trusted.

704
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:50,560
Why do you keep talking?

705
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:51,560
Get down.

706
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,439
Although I don't know

707
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,719
why we have to learn knowledge,

708
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,040
I don't wish

709
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,239
to be trapped here

710
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,520
like a bird in the cage.

711
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,280
Don't give up.

712
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,080
Zhao Xiaoqian won't help you,

713
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,800
but I will.

714
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,199
I'll help you to think of a way.

715
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,879
Let's go to Teacher Liu for help.

716
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,760
Teacher Liu?

717
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,439
That's right.

718
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,919
I'm talking about Teacher Liu.

719
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,199
She gave us homework today.

720
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,560
Dragon Boat Festival
is in two days' time.

721
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,239
She told us to write
Qu Yuan's poetry and prose,

722
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,439
and answer it on the day of the test.

723
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,439
You'll also prepare a copy at home,

724
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,239
and I'll help you bring it to
Teacher Liu

725
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,800
so she could plead for your sake.

726
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,959
What do you think?

727
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,080
When is the test?

728
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,959
Let me think.

729
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,560
It's the day
you'll visit your own family.

730
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,080
Support the teacup with your left hand.

731
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Be steady.

732
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,080
Exert force with your right wrist.

733
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,560
How many times have I told you?

734
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,840
Flick with strength.

735
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,439
