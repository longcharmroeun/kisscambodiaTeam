00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,080
Why do I have a daughter

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,830
as stubborn as you?

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,440
Don't think about going back
to Yuyangli Village.

24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,830
Give up the idea forever.

25
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,160
The four of us

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,400
had been living on
the two hectares of land

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,040
in Yuyangli Village.

28
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,360
How could Xie Jing have the heart
to take it away?

29
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,030
He's your uncle.

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,830
(Xie Xiaoman's younger brother Xie Li)
He's not.

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,440
He's a bandit.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
(Xie Xiaoman's mother, surnamed Meng)
You sold the land

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,520
and decided to move to
Wujiang Prefecture without my consent.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,110
You asked me to
go to a free school there,

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,320
but I haven't finished my studies
in the village.

36
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,360
Anyway,

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,000
we've sold the land to your uncle

38
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,160
and we're arriving
in Wujiang Prefecture.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,720
You have no other choice
but to live there

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
and go to school there.

41

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,630
Where is your sister?

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,360
She pissed mom off again.

No, I haven't.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,470
I'm great.

62
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,320
Don't worry.

63
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,630
You've had a long journey.

64

69
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,030
Don't go anywhere.

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
You guys go over there and look for it.

72
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,190

What are you waiting for?

74

Go look for it!

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,950
I have something else to report to you.

92
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,480
The study in our mansion

93
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,510
hasn't been cleaned for a long time

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,600
since all our maid servants can't read.

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,350
Shall we hire one who can read?

96
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,000

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,110
you've received 13 letters
from the capital.

Go look for it.

Hurry.

111
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,510
- Let's go.
- Yes sir.

112
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,440
What's wrong with Xiaoman?

113
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,320
She looks upset.

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,790
Is it because of
the two hectares of land?

115
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
Exactly.
She's been complaining all the way here.

116
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,390
Just ignore her.

117
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,390
She's ill-mannered at such a young age.

118
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,600
I'm afraid she'll be ruder
when she's older.

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Lower your voice.

120
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,270
I'm telling you.

121
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,440
We're going to my brother's home.

122
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,600
You'd better cheer up

123
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,760
and stop pulling a long face.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,040
Mind your step!

What are you doing?

127
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,830
Don't push.

128
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,480

134
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,270
Watch your step!

135
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,830
- Jinguo. Jinguo.
- Jinguo.

136
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,790
Be careful not to step on it.

Who's he?

140
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,390
They're making a fuss over a cricket.

141
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,390
Don't you know that?

142
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,480
He's well-known

143
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
as the Commandery Prince of Julu.

144
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Mind your step. Don't step on it.

145
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,390
Dad. Mom.

146
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,320
Catch up.

147
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,880
Dad.

148
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,420

You want to run away after killing it?

149
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,270
(The Commandery Prince of Julu)
You want to run away after killing it?

150
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,640
Who are you?

151
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,070
Let go of me.

152
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,550
I'm going to look for my parents.

153
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
After treading on Jinguo,

154
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
you still want to see your parents?

155
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,320
I'll take you to the local magistrate.

156
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,200
Insane.

157
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,200
Playboy.

158
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,760
Hanchen.

159
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,000
Alright. Go back.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,830
Stop looking on.

161
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,510
Go back.

162
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,480
You've got 13 letters from the capital.

163
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,550
Will you make a decision

164
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,640
only after receiving an imperial edict?

165
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,480
13 letters from the capital were sent
to get me back.

166
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,350
Those outsiders may think

167
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,440
my father is dead.

168
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,720
How... How...

169
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Your Highness,

170
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,070
how dare you say that?

171
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,230
Your mother said

172
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,920
you're neglecting your studies
in Wujiang.

173
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,440
Now that you got a C again last time,

174
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,790
she wants you to go back to the capital
and study in the Imperial College.

175
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,830
But that's just an excuse.

176
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,160
As we all know,

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
things are complicated in the capital.

178
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,700
(Receipt:Xie Yu sold his land to Xie Jing
at a price of 20 strings of 1000 cash.)

179
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,620
(Xie Yu, Xie Jing)

180
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,830
Hanchen!

181
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,880
As for hiring a maid servant
to clean the study,

182
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,110
you can just forget about it

183
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,040
if you decide to go back to the capital.

184
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,160
Who said I'd go back?

185
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,670
Hanchen,

186
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
why are you leaving?

187
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Have you found Jinguo?

188
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,160
(Oh no!)

189
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,830
(Jinguo was killed by me.)

190
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,830

192
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,640
Come on. Cheers!

193
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Cheers!

194
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,510
Here. Have some crab.

195
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,270
Okay.

196
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,980
(Xie Xiaoman's cousin Su Wei,)
Here.

197
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,760
(nickname Minggu)
Say thank you to your auntie.

198
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,510
Eat more.

199
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,040
Thank you, auntie.

200
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,060
(Su Wei's father Meng Hanru)
Xiaoman,

201
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,940
help yourself.

202
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,380
(Su Huazhong, Su Wei's mother,
owner of Su Chang Ji)

203
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,270
- Make yourself at home.
- Yu.

204
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,510
Have some crab.

205
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Well,

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,230
when will you

207
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,720
pay a visit to Mr. Xie Jing?

208
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,760
We're going tomorrow.

209
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,880
Minggu, would you mind

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,390
taking Xiaoman to the academy tomorrow?

211
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,520
And,

212
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
I really appreciate

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,150
what you've done

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,960
to transfer them to the school.

215
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,640
That's true.

216
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,150
Here.

217
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,840
Let me drink a toast to you.

218
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,910
Huazhong.

219
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,350
We won't drink unless you take a seat.

220
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,910
Take a seat.

221
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,150
- Okay.
- Don't be so polite.

222
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,760
We're family.

223
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,520
In the future,

224
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,960
Xiaoman will stay in our house.

225
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,000
Trust me.

226
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm sure to

227
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,590
make her fit and healthy.

228
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,150
Here. Okay.

229
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,910
Thank you.

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,030
Thank you, Huazhong.

231
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,400
Mom,

232
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,520
why do I have to stay here?

233
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,840
Can't I live with you?

234
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,030
Okay.

235
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,910
Come on. Eat!

236
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,230
Here.

237
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,670
A broke family.

(Confucian Classics and Moral Precepts
Are Worth Handing Down For Generations)

239
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,790
I know you don't want to live in
Wujiang Prefecture.

240
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,790
I also know

241
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,280
you don't want to stay in
my brother's home.

242
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,000
But think about it.

243
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,400
Your elder brother
is taking imperial exams in the capital.

244
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,910
Your dad is working
in Wujiang Prefecture.

245
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,350
You couldn't go back
and be a farmer, right?

246
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,110
Then why

247
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,590
do I have to stay here with them?

248
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,030
I want to live together
with you and dad.

249
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
The yamen hostel is far from the school,

250
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,670
with good and bad people mixed up.

251
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,760
You're such a young girl.

252
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,880
How could I let you live there?

253
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
What if I save up enough money?

254
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,350
Is it possible

255
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,400
I get the land back from uncle Xie?

256
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,230
What?

257
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,280
You still haven't given up the idea.

258
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,880
It's impossible for us
to go back to Yuyangli Village.

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,590
Oh no.

261
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,230
My receipt is gone.

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,230
Things are complicated in the capital.

263
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,790
It seems that your mother wants you
to go back for your studies,

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,520
but actually,

265
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,280
she wants you to marry Miss Shen.

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
Nobody clears up my study.

267
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,320
It's a mess, indeed.

268
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,520
Hanchen.

269
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,760
Don't worry.

270
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,230
So many years have passed.

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,620
(Receipt)
Maybe they are the only ones

272
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,320
(Receipt)
who still remember the engagement.

273
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,760
They're happy to do that,

274
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,550
but the Shen family may not be.

275
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Tomorrow is the mid-term exam.

276
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,910
What's your plan?

277
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Burn it.

278
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,960

and now is by the islet.)

in which are the sandal trees;)

281
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:17,280
(but beneath them
are only withered leaves.)

282
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,670

may be made into grind-stones.)

(The lord stands there refined,)

285
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,230
(like ivory polished,
like precious stone finished.)

286

(Bailu Academy)
(Lo, he's solemn and grave;)

287
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,790
(Bailu Academy)
Lo, he's open and brave.

288
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,550
(The lord stands there refined;
We will bear him in mind!)

289
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,710
I didn't expect
to have a relative like her

290
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,030
who has seen nothing of life.

291
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,790
Excuse me?

292
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,790
What's up?

293
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,150
Did I say anything wrong?

294
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,080
Your parents borrowed money
from us time and again

295
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,520
and now you live under our shelter.

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,710
If you hadn't

297
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,000
burnt my brother's palm that year,

298
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,880
my parents wouldn't have had to
quit their jobs for a year

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,840
to take care of him

300
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
and then wouldn't have needed to
borrow money from you.

301
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,790
I have no time for you.

302
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,710
Sis.

303
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
Come over.

304
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,400
Today is the mid-term exam.

305
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,150
What books are you reading, Ziyou?

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm reading "Mencius".

307
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,790
But my father would

308
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,590
check how my studies are going any time.

309
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,520
Today is the mid-term exam?

310
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,670
Sis,

311
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,880
do you have money with you?

312
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
Can we buy it or not?

313
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,320
Don't worry.

314
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,590
I've saved a lot of money

315
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,640
by weaving cat grass.

316
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,960
I can afford books for you.

317
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,200
Sir,

318
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280
I wonder

319
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,910
if you have standard textbooks
of Bailu Academy.

320
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,080
Yes.

321
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Here.

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,760
Have a look.

323
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,940
("The Commentary of Zuo")

324
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,710
How much does it cost?

325
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,030
I need two copies.

326
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Two strings of 1,000 cash in total.

327
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,790
So expensive!

328
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,550
My dad's monthly salary
is three strings.

329
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,960
Young lady.

330
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,470
Don't touch it.

331
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,400
You never heard of that, right?

332
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,590
Paper became expensive in Luoyang,

333
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,640
but it's more expensive
in Wujiang Prefecture.

334
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,840
Paper became expensive in Luoyang

335
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,670
because readers vied
to make handwritten copies of

336
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,030
"Ode to the Capitals
of the Three Kingdoms" by Zuo Si.

337
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,710
There is no shortage of paper here.

338
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,790
Why is it expensive?

339
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,470
Fine. Enough.

340
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,910
Go make money if you're broke.

341
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,710
(Recruitment)

342
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,080
All my books are printed with
woodblock printing technique.

343
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,280
No bargain please.

344
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,230
Zhao Xiaoqian is coming over.

345
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,030
Zhao Xiaoqian.

346
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,350
Let's go.

347
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,520
Sis.

348
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,710
We're going to be late.

349
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,760
Sis,

350
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,710
are you really going to work
as a maid servant?

351
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
Of course not.

352
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,470
I'm not stupid.

353
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
The Luming Pavilion for boys
is over there.

354
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,910
Hurry up.

355
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,880
I've figured it out.

356
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,230
Ziyan writes down the answers

357
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,350
and passes them to me.

358
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,440
Then I'll pass them to you.
What do you say?

359
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,030
I'm a man. How can I cheat in an exam?

360
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,760
It'll make me a laughingstock.

361
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,710
What can you do if you don't cheat?

362
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,470
You don't want to
set fire on the academy, do you?

363
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,590
I'm sleepy.

364
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,520
You don't need to wake me up.

365
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,980
(Jingnv Pavilion)

366
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,350
Sir.

367
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm Xie Xiaoman the newcomer.

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,550
Okay.

369
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,400
Take a seat.

370
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,280
It's time for the exam.

371
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,760
Hi, Ruying.

372
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,350
Xiaoman, you've really made it here.

373
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,710
Do you know her?

374
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,340
(Xie Ruying, Xie Jing's daughter,)
She's my uncle's daughter.

375
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,400
(Xie Xiaoman's cousin)
She was brought up in the countryside,

376
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,280
so she's ill-mannered.

377
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,470
Please don't mind.

378
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,300
(Xue Yanwan, daughter of sub-prefect
of Wujiang Prefecture)

379
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,000
Here.

380
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,910
Thank you.

381
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,710
The exam begins now.

382
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,280
Hey, look.

383
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,350
Xiaoman,

384
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,110
"southern-style noodle houses
and Sichuan-style restaurants

385
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,550
were opened in the capital

386
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,520
for those from the south

387
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,640
who didn't get used to
the northern-style food."

388
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,710
What does it mean?

389
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,280
I don't know.

390
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,230
No whisper!

391
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,590
What nonsense did you write on it?

392
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,590
"Don't pretend to know

393
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,710
(Xu Shaolin, director of Bailu Academy)
what you don't know."

394
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,550
What does it mean?

395
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,790
It means
if you don't understand something,

396
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,280
you should learn
instead of talking nonsense.

397
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
Since you know it,

398
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,840
why can't you follow it?

399
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,670
Stop being opportunistic

400
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,550
or playing dirty tricks.

401
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,150
I know you all study here

402
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,520
in order to marry a good man.

403
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,790
But why will a good man choose you

404
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,760
if you don't study hard?

405
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,200
Sir, you got me wrong.

406
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,440
Meet me in the Teachers' Office

407
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,200
when the exam is finished.

408
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,740
(Teachers' Office)

409
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,470
Are you done yet?

410
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,640
Xu Shaolin is coming back.

411
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,760
Alright. It's done.

412
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,110
Nobody sees us, right?

413
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,880
No.

414
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,280
Zhao Xiaoqian.

415
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,110
Are you a silly goose?

416
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,520
Xingzhou gave the answers to you,

417
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,440
but you just kept sleeping.

418
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,110
What's done is done.

419
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,200
The papers are burnt by you, anyway.

420
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,230
I didn't do anything.

421
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,350
What?

422
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,230
It's you that asked me to do that.

423
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,350
Enough. Let's get out of here.

424
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,590
The teachers will be back soon.

425
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,320
Well...

426
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,000
It's you!

427
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,110
Where is my receipt?

428
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,230
A reminder for you.

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,840
Keep your mouth shut!

430
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,520
You...

431
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,400
Remember.

432
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,160
Keep your mouth shut.

433
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,880
What's happened?

434
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,040
Sir.

435
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,920
How dare you burn the exam papers?

436
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,430
I didn't.

437
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,760
Just now...

438
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,040
You tried to cheat in the exam in vain,

439
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,040
so you burnt the papers.

440
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,400
Who else could have done it
if it weren't you?

441
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,470
I didn't. I'm telling the truth.

442
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,710
Congwen.

443
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,640
Xiaoman?

444
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,760
Answer me. Why did you burn the papers?

445
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,920
I didn't do it.

446
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,590
You!

447
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,310
As a newcomer,

448
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
she didn't even have her first class,

449
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,470
but she dared to burn the papers.

450
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,920
How dare she?

451
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,900
(Li Su, courtesy name Congwen)

452
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,040
That newcomer

453
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,470
is your cousin you mentioned?

454
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Just a broke girl from Yuyangli Village.

455
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,590
She doesn't deserve to be my cousin.

456
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
I was just trying not to embarrass her.

457
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,760
We've been living apart for long.

458
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,760
You know what?

459
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,350
At my grandmother's birthday party
last year,

460
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,760
she ate a whole plate of cherries

461
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,830
since she'd never seen it before.

462
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,680
Then she spent the whole afternoon
in the bathroom.

463
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
Did you hear that

464
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,430
a fire took place
in the Teachers' Office?

465
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,280
A fire?

466
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,230
It's said someone burnt the papers.

467
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,830
What?

468
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,280
To prepare for the exam,

469
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,830
I reviewed lessons
till midnight every day.

470
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,830
Same here.

471
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,520
She's back.

472
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,350
Xie Xiaoman,

473
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,000
don't embarrass yourself in the academy!

474
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,400
You burnt the papers

475
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,350
because you're afraid you'd fail.

476
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,280
You must be crazy.

477
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,230
I...

478
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,230
Director Xu.

479
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,430
Director Xu is here.

480
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,110
Due to the fire,

481
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,280
some of the papers are burnt, indeed.

482
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,000
But no gossip here.

483
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,760
The academy will
investigate it thoroughly.

484
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,350
If we find out who did it,

485
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,920
the troublemaker
will be punished severely!

486
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,920
It's not me.

487
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,000
Students here

488
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,280
are all decent people.

489
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,430
Such acts of sheer folly
have never happened before.

490
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,640
You've disgraced

491
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,680
the Xie family.

492
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,110
I said I didn't do that.

493
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,110
You did!

494
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,760
Who else could it be if it weren't you?

495
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,230
Your clothes are covered in ash

496
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,760
from coming out of the Teachers' Office.

497
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,760
You're Xiaoman, right?

498
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,800
Ruying mentioned

499
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
you're her cousin.

500
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,040
She has always been well-mannered.

501
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,200
She accused you because

502
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,280
there is solid proof against you,

503
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,000
otherwise,
she doesn't want to give you a hard time

504
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,470
now that you're one of her relatives.

505
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
I'll prove my innocence!

506
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,040
Xie Xiaoman!

507
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,900
(Jingnv Pavilion)

508
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,590
Xie Xiaoman.

509
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,230
Stop messing about, okay?

510
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,430
You're trying to frame me.

511
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,190
I'm not messing about.

512
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,760
Look at what you're like.

513
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,640
You said we're trying to frame you.

514
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,520
Nobody would buy it.

515
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,350
Then why did you come to me?

516
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
What do you want?

517
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,680
Actually,

518
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,350
I just want to tell you

519
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,160
not to create trouble.

520
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
I didn't.

521
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Trouble came looking for me.

522
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm from the countryside,

523
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,000
but I'm not a pushover.

524
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,950
Xie Xiaoman.

525
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,100
(Delicacy Restaurant)

526
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,430
I'm thirsty.

527
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,190
Your Highness,

528
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
there are still 100 grams
of Donghai Longshe tea

529
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,400
you bought last time.

530
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,520
How about I make a pot for you?

531
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,590
Hurry up.

532
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,280
Go ahead.

533
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,880
Sure!

534
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
It's great.

535
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,710
The papers have been burnt.

536
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,830
Your mother can't find
an excuse to scold you.

537
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,710
I heard all exam papers
in the Teachers' Office

538
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,710
are burnt away.

539
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,310
Director Xu is investigating.

540
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,880
You're ill-informed.

541
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,950
What's burnt are mainly

542
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,640
papers of female students.

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,560
Most of male students' ones

544
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,880
have been kept intact.

545
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,880
Wait.

546
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,000
What are you talking about?

547
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,520
It's just hearsay.

548
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,310
Everyone said

549
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,160
a female student

550
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,230
set the office on fire

551
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,830
but she also put it out.

552
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,230
So some of the papers are not destroyed.

553
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,760
Let's go.

554
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,710
It's her again.

555
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,580
(Striving to learn and grow)

556
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Young lady,

557
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,950
you can't go upstairs.

558
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,280
Why are you stopping me?

559
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,040
Young lady,

560
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,230
the second floor
is for those from noble families.

561
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,400
I know every nobleman in Bailu Academy.

562
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,110
May I know who you are?

563
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,760
It's said academies provide education

564
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,040
for all people without discrimination.

565
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,920
The teachers follow the rule,

566
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,830
but staffs act against it.

567
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,350
Let her come up.

568
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:11,920
Got it.

569
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,040
Please go up.

570
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,700
(Bright and clean)

571
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,230
You put the fire out?

572
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,680
You set it on fire?

573
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Can you tell me

574
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,070
what your name is?

575
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

576
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,560
I'll tell Director Xu about it.

577
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,110
I'll also tell him

578
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,190
you set the office on fire.

579
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,280
And,

580
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,590
you're the one
who took my receipt, right?

581
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,000
It's very important to me.

582
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,310
I've burnt it away.

583
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,590
What?

584
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,520
You burnt it?

585
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,680
You actually did that?

586
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,190
Yes.

587
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,430
I threw it into the fire.

588
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,680
So what?

589
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,190
You know what,
that's very important to me.

590
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,190
Aren't you afraid of me?

591
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,190
Why should I?

592
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,040
Good. Great.

593
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,190
Then,

594
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,310
wait and see.

595
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,230
You...

596
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,430
Don't go.

597
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,310
Don't go!

598
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,800
How dare he burnt it.

599
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,800
It pissed me off.

600
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,760
Oh, my receipt!

601
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,140
(Bailu Academy)

602
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,800
Excuse me.

603
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,680
Did you see the carriage
sent by the Su family?

604
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,280
The Su family?

605
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,710
They were the first one to leave.

606
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,950
Oh no.

607
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,540
(Mrs. Xie, Xie Jing's mother)

608
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,540
(Xie Jing's wife, surnamed Sheng)

609
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,660
(Xie Jing, Xie Xiaoman's uncle,
Wuxian County Magistrate)

610
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
Jing, I'm really sorry.

611
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,920
It's Xiaoman's first time
to be in Wujiang Prefecture.

612
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,520
And the academy is a little far away

613
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,190
from your home.

614
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,830
She may be lost.

615
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,830
I'm so sorry

616
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,830
for having kept all of you

617
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,000
waiting for so long.

618
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,000
In this case,

619
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,640
now that I'm tired...

620
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,230
Be careful.

621
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,110
I'm leaving.

622
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,350
She's back.

623
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,470
You damn girl.

624
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,280
Where have you been?

625
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,400
You didn't study hard at school

626
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,350
and you wandered off after school.

627
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,430
Kneel down and say sorry
to your grandmother.

628
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,110
Xiaoman,

629
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,950
did you hear what your mom said?

630
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,680
Despite her age,

631
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,560
your grandmother
is still waiting for you.

632
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,110
Everyone is waiting for you!

633
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,950
Kneel down!

634
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,800
Mom,

635
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,680
Xiaoman will

636
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,800
kneel down and apologize to you.

637
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,350
Yeah.

638
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,190
How could we be a family?

639
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,430
A family

640
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,710
wouldn't add insult to injury

641
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,640
and make us suffer so much.

642
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,560
Since grandfather passed away,

643
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,190
uncle Xie has been treating us harshly

644
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,470
and taken away all property

645
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,070
grandfather had left us.

646
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,430
To make a living,

647
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,160
dad has to work as a coroner
in Wujiang Prefecture

648
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,760
and he's been treated unfairly.

649
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,590
To take care of my brother and me,

650
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,110
mom has to wash
and mend clothes for others

651
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,400
to make ends meet

652
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,350
even if she's ill.

653
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,040
If it weren't for my elder brother
who may pass the imperial exams,

654
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,310
uncle Xie wouldn't
keep in contact with us.

655
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,310
Xiaoman, what are you talking about?

656
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,680
We're a family.

657
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,230
Did I ever treat you harshly?

658
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,830
No, he didn't.

659
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,350
At the cost of 20 strings of 1,000 cash,

660
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,470
you bought our two hectares of land,
which is all we had.

661
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,520
Isn't that obvious?

662
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,920
You made us homeless.

663
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,680
Did I also treat you harshly?

664
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,950
How?

665
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,640
Fine.

666
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,310
Xiaoman,

667
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,560
just take me to the local magistrate.

668
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,280
By going to the local magistrate,

669
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,400
can we

670
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280
get our land back?

671
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,310
You want to get the land back?

672
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,110
It has been given
to the Commandery Prince of Julu.

673
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,470
If you want it,

674
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,110
go to the Commandery Prince's Mansion
yourself.

675
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,190
I'm so useless.

676
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,190
Even a young girl like you

677
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,920
dares to ask me for payment.

678
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,070
Mom, calm down.

679
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,430
Xie Yu,

680
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,430
I don't think I deserve
to be your mother.

681
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,040
How dare you offend your grandmother?

682
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,280
Kneel down!

683
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,880
On your knees.

684
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,800
Kneel and apologize!

685
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,640
I'm sorry, grandmother.

686
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,590
Please forgive me, grandmother.

687
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,950
I shouldn't have done that.

688
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,830
How dare I be mad at you?

689
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,400
My receipt.

690
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,710
You actually did that?

691
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,760
Yes.

692
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,430
I threw it into the fire.

693
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,190
My receipt.

694
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,700
(Bailu Academy)

695
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,340
(Teachers' Office)

696
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,070
Keep quiet.

697
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,190
You pushed me so hard!

698
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,230
You saw it anyway.

699
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,830
But if you dare tell anyone else,

700
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,350
I'll...

701
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,040
Go.

702
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,950
Drive the mouse away.

703
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,230
Hurry.

704
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,350
Why are you looking at me?

705
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,110
I'm not afraid of mouses.

706
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,950
I just think it's dirty.

707
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,350
It's dirty. Understood?

708
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,880
All doors have been closed, right?

709
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,350
Yes.

710
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,000
Come on.

711
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,590
What's wrong?

712
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,070
You throw your weight about!

713
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,800
I...

714
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,190
I didn't. I didn't bully you.

715
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,110
I didn't.

716
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,950
Did you burn the receipt away

717
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,040
or not?

718
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,400
I don't know.

719
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,400
You...

720
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,190
I'm telling you.

721
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,230
If you dare tell anyone

722
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,230
I stole the papers,

723
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,350
you...

724
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,760
You'll have to quit school.

725
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,310
You jerk!

726
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,950
Xiaoman?

727
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,760
What are you doing here?

728
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,760
Everyone thought I set fire.

729
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,230
I want to find some evidence.

730
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,590
Public clamor
can confound right and wrong.

731
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,190
It's correct for you to do that.

732
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,310
If you make a mistake, admit it.

733
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,280
If not,

734
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,800
find a way to prove your innocence.

(Noodles Stall)

736
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,470
Thank you, Congwen.

737
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,830
Our land was sold.

738
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,400
I planned to get it back

739
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,920
after making enough money,

740
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,470
so I'd been keeping the receipt.

741
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,880
Now that it's burnt,

742
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,590
I don't know what to do.

743
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,590
(Noodles Stall)
I remember you used to be

744
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,070
the most diligent girl
in Yuyangli Village.

745
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,280
You're smart.

746
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,590
There is always a way
if you decide to do something.

747
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,040
What matters is how you want it done.

748
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,280
Do you mean

749
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,350
I can earn some money
by working part-time?

750
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
Do you still remember

751
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,310
the two lines of poetry I told you

752
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,950
the first time
I went to Yuyangli Village?

753
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,070
Someday,
with my sail piercing the clouds,

754
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,040
I will mount the wind, break the waves,
and traverse the vast, rolling sea.

755
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,430
Dad.

756
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,760
Xiaoman.

757
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,350
Dad.

758
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,880
(Residence of the Su Family)

759
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,590
Sit down.

760
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,830
You have a relapse, right?

761
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,350
Let me massage it.

762
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,760
I slapped you so hard. It must hurt.

763
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,350
As for what happened today,

764
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,710
it's all my fault.

765
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,280
No, it's not.

766
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,880
I know

767
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,400
you hate to leave Yuyangli Village.

768
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,680
And you

769
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
have kept the receipt well.

770
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,710
You want to

771
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,400
get the land back someday,

772
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,640
right?

773
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I also know

774
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,280
you hate to see me

775
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,110
be wronged

776
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,710
and want to make me happy.

777
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,230
In my childhood,

778
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,560
after grandfather passed away,

779
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,920
I saw you be maltreated by grandmother.

780
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,680
Among so much family property,

781
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,280
only a few hectares of land
were given to us.

782
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,800
But we managed

783
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,160
to live on our land.

784
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,280
When I was little,

785
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,280
the five of us

786
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,040
lived a simple but happy life.

787
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,760
Li'er and I caught frogs in the field.

788
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,710
My elder brother read books
by the window.

789
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,920
I remember one time

790
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,830
Li'er got sick,

791
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,680
so we borrowed some money that year.

792
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,280
If we hadn't grown tea,

793
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,390
we must have

794
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,230
had a hard time.

795
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,800
In my opinion,

796
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,910
the land is my savior.

797
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,910
I didn't expect you to be so grateful.

798
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,040
Mom said I must be a farmer
in my previous life.

799
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,230
What?

800
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
A farmer?

801
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,760
We're not rich,

802
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,230
but Xiaoman,

803
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,520
you're always

804
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,670
my beloved daughter,

805
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,910
the apple of my eye.

806
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,390
Dad.

807
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,870
I'm sorry for what happened today.

808
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,520
I promise you.

809
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,080
In the future,

810
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,870
I'll never do that to you again.

811
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,190
But you have to promise me too.

812
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,120
No matter what happens,

813
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,280
think carefully before you act.

814
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,760
It's thundering.

815
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,040
It's going to rain.

816
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,910
Hurry. Get in.

817
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,120
Don't forget your book box.

818
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Dad.

819
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,840
I...

820
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,080
I'll get an umbrella for you.

821
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,080
Don't bother.

822
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,520
Give me a sec.

823
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,230
No need. Get in.

824
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,910
Don't bother.

825
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,800
Go in.

826
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,150
Dad.

827
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,150
I'm leaving.

828
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,710
Dad, wait a moment.

829
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,520
I'm leaving.

830
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,120
Dad.

831
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,560
Bye!

832
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,600
Dad.

833
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,900
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion
is hiring.)

834
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,390
Someday,
with my sail piercing the clouds,

835
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,040
I will mount the wind, break the waves,
and traverse the vast, rolling sea.

836
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm sure to get you back!

837
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,780
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

838
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,520
You're...

839
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,320
Are you hiring a maid servant

840
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,910
to clean the study?

841
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,710
The wage is 50 cash per day, right?

842
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,230
I can read.

843
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm sure I'll do a good job.

844
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,760
I can start from tomorrow.

845
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,190
Here is the tea.

846
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,390
Here.

847
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,670
Hurry.

848
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,910
I'm thirsty.

849
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,630
Your Highness,

850
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,910
have some tea

851
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,910
to refresh yourself.

852
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,600
Hanchen,

853
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,560
this morning,

854
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,430
we got a letter
from Principal Yang's servant.

855
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,870
I'm afraid your mother

856
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,670
wrote a letter to Principal Yang.

857
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,000
I wonder why

858
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,390
your mother insists on
your studying in the capital.

859
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,950
The location doesn't matter at all.

860
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,190
What's the big deal of
studying in the imperial college?

861
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,080
Hanchen was engaged to Miss Shen Zhaowen

862
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,040
when they were very little.

863
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,430
Now they've grown up.

864
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,000
It seems that

865
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,190
his mother is urging him to study hard,

866
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,120
but actually,

867
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
she wants him to go back
and marry that girl.

868
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,870
Miss Shen?

869
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,390
The daughter of

870
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,520
General Shen Zunfu?

871
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,800
So what if it's the Shen family?

872
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,520
We were engaged long time ago.

873
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
Nobody would care about it.

874
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,800
My parents must be the only ones
who still remember it.

875
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,870
But you can't treat it lightly.

876
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,470
Your mother
has contacted Principal Yang.

877
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,360
If she knows about

878
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,910
you burning the papers away,

879
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm afraid you'll have to go back.

880
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,230
Here are the noodles.

881
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,190
Come on.

882
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
Here.

883
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,120
Hurry.

884
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,840
Oh, by the way,

885
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,360
the other day,

886
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,150
I went to the Teachers' Office at night

887
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,670
and met that girl again.

888
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,080
Help me find out

889
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,080
why she went there
in the middle of the night.

890
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,840
Okay.

891
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,910
Oh. I remember.

892
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,080
It's the girl

893
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,670
who didn't show respect
to you last time, right?

894
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,080
She's way too bold.

895
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,190
What's her background?

896
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,950
She's just a naive girl.

897
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,950
Nothing special about her background.

898
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,360
Your Highness,

899
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,040
I have something to report to you.

900
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,520
We've got a new maid servant

901
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,470
to clean up your study.

902
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,950
She's clever.

903
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,190
Today is her first day.

904
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,360
You can read in the study from now on.

905
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,390
Anything else?

906
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,190
The tassel attaching
on your big brother's sword

907
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,520
has loosened.

908
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,470
The weaver in our mansion

909
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,950
has gone home to visit her family.

910
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,600
So, shall we have it repaired

911
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,190
by someone else tomorrow?

912
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,470
It's okay.

913
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,430
Put it on the desk.

914
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,080
I'll take it with me

915
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,120
and have it repaired.

916
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,190
I'm full.

917
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,080
What's going on?

918
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,150
Are you already full?

919
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,520
What's the story of the sword tassel?

920
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,670
It belongs to Hanchen's big brother.

921
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,670
His big brother?

922
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,560
Zhao Xiaojie, Duke of Yongguo?

923
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,520
Isn't he dead?

924
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,150
Mr. Yan!

925
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,870
Please never say that again.

926
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,390
Anyone who says that in our mansion

927
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,430
will be given a beating.

928
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,500
(Studio of Artlessness)

929
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,380
(Keep calm And Stay Focused)

930
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,630
Therefore soldiers must be treated
in the first instance with humanity,

931
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,520
but kept under control
by means of iron discipline.

932
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,630
This is a certain road to victory.

933
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,840
How is everything going, Xiaoman?

934
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,670
Mr. Liangji.

935
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,040
There are many books here.

936
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,870
Commandery Prince
doesn't often come here,

937
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,360
so it's been a mess before we know it.

938
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,040
It's nothing.

939
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,190
But there are way too many books here.

940
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,120
I haven't even heard of some of them.

941
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,120
I plan to sort them out

942
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,320
by category.

943
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,670
The four forms of poetry
are put on this side.

944
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,000
Confucian classics are put on that side.

945
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,390
I found there are also
many books on the art of war.

946
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,670
What's written here on the paper
is also about that.

947
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,670
So I plan to

948
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,800
put those books here on both sides.

949
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,800
Xiaoman, you're really clever.

950
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
You're the best person for the job.

951
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,840
What is it?

952
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,150
It's a sword tassel.

953
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,080
It's the treasure
of the Commandery Prince.

954
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,430
Nobody is allowed
to touch it without permission.

955
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,600
However, after so many years,

956
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,390
it is falling apart.

957
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,190
Can you repair it?

958
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,190
No, I can't.

959
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,190
If you can do it,

960
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,760
instead of 50 cash,

961
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,670
I'll be willing to pay 500.

962
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,560
500 cash?

963
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,040
Half a string?

964
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
The pattern...

965
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,600
Xiaoman,

966
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,710
don't touch it.

967
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,390
Mr. Liangji,

968
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,870
I heard...

969
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,950
I heard that

970
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,080
Magistrate Xie gave two hectares of land

971
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,000
to the Commandery Prince.

972
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,120
Is that true?

973
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,760
Yes. It happened the other day.

974
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,520
How do you know that?

975
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,560
The land used to be ours.

976
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,630
I've figured it out.

977
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
My wage is 50 cash a day.

978
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,080
So I can earn a string in 20 days.

979
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,470
The two hectares of land
is worth 100 strings.

980
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,080
If I work in your mansion
for 2,000 days,

981
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
is it possible

982
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,870
I can get the land back?

983
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,870
No wonder you want to work here.

984
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,870
We are all unlucky folks,

985
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
or we couldn't have left our hometown.

986
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,080
Don't worry.

987
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,710
That small piece of land is nothing

988
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,320
for the Commandery Prince.

989
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,230
How about this?

990
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,840
As long as I can balance the accounts,

991
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,120
I'll keep the two hectares of land

992
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,280
for you.

993
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
Thank you, Mr. Liangji.

994
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,120
It's nothing.

995
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,040
Oh no.

996
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,360
Mr. Liangji, I gotta go.

997
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,000
I'll finish the rest next time.

998
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,360
