Don't miss the chance.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,000
May I ask

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,910
what kind of dessert you like?

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,160
He is rather undemanding
in this aspect.

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,800
This is what you eat?

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,550
He likes

29
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,910
all delicious foods.

30
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,670
Yeah.

31
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,320
I like delicious foods too.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,910
Why is Hanchen blushing?

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
Bossy.

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,600
It's alright. It's alright.

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,550
He is always like that.

Let's not make desserts
for Zhao Xiaoqian.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,390
Let's make it for Zhong Ziyan.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,830
His name is Zhong Ziyan?

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,630
He is the Commandery Prince's
learning partner

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,030
and he is from a humble family.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,520
I heard his father had won
1st place in the imperial exam.

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Unfortunately, his father died early,

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
leaving him and his mother behind.

45
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,080
So he had to serve the Commandery
Prince as a learning partner.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,520
Is it that interesting

47
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,160

I never knew about this benefit
of attending the Academy.

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,080
I told you

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,320
I am not a village rascal

54
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,800
and my father is not a butcher.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,470
My father is a government official.

56
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,320
You bragger.

57
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,550
Like hell he is.

58
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,800
If you were an official's son,

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,880
you wouldn't be eating scraps here.

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,470
Your father has lost his fortune.

61
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,080
You!

62
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,830
You've even learned how to fight?

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,960
Good for you.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
I won't bother with you today.

65
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,160
But wait for me

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,470

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,550
Forget him. He looks so dirty.

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,110
He can't pay for your damaged shoes.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,390
Let's go.

70
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,030
Be careful not
to catch any weird disease.

71
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,550
Very well.

72
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,910
I won't bother with a village rascal.

73
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,520
We'll deal with him tomorrow.

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,670
Come on.

76
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,270
My father is really an official.

77

You don't believe me?

78
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,030
I'll show you my father's official token

What kind of dessert do you like?

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
When I was in Yuyangli,

94
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,640
your family looked after me.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,830
What I did was nothing

96
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,640
compared to your family's help.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,440
No, no, no.

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,350
You have returned the favor,

99
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,480
but I should still thank you.

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,480
I remember the Chestnut Cakes
your mother made

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,110
for students.

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
I like those cakes.

103

What's the matter?

108
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,200
Sis.

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
Will you send me home after school?

110
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,350
Do you remember our mother's

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,160
recipe for the Chestnut Cake?

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
It's not the time
to talk about Chestnut Cakes.

113
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,550
Remember to send me home after school.

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,070
I'll be waiting for you
at the Academy's gate.

You must be there for me.

118
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,270
Does a Chestnut Cake

119
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,270
contain sesame or not?

120

124
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,600
Pass it that way.

126
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,320
Catch it.

128
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,320
go up there.

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,270
Ask the Commandery Prince
what his favorite flavor is.

130
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,670
Ask him yourself.

131
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,390
You!

132
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
You are annoying.

133
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,320
What's in it for you?

134
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,600
You don't treat her
as your paternal cousin,

135
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,070
but I treat her as my maternal cousin.

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,880
Of course it is related to me.

137
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,760
Miss Xie.

138
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,510
Minggu.

139
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,270
How could you say that to Ruying?

140
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,880
Can you stop being pretentious?

141
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,640
Even my father

142
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,200
has heard your gossip.

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,000
Sub-prefect Xue's family
is really powerful.

144
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,950
The young ladies' bickering

145
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,760
could lead to my family's
silk document being withheld.

146
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,160
You!

147
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:39,950
I'll go.

148
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,510
You told me to stay out of trouble.

149
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,200
You should watch your mouth too.

150
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,270
Uncle has been working
on that for a long time.

151
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,320
I can go and ask. It'll be alright.

152
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,440
Don't go.

153
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,670
Xiaoman!

154
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,670
Pass it on. Pass it on.

155
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,790
That kick was savage.

156
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,320
Take her to a doctor.

157
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,480
Will she offer herself to him

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,480
to thank him for saving her life?

159
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,510
Come off it.

160
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,440
Here you go.

161
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,950
Thank you.

162
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,350
Goodbye.

163
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,270
You shrew!

164
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,720
You seek revenge
for the smallest grievance.

165
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,670
You just won't stop, right?

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,670
You kicked that ball, didn't you?

167
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,950
It's your fault
that you are weak as a chick.

168
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,480
And your skin is dark as Guan Yu.

169
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,200
How dare you!

170
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,440
I dare not.

171
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,160
You!

172
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,480
It wasn't me at the Spring Banquet.

173
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,160
You're after the wrong person.

174
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,440
But you tore my title deed.

175
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,640
So what if I did?

176
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,320
It was just a receipt.

177
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,320
Your family's land is mine anyway.

178
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,550
If you make me happy,

179
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,910
I will give it to you.

180
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,150
Tell me

181
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,840
what kind of dessert you like,

182
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,470
then I won't hold a grudge against you.

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
Why should I tell you?

184
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
Suit yourself.

185
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,760
You're such a sharp-tongued woman.

186
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,200
Do all bumpkins talk like this?

187
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,640
You!

188
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,670
Just bake whatever you want.

189
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,910
I'm not picky.

190
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,710
I'll eat anything.

191
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,000
Rest well.

192
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,910
Jerk.

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Xie Xiaoman.

194
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,960
What's Zhao Xiaoqian's favorite food?

195
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
I don't know.

196
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,320
He didn't tell.

197
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,520
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

198
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,400
- I...
- Moreover,

199
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,440
don't make me help you

200
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,670
marry up.

201
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,080
Don't assume I am unaware

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
of what you did.

203
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,790
You!

204
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,320
You're here.

205
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,150
Are you going to make Chestnut Cakes?

206
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,960
What about you?

207
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,030
It's a secret.

208
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,320
Good.

209
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,150
Here.

210
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,960
Hanchen is here.

211
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,080
How is she?

212
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,150
Is my skin dark?

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
Why would you care about
your skin tone as a man?

214
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,550
What are you up to?

215
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,840
Planning to serve
the ball with your beauty?

216
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,520
Piss off.

217
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,670
Give me the ball.

218
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,110
Who is ready for a game?

219
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,790
Every man at Bailu Academy!

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Let's play!

221
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,110
Do you think

222
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,350
Hanchen looks a bit weird today?

223
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,230
His tanned complexion

224
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
is tinged with red.

225
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,960
Chief.

226
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Are you going to drug him?

227
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,670
There is no "drug" involved.

228
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,710
This is croton nut powder.

229
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,590
I've asked around about Zhao Xiaoqian.

230
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
He eats customized food

231
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,280
in Bailu Academy.

232
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,550
He even brought a cook
from the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

233
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,590
Then we won't have a chance to drug him.

234
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,840
I heard Xie Xiaoman

235
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
works at his home as a maid.

236
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,670
Go ask around, you two.

237
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,080
You made two helpings.

238
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
What are these snacks?

239
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,710
These Ox Tongue Cakes

240
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,590
are auspicious snacks
for the Cold Food Festival.

241
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,470
These are the Chestnut Cakes

242
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,200
I made for my family and seniors.

243
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,840
You're marvelous.

244
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,840
Let's go.

245
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
School is over?

246
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,710
It's over half an hour ago.

247
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,550
You should go home too.

248
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,320
- We'll be going.
- Yeah.

249
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,080
See you.

250
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,580
(Bailu Academy)

251
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,230
Doesn't your family
live in the countryside?

252
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,280
Go now.

253
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,910
Otherwise, you won't be home

254
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,280
until the early morning.

255
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,320
Your father is a pig killer.

256
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,550
He is waiting for you
to go home and eat pork.

257
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,790
Yeah. Go home.

258
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,910
I-I told you

259
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,080
I am not a village rascal.

260
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
Can't you understand?

261
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,710
I don't believe you.

262
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,140
(Civil Official)

263
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,080
See?

264
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,960
This is my father's official token.

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,110
M-my father has an official position.

266
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,110
He is not a butcher.

267
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,350
Scram!

268
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,110
Let's get out of here!

269
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,550
Little boy,

270
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
what are you doing here?

271
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,440
I...

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,520
I'm waiting for my elder sister Xiaoman.

273
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,710
Little boy,

274
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,840
you are Xie Xiaoman's younger brother.

275
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,520
Give it back.

276
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
What are you doing?

277
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,580
(Civil Official)

278
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,200
He is being naugthy.

279
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,760
He took our father's thing out

280
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
for fun.

281
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,350
If he offended you, please forgive him.

282
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,960
I apologize on his behalf.

283
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,400
You are Xie Xiaoman?

284
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,030
Yes.

285
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,200
What's wrong with that?

286
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,520
Are you going to participate
in the Cold Food Festival?

287
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,440
What do you mean?

288
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,710
Let me offer you an opportunity.

289
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,760
There will be
a cuju competition tomorrow.

290
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,790
Put this

291
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,670
in Zhao Xiaoqian's food.

292
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,350
Then make him eat the food.

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,760
What is this?

294
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,110
Croton nut powder.

295
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,280
Don't worry. It won't kill him.

296
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,110
He'll get the runs
for half a day at worst.

297
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,080
Let's go.

298
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,880
Give it back.

299
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,790
Give it back.

300
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,840
Give it back.

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,670
Lady,

302
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,400
you'd better do as I said.

303
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,400
If I don't see him

304
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,790
eat the drugged food,

305
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,030
you'll have to find

306
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,150
the official token in Lake Taihu.

307
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,590
What's more,

308
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,550
your father will have to jump

309
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,880
into Lake Taihu with you

310
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
if he finds out
he's lost the official token.

311
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,400
- You!
- Come on.

312
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,200
Don't move.

313
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Sis.

314
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,470
Why did you

315
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,280
take our father's token?

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,880
Are you out of your mind?

317
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you know how much trouble he is in

318
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,640
now that he's lost the official token?

319
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,880
Our father is in big trouble.

320
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,790
Do you know?

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,550
I told you to pick me up after school.

322
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,550
Where were you?

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,030
I forgot, alright?

324
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,230
Why didn't you go home after school?

325
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,520
We don't live in the same place.

326
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,910
You should be content

327
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,880
with living with our parents.

328
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,710
You make trouble all the time.

329
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,670
You live on the Su family's property.

330
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,280
Mother is worried you
may be looked down upon.

331
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,350
She gives you a monthly allowance

332
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,400
five times higher than mine.

333
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,110
You can afford the food
from Delicacy Restaurant.

334
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,470
You can afford new clothes.

335
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,350
However,

336
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,320
I can only bring the steamed cakes
made by our mother to the Academy.

337
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,910
My schoolmates call me a village rascal.

338
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,590
Li'er.

339
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,470
Don't touch me.

340
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,710
Alright. Don't be mad.

341
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,640
I'll try to fix

342
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,000
the official token problem.

343
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,400
Let's go home now.

344
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,670
Don't tell anyone about this.

345
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,840
Let's go home.

346
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,220
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Xiaoman.

348
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,440
Mr. Liangji.

349
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,520
It's supper time.

350
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,710
The Commandery Prince said

351
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,550
you've been doing a good job these days.

352
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,760
He sent me here to look after you.

353
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,840
What's the matter?

354
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,590
Mr. Liangji.

355
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,080
You're a man of the world.

356
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,110
If a government official
loses his official token,

357
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,670
how will he

358
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,440
be punished?

359
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,590
It depends.

360
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,110
The official token is evidence
of his official position.

361
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,760
If those with ulterior motives

362
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,280
obtain the official token

363
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,400
and use it to do evil,

364
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,230
the government official
will lose his job at best

365
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,910
or end up in prison at worst.

366
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,880
Mr. Liangji.

367
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,380
(Maid at the Commandery Prince's
Mansion, Hongsu)

368
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,520
The Commandery Prince said

369
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,790
Xiaoman will have supper

370
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,030
in Dayang Room tonight.

371
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,080
Come on.

372
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,910
Let's have a drink.

373
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,150
Here.

374
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,230
Refill the wine cups.

375
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,710
How is it going with your desserts?

376
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,200
I've finished making the desserts.

377
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,910
Eat.

378
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,230
You look skinny from top to bottom.

379
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
How unattractive.

380
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,350
Didn't your family give you proper food?

381
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,670
No.

382
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,960
We bumpkins only eat plant roots.

383
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,790
Then eat more.

384
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,520
I don't want people
to think I mistreat my servants.

385
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,550
Look how scrawny you are.

386
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,670
Even human traffickers
wouldn't want you.

387
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,440
Here.

388
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,590
Eat more vegetables.

389
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,350
Have some tofu.

390
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,550
Eat up. Eat up.

391
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,160
What are you guys looking at?

392
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,760
Have you never eaten duck legs before?

393
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,560
Here.

394
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,800
Eat this duck head.

395
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,830
You, take whatever you want.

396
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,760
Someone eats the duck leg

397
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,310
while I eat the duck head.

398
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,660
(Energetic and spirited)

399
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,400
Nice. Nice.

400
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,580
(Score every goal in the manner
of a shooting star)

401
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,920
Fierce tigers on the mountain.
Flood dragons in the water.

402
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,190
Tigers and dragons lie
in Wujiang Prefecture School.

403
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,800
Come on.

404
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,760
We mustn't lose.

405
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,950
Finely dressed students at Bailu Academy
ride well-groomed horses.

406
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,920
They stand at the top
of the world and aim high.

407
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,110
Fierce tigers on the mountain.
Flood dragons in the water.

408
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,190
Tigers and dragons lie
in Wujiang Prefecture School.

409
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,190
Finely dressed students at Bailu Academy
ride well-groomed horses.

410
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,350
They stand at the top
of the world and aim high.

411
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,680
Zhong Ziyan!

412
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,560
Zhong Ziyan!

413
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,230
Bailu Academy for the win!

414
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,520
All hail Bailu Academy!

415
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,830
Bailu Academy for the win!

416
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,000
This cuju competition has ten rounds.

417
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,040
Ten rounds later,
the team that scores more goals

418
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,950
wins.

419
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,220
(Score every goal
in the manner of a shooting star)

420
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,020
(Winds sweep over the pitch
where the players compete exuberantly)

421
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,110
Zhong Ziyan!

422
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,110
Hurry up.

423
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,760
Zhong Ziyan!

424
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,350
I made

425
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,190
these peach blossom shortbread rolls.

426
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,680
It took me a long time.

427
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,400
Do you want to try a roll?

428
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,350
Boyang.

429
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,710
These aren't for you.

430
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,280
I wouldn't have the strength to play
if my stomach were empty.

431
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,470
I'm sorry.

432
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,760
(Don't eat my food. Don't eat my food.)

433
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,280
You made this?

434
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I made it with little effort.

435
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,430
With little effort?

436
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,950
You didn't put in much effort indeed.

437
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,760
This looks ugly.

438
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
You'll eat this?

439
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,110
Sure.

440
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,280
As a gesture of apology.

441
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,830
You!

442
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,520
Eat this!

443
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,280
This is delicious.

444
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,760
Here.

445
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,160
Why did you make two helpings?

446
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,760
This tastes better than that.

447
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,680
- Just eat it.
- Hey...

448
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,710
Stop talking.

449
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,280
It really is delicious.

450
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,350
Come on. The game is on.

451
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
All hail Bailu Academy!

452
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,300
Bailu Academy for the win!

453
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,020
All hail Bailu Academy!

454
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,340
Bailu Academy for the win!

455
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,860
(Take the lead)

456
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,950
The competition starts now.

457
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,160
Move aside.

458
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,760
Catch the ball!

459
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,190
Good one!

460
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,520
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

461
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
(Energetic and spirited)

462
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,640
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

463
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,190
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

464
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,680
Bailu Academy scored one goal.

465
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,190
The ball has hit the ground.
Round One is over.

466
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,400
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

467
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,430
Bailu Academy!

468
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,280
Yay!

469
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,160
- Good one!
- Good one!

470
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,710
- Well done!
- Well done!

471
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,280
Here.

472
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,590
Bailu Academy scored one more goal.

473
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,040
The ball has hit the ground.
Round Three is over.

474
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,190
Wonderful!

475
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,000
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,680
Wujiang Prefecture School!

477
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

478
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
- Bailu Academy!
- Wujiang Prefecture School!

479
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,710
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

480
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,310
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

481
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,710
- Bailu Academy!
- Wujiang Prefecture School!

482
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,800
- This way.
- This way.

483
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:10,800
Boyang!

484
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,430
Catch the ball!

485
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,190
Yes!

486
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,310
Good job!

487
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,310
Bailu Academy! Bailu Academy!

488
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,230
Round Five is over.

489
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,430
Break time!

490
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,040
Bailu Academy!

491
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,900
Don't get cocky. We'll catch up soon.

492
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,520
You were doing well in the capital.

493
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,350
I don't know why you

494
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,040
came to Wujiang Prefecture.

495
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,190
Well,

496
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,590
does losing feel good?

497
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,680
Damn you, Zhao Xiaoqian.

498
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,920
You're so impolite to me,

499
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,000
yet you want to marry my younger sister.

500
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,230
I can live without marrying her.

501
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,560
Idiot.

502
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,070
Crap.

503
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,110
Give me the token.

504
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,160
I saw what happened.

505
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,950
You didn't make Zhao Xiaoqian

506
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,640
eat the drugged food.

507
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,190
You want the token?

508
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,560
Find it in Lake Taihu.

509
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,710
I accidentally
toppled the dessert earlier.

510
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,470
That's why His Highness
didn't eat croton nut powder.

511
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,040
But what's done is done.

512
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,950
I've done everything you told me to do.

513
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,640
Accidentally?

514
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,880
You think I'm blind?

515
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,950
What else do you want from me?

516
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,230
The token is really important
to my father.

517
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,710
Fine.

518
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,760
Young lady.

519
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,470
Give me a kiss.

520
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,920
What are you talking about?

521
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,160
N-n-nothing.

522
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,310
Where is the token?

523
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,190
Did Shen Yan arrange all this?

524
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,430
Your Highness,

525
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,880
I'm just an errand boy.

526
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,800
Please spare me.

527
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,040
Get lost.

528
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,760
Wujiang Prefecture School.

529
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,190
Croton nut powder.

530
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,830
You wanted me to lose?

531
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,230
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,400
This is your noble way of living?

533
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,400
Zhao Xiaoqian.

534
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,680
Hanchen.

535
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,070
Don't touch me.

536
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,920
In the second half of the competition,

537
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,400
both teams will switch fields.

538
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,710
Get ready, everyone.

539
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,400
What's the matter?

540
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,950
Nothing.

541
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,760
Really?

542
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,760
Hanchen.

543
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,230
Prepare yourself, Hanchen.

544
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,190
Hanchen, what's wrong with you?

545
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,680
The competition will start soon.

546
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,040
Xingzhou,

547
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,590
what's wrong with Hanchen?

548
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,350
The competition starts now.

549
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,950
Here.

550
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,680
Here.

551
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,500
Here.

552
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
- Here.
- Keep the goal.

553
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,780
Here.

554
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,070
Shameless.

555
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,280
Pass it on.

556
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,760
Hurry up.

557
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,920
Pass it on.

558
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,710
This way.

559
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,040
Hanchen!

560
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,230
Pass the ball!

561
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:56,760
This way.

562
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,110
Go stop him.

563
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,640
Here.

564
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,640
Vile.

565
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,710
Get lost.

566
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,640
How did this happen?

567
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,520
- Good one!
- Good one!

568
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,160
Yay!

569
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,860
(Energetic and spirited)

570
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,350
Luck is on their side.

571
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,950
Yeah.

572
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,560
Nice shot!

573
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,070
Hanchen.

574
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,110
Yes!

575
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,760
Round Ten is over.

576
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,230
Bailu Academy scored three goals.

577
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,230
Wujiang Prefecture School
scored seven goals!

578
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,470
Wujiang Prefecture School won!

579
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,190
Hanchen.

580
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,710
As the team leader, you need to pour
three bowls of powder on yourself.

581
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,110
- Pour it.
- Pour it. Pour it.

582
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,040
Three bowls.

583
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,830
Pour it. Pour it.

584
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,160
Two bowls to go.

585
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,110
There are two bowls to go.

586
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,040
Two bowls to go.

587
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,190
- Go on.
- Pour it.

588
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,280
- Yeah.
- Pour it.

589
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,590
The third bowl.

590
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,000
Watch me.

591
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
Good.

592
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,640
- Good.
- Good.

593
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,430
Why are they fighting?

594
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,660
(Energetic and spirited)

595
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,190
Why are they fighting?

596
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Yeah.

597
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,350
This is for trying to drug me!

598
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,230
Drug me! Drug me! Drug me!

599
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
Drug me! Drug me!

600
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,350
Stop!

601
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,310
This is for trying to drug me!

602
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,640
Drug me!

603
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,350
Drug me!

604
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,560
Hanchen, enough is enough!

605
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,680
What's your problem?

606
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,070
Are you done making a scene?

607
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,470
Yes.

608
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:24,950
Hanchen.

609
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,560
Hanchen.

610
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,190
Xiaoman.

611
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,520
Hanchen, are you alright?

612
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,280
Zhao Xiaoqian.

613
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,230
I lost.

614
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,880
Are you happy now?

615
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,560
Miss Xie,

616
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,280
we don't know each other well.

617
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,110
But I can see

618
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,160
what happened today

619
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,430
upset Hanchen very much.

620
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,000
It's fine though.

621
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,190
Don't be scared.

622
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,430
We'll leave soon.

623
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,980
(Civil Official)

624
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,560
Your Highness.

625
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,600
What...

626
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,760
What happened to you?

627
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,190
How did you get so soiled?

628
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,470
Who dared to pick on you

629
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,430
in Wujiang Prefecture?

630
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,080
Shi Deng,

631
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,670
go

632
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,800
get the Prefecture Magistrate here.

633
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,080
This...

634
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,800
Pack up.

635
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,280
We'll return to the capital.

636
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,280
Now?

637
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,190
Yes, now.

638
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,390
But...

639
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,280
What happened?

640
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,320
Don't follow me!

641
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,800
Hanchen.

642
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,600
What is this all about?

643
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,320
What exactly happened?

644
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,760
Look how soiled he is.

645
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,190
And why did he

646
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,710
suddenly decide
to return to the capital?

647
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,800
Do as he said.

648
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
Pack up.

649
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,040
We'll discuss the details tomorrow.

650
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,390
I'm sorry.

651
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,390
No.

652
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,150
I'm sorry. My bad.

653
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,430
Move aside!

654
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,760
Move aside!

655
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,870
Move aside!

656
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,520
Move aside!

657
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,870
Miss, are you alright?

658
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,120
Su Wei.

659
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,120
Alright, stop looking on.

660
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,120
Go away.

661
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,120
Are you alright?

662
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,390
Xiaoman.

663
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,120
What do I do now?

664
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,520
You want to give someone
the peach blossom shortbread rolls?

665
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,520
Do you like Zhao Xiaoqian?

666
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,280
Hell no.

667
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,760
Then you like Zhong Ziyan.

668
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,000
I...

669
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,020
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

670
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,760
How about this?

671
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,910
Put the peach blossom shortbread rolls
in my food container.

672
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,390
I'll deliver the food
to Zhong Ziyan for you.

673
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,600
But

674
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,520
the peach blossom
shortbread rolls are dirty.

675
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,280
It's fine.

676
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,560
My granny said

677
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,120
a little dirt on food harms nobody.

678
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,320
We won't tell him it's dirty.

679
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,430
Alright. No more delay.

680
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,120
If we waste more time,

681
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,520
the Cold Food Festival will be over.

682
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,360
I'll get going.

683
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Don't tell him I made these rolls.

684
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,540
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

685
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:18,300
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

686
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,100
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

687
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,940
(The Commandery Prince's Mansion)

688
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Xiaoman.

689
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,430
Shi Deng.

690
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,120
Where is the Commandery Prince?

691
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,470
Someone riled up His Highness.

692
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,390
He is smashing things in the room.

693
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,040
We'll set off for the capital tomorrow.

694
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,040
Now he refuses to meet anyone.

695
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,600
Give this food container to Mr. Zhong.

696
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,520
Tell him

697
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
it's from a young lady

698
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,870
at the Academy.

699
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,320
He knows her.

700
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,320
There is one more thing.

701
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,080
Please deliver this message for me:

702
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,760
I've made a mistake

703
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,040
and I've learned my lesson.

704
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,760
But please don't

705
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,080
fire me.

706
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,430
I want to continue working here.

707
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,470
Mister who?

708
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,710
Mr. Zhao?

709
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,390
Xiaoman.

710
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,800
Take a seat.

711
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,080
What do you see in Zhong Ziyan?

712
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,390
It's none of your business.

713
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,000
How come you're so familiar

714
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,840
with their servant?

715
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,600
I work at their study.

716
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Don't tell my uncle and auntie.

717
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,000
Why?

718
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,280
My land

719
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,950
belongs to the Commandery Prince now.

720
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,470
I need to redeem it.

721
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,280
But I just don't get along

722
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,600
with Zhao Xiaoqian.

723
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,870
I wonder when

724
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,710
I'll get to apologize
to him face-to-face.

725
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,040
Hurry up.

726
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Hurry up. Hurry up.

727
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,320
You act like you haven't eaten.

728
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,360
Hurry up.

729
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,600
Pack my military texts and maps

730
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,870
into a separate box.

731
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,280
I need to bring them along.

732
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,910
Rest easy, Your Highness.

733
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,080
It has been on my mind.

734
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,120
We won't leave anything behind.

735
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,600
Your Highness.

736
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,120
Your Highness.

737
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,280
What's with the noise?

738
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,600
Xiaoman came here today.

739
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,080
She asked me to bring this to you.

740
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
She said you'd recognize the food.

741
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,360
She said she learned her lesson

742
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,430
and wanted to continue working here.

743
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,280
Throw it out.

744
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,390
Wait.

745
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,760
Let me see.

746
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,430
Aren't these peach blossom
shortbread rolls?

747
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

748
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Today is the Cold Food Festival.

749
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,520
This is the food the young ladies use
to express their love.

750
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,600
Is Miss Xie expressing her love...

751
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,470
For Your Highness?

752
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,150
We are not going then.

753
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,500
♪Ask the moon whether it has seen♪

754
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,340
♪The other end of the earth♪

755
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,380
♪Your feelings fluctuate
