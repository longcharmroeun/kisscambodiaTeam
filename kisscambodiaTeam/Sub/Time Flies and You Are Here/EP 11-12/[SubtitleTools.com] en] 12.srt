=Episode 12=

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,716
(Apart from you like stars in the sky)

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,994
(Jingnv Pavilion)

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
We're playing polo
against Luming Pavilion?

23
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,440
We're all ladies.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,199
I've never even ridden a horse before.

25
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,319
How are we going to play polo?

26
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,080
That's true.

27
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,199
It's the family affair between
the Commandery Prince of Julu,

28
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,360
and Xiaoman anyway.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,279
If we take part hastily,

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,800
it's not appropriate.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,760
That's right.

32
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,239
We're all ladies.

33
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,160
Could Xiaoman be sold

34
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,000
and someone's happy about it?

35
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,800
In this world,

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,759
there are too many injustice
towards us ladies.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,399
Are we not going to help

38
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,240
other ladies?

39
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,479
Help her if you want.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,320
I can't do it.

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,679
I was angry with him.

42
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,839
Who knew

43
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,919
it's as if he was born to play polo.

44
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,440
My bad.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm not as bright as the city people.

46
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,399
I'm such an idiot.

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,479
Xiaoman.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,119
Oh, right.

49
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,080
About what happened before this,

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
how did it go?

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,679
It's solved.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,039
Don't worry

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,960
about me.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,000
Since Yanniang has decided to do so,

55
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,559
I should be responsible
for your matters anyway.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,919
You're my junior,

57
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,440
and also the most hardworking
student in Jingnv Pavilion.

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm like your teacher.

59
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,839
There's no way I'll ignore you.

60
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,199
Don't worry.

61
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,919
Zhao Xiaoqian can't do
anything to me for now.

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,199
not just a powerless scholar.

64
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,479
Xiaoman.

65
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,160
Teacher.

66
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,919
I've heard about what happened.

67
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,720
I've disgraced you.

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,800
How is that disgrace?

69
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,479
As a concubine,

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,919
your fate isn't up to you.

71
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,119
I heard you're going to
have a polo match

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
with the Commandery Prince
at the old academy.

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,199
Actually,

74
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,080
I couldn't even ride a horse properly.

75
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,440
I made that decision in a rush.

76
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,759
Please forgive me.

77
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,440
How do I forgive you?

78
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,759
Since such misfortune is set,

79
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,240
compromising

80
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,880
will be unfair for ourselves.

81
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,600
Confucius compared ladies to villains.

82
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,919
So, as ladies,

83
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,639
all the more we should

84
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,440
always remind ourselves
of the way of gentlemen.

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
We must keep our word.

86
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,440
For our own destiny,

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,360
we must also achieve
something for our future.

88
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,520
Hopefully we'll have a clear
conscience towards heavens,

89
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
towards the world,

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,080
and ourselves,

91
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,520
understand?

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,080
Teacher, may I ask,

93
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,880
what's the meaning of have a clear
conscience towards ourselves?

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,360
In the past, Lady Hao went to the
battlefield in her husband's place,

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
and Princess Zhao of Pingyang
guarded Niangzi Pass.

96
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,079
The two of them never relied
on their father or brothers.

97
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,880
People always say

98
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,799
ladies depend on others throughout their
lives, akin to climbers on trees,

99
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,519
and the tree here means the
male members of her family.

100
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,880
But ladies in this world

101
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,239
are no different from men.

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,079
The only difference is
ladies neither compete,

103
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,880
nor dare,

104
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,720
thinking submitting will
mean an easy life in future.

105
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,480
However, easy life or not,

106
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,359
it depends on others.

107
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,000
Food handed out in
contempt is tasteless.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,119
Heavens help those who help themselves.

109
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,200
Today,

110
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,880
if you stand forth for yourself,

111
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,160
even if you failed in future,

112
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,440
you won't regret it.

113
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,519
But if you admit defeat

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,720
or give in,

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,359
then your destiny

116
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,119
is no longer up to yourself.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,239
Teacher, do you mean

118
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,399
I should fight for my own destiny?

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,839
A just cause attracts much support,

120
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,519
an unjust one finds little.

121
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,880
If you're firm-minded,

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,959
yours will be a just cause.

123
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,359
I understand now.

124
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,640
Teacher, you're broad-minded and bold.

125
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I'll go and take a look at her first.

126
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,079
Xiaoman.

127
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,559
Ladies.

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,880
I know.

129
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,440
Perhaps all of you are thinking.

130
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,559
What did Xie Xiaoman do

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,279
to be loathed by the Commandery Prince

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,519
and even offered to sell her to others?

133
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:11,959
In fact...

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,279
In fact, I also want to know why.

135
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,679
What exactly happened that

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Xie Xiaoman has to end up in this state?

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,359
Today,

138
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not afraid of being
embarrassed anymore.

139
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,440
I'll tell you the entire story.

140
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,440
I thought about living in
Yuyangli my entire life.

141
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,799
Plant mulberry trees during
peak farming season,

142
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,000
and study during off-peak season.

143
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,559
Find a good husband,

144
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,440
and lead a stable life

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,559
as long as we're safe and secure
for the rest of our lives.

146
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,440
But the current era

147
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,959
is so harsh towards ladies.

148
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,760
I won't hide it from everyone else.

149
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,839
That day,

150
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,440
I indeed spent the night
with the Commandery Prince.

151
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,559
It was an accident.

152
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,000
But my entire life

153
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,440
was changed since that night.

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,559
The times we're in now,

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,239
ladies have to obey
their father's orders at home,

156
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,000
and after they get married, they'll
obey their husband's orders.

157
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,320
When their husband pass away,
it's the sons.

158
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,160
I've always enjoyed studying

159
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,959
because it'll bring us knowledge.

160
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,279
But if I can't even determine

161
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,399
my own fate,

162
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,279
what good will knowledge do?

163
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,799
If we keep living in the lessons
of "Admonitions for Ladies",

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,279
we'll only suffer more and more.

165
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,079
For us ladies,

166
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,559
a concubine like me,

167
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,880
or a female servant,

168
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,279
or even courtesans,

169
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
none of us is an object.

170
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,519
We shouldn't be trampled by others

171
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,640
or thrown around.

172
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
What's the purpose of studying anyway?

173
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,160
I've been thinking about this question

174
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,720
ever since I joined the academy.

175
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,359
Now,

176
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,239
I seem to have understood a little.

177
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,239
Perhaps it takes this kind of suffering

178
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
and tribulations

179
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,079
for us to understand that

180
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,959
like men, we're also humans.

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,600
I'm not afraid to fight with anyone.

182
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,119
I just want Xie Xiaoman

183
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,279
to live on with a sense of pride.

184
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
Today, the person who is
asking for your help

185
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,920
isn't your classmate, Xie Xiaoman,

186
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,600
but a lady

187
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,600
Xie Xiaoman.

188
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,839
I'll help you.

189
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
It's not easy for ladies anywhere.

190
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,920
We're not those kind of

191
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,399
ordinary short-sighted ladies.

192
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,920
Let's show those guys
from Luming Pavilion

193
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,799
that

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
we can also play polo with them,

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,119
fair and square.

196
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,399
Count me in!

197
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,479
Count me in!

198
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,440
Count me in!

199
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,039
We'll also help you.

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,840
Of course.

201
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
I'll help you, too.

202
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,679
Zhao Xiaoqian,

203
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,000
what are you doing?

204
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,559
All of us are friends.

205
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
In future, when we meet,

206
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,159
it'll only make things
difficult for all of us.

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
Jingnv Pavilion has promised Xiaoman.

208
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,200
But even if that's the case,

209
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
it's also very unlikely they'll win.

210
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,159
You shouldn't be doing this.

211
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,640
I agree.

212
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,359
Hanchen.

213
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Don't let yourself regret this.

214
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm already regretting

215
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,840
marrying her.

216
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,640
Master.

217
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,880
This rascal.

218
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,960
What happened to you this time?

219
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,880
Did you come and have a drink with me?

220
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,200
Or you're here for archery?

221
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:22,960
That shot

222
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,880
was full of determination.

223
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
But you've been visiting

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
the army camp often lately.

225
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,039
What are you up to?

226
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,919
Are you planning to join Xiongjie Camp

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,799
or remain at Wujiang Prefecture?

228
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Master, you've heard of it?

229
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,479
Of course.

230
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,599
Commandery Prince of Julu's
selling his concubine.

231
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:44,000
Everyone in Wujiang Prefecture knows.

232
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,280
So, Master,

233
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,359
what do you think I should do?

234
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,520
When I first taught
you horseback archery,

235
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,799
I told you,

236
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,760
for us men,

237
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,599
if you have high ambitions,

238
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,080
you need to be broad-minded.

239
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,520
Attachment to the self
brings about trouble.

240
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,840
Self-centeredness is
a no-no for soldiers.

241
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,520
If you have high ambitions,

242
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,359
you'll have to let go of certain things.

243
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Master, do you mean

244
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:11,919
you want me to let go?

245
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,760
Men should be

246
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,479
adaptable to circumstances.

247
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,400
If you want to leave
Wujiang Prefecture itself,

248
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,880
then nothing at this place

249
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,400
should hold you back.

250
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
Squire Wang, will you really redeem me?

251
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,840
Certainly.

252
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,039
Then I'm willing to marry you.

253
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,400
I hope you're not lying to me

254
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,239
and are indeed planning to

255
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,719
make me your wife.

256
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,159
You're really agreeing to it?

257
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,640
Yanniang,

258
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,479
don't worry.

259
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
I'll definitely treat you well.

260
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,520
I guarantee

261
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,840
I won't get any concubines.

262
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,679
When we get your contract,

263
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,599
I'll make you

264
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,119
my wife openly.

265
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,840
Magistrate Yan,

266
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,640
about redeeming Courtesan Zhu,

267
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,719
I need your help.

268
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,880
(Capital)

269
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,229
(Kunning Palace)

270
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,260
(Crown Prince, Zhao Xiaoze)

271
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Lady Shen again submitted a
memorial to the palace today,

272
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,039
(Eunuch Wang Xian)
saying she wants to meet Your Highness.

273
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,960
How many times has she done
that in this month alone?

274
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,440
It must be about

275
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,679
(Empress)
Commandery Prince of Julu.

276
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,880
I don't understand

277
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,640
what Shen Zunfu is thinking.

278
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,479
Zhao Xiaoqian got
a concubine in Wujiang,

279
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,640
embarrassing Shen Family.

280
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,280
Yet, he's still thinking of
letting Lingniang marry him.

281
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,080
Maybe Lingniang is the one
who couldn't forget him.

282
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:45,840
Did you forget?

283
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,840
Lingniang and the Commandery Prince

284
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,119
grew up in the palace together.

285
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
His Majesty

286
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,679
verbally granted their marriage before.

287
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,679
What Commandery Prince has done

288
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,880
is known all across the capital.

289
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,119
Lingniang would rather
compromise her dignity

290
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,159
than change her mind.

291
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,119
Perhaps...

292
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,520
Perhaps she's unwilling to enter
the imperial palace as a concubine.

293
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,880
Lingniang is entering the palace?

294
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,479
His Majesty is here!

295
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,200
You may rise.

296
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
Yesterday, Xiaoze said

297
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
he's almost memorised "Mencius"

298
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,640
by heart,

299
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,119
and yet you still haven't
tested him on it.

300
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,599
What were you writing?

301
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,340
(Emperor)

302
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,239
"To be able to celebrate with the people

303
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,719
as one's happiness."

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
What does it mean?

305
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:09,840
It's talking about

306
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,880
King Wen of Zhou was
building the astronomy tower.

307
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,840
He said to the people,

308
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,359
"take your time to build the tower."

309
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,080
The people thought King Wen
was concerned about them,

310
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,119
so they put even more effort into it.

311
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,760
However, when it's completed,

312
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,520
King Wen of Zhou was found
relaxing in the astronomy tower.

313
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,119
It was then the people realised

314
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,479
King Wen of Zhou's aim

315
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,799
was to enjoy himself in the tower.

316
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,479
So, this sentence implies that

317
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,479
King Wen...

318
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,679
King Wen wants to

319
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,000
celebrate with the people.

320
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,400
It means the king should apply
the policy of benevolence,

321
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,880
share weal and woe with the people,

322
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,919
and celebrate together.

323
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,159
It's better to have a solid foundation
when it comes to studying.

324
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,119
Don't be restricted in vision
and shallow in understanding.

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,760
In the past, when Hanchen
studied "Mencius",

326
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,760
it took him great painstaking effort.

327
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Not only must you memorise it by heart,

328
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,440
you have to understand what it means.

329
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,159
Learn from your brother.

330
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,760
I understand.

331
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,799
I received many memorials again.

332
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,080
I need to leave.

333
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,840
The osmanthus tree at the backyard
is going to bloom soon.

334
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,799
You and your son should go
have a look when you have time.

335
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,359
No need to see me off.

336
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,599
Revise with the Crown Prince.

337
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,440
Take care, Your Majesty.

338
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Take care, father.

339
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,919
Your Highness,

340
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,119
regarding Lady Shen...

341
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,239
I won't meet her.

342
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,159
Entering the palace or not

343
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,559
isn't up to her.

344
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,460
(Residence of the Shen Family, Capital)

345
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,440
Her Highness wants us to send
Lingniang to the palace.

346
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,239
How can I let them ruin our Lingniang?

347
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,320
His Majesty is much older

348
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,679
than Lingniang.

349
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,920
No, this won't do.

350
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,560
I married you

351
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,920
not to let our daughter suffer.

352
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,640
I don't care.

353
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,760
Go to the palace and tell His Majesty

354
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
that Lingniang's already engaged.

355
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,880
What are you talking about?

356
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,719
Zhao Xiaoqian has got himself a
concubine in Wujiang Prefecture.

357
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,599
It's an act of humiliation towards us

358
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,880
as well as Lingniang.

359
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,839
You've been

360
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,239
my wife for years.

361
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,760
Why don't you understand
such a simple theory?

362
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,274
(Madam Shen)

363
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,880
Why won't Her Highness meet Lingniang?

364
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:37,959
Do you know why?

365
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,590
(Minister of Bureau of Military Affairs,
Shen Zunfu)

366
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,239
Her Highness has decided

367
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,280
to bring Lingniang to the palace,

368
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,160
but the current situation within
the palace is very complicated.

369
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,199
Noble Consort Zhang and Her Highness
are fighting over His Majesty's favour,

370
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
but she has no child.

371
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,479
Her Highness has Crown Prince,

372
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,400
yet Chancellor Xu's clinging
to Crown Prince for his power.

373
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,199
The forces in the capital
are intertwined and complicated.

374
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,400
Our Junfu is coming back next year.

375
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,520
Her Highness' idea

376
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,560
is to let Shen Family settle down first.

377
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,719
You won't let Lingniang enter
the palace.

378
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
Do you want to let her enter
the East Palace?

379
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,560
(Lingniang, Shen Zhaowen)
Do you mean

380
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,199
you want my Lingniang,

381
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,359
to set the path for Shen Family?

382
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,800
We're a family of high officials,

383
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:30,800
not some unknown people

384
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,520
who climbed up to this status today.

385
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:35,719
We

386
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
can't afford to fall.

387
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,560
It's the last 15 minutes.

388
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,319
Don't give up.

389
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,319
Hang in there.

390
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,199
Although those from Luming Pavilion

391
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,640
are natural horse riders,

392
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,880
we mustn't lose to them.

393
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,560
I'll remember

394
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,560
the kindness you all show today.

395
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
In future,

396
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,400
if any of you

397
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,160
are treated unfairly by the society,

398
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,359
I'll be the first to stand up for you.

399
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,040
Why don't we

400
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,160
recite "The Ballad of Mulan"

401
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,439
to boost our morale?

402
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,439
Sure!

403
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,400
Sigh.

404
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,439
Mulan sat at home weaving,

405
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,319
but the loom's resonant sound
could not be heard

406
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,079
over the girl's sighs,

407
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,959
but my father has no son,

408
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,599
and I have no big brother.

409
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,520
I want to go to buy
a saddle and a horse

410
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,359
to serve in my father's place.

411
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,400
The night air moved
the watchman's rattle,

412
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,079
the cold light glinted on her armour.

413
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,920
A hundred generals died in battle,

414
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,839
in ten years she returned
as a great warrior.

415
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,920
Mulan said, "The male rabbit
normally hops and runs

416
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,800
while the female sits and stares.

417
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,599
But both flee fast
when danger threatens.

418
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,280
How can one tell whether they
are male or female then?"

419
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,199
Sister,

420
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,439
did something happen within the mansion?

421
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,680
Lady Xie,

422
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,400
well...

423
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,880
I still have something on.

424
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,959
I don't know anything.

425
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:24,800
I don't know anything.

426
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,340
(Lotus Garden)

427
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,719
Wick,

428
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,560
come closer.

429
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,119
Try again once more.

430
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,359
What's wrong?

431
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,040
What's she doing?

432
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,640
This afternoon,

433
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,959
she bought a few books on polo.

434
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,119
I guess she's practising now.

435
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:36,599
Your Highness,

436
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,680
a married couple's fights don't last.

437
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,839
Why don't you just go in?

438
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,040
Maybe if she's happy,

439
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,560
the misunderstanding between
you two will be solved.

440
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,439
What's there to solve?

441
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,119
She's already made her decision.

442
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,959
It's already been said.

443
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,680
If all the misunderstandings
in this world

444
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,959
can be solved so easily,

445
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,880
then I...

446
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Wick, don't sleep.

447
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:56,719
Help me see

448
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,119
if my action just now
was correct or not.

449
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,800
Yes.

450
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:00,959
This is the page.

451
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,199
Why does it feel strange though?

452
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,199
Is that so?

453
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,439
What are you doing?

454
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,640
Leave us first.

455
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,599
What are you doing?

456
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,719
Let me tell you.

457
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,599
Many of the students at Jingnv Pavilion

458
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,560
are skilled in polo.

459
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,199
We won't lose to

460
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,560
you all from Luming Pavilion.

461
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,199
You've been practising polo
the entire evening?

462
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,319
That's right.

463
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,040
It's going well.

464
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,119
Do you want to leave me so badly?

465
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,199
Speak.

466
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,839
What are you doing?

467
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,160
You're the one who
was planning to sell me.

468
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,359
You abandoned me first.

469
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,439
I sold you?

470
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,439
Don't you know why I did that?

471
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:23,959
Let go of me!

472
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,719
Let go!

473
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,839
You're my concubine

474
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,719
yet you secretly helped Li Su.

475
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,560
What do you take me for?

476
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm the Commandery Prince, you know.

477
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,839
Speak!

478
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,160
Let go!

479
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:39,839
Yes,

480
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,040
that's right.

481
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,400
It's because I was worried something
might happen to Congwen.

482
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,040
That's why I copied the intelligence.

483
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,880
It's because Congwen helped me before.

484
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,359
Be it Congwen

485
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,160
or Teacher Liu,

486
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,479
they're the ones who told me that

487
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,280
ladies can also study and
know the rules of propriety.

488
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,280
Ladies can also have their own path.

489
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,560
And you?

490
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,319
Zhao Xiaoqian,

491
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,800
I'm thankful for what you did for me,

492
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,439
and I'm also trying to repay that.

493
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,319
However, am I mere nothing to you?

494
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,640
What unforgivable mistake did I make?

495
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,640
When you're unhappy,

496
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,359
you just sold me to others?

497
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,959
Zhao Xiaoqian,
you were going to sell me.

498
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,079
So tell me.
Why should I be in love with you?

499
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,359
Why should I be in love with

500
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,680
a person who decides
my destiny as he pleases?

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,800
Let go!

502
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,160
Let go!

503
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,319
Please let me go!

504
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,160
Let go!

505
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,280
Do you hate me so much?

506
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,319
In future, when you've left my side,

507
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,079
take good care of yourself.

508

Don't try to step up for others anymore.

509
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,199
If you come across someone
other than me,

510
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,199
who knows

511
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,199
you might even get killed.

512
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,439
Did you know?

513
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,400
I also hate myself.

514
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,359
There're so many ladies in this world.

515
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,920
Why does it have to be you
of all people?

516
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,520
You heartless Xie Xiaoman.

517

521

Su Family sent someone here

522
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
to bring Lady Xie back.

523
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:19,920
Chase them away.

524
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,640
That'd be inappropriate.

525
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,959
After all, it's Lady Xie's family.

526
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,640
Do I need to teach you all these?

527
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,079
If they cause a ruckus again,

528
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,599
just seal Su Chang Ji.

as well as a deed.

Xiaoman will go with you
after the polo match.

534
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,479
Let her leave

535
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:07,560
and return the deed to her.

536
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,800

Principal,

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,599
I guess the polo match will
go on as usual tomorrow.

567
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,000
But if we

568
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,479
don't want things to get more
serious than it already is,

569
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,000
the polo match mustn't
have a final result.

570
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,920
Therefore, I'd like to ask you

571
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,800
to think of a way to
terminate the match tomorrow.

572

to solve the issue.

00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,079
Since you're solving the issue,

575
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,520
problems shouldn't arise
from it further.

576
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,000

this time's polo match as a test

is a first for male and female
students to fight in opposing teams

584

ever since the establishment
of Bailu Academy.

585

It'll set a precedent.
