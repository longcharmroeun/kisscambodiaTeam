(Studio of Artlessness)

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,919
I'm heading to Zhao Xiaoqian right now.

23
00:01:58,559 --> 00:01:59,599
Do not tell anyone in the mansion

24
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,919
that I'm back.

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,559
Especially Zhu Momo.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,519
Lady Xie, how dare you return?

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,879
Clearly, you have no respect for me.

28
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,239
Servants.

29
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,440
Take Lady Xie away.

30
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,880
What are you doing?

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
What are you doing?

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,839
Squire Wang.

33
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,039
Squire Wang, you cannot go in there.

34
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,520
The courtesan isn't feeling well.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
Squire Wang.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Let me in.

37
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,479
Qiongqiong,

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
let Mr. Wang in.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Yes.

40
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:35,960
Yanniang.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
Yanniang.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,119
I was too rash before.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
I shouldn't have insulted Mr. Li.

44
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,039
I came just to talk to you

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
about your redemption.

46
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,639
I've been investigating.

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,639
Mr. Li sought help from Duke Teng

48
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,559
to redeem your freedom.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,839
However,

50
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,759
I'm afraid even Duke Teng
is unable to do so.

51
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,119
Yanniang, have you ever
thought about it?

52
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,679
You submitted your
petitions numerous times.

53
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,759
Why were your requests
constantly suppressed?

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,639
It isn't because you're disallowed to,

55
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,320
but it's because of Mr. Li.

56
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,720
If Mr. Li attempts to
redeem your freedom,

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,440
it would never work.

58
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,880
You don't need me to
tell you the reason,

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm sure you're aware.

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,240
Yanniang,

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,679
my feelings

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,119
for you are genuine.

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,880
I may not be educated,

64
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,479
but my family is affluent.

65
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,199
My wife passed away long ago.

66
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,919
All she left behind was
a son and a daughter.

67
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,320
I know

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,919
you dislike me because
I'm uneducated.

69
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,520
However, believe me.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,759
My feelings for you are true.

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,240
I'll definitely redeem your freedom.

72
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,679
I'll marry you

73
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,000
with a grand wedding.

74
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:54,919
Since ancient times,

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
weddings and funerals
hold significance.

76
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,559
I heard

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,399
what you had to say.

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
I'll think about it.

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
However, I'm not feeling well today.

80
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,960
Please return.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,440
Squire,

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,559
your carriage is here.

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,119
As long as it takes,

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,679
I'll wait for your good news.

85
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,359
Another man who
doesn't know his place.

86
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,079
Where's Congwen?

87
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,760
Where is he?

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,239
(About Courtesan Zhu's redemption,)

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,959
(I'm unable to help you.)

90
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,920
(My apologies.)

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,839
Yanniang.

92
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,359
What should I do?

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,119
If I recall it right,

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,959
yesterday, Lady Xie

95
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,839
insisted on returning home at all cost.

96
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,679
However, you intruded
the Commandery Prince's Mansion

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,559
and the Studio of Artlessness today.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,760
What's wrong?

99
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:33,600
Is the Commandery Prince's
Mansion a place for you

100
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,600
to come and go as you please?

101
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,399
I was wrong for leaving
without permission.

102
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,559
However, I signed a contract
with the Commandery Prince.

103
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,760
As long as the contract remains,

104
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,239
I'm allowed to leave
whenever I want to.

105
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,160
If you're upset,

106
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm willing to receive punishment.

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Fine.

108
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,480
Since you're willing to be punished,

109
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I will teach you

110
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,239
the rules of the capital.

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,799
Someone beats her.

112
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,000
Lady Xie's skin is tender.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
The beating will leave her scarred.

114
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
Hit me instead.

115
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,559
It's my fault.

116
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,040
What fault do you have?

117
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
Everything is my fault.

118
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,679
Fine.

119
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Punish the both of them!

120
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Get out of the way.

121
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,359
Please stop it!

122
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,359
Lady Xie!

123
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm begging you to stop!

124
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,320
Zhu Momo!

125
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,480
Please stop hitting her!

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Hit her hard!

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,279
Please stop!

128
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,079
Hit her harder!

129
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,279
Please! I'm begging you to stop!

130
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,040
Zhu Momo, please stop hitting her!

131
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,799
She's being punished by Zhu Momo?

132
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,040
Hanchen,

133
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
you can't go.

134
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,200
I'll go instead.

135
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Your Highness,

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,239
you can't be exposed to cold.

137
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,279
Hanchen.

138
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,079
Hanchen.

139
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,000
Your Highness.

140
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,359
You can't expose yourself
to cold right now.

141
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm begging you to stop!

142
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,279
Zhu Momo, I'm begging you!

143
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,799
Please stop hitting her!

144
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,359
Go on!

145
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,600
Hit her harder!

146
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,760
Please!

147
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm begging you.

148
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,200
Please stop it.

149
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,480
Are you torturing Xie Xiaoman, Zhu Momo?

150
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,760
Princess Consort Pu sent me
to Your Highness' aid

151
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,239
to discipline

152
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,040
the Commandery Prince of Julu's Mansion.

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,839
Lady Xie

154
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,959
left the mansion without permission.

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
In regards to the rhino horn hairpin,

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,079
it's going to be another hassle.

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,720
Since Lady Xie entered the mansion,

158
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,959
she has never abided by the rules.

159
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,799
Because of that,

160
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,920
I exercised discipline.

161
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
Even at your father' presence,

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,799
there's nothing His Highness could say.

163
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,160
You brought my father up against me.

164
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,040
Your Highness.

165
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,720
Since you are

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,079
establishing order for my mother,

167
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,119
I'm sure

168
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,239
I've violated order in many ways.

169
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,239
Zhu Momo,

170
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,799
I'm a man.

171
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,760
Hit me first

172
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,480
before you hit my woman.

173
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,760
Those who used the ruler,

174
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,840
those who held Xiaoman down,

175
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,000
those who hit her,

176
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,359
you know what to do.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,039
Punish yourselves as fit.

178
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,960
Thank you for saving
Lady Xie, Your Highness.

179
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,520
Put me down.

180
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,200
Shut up.

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,760
Where's the ointment?

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Hurry up and fetch the medication.

183
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,159
What happened to His Highness?

184
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,919
His Highness drank some wine

185
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,919
out in the cold

186
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,520
and caught a cold.

187
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,880
Let's excuse ourselves.

188
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,799
Hold it.

189
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,880
Sit down.

190
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,960
Remove your mantle.

191
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,320
I'll apply the medication for you.

192
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,440
There's no need.

193
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,400
You fool.

194
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,960
We're husband and wife.

195
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,840
What are you ashamed of?

196
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,679
You're late from checking on me.

197
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,760
I haven't gotten a chance
to lecture you.

198
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
There's no need.

199
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,440
Did you know I've seen it all?

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,679
Back then, you were
working at my mansion.

201
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,919
You helped me compile
the ways of a gentleman.

202
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,320
I followed you into the chambers

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,320
and you were getting
changed coincidentally.

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,440
Why would I

205
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,799
order you to eat more after that?

206
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,559
It's because you're too skinny.

207
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,719
Silly girl.

208
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
I'll do it myself.

209
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,320
Don't worry.

210
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,320
I'm not going to do anything to you.

211
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,159
I'll get your

212
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,320
attendant to apply
the ointment on your back.

213
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,159
I just

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,080
want to talk to you.

215
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
Go ahead.

216
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,039
I'm listening.

217
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,200
Last night, after you left,

218
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,039
I was consumed by remorse.

219
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
I had some wine to drink.

220
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,799
Shen Yan was irritating as usual.

221
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,080
I drank as much as I could.

222
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,559
He said, you took the hairpin

223
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
to the brothel.

224
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,640
I...

225
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,320
I do not blame you.

226
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,840
I know

227
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,159
you must have your reasons.

228
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,080
I just

229
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,280
had dreams of the past.

230
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
You know

231
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,640
how much Xingzhou overthinks.

232
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,880
It's inappropriate to bring it up.

233
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,200
Forget about Zhu Momo and the rest.

234
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,679
They'd never understand anyway.

235
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,520
That's why I thought,

236
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,280
perhaps...

237
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,960
I understand.

238
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,159
I had a dream last night.

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,400
It was about my brother.

240
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,559
Before meeting you,

241
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,200
I'd always dream of
the snowy days in the capital.

242
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,159
I'd dream of the great palace walls.

243
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,960
Snow was gathered on the rims.

244
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,159
I was only seven or
eight years old then.

245
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,239
Brother was concerned that I'd be bored.

246
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,799
So, he took me

247
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,919
to fly kites by the palace walls.

248
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,280
Look.

249
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,080
How could a feeble kite

250
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,559
fly so high?

251
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,159
Did you know?

252
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,440
After the Qixi Festival,

253
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,520
comes my brother's birthday.

254
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,359
Principal Yang once said,

255
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,359
my brother and I are
completely different.

256
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,440
Both of us entered the palace together.

257
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,719
My brother was reliable,

258
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,440
and I was stubborn.

259
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,239
Everyone thought

260
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,359
my brother would emerge
as the next Emperor.

261
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:03,960
I've never thought of

262
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,400
competing with my brother anyway.

263
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,239
All I wanted

264
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,119
was after my brother
becomes the Emperor,

265
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,599
I'll head to the borders

266
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,960
and protect the state for my brother.

267
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,559
Unfortunately,

268
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,280
I was exiled from the capital.

269
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,400
Even worse,

270
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,239
he no longer exists.

271
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,559
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,440
I lied yesterday.

273
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,080
I did not return to my uncle's house.

274
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,880
I lost the hairpin

275
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,840
because I went to learn
Bian Embroidery

276
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,760
from Courtesan Zhu.

277
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,520
Minggu is grounded.
I wanted to help her,

278
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,440
but

279
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,799
I was afraid you'd reveal this.

280
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,000
The incident with Minggu
would be disclosed.

281
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,880
I dare not tell you that
I went to the brothel

282
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,520
because I didn't want to enrage you.

283
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,159
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,280
I didn't know you caught a cold.

285
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,159
You were troubled to
stand up for me just now.

286
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,919
Yesterday, I was telling Minggu

287
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,599
how I wish I could hate you.

288
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,760
However, you treat me with kindness.

289
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't bring myself to hate you.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,119
How can I bring myself to hate you?

291
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,239
As for the Bian Embroidery you need,

292
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,359
I'll order Liangji to have it done.

293
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,520
Get a goodnight's rest tonight.

294
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,239
We shall celebrate Qixi Festival
at the streets tomorrow.

295
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,159
We will stroll through
Xiangqiao and guess riddles.

296
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:34,880
All right?

297

Are there any news

00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,359
about my redemption?

307
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't worry.

308
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,760
Duke Teng has yet to reply me.

309
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,839
It should happen soon.

310
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,359
Did you do this yourself?

311
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,479
All right.

312
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,239
It's the Qixi Festival.

313
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,319
You may go.

314
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,800
However, keep this in mind.

315
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,560
Just because

316
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,199
you're the heir of Su Chang Ji,

317
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,760
you can't act like you're above order.

318
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,760
I understand.

319
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,640
This time,

320
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,800
if it wasn't for Yan Boyang's kindness

321
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,800
to keep this incident hidden,

322
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,880
you'd be in deep trouble.

323
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,359
Mother, don't worry.

324
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,280
I'll behave like a respectable lady.

325
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,280
You're one sweet-talker.

326
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:23,760
Go

327
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,079
and show me the spider web.

328
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,079
I'll go.

329
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,640
The web is made exquisitely.

330
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:48,839
Minggu,

331
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,119
you're in luck.

332
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:53,719
All right.

333
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,239
You may pack up and go have fun.

334
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,640
Remember to bring attendants with you.

335
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,199
Do not get into trouble.

336
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,839
All right, mother.

337
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,119
Let me show you something.

338
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,520
Let's go.

339
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,500
(Qixi Lantern Temple Fair)

340
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,640
May my parents be blessed
with great health.

341
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,359
May my brother's civil
examination proceeds smoothly.

342
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,599
May Congwen be
filled with happiness.

343
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,800
No harm may come to Hanchen.

344
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,199
May he lives in peace for life.

345
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,839
Make way.

346
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:21,640
Boss.

347
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,359
How many scores in order
to win the white rabbit lantern?

348
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:24,640
Three.

349
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,439
I'm playing the first round.

350
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,180
(Arrow-throwing)

351
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,959
Another one.

352
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,959
Mr. Jiang threw a hazelnut.

353
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,119
The second place.

354
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,239
The second place.

355
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,479
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

356
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:04,599
Thank you.

357
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,280
Mr. Niu will fail.

358
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,959
You will have to retake
the examinations.

359
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,479
Mr. Zhong threw a longan.

360
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,800
You're going to emerge
as the principal graduate.

361
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,959
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

362
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,199
Come on.

363
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:24,880
Predict my fortune, too.

364
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,319
Predict my fortune.

365
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:25,880
Here.

366
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,880
Boyang did not show up.

367
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,000
Forget about him.

368
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,119
Xiaoman and her friends are here.

369
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,719
Let's go.

370
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,199
All right.

371
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,280
Zhao Xiaoqian.

372
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,640
Let's check out the fish lantern.

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,560
Let's go.

374
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,599
Come on.

375
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,439
Why aren't we joining them?

376
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,119
Minggu needs to talk to Zhong Ziyan.

377
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,359
We shouldn't interrupt.

378
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,880
Do you want to

379
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,640
take a walk at the bridge?

380
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,439
Do you enjoy watching
the fish lanterns?

381
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,119
I enjoy looking at

382
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,520
bright, flickering objects.

383
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,040
Back at Yuyangli Village,

384
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,599
I love looking at the stars.

385
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,880
Previously, Mr. Liangji said,

386
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,400
every year, Wujiang Prefecture

387
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:43,319
would light fireworks
during the Lantern Festival.

388
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,239
Fellow noble households
would compete

389
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,680
to see whose fireworks
were the prettiest.

390
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,119
Does that mean you enjoy fireworks?

391
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,640
The fishes are intriguing.

392
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,359
Don't they resemble the great fish,
Kun, we saw

393
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,599
back at Mount Kunyan Temple?

394
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,800
Give me a moment.

395
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,560
I'll be back soon.

396
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,719
Don't go.

397
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,079
What's wrong?

398
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
(Qixi Lantern Temple Fair)

399
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,880
Just now, you prayed to Kui Xing

400
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,359
and earned the principal graduate.

401
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,599
I don't believe in superstition.

402
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,839
I was just joking around.

403
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,359
Courtesan Zhu.

404
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,160
Courtesan Zhu.

405
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,280
Slow down. I'm not going anywhere.

406
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,520
Here's the intelligence I copied.

407
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,599
It's all written in it.

408
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,319
Will Congwen be all right?

409
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:05,959
He will be fine.

410
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:06,719
Don't worry.

411
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,000
He will remain as your senior.

412
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:10,959
That's good.

413
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,160
Also,

414
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,040
please do not tell him about
the incident today.

415
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:16,920
He helped me a lot.

416
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,520
This is the least I could do.

417
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,400
Xiaoman.

418
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,199
Are you in love with
the Commandery Prince?

419
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,199
Many marriages are arranged.

420
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,599
Love doesn't mean anything.

421
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,400
You don't have to feel guilty about it.

422
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,119
What about Congwen?

423
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,599
You always do your best
to help him and rescue him.

424
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,640
You don't want him to know either.

425
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,400
What are

426
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,040
your feelings for him?

427
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,520
To Congwen,

428
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,599
I only...

429
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Whatever it is,

430
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,119
you don't have to tell me.

431
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,319
I overstepped my bounds.

432
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,760
Zhao Xiaoqian.

433
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,680
It seems like you do not
have feelings for me.

434
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,119
I...

435
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,920
You returned

436
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,760
for the intelligence.

437
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,040
That's not true.

438
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,800
Did you know?

439
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,560
I,

440
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,680
Zhao Xiaoqian,

441
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,599
have never tried so hard

442
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,040
to win a woman's heart.

443
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,040
You don't want anything to do with it.

444
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,439
Zhao Xiaoqian.

445
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,319
(On the night of Qixi Festival,
6th year of Fengheng,)

446
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,640
(the fireworks of Wujiang Prefecture
were magnificent.)

447
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,719
(They resembled the stars)

448
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,800
(I saw back at Yuyangli Village.)

449
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,280
(Do I love him?)

450
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:19,800
(I...)

451
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,439
(Zhao Xiaoqian,)

452
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,359
(thank you for all that
you've done for me.)

453
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,280
(I'm sorry.)

454
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,760
(I'm sorry.)

455
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,359
The fireworks

456
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,599
are beautiful.

457
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,439
Yes.

458
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,199
They are beautiful.

459
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,959
By the way,

460
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
what was it that you wanted to ask?

461
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,199
Nothing.

462
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,479
If there's nothing else,

463
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,719
I shall return to my books.

464
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,359
The civil examinations are near.

465
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,599
I have no time to waste.

466
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,319
I refuse to accept this.

467
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,599
Another round.

468
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,920
All right.

469
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,959
Sister.

470
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,040
This is for you.

471
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,439
Let's go.

472
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:32,920
What's going on?

473
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,839
He didn't even hit a single one.

474
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,239
He played for a long time

475
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,160
and couldn't even score a single one.

476
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,280
Let's go.

477
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,439
What do you think?

478
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,319
Sir,

479
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,719
would you like to try again?

480
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,520
Yanniang.

481
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,959
What are you doing here?

482
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,760
Did you send Xiaoman

483
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,000
to retrieve intelligence from
the Commandery Prince's mansion?

484
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,199
I...

485
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,119
I'm just doing this for your own good.

486
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,359
Have you ever considered that

487
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
she's a concubine of
the Commandery Prince's mansion?

488
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,239
If she makes a mistake,
and the prince finds out,

489
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,920
she'd be severely punished.

490
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,520
Regardless of her explanation,

491
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
none will suffice.

492
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,640
Yanniang.

493
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,719
Since when have you become

494
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,359
someone so unethical?

495
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,839
What about you?

496
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,520
Have you ever wondered

497
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,599
why would I resort to such method?

498
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,599
All you care about are
doctrines and loyalty.

499
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,719
If you didn't,
I will not have to stain my hands.

500
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,839
Refusing to help one in trouble

501
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,400
is not the way of a gentleman.

502
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,760
Is keeping one in the dark from truth

503
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,680
your way of a gentleman?

504
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
You knew beforehand.

505
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,439
Duke Teng is unable to
help redeem my freedom.

506
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,560
You still lied.

507
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,400
Why did you lie to me?

508
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,640
I don't need your lies!

509
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:13,800
Yanniang.

510
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,380
(Commandery Prince's Mansion)

511
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,280
No.

512
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,719
Without Lady Xie's permission,

513
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,319
no one may take our belongings.

514
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,560
Drag her away.

515
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,400
Stop it.

516
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,400
Zhu Momo.

517
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,439
This is the Lotus Garden.

518
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,479
They are trying to
enter your chambers

519
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,359
to seize your possessions

520
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,479
and your dowries.

521
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,839
You're but a mere student.

522
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:54,599
How many dowries
could you possibly own?

523
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,959
Why are you trying to seize

524
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,319
my possessions?

525
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,880
The rhino horn hairpin
given by His Highness

526
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,599
is a tribute bestowed
by the Emperor.

527
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,119
You can't just leave it
in someone else's keepsake.

528
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,560
If this goes out,

529
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,800
no matter how fearless

530
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,760
you are,

531
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,800
the Commandery Prince's Mansion
cannot afford the embarrassment.

532
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,599
Zhu Momo.

533
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,640
Although I'm but a concubine,

534
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,160
despite one's status, we're all humans.

535
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,959
Without His Highness' permission,

536
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,280
you led people over

537
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,359
to harass me in public.

538
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,680
Are you trying to embarrass
Commandery Prince

539
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,000
or are you casting me out?

540
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:26,920
You...

541
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,319
Well,

542
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,079
you're an old trustee
of Princess Consort Pu.

543
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,680
You have all the support you need.

544
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,040
The majority of my possessions

545
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,599
were granted by His Highness.

546
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,599
If you insist on seizing them,

547
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,839
I can't stop you.

548
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,640
However, if you lay a finger
on my family's endowment,

549
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,239
the court

550
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
will serve the justice I deserve.

551
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,319
Let's go.

552
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,560
How atrocious.

553
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,160
This brat

554
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,079
has gotten cunning.

555
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,359
How did I do?

556
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,199
Did I do well?

557
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:15,920
Yes.

558
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,640
You finally stood up for yourself.

559
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:23,119
It's my fault after all.

560
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,880
Life will be harsher
for me in the mansion.

561
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,719
Even if they decide to divorce me,

562
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,359
I have nothing to say.

563
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,640
On the contrary,

564
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,079
you should stop opposing them.

565
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,839
Do you understand?

566
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,839
What's going on, Lady Xie?

567
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,160
His Highness left early in the morning

568
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,359
without waiting for you.

569
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,760
Did you guys get into a fight?

570
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:47,880
No.

571
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:49,280
Everything is fine.

572
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,119
Anyway,

573
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,239
no matter what happens,

574
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,520
I'll not allow you to suffer.

575
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,040
Let's go.

576
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,839
Xiaoman.

577
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,040
Hurry and come with me.

578
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,879
Bad news.

579
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,280
Congwen, it seems like

580
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,840
you're pretty involved
in the affairs of my household.

581
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,919
Are you the Prince Li of the palace

582
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,800
or are you an investigating censor
of the court,

583
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,679
Lord Li?

584
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,439
I'm your senior.

585
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,320
Since I'm your senior,

586
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,239
everything has an order.

587
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm obligated to teach you

588
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,199
the right and wrong

589
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,520
of the way of a gentleman.

590
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
Do you see me as a gentleman?

591
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,479
Zhao Xiaoqian.

592
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,679
This is Wujiang, not the capital.

593
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,760
Since it's Wujiang,

594
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,760
nobody can order me around!

595
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,159
Listen to me.

596
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,840
She's just a plaything to me.

597
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,159
Even if I sell her off for three cash

598
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,520
just for fun,

599
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,080
what can you do?

600
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:08,719
Gentleman?

601
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,239
Since Your Highness have
made up your mind,

602
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,360
three cash, right?

603
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:19,040
Xiaoman of Xie Family,

604
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,520
it would be an honour for me to buy her.

605
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:24,399
This is bad.

606
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,719
Selling her to you?

607
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,919
Although she's just a plaything,

608
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,560
you've overestimated

609
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,040
how generous I am.

610
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,719
I would rather sell
her off to a peasant.

611
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,879
I would never sell her to you.

612
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,159
Do you understand?

613
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,280
Three cash.

614
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,639
I'll sell Xie Xiaoman to you.

615
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,080
Bring the money and
collect her tomorrow.

616
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,760
But...

617
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:03,239
But I...

618
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,040
Cut the crap.

619
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,919
I'm giving you a toy for free.
Quit the yapping.

620
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,679
Zhao Xiaoqian!

621
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,760
I'm going to sell you off!

622
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,919
What are you going to do about it?

623
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,639
Are you done?

624
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:42,840
Principal Yang would like
to see all of you.

625
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,120
(Principal Office)
Xie Xiaoman signed an agreement with me.

626
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,040
I can sell her off as I please.

627
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,159
It has nothing to do with you.

628
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,760
Xie Xiaoman is not only your concubine,

629
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,719
she's also a student of Bailu Academy.

630
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,840
You did a pretty good job.

631
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:09,919
You stuck

632
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,280
your nose into the student's household.

633
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,639
I have no say in the affairs
of your household.

634
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,879
Your Highness is selling her,

635
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I only seek to purchase.

636
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:18,919
I didn't do anything wrong.

637
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:19,760
You want to purchase her?

638
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,399
Who do you think you are?

639
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:26,800
Bailu Academy has taught
for many years.

640
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,600
We cultivated plenty of talents.

641
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,439
We produced officers
that served the court,

642
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,040
and benefactors that aided the people.

643
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,919
We produced many individuals
who shared the burdens

644
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,719
of the common folks.

645
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,320
What about you?

646
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,719
What are you fighting for?

647
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,639
The weather has turned warm recently.

648
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,800
I'm of old age.

649
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,719
I constantly reminisced in the past.

650
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,280
During summer back at the palace,

651
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,919
Xiaojie was brewing tea.

652
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,600
Hanchen, you were playing by the pool.

653
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,719
Those were rare relaxation.

654
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,239
Xiaojie's birthday

655
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
is in a few days.

656
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,360
That almost slipped my mind.

657
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,159
Do not mention him.

658
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:20,679
On the year of Xiaojie's death,

659
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,600
I taught you about the way of tea.

660
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,239
I taught you about broad-mindedness.

661
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,879
As the tea boils, the foam
should be as light as snow.

662
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,719
As one pours, it should
flow like the surging waterfall.

663
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,080
Its fragrance evokes
one to ask for more.

664
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,840
One shall sit by and watch
as the sun rises and falls.

665
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:43,239
You grasped the way of tea
very well when you were young.

666
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,159
You seem confused now.

667
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,439
When there is supply, there is demand.

668
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:49,439
Congwen would like to
purchase at a bargain.

669
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,919
A gentleman is broad-minded.

670
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,080
You should sell her to him.

671
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,320
What do you say?

672
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,719
I said, do not mention him.

673
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,679
Both of you went on

674
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,639
about selling and buying.

675
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,239
None of you considered my feelings.

676
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,719
Yes.

677
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,919
I may be Your Highness' concubine,

678
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,919
but I'm a person.

679
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:10,360
I'm not an object.

680
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,360
I'm not one to be sold
and bought easily,

681
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,439
or abandoned casually.

682
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,760
Do not forget, Your Highness.

683
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,439
Our contract comes with an expiry term.

684
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,719
You may treat me as a plaything,

685
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,040
but I cannot

686
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,439
treat myself as one.

687
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm a student of the academy,

688
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,840
and a student of yours, Principal Yang.

689
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,439
I'm in a predicament,

690
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,000
I plead for your help.

691
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,120
Who do you think you are

692
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:46,199
trying to ask for the principal's help?

693
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,159
Do you excel in your studies

694
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,919
or have you earned
honourary titles in civil affairs?

695
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:51,239
Did you pass the civil examination
and earned a title?

696
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:51,760
What's wrong?

697
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Your Highness, do you think

698
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,239
only men deserve to study?

699
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,679
Only men deserve the identity
as a student?

700
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,199
Principal,

701
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,600
the polo tournament is commencing

702
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:05,600
in five days.

703
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,679
Your Highness, since you think

704
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,080
I do not deserve to study here,

705
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,320
I shall prove

706
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,439
that although I'm a lady,

707
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,159
I'm going to attain first place

708
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,919
both in literature and martial arts.

709
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,439
I'm willing to participate

710
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,919
in the polo tournament.

711
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,919
If I obtain a good grade,

712
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:35,320
please help me redeem my freedom.

713
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,560
I beg for your approval, Principal Yang.

714
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,280
Xie Xiaoman.

715
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,560
Fine.

716
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,840
Since the ladies of Jingnv Pavilion

717
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,439
deem the polo tournament important,

718
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,919
I suggest for you to take it seriously,
Principal Yang.

719
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,360
I'm willing to help you

720
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,399
in training the ladies
of Jingnv Pavilion

721
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:57,840
with polo.

722
00:40:59,439 --> 00:40:59,919
Principal.

723
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:00,800
Since there's a test,

724
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,919
allow all of us to participate.

725
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,280
Let's see if you'd win

726
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,320
or I would.

727
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,360
See you

728
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,399
on the horse five days later.
