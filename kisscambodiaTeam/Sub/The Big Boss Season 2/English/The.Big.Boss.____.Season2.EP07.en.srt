00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,930
Episode 25

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,270
Hello?

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,140
Okay. Okay.

32
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,500
Bye-bye. Bye.

33
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,740
Why do they have to call me before coming here?

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
I have nothing hidden in my home.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,790
Any munition? No.

36
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,790
Any man? No.

37
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,670
Why are you still here?

38
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,730
-I'll fight back if you keep doing so.
-Leave. Hurry. Hurry.

39
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,220
-They're coming.
-What are you doing?

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,270
-Why are you fighting in such an early morning?
-He's bullying me!

41
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,610
That... That...

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,490
It's okay. It's okay.

43
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,960
Aren't you stupid?

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,250
I can tell them that I came here earlier. Okay?

45
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,250
Yes. I'll go open the door.

46
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,720
With your pajamas on?

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,110
I'll go change. I'll go change.

48
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,980
What's going on?

49
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,460
Okay. Okay. I got this.

50
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,800
Coming. Coming.

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,400
-Morning, brother Yihan.
-It's you guys.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,180
-Hi, brother Yihan.
-Morning, guys.

53
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,240
Danyi, you're so early.

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,110
I live more closely to here.

55
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,310
So I arrived first.

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,270
Yes. Yes.

57
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,270
He does live more closely.

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Where's Yezi? Still not up?

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

60
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,070
Aren't you Liao Danyi who lives very closely to my home?

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,200
You really arrived earlier than them.

62
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,350
Come, let's study.

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,120
Yes. Yes. Hurry, come on in.

64
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,519
Brother, your phone is ringing.

65
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,249
Someone called editor Chen...

66
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,810
No!

67
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,090
Someone out there. I got this.

68
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,560
No!

69
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,570
Brother.

70
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,520
Yezi. Yezi, don't let them in!

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,020
Mr Ye, we're here to pick you up.

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,660
They're gonna take me away!

73
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,660
We're here! No one can hurt my brother!

74
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,870
We're gonna send you to the beach house.

75
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,140
They're gonna lock me up in the beach house.

76
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,380
To abuse me!

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,070
They said...

78
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,760
Beach?

79
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,620
Someone said that we're gonna go to the beach?

80
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,610
I also heard 'beach house'?

81
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,520
Thank you, brother.

82
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,520
Thank you, brother.
-You're welcome.
-Thank you, brother!

83
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,920
No problem. No problem.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,090
Brother, you're the best!

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,090
But why did you invite him?

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,740
Well, because you and lad Danyi are both...

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,950
Shanqi!

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,170
You...

89
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,300
So naughty.

90
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm totally locked up in the cage this time.

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,190
But it's also good.

92
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,840
With wonder girl Ye and lad Danyi,
and so many younger friends staying with me...

93
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,760
Brother, I'm gonna go to the beach! Bye-bye.

94
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,590
Bye, brother!

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,020
Bye, brother.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,950
Bye...

97
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,900
Ocean! Ocean! Ocean!

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,440
Beach! Beach! Beach!

99
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,650
And Shanqi! Shanqi! Shanqi!

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,330
-Shanqi!
-What are you doing?

101
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,440
Watching beauties.

102
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Come on! Come on! Come on!

103
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,990
Where are they?

104
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,670
You don't understand. When beauties show up,

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,710
we'll look back naturally.

106
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,910
To spark the flames of love.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,210
Xiaodong.

108
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,170
Look, the sunlight is so hot today.

109
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,700
Need me to apply some sunscreen cream to you?
No, thank you. I've already had it applied.

110
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,960
Zhu Shanqi. We still haven't.

111
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,980
Never mind, brother.

112
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,390
It's okay, we can help each other.

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,980
Bros, you're well-trained. Well-trained.

114
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,410
Very rigorous.

115
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,230
Very burly.

116
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,530
You must often do body-building.

117
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,030
Bros.

118
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,150
Well... Don't be too nervous.

119
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,210
Actually, we... Writing, you know.

120
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,670
Sometimes, we want... Well...

121
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,760
Smoking. Smoking.

122
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,180
This...

123
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,620
This is not from the brand that I usually smoke.

124
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,440
But it's good enough. It is.

125
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,600
But sometimes, when it comes to...

126
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,430
When writing becomes very depressing...

127
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,050
I need... Right, I need to drink.

128
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
You also got wine...

129
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
You really have everything prepared.

130
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,550
Well... In fact...

131
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,330
You know, we writers need many inspirations.

132
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,600
I also need some... For example, coffee...

133
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,810
No. Bros.

134
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,360
Bros. Be gentle. Be gentle. Bros.

135
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,670
It hurts...

136
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,080
Bros, we can talk. Don't be mad.

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,380
Can I go outside to have some fresh air?

138
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,150
Thank you. Thank you, bro.

139
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,690
A phone is also okay!

140
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,530
Bros!

141
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,820
Bro!

142
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,490
Bro!

143
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,310
Lately, we students are prompted to go beyond our school.

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,310
To approach Nature.

145
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,950
To feel Nature.

146
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,560
To conquer Nature.

147
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,760
So we have to use our valuable learning time

148
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
to spend a vacation on this beach.

149
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,580
Now, you guys can enjoy your time.

150
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:39,600
Sit down.
Now, you guys can enjoy your time.

151
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,460
Sit down.

152
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,300
Look at the sea.

153
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,020
Take a picture.

154
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,100
Done.

155
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,030
We together have spent a pleasant and wonderful time.

156
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,720
Now, any one wants to continue sightseeing?

157
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,830
Then you can go back home learning.

158
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,010
Thank you, monitor.

159
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,530
Thank you, big boss.

160
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,130
Big boss!

161
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,350
What are you doing?

162
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,930
Pressing the shutter.

163
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,930
Recording this beautiful moment.

164
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,310
Is that necessary?

165
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,590
What do you know?

166
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,460
Where else can you see so many girls?

167
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,400
They're everywhere, aren't they?

168
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,410
I got this! I got this! I got this!

169
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,630
I got this! I got this! I got this!

170
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,490
I got this! I got this! I got this!

171
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,890
Look!

172
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,150
Can you play this or not?

173
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,600
You got this.

174
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,110
You like catching the ball.

175
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,770
What did you mean?

176
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,390
Nothing.

177
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,430
I just feel that you have no team spirit.

178
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,680
Why shouldn't I catch it when I can?

179
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,510
If you don't let your teammates join you,

180
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,340
no matter how awesome you're,

181
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,850
a hundred wins won't help.

182
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,330
It's enough if I can beat you.

183
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,060
-Give it a try.
-Are we done?

184
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,620
How about we go eat something first?

185
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,980
-No!
-No!

186
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,050
Let's go.
Do you have the nerve to play again?

187
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,610
I'm in.

188
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,770
Just try me.

189
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,570
Sea wind blows the fine sands,

190
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,570
along with my thoughts.

191
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,800
Who can listen to me talking about
a love that can't be answered back?

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,920
So let this drift bottle...

193
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,880
Go into the waves.

194
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,370
With my youth.

195
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,930
Drifting and drifting.

196
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,950
Can it drift into my love's heart?

197
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,900
But, I know.

198
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,460
This is just a fallacious dream.

199
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,440
The ocean is so vast.

200
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,300
But his heart...

201
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,340
More ruthless than this ocean.

202
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,880
This little drift bottle...

203
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,860
Will soon be swallowed by the deepness.

204
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,730
Diving and diving.

205
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,230
Sea wind blows the fine sands.

206
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,890
Brings a little drift bottle to me.

207
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,720
Is it the kismet? Or fate?

208
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,070
Although I don't know its owner,

209
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,870
yet everything in this letter,

210
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,140
betrays the writer's sensitivity.

211
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,840
I hope all the lovers can marry each other.

212
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,260
I hope the world will be in peace forever.

213
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,260
Little drift bottle.

214
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Can you return to your owner under the help of waves?

215
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,350
Tell her.

216
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,000
At the other end of this boundless ocean,

217
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,540
there's someone,

218
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,520
sharing the same thoughts with her.

219
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,740
Who's that? Who wrote me back?

220
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,700
Is it the kismet? Or fate?

221
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,620
Does God really grant my wish?

222
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,560
Is there really a miracle in this world?

223
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,550
Is it... Is it...

224
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,670
Miss Xinyi, you're also taking a sunbath?

225
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,100
Once upon a time...

226
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,050
There was a very heinous ghost.

227
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,900
It only ate KFC...

228
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,080
Once upon a time.

229
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,680
There was a ghost with a pathetic life story.

230
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,980
Every time it went to scare people.

231
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,650
Ended up being spooked.

232
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,610
Three rounds. Two wins decides the winner.

233
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,610
Twenty-one throws in total.

234
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,790
Today we'll see which one of us is the winner.

235
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,550
Be my guest.

236
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,800
I won't lose to you.

237
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,470
Me, neither.

238
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,360
Well, why do we have to be enemies?

239
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,710
I don't know, either.

240
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,540
Are we still good brothers?

241
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,670
For a lifetime.

242
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,160
Well, where are Shanqi and Xiaodong?

243
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,320
Shanqi had a sunstroke.

244
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,320
Xiaodong went back with her.

245
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,250
Shanqi, are you alright?

246
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,110
Still feel dizzy.

247
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,110
Let I get you an ice bag?

248
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,450
Okay.

249
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,480
Your forehead feels hot.

250
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,540
Why is your face so red?

251
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,930
Because of the sunstroke.

252
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,930
I failed to catch that.

253
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I failed to catch that.

254
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,910
You failed to catch that, what the heck?

255
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,070
What makes you so weak?!
Even I am better than you!

256
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,160
Try again!

257
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,980
Sorry, I failed to catch that.

258
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,050
It's okay. Believe yourself, you can do it.

259
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,890
Ye Muxi.

260
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,570
Seemingly we're neck and neck.

261
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,340
But in this competition, you're bound to lose.

262
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,130
By winning this competition,

263
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,930
I'm gonna make you realize the importance of teamwork.

264
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,390
For your teammate's failure,

265
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,910
you always criticize him, deny him.

266
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,910
But when my teammate fails,

267
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,460
I'll encourage him.

268
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,460
As time passes by,

269
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,270
my team's cooperation and team spirit

270
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,900
will become stronger.

271
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,100
While your team's morale,

272
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,610
will become weaker.

273
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,860
If it goes on like this,
the gap between us will...

274
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,860
Remain unchanged!

275
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,950
With morale or not, we're both being undermined!

276
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,400
I've ignored their inability!

277
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,740
You've proved that you're useless!

278
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,700
Gosh, playing with the sand here?

279
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,700
The final try, I'll do it myself!

280
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,330
I'm really sorry.

281
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,010
Yes!

282
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,940
Yes! We win!

283
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,220
Gives me sense of accomplishment!

284
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,660
Have you learned the lesson?

285
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,660
What lesson? You played by yourself.

286
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,800
You lost anyway.

287
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,990
I didn't.

288
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,370
What did you mean?

289
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,650
You hit the line.

290
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,630
What did you mean?

291
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,740
You hit the line.

292
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,150
It's inside the line.

293
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,850
Outside.

294
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,500
Inside.

295
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,390
Outside.

296
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,420
Are you trying to deny it?

297
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,760
Always do this since childhood.

298
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,770
Aren't you childish?

299
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,880
You're childish.

300
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,640
-What do you want?
-What do you want?

301
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,610
Parroting me?

302
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,690
Parroting you?

303
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,450
Why parroting me?

304
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,640
I dare you do that again.

305
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,660
Okay.

306
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,980
Will you admit your loss?

307
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,800
No.

308
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,280
Okay. Let's have another competition.

309
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,590
The best of three.

310
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,390
Okay.

311
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,280
The one who loses will eat sands.
No problem.

312
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,330
-Drink seawater.
-No problem.

313
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,510
Okay. Another competition.

314
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,240
Okay.

315
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,260
The best of three.

316
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,760
Okay.

317
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,660
Twenty throws in each round.

318
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,360
Okay.

319
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,770
Let's leave first.

320
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,670
Let's go.

321
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,770
At last, the ghost...

322
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,730
Finally found a ghost who was the same as it.

323
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,440
They lived happily together ever after.

324
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,200
No longer felt lonely.

325
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,180
Open the door. Mr Ye wants to go out.

326
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,100
Thirty-eight to thirty-nine.

327
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,100
Where are they?

328
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,160
It seems that they've left.

329
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,240
Some people feel nothing before winning or lose.

330
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,610
Yes. People who are not serious are the most annoying.

331
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,480
Take this!

332
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,930
Thirty-nine to thirty-nine.

333
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,650
Come on! I'm not afraid of you!
