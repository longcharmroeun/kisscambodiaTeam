It seems that he's a genius.

72
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,630
He can get the test paper that's barely disclosed.

73
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,460
And give standard answer.

74
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,540
At last, he sells it to all the students at a very low price.

75

Actually, no.

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,720
we'll find it out from the textbook.

188
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,940
Then we'll teach you directly.

189
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,750
It's definitely more effective than
rote learning that students normally do.

190
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,000
For example, me.

191
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,060
I come from the Northern Expedition Memorial.

192
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,460
That's my setting.

193
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,770
Yes. Yes.

194
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,590
Listen.

195
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,010
We know all the literature about the Three Kingdoms Period.

196
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,490
Back in the period, we were praised as the Twin Stars.

197
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,710
The cleverest two persons in the Three Kingdoms.

198
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,030
Here, more. Come. Come.

199
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,590
Hi, I'm Li Lei.

200
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,930
How are you?

201
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,930
I'm fine, thank you. And you?

202
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,480
These two are more awesome.

203
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,490
Even though they're retired now,

204
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,030
but they together have dominated the English textbooks for years.

205
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,690
And this.

206
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,240
Our country is taken even mountains and rivers remain unshaken.

207
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,960
When spring comes here, nothing but weeds grow wildly everywhere.

208
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:53,240
The loom goes on creaking; at the door Mulan is weaving.

209
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,170
Yezi, don't worry.
We will help you a lot!

210
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,110
So great to have you guys around!

211
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,110
I shall no longer worry about my scores!

212
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,590
Ye Muxi's Wolong and Sima, what they've got,

213
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,470
in fact, totally overlaps with what she has learned.

214
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,620
They can't help anything

215
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
when it comes to improving her scores.

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,850
It takes time for her to realize this point.

217
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,290
Hi, director Yan.

218
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,940
Director Yan.

219
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,410
I still haven't found the source of the answer.

220
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,000
Never mind. Never mind.

221
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,400
This is kinda a victory for this phase.

222
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,400
Keep this name list.

223
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,160
Students who scored zero in today's test are all here.

224
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,360
Post it up in our school's bulletin board tomorrow morning.

225
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,040
Punish them and detain them for further observation.

226
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,100
Okay.

227
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,690
This is called 'kill one as a warning to the others'.

228
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,670
Those troublemakers never try their best to study.
Their days are numbered.

229
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,550
Okay. Director Yan.

230
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,640
Guan, here is another thing.

231
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,230
Tomorrow afternoon.

232
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,549
There's a municipal Education Level Assessment Test.

233
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,170
A pretty important test.

234
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,170
What can I do for you, then?

235
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,979
This test.

236
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,630
Relates to our teachers' levels of education.

237
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,510
So, I hope you can try your best to get the first place.

238
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,399
To win glory for our school and me.

239
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,510
Okay?

240
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,650
Okay.

241
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,080
Good luck.

242
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,500
Thank you, director Yan.

243
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,120
You also ride bike today?

244
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,990
What a coincidence. I ride bike, too.

245
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,040
How about we go home together?

246
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,640
No need. I've got something else. Excuse me.

247
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,560
Liao Danyi, why are you so arrogant?

248
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,500
Miss Xinyi!

249
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,630
Miss Xinyi.

250
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,230
Didn't expect that you can ride bike, too.

251
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,520
Bravo, Miss Xinyi!

252
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
What's the big deal?

253
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,470
For me, it's not hard at all.

254
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,880
Do you have something else?

255
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
If no, I shall leave first.

256
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,210
Miss Xinyi, let me walk you home.

257
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,000
Whatever.

258
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,200
Miss Xinyi, wait for me!

259
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,110
Danyi, sorry for keeping you waiting.

260
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,060
This is a test for tomorrow.

261
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,700
Make sure that it's done.

262
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,970
Where are they?

263
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,870
Didn't they say that they're gonna sell the answer here?

264
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,090
Where have they gone?

265
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,710
Well...

266
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,650
We're here for the answer.

267
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,840
Where is our answer?

268
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,920
Take it out.

269
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,970
-Let go.
-Gimme.

270
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,560
Gimme. Gimme.

271
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,820
Stop running!

272
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,920
Can't be like this forever.

273
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,710
We gotta find a helper.

274
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,770
A top student?

275
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,680
Let's go.

276
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,450
Go.

277
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Liao, do us a favor.

278
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,510
Brother Liao. Brother Liao.

279
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,640
Don't leave.

280
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,960
Please hear us out.

281
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,290
In fact it's more than a favor.

282
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,620
We're including you in a good deed!

283
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,040
Will you join us?

284
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,760
Brother Liao. Brother Liao.

285
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,820
Look, don't know whom we've offended lately.

286
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,140
We... Failed to sell out anything!

287
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,590
So impoverished.

288
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,440
Brother Liao, what you'll do is to save life!

289
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,170
We even can't afford our breakfast now.

290
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,550
Come to see me again after I'm done with running.

291
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,670
Ruthless.

292
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,930
Heartless.

293
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,930
Cool!

294
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,780
I'm starved.

295
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,710
Stop faking.

296
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,590
So ruthless.

297
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,200
So heartless.

298
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,200
Let's go.

299
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,570
Okay. I'm home.

300
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,740
Miss Xinyi.

301
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,270
This is your home?

302
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,040
Bravo, Miss Xinyi.

303
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,730
Thank you for walking me home.

304
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,790
No problem.

305
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,670
Miss Xinyi!

306
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,380
I will always support you!

307
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,750
After the emergency today,

308
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,090
we've lost our allowance for half a month!

309
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,440
What emergency?

310
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,430
Answer to this morning's test is so irrelevant.

311
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,980
Shouldn't I return all the money to them?

312
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,280
But it's not our fault.

313
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,700
Because they're so foolish that they
didn't realize the test paper had been changed.

314
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,960
Understandable.

315
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,150
They believed us too much.

316
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,680
But they filled in the blanks with A B C D.

317
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,890
Just because they believed us too much?

318
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,390
We were entrapped. Who the hell is the spy?

319
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,090
Hard to say.

320
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,530
After all, you've sold it to so many people.

321
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,120
Could it be you?

322
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,510
I think it's you.

323
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,220
Bro!

324
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,160
Coming.

325
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,300
Arena of Valor coaching?

326
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,860
Full set of LOL champion skins?

327
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,860
QQ coin twenty percent off?

328
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,430
World of Warcraft on sale?

329
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,460
The answer?

330
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,730
Answer sells really well.

331
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,140
Isn't that Liao Danyi?

332
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,670
A top student.

333
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,300
Let's go.

334
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,410
Go.

335
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,220
In fact, it's very simple.

336
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,560
Finish the test.
Then give us the answer.

337
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,380
Money-coming. With huge profits.

338
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,770
Okay. But on one condition.

339
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,990
What's that?

340
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,460
Don't tell anyone that I did this.

341
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,340
Deal.

342
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,790
Nice cooperation.

343
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,480
Ruthless.

344
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,110
Heartless.

345
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,970
Cool!

346
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,470
Everyone, be alert around the clock.

347
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,190
This time, we must catch Answer.

348
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,070
President, how shall we work respectively?

349
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,860
That problem...

350
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,860
He Lvxi will explain it to you later.

351
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,840
Where's He Lvxi?

352
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,470
Where's He Lvxi?

353
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,830
He Lvxi.

354
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,570
Xinyi. Xinyi. Invincible Xinyi!

355
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,510
President. President. Formidable president!

356
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,940
May our dear Miss Xinyi live long and depart from the world!

357
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,710
Depart... From the world?

358
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,770
What the heck?

359
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,400
It should be... Keep pace with the times and stay different.

360
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,060
Shine forever like the sun and the moon!
Vie with Heaven in altitude!

361
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,980
Miss Xinyi, happy birthday!

362
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,150
Happy birthday what?

363
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,460
But... But isn't it your birthday today?

364
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,140
How could I not know my birthday?

365
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,750
But it reads 'birthday' on your calendar.

366
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,750
I got it.

367
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,750
You don't want to occupy our work time?

368
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,830
So dedicated.

369
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,270
Shouldn't we applause to that?

370
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,890
He Lvxi.

371
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,970
What's up, Miss Xinyi?

372
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,560
Look at my mouth.

373
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,970
Miss Xinyi.

374
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,660
I didn't hear you. Please say it again.

375
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,630
Out!

376
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,370
You may go there first.

377
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,280
That idiot.

378
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,260
The 'birthday' marked is not mine.

379
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,640
But his.

380
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,080
You're here.

381
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,300
What's the matter?

382
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,180
Nothing.

383
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,770
I gotta do homework.

384
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,960
Please leave if there's nothing else.

385
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,480
There's... There's something.

386
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,190
Someone's selling answers in our school.

387
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,670
But I haven't got a chance to prove that.

388
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,270
Huang Nan and Huang Yi are in your class, right?

389
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,640
So I want to...

390
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,770
None of my business.

391
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,470
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

392
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,570
Okay.

393
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,640
I can help you.

394
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,700
Anything else?

395
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,770
Guan Xinyi.

396
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,140
You really don't have anything else?

397
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,410
What brought you here?

398
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,160
Can't ask you out if there's nothing else?

399
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,050
Excuse me, then.

400
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,500
Some official business.

401
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,090
This is the answer for tomorrow's test.

402
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,840
How did you get this?

403
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,440
Director Yan gave it to me.

404
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,190
But the answer is fake.

405
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,190
What did you mean?

406
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,820
Whoever follows the answer tomorrow,

407
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,240
will get zero point.

408
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,350
So you may give it to Huang Nan and Huang Yi.

409
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,050
How long will it take before this ends?

410
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,360
You said, only three days.

411
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,760
But another three days after that...

412
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,500
If it keeps going on like this,

413
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,440
Ye Muxi will be doomed to get worse scores.

414
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,720
Soon. It'll end soon. Don't worry.

415
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,470
Excuse me, then.

416
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,940
Happy birthday.

417
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,620
Thank you.

418
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,110
You're here.

419
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,810
You're really something.

420
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,230
After only an hour. So fast.

421
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,350
I knew we're right to ask you for help.

422
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,410
In this world, I only admire three people.

423
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,820
The first one, Bill Gates.

424
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,770
The second one, Buffett.

425
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,630
The third one, should be Jobs.

426
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,200
But now I think should be you, must be you.

427
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,930
It's not right.

428
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,950
Why is threre one page less?

429
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,530
I also want to ask you about that.

430
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,730
What did you mean?

431
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,990
The test paper you gave me...

432
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,140
The last two questions are missing.

433
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,950
How did you know that?

434
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,280
There should be one hundred and fifty points in total.

435
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,780
It's written on the front page.

436
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,780
But it turns out less than one and thirty points.

437
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,910
That's impossible.

438
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,040
Where did you get the test paper this time?

439
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,090
Did you get the wrong one?

440
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,840
Impossible.

441
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,810
We stole this test paper from director Yan's office.

442
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

443
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,500
How about this. I'll leave first.

444
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,690
If you find the last two questions,

445
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,520
send me a picture.
