1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,648
Xinyi, be careful.

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,064
Senior, this Flirting Swordplay is so exhausting.

3
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,960
Can we quit?

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,248
Every move needs to flirt with the eyes.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,784
That's truly tiring.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,744
How about we practice Everlasting Love Swordplay?

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,536
Everlasting Love Swordplay?

8
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,056
I'm afraid you won't be able to hold it.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,928
Don't you remember that night in the mountain

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,224
when we were practicing Hot love Fist.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,160
If I didn't try my best to resist.

12
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:01,184
I'm afraid we would made some huge mistakes.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,040
Come on,

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,464
I was the one resisting you.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,032
Don't talk nonsense.

16
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:19,024
Tell me, do you really love me with your all heart?

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,864
Of course.

18
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:22,784
Since I came here when I was seven.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,952
I have never seen another girl.

20
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:28,096
Why wouldn't I love you?

21
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,632
What if you see other women.

22
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,480
Will you stop loving me?

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,976
I'm not a dandy.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,168
Of course I'll love you.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
Excuse me, may I ask where is the Maple Leaf Middle School?

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,632
Hey, why are you ogling him?

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,824
Listen, we've been engaged, he is my man!

28
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:00,816
I didn't ogle him.
He is ogling me.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,920
Who wants to look at him?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,288
I don't care if it's you ogling him or he ogling you.

31
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,072
You're not allowed to look at him.
Look at me if you want.

32
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,192
I've been watching you for decades.

33
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:13,168
This doesn't matter.

34
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,496
Miss, May I ask why do you want to go to Maple Leaf Middle School?
Don't answer.

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,816
Don't ask.

36
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,152
I want to answer.

37
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,344
I need to see director Yan.
Do you know where he is?

38
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:25,584
Don't answer!

39
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:31,600
Thanks.

40
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:33,024
Please.

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,552
Please.

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,976
What?

43
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,360
She said please, so I said back.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
Why did she say that? Does she love you?

45
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,080
I don't know why she did that.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,160
Then do you love her?

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
I don't love her, sis.

48
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,224
I don't believe you!

49
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:54,752
Where're you going?

50
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:55,584
To disfigure her.

51
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,448
# Head held high, stride forward #

52
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,672
# Dream big, break the limits #

# Sunlight, goes into our coat #

# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

59
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:31,184
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

60
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:35,472
# Waiting, the signal for running #

61
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,480
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,800
# After class, we laugh and sing #

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,912
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #

77
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:45,408
Episode 28

78
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,040
Liao Danyi.

79
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,152
Sorry, I'm reviewing.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,968
I'm here not because of some personal things.
It's for official business.

81
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:04,608
I heard some students say that
students of Class Ten didn't dress properly according to the rules.

82
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,216
I hope as a member of class committee
you can correct them.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,992
Sorry, I didn't know about this.

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,008
Xiaodong, one of my friends is your big fan.

85
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:22,352
She wants to see your concert.

86
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:23,872
Can you get her a ticket?
No problem, I'll settle that.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,592
Thanks.

88
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,680
Ke'er is dressing the uniform style.

89
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,352
Xiaodong is wearing the shirt of the uniform.

90
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,064
I don't think it's inappropriate.

91
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:42,170
Let's go. Let's go.

92
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,424
You're away too far.

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,064
I see.

94
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,080
It's just I'm the commissary in charge of studies.
You should talk to our monitor.

95
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,232
Your dress is so beautiful!

96
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:00,910
-You really think so?
-I like this line.

97
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,688
And the heart shape is so cute.
Right, so cute.

98
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,360
Yeah, I agree.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,120
You look like the super model.

100
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:20,928
I see the severity here.

101
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:22,592
I will deal with it.

102
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:32,944
As the commissary in charge of studies,
I shouldn't host this committee meeting.

103
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,128
So, don't.

104
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,360
But there's some problems have to be mentioned.

105
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,536
Don't, then.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
And it's very obvious.

107
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,128
I don't see it.

108
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,232
It's our uniform.

109
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,632
Any problem?

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,856
Our school uniform is for us to wear it in school.

111
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,840
But some students are wandering in school in some strange clothes.

112
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,472
What will other students think about it?

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,776
This is the school uniform.

114
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,248
We only changed it a little.

115
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,888
See? School badge.

116
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,992
You call this "changed it a little"?

117
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,008
It's totally different apparel, okay?

118
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,672
Only Xiaodong kept his school uniform shirt.

119
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,616
Ke'er is still wearing the school uniform.

120
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:32,608
As for the others, Huang Nan, Huang Yi, Zhu Shanqi,

121
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,816
what you're wearing has nothing to do with our uniform.

122
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:38,944
What're you talking about? Okay.

123
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:40,432
No more words.

124
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:43,648
We have our reasons.

125
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
What is that?

126
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:49,696
The school uniform is too ugly.

127
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,544
No, I think it's good.

128
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,512
I... I think it's pretty.

129
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,352
It's the most beautiful clothes I've ever had.

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,648
See?

131
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,232
Why they can wear it, but you can't?

132
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,264
Let me tell you why.

133
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,528
Because you're so low, we're high fashion.
We have youth, we have fashion.

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,128
What do you have?
Rustic. You rustic.

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,112
We're so fashion.

136
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,736
Youth, shining.
Fashion.

137
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,744
We're so high fashion, right?
Put it on!

138
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,543
Easy, easy, easy.
Put it on!

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
You're always like this.

140
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,632
You hooligan! Hooligan!
Big boss.

141
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,040
Now it's our Class committee meeting.

142
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,568
I won't argue with you.

143
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,632
Since we have different opinions.

144
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,288
Let's solve this in a fair and democratic way.

145
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:58,768
Let's vote.

146
00:09:01,744 --> 00:09:02,680
Vote?

147
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,088
So boring. Gosh.
Listen, if we have dissenting opinions.

148
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,280
Solve it by fist.

149
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,408
I don't know how to answer you.

150
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,768
Since people who want to wear the uniform and who don't are the same.

151
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,720
There's no point in voting.

152
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,000
How about this.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,152
Let's play a game.
The losers will obey.

154
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:30,464
That's right.

155
00:09:32,224 --> 00:09:33,168
What game?

156
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:34,544
I have an idea.

157
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,352
Xue Xiaodong suggested we solve it by competition.

158
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:44,976
And he also suggested a nice competition mode.

159
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,320
Live CS.

160
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,856
That's right.

161
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:50,496
Everything was leaded by that suggestion.

162
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,080
That incident

163
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,384
was called Class Ten Civil War Incident later.

164
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,240
As a person who experienced it.

165
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,256
I'll do my best to reproduce that horrifying day.

166
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:06,016
Today, this Uniform War's purpose

167
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,944
is to determine how we'll wear our school uniform in future.

168
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,200
It's also a thing which indicates the justice and democracy of our class.

169
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,248
So I hope you can deal with it rationally.

170
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:18,416
At last,

171
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,152
Be safe.

172
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:21,936
Yes!

173
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:24,432
Annihilate them at all costs!

174
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,896
Have you had it enough?
Yes!

175
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,432
We have our right to choose what kind of clothes and shoes we wear.

176
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,400
To choose our hair style and makeup.

177
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,016
Fire it up!
Liao Danyi you bastard!

178
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,808
You'll be killed today, fire it up!

179
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,736
Go! Go! Go!

180
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:43,232
Wipe them out! Skin them alive!

181
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:45,392
Wipe out their heart and drink their blood!

182
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:46,864
Come on!

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,288
Ke'er, that's too bloody. Under eighteen restricted.

184
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:58,208
At that time,

185
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,952
neither of them had realized

186
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,424
it's a seesaw battle way beyond their estimate.

187
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:06,576
Don't know it's a coincidence or god's plan.

188
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,264
Two teams were neck and neck.

189
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,296
Once the first bullet was fired.
They were both on a close-quarter bloody battle which was too late to mend.

190
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:20,512
Now, as the writer of this biography.

191
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,960
Allow me to introduce the strong fighters of both team.

192
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:28,128
First of all, myself.

193
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,056
Who vowed to protect the school uniform.

194
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,736
Xiong Tiancheng.

195
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,696
Back then, I would never join this kind of thing.

196
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,296
Because I was a loner.
I couldn't even take care of myself.

197
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,656
The only thing I'm proud of is my article.

198
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,648
Which was wrongly used when I initially joined our class.

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,512
Until I met a teacher who appreciates my talent,
and our monitor who seems quite careless.

200
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,360
Then I started to change.

201
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:06,352
With the help of the monitor and our classmates

202
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,336
I changed my imagine.

203
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,040
And started to try to blend in.

204
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:15,280
Just because now I see myself as a member of class Ten,

205
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,872
I decided to devote myself in this vital moment.

206
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,976
Just shoot me.

207
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:56,064
I have sunstroke and sprained my ankle anyway.

208
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,504
I wanna go home.

209
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,552
Should we help Zhu Shanqi?

210
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,896
Is that a trap?

211
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,064
She seems so sincere, shouldn't be lying.

212
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,168
Let's go.

213
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,448
Come, come, celebrate!

214
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,008
Come on, give me five!

215
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,240
Xiaodong.

216
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,328
I want to invite you to eat ice cream after school.

217
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:34,592
Xiaodong.

218
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:37,744
I want to invite you to eat ice cream after school.

219
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,792
Mew Mew. Xiaodong.

220
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:54,640
Would you like to eat ice cream after school?

221
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,824
A kiss for you.

222
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,952
Mew Mew. Xiaodong.

223
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,832
Would you like to eat ice cream after school?

224
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:03,776
A kiss for you.

225
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:05,760
No, no, no.

226
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,520
Xue Xiaodong.

227
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:19,056
Wanna eat ice cream after school?

228
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:22,368
Xue Xiaodong.

229
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:26,080
Wanna eat ice cream after school?

230
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:38,448
Yo, Yo.

231
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,520
Xue Xiaodong, wanna eat ice cream tonight?

232
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:44,944
Yo, Yo.

233
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,064
Xue Xiaodong, wanna eat ice cream tonight?

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,128
What're you doing?

235
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,240
I want to invite Xiaodong to eat ice cream tonight.

236
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,856
So hemming.

237
00:14:58,224 --> 00:14:59,008
Xiaodong.

238
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:01,216
Zhu Shanqi wants to invite you to eat ice cream today.
Are you free? Will be waiting.

239
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,944
Is that a little mean?

240
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,800
-Maybe a little.
-Let me hear it.

241
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,464
Xiaodong.

242
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:14,656
Zhu Shanqi wants to invite you to eat ice cream today.
Are you free? Will be waiting.

243
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,528
I'll send him another.

244
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:22,464
Xiaodong, this is Ye Muxi.

245
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,184
Zhu Shanqi wants to invite you to eat ice cream today.

246
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
Are you free?

247
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,328
Xiaodong, this is Ye Muxi.

248
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:33,984
Zhu Shanqi wants to invite you to eat ice cream today.

249
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,392
Are you free?

250
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,440
[Ye Muxi] [Zhu Shanqi]

251
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,816
Luckily, we've many talented fighters.

252
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,568
Apart from me and our team leader,

253
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,304
There's also a heroine who is as good as any male great fighters.
Li Yao, kept the situation under control.

254
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,728
Li Yao, I'm gonna play basketball.

255
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:41,340
I'd like to.

256
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,120
You? You also like basketball?

257
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,216
Right, I like restive sport

258
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:47,696
That's so you.

259
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,696
Let's go.

260
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:58,736
Are you okay?

261
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,368
- I'm fine. 
 - Let me help.

262
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,640
[Li Yao]

263
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:16,128
Can't drop physical training in vacation as well.

264
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,528
Aerobic exercise is necessary.

265
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:50,400
As the both sides were fighting vigorously

266
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,872
Forces from beyond Class Ten have been drawn.

267
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,728
Monitor of Class One and their vice monitor He Lvxi
sneaked in the battlefield to help Liao Danyi shoot the enemy.

268
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,792
As for their motive... .

269
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,352
Miss Xinyi.
We're not from Class Ten.

270
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,336
Why came here?

271
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,832
To make sure they all will wear school uniform properly.

272
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,056
So we must fight this game.

273
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,216
Right, this thing has nothing to do with Liao Danyi.

274
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:20,704
Don't get me wrong.

275
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,232
Although she denies it

276
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,608
But I know that the monitor of Class One

277
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,192
carries a touch for Liao Danyi.

278
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,000
As a writer.

279
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:33,216
Must have the insight which others don't have.

280
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,536
You didn't see Liao Danyi today either, right?

281
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,320
Me too!

282
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,136
But you must be impatient.

283
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:46,736
You should think it this way.

284
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:48,624
You gave him a chance to date you.
He didn't come.

285
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,872
So that kind of man,

286
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,936
doesn't deserve your love.

287
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,936
So must quit him. Quit him.

288
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,648
Anything I can help with?

289
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,384
This is my favorite novel.

290
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:31,168
I want to lend it to you.

291
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,520
Why?

292
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,704
Don't ask why.

293
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,264
I'm looking forward to hear your feedback.

294
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:55,968
You really don't wanna know what I'm gonna say to you?

295
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,968
You already knew?

296
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:11,904
Are you pretending or you really don't know?

297
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,272
Sorry, I've to go.

298
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:21,024
As from now,

299
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,880
Don't think of Liao Danyi.

300
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,776
No Liao Danyi in your head.

301
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,008
Come, follow me.
Don't think of Liao Danyi.

302
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:28,064
Don't think of Liao Danyi.

303
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,664
Liao Danyi. Liao Danyi.
Don't think of Liao Danyi.

304
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,520
Liao Danyi. Liao Danyi.

305
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,416
Now all I can think is Liao Danyi!

306
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,872
What shall I do?

307
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,992
No, stop!

308
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,512
Enemy, on the slope.

309
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,272
Three enemies, two hundred meters away.

310
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,192
Got him.

311
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,192
Two enemies up there.

312
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,992
Two.

313
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:37,904
Guan Xinyi's joining

314
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:41,104
made the balance slide to one side for a short while.

315
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,432
But soon after that,

316
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:44,080
a forth side joined

317
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,872
and pulled the game back on balance.

318
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:49,440
Xue Xiaodong's broker, Annie.

319
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,536
Speaking of that...

320
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,032
An adult came to play with a bunch of kids.

321
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:55,568
She should be ashamed.

322
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,744
Seems broker has many free time.

323
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:01,632
After the war,

324
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,216
I interviewed her.

325
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,176
As the broker of Xiaodong.

326
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,536
I should be prepared to fight for Xiaodong at any time.

327
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,504
She said that.
[Annie]

328
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:36,912
[Xue Xiaodong]

329
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,440
Isn't that our classmate Liu Ran?

330
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,984
What a coincidence.

331
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,664
What kind of tricks are you playing?!
Nothing.

332
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:48,336
Just thinking

333
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:50,608
The world is so small.

334
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,960
I saw you shared an ice cream

335
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,632
with a male senior student in an amusement park.
Today, here you are.

336
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:01,408
Stop talking nonsense!

337
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,376
Sorry to tell you that

338
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,568
That image is so touching.

339
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:07,440
So I took a picture of that.

340
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,712
I didn't expect.

341
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:11,440
After you ate the ice cream

342
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,032
you two dare to do this?
I feel so...

343
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,368
What did you do?

344
00:27:21,328 --> 00:27:22,880
Liu Ran, what picture?

345
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,936
Liu Ran, don't!

346
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:28,224
Liu Ran, don't!

347
00:27:30,912 --> 00:27:32,160
That voice...

348
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,424
Aren't they our classmates Fu Xiao and Zuo Zuo?

349
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,160
And fatty.

350
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,888
What a shame.

351
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,544
I have three other pictures.

352
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:49,232
Let's go.

353
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:55,040
[Huang Nan][ Huang Yi]

354
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:59,552
I heard you're our new commissary in charge of sports?

355
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:03,008
I heard your speed is quite shocking.

356
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,120
Let's race.

357
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,248
Okay, let' go out and race.
No, let's flip our hands.

358
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,664
Okay.

359
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,128
Watch it. I'm gonna win.
My brother will win.

360
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,752
Ready?Go!

361
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,656
Cheng Ling.

362
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,872
You started a little too earlier.

363
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,368
You must have cheated. So cunning.

364
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:31,616
Right? Shen Wei.
I didn't see that.

365
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,192
Maybe, we can rewind?

366
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:42,784
Ready?
Go!

367
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,216
Seems I underestimated you.

368
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:53,200
Come on, one more round.

369
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,912
That's the reason.
Now the warm up is over.

370
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,960
Ready? Go!

371
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,928
Interesting.

372
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,696
Interesting.

373
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,496
Huang Nan, you...

374
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,576
Is this the flip hands game?

375
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,600
Interesting.

376
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:28,048
Seems you need to hold this for me for a while.

377
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:32,944
Brother.

378
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:35,312
You wore such a heavy thing to compete?

379
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,592
No wonder you lost.

380
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,056
Now you're gonna win!

381
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,632
Ready? Go!

382
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:48,080
Be serious.
Use all you've got.

383
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,040
So can I.

384
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,800
I'm gonna use my secret weapon.

385
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
Finally, brother.

386
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,216
Ready? Go!

387
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:11,440
That's the whole point of the flip hands game?

388
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,496
What's the whole point?

389
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:18,176
Brother, I just realize that

390
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,456
did we forget to turn off our faucet?
Let's go home to turn it off.

391
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,728
No wonder you lost.

392
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:29,888
Because you were bothering by that.
Hurry, we need to turn the faucet off.

393
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:34,000
See you next time!

394
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,512
The war has begun.

395
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,736
No one can stay aloof from the affair.

396
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:17,712
What kind of future for Class Ten

397
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,784
would this battle about school uniform lead to?

398
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,776
Let's wait and see.
