1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,240
So,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,410
it's our last class in this semester.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,070
Keep studying hard during the vacation.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,580
Guys, this is your homework.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,190
Remember to do it back home.

6
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,700
Do we have to be so sentimental?

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,350
It's not our graduation after all.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,310
Just an ending of a semester.

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,310
See you in the next semester.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,670
Vacation!

# Sunlight, goes into our coat #

18
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,320
# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,110
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,810
# Waiting, the signal for running #

21
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,400
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,520
# After class, we laugh and sing #

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,780
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #

24
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,150
# On the way to the future #

25
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,120
# Thunder and storm won't matter #

26

# Dream big, break the limits #

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,820
# Blue sky, green campus (handsome lads) #

30
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,870

The Big Boss

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,130
Episode 23

40
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,020
I love you.

41
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,090
I love watching you smiling.

42
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,130
I love watching you being noisy.

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,340
I love you rushing into my world directly.

44
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,570
Ye Muxi, I love you.

45
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,540
Not that kind of love between friends.

46
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,880
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

47
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,190
[ A few hours ago ]

48
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,130
Performance lesson?

49
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,300
My company got an idol drama for me.

51
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,930
Have you watched the idol drama I performed?

52
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,610
They said I'm such a poor actor.

53
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,300
So my broker arranged me some Performance Lesson.

54
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,479
And told me to go.

55
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,090
Good. Work hard on it.

56
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,310
But my teacher told me,

57
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,580
I need a familiar and ethereal girl as my partner.

58
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,920
Ethereal? Me?

59
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,360
Forget it.

60
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,590
You're really not going?

61
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,260
I just feel that performance is not my thing.

62
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,920
It's too hard. I'm not in.

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,920
Fine.

64
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,070
If you're not going, I'm not going, too.

65
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,720
What should we do in such a good afternoon?

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,280
How about we go bodybuilding?

67
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,760
Tell me about the performance lesson.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,320
Where? And When?

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,280
Sit in the back row.

70
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,710
- I came first.
-Go.

71
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,850
Liao Danyi, you're also here
for the Mathematical Olympiad lesson?

72
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, we can see each other more during the vacation.

73
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,460
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

74
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:13,400
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

75
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,400
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.

76
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,730
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines.

77
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,550
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd.

78
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,000
Bravo! Completely perfect!

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,670
You're indeed a mentor who teaches many famous actors!

80
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,830
Bravo.

81
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,970
Shakespeare's sonnets.

82
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,970
My forever favorite.

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,360
You're recommended by director Famous?

84
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,280
Famous has briefed me on your situation before.

85
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,900
So, from now on,

86
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm your performance teacher.

87
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,310
My family name is Biao.

88
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,590
You can call me Miss Biao.

89
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,800
The famous Director's name is Famous.

90
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,210
So the Performance teacher's name must be Performance.

91
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,540
Little girl, what are you talking about?

92
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm not that shameless like director Famous.

93
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,280
Called himself Famous.

94
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,410
My full name is Beauty Biao.

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,930
Famous sent me this script,

96
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,150
from which I've chosen two paragraphs. 

97
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,800
Now, you two perform for me.

98
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,660
So I can know your performance levels.

99
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,490
Here's a misunderstanding.

100
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,510
This little girl is here just for fun.

101
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Today, I brought my superstar Xiaodong here

102
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,230
to attend your class.

103
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,670
So I can be his performance partner.

104
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,940
I also majored in performance.

105
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,510
Xiaodong. My dear Xiaodong.

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,570
I love you so much.

107
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,030
Why you always have tears in your eyes?

108
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,700
You're lightning. You're light.
You're the only miracle.

109
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,320
Annie, you... You gotta calm down.

110
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,080
No. No. I can't. I can't calm down.

111
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,550
Xiaodong! Xiao... Xiao...

112
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,790
Miss Biao, what are you doing?

113
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,510
Your performance is too exaggerating and dry.

114
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,580
You need moistening.

115
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,890
Flunk. Flunk. Flunk.

116
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,630
Out. Out. Out.

117
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,650
Xue Xiaodong, you're like a blank sheet.

118
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,180
You don't need her. She doesn't deserve it.

119
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,280
I need a sincere performer.

120
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,050
That little girl.

121
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,050
Come and give it a try.

122
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,670
In fact, I'm pretty interested in performing.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,850
Performing is very hard.

124
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,280
Not as easy as you thought.

125
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,580
It's something that we should revere.

126
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,080
First of all, clear your mind.

127
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,000
Done.

128
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,560
Recite the lines.

129
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,560
Done.

130
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,130
Be ready for the role as soon as possible.

131
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,720
I've heard that there was a kind of bird

132
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,640
with no legs.

133
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,560
It could fly and fly only.

134
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,570
When it got tired,

135
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,100
it slept in the wind.

136
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,320
This kind of bird could land only once,

137
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,510
that was the time it died.

138
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,790
We broke up right on the April Fools' Day.

139
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,280
I was convinced that she was joking with me.

140
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,860
I bought thirty cans of pineapple.

141
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,210
Because it's her favorite food.

142
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,780
I told myself...

143
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,390
Those cans of pineapple were to expire on May 1st.

144
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,760
May 1st is my birthday.

145
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,800
I told myself, if she won't show up on that day,

146
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,810
our love will expire, too.

147
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,240
Am I right?

148
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,870
Is that what you want?

149
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,650
Miss Biao, how is that?

150
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,470
Let's try a new paragraph.

151
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,840
In fact, I have so much to tell you.

152
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,140
I had a relationship before.

153
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,040
I... Loved him so much.

154
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,280
He also loved me so much.

155
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,710
Maybe we were not meant for each other.

156
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,970
Or I didn't cherish him well.

157
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,910
So many problems happened.

158
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,610
I always felt that I couldn't find someone

159
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,610
who could love me again.

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,580
But didn't expect that I would bump into you.

161
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,260
So I feel that it is meant to happen.

162
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,780
Do you have something to tell me?

163
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,720
How is that?

164
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,170
Try again.

165
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,510
Miss Biao, can I have a look at the lines?

166
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,860
So we...

167
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,620
From now on, we'll be friends for one minute.

168
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,170
You belong with me.

169
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,480
I belong with you.

170
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,260
For one minute.

171
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,020
Done.

172
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,960
A long time ago,

173
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,400
when one had a secret,

174
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,850
he would go deep into a mountain,

175
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,100
to find a big tree and dig a hole.

176
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,820
Then told his secret to that hole.

177
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,710
Then sealed it up with some soil.

178
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,370
In that way,

179
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,670
no one would know his secret.

180
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,160
Is that what you want?

181
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,970
Today, we brothers are gonna have an unprecedented

182
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,370
courageous challenge!

183
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,370
That girl. That girl.

184
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,000
Look, everyone.

185
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,530
That girl is taking a selfie.

186
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,450
And we're gonna go kiss her.

187
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,730
Let's go.

188
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Hello, sis.

189
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,790
Can I take a selfie with you?

190
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,640
Okay. Okay.

191
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,370
Okay.

192
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,460
I'll help you get him!

193
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,550
Stop!

194
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,490
Are you crazy?

195
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,640
Run! Hurry!

196
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,200
Our courageous challenge today

197
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,040
completed successfully!

198
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,850
Brother, she's coming!

199
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,830
Run! Run!

200
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,700
Run!

201
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,150
Stop!

202
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,540
Guan Xinyi.

203
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,330
You can solve this problem in this way.

204
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,330
Thank you.

205
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,470
How about you try to cry this time?

206
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,390
Because I'm leaving.

207
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,110
I gotta cry?

208
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,520
Yes...

209
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,290
Cry?

210
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,410
For example, I'm leaving you.

211
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,500
So you... You...

212
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,210
Let me feel your sadness.

213
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:59,710
If I leave you some day,

214
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,230
will you get me back?

215
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,850
I will.

216
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,730
What are you laughing at?

217
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,010
What are you laughing at? What's so funny?

218
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,550
Are you done with the song?

219
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,810
I gotta release the album in three days.

220
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,350
What my Xiaodong should do?

221
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,150
He gotta go to school.

222
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,260
If no red carpet at the newcomer award,

223
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,470
no solemn introduction,

224
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,620
no cooperation with Zhang Yimou,

225
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,860
I won't go there!

226
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,310
Can you see...

227
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,420
The biggest star?

228
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,900
If you're very capable,

229
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
can you pick it up for me?

230
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,880
Yes.

231
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,150
Well, when you make big money some day,

232
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,090
can you buy a big home for me?

233
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,060
Yes.

234
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,320
How about cars?

235
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,320
Yes.

236
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,970
It doesn't feel that way.

237
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,940
Let's try again.

238
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,939
No! No! No!

239
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,980
My Xiaodong performs really well.

240
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,500
I've never seen such a potential actor.

241
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,730
What the hell that little girl performs?

242
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,720
I can't bear it any more.

243
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,470
Even I perform better than she does.

244
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,300
I love you.

245
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,110
I'm willing to pick up the stars for you.

246
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,280
I'm willing to pick up the moon for you.

247
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,550
And then?

248
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,140
You're my only one.

249
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,650
I'm so bad at this, right?

250
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,110
It's okay. It's okay.

251
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,190
-Let's try again.
-Try again.

252
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,170
Okay.

253
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,020
I love you.

254
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,100
I'm willing to pick up the stars for you.

255
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,580
I'm willing to pick up the moon for you.

256
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,580
You're my only one.

257
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,940
Better?

258
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,090
A little.

259
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,970
I've told you!

260
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,030
No. No. We won't join it

261
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,690
if less than eight hundred thousand! Okay?

262
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,160
Okay. I got it.

263
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,510
Lion!

264
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,530
Gorilla!

265
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,910
Electric fan.

266
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,400
Electric fan?

267
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,230
Electric fan?

268
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,810
Liao Danyi.

269
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,930
You solved that problem very nicely.

270
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,880
I had a dad who loved me very much.

271
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,640
We often flew kites together.

272
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,640
With the whole family.

273
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,620
When I was four,

274
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,650
we flew kites in a very, very big park.

275
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,920
I believed that he led the way ahead of me.

276
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,990
I was running and running. But suddenly, I lost him.

277
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,410
Since then, he just disappeared.

278
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,850
As of that day, my mom got depression.

279
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,610
Went mad.

280
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,900
And then, when I was fourteen,

281
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,420
my mom passed away.

282
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,540
Since then, my brother started looking after me.

283
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,730
He worked hard every day.

284
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,010
He did various jobs.

285
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,570
And he studied very hard.

286
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,570
To get scholarships.

287
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,960
Then he could be admitted by a good school.

288
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,280
And took me there as well.

289
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,950
No more words. I gotta write.

290
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,210
Fight for my sister.

291
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,520
Ye Muxi. Ye Muxi.

292
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,520
For my sister. For my sister.

293
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm really happy to have such a brother.

294
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,260
But...

295
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,150
Sometimes I really want to know

296
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,750
how it feels to have dad and mom around.

297
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,150
My brother went working every day.

298
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,670
No matter how tiring it was,

299
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,440
whether he sweat or bled, when he came back home,

300
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
he will still smiled at me and said,

301
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,660
never mind, it's okay as long as you're happy.

302
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,660
Because we ran out of money,

303
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,970
we could only live in a twenty-square-meters house.

304
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,430
And...

305
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,920
We only had one bed.

306
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,020
So he slept on the floor.

307
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,180
I slept on the bed.

308
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,320
It's okay if he couldn't have enough meals.

309
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,910
As long as I was full, he would feel happy.

310
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,150
What?

311
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,950
Look at your bag, it's wide open.

312
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,480
Look nice when in school.

313
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,570
Sis, I must stop here.

314
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,260
Come, look what I have made for you.

315
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,940
Here, sit.

316
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,250
So many delicious food.

317
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,890
This is your favorite fried eggs with tomatoes.

318
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,080
A cold dish for you.

319
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,410
And a chicken.

320
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,700
Hurry, start eating.

321
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,790
Did... Did that old lady bully you again?

322
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,060
Tell me.

323
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,420
Here, I made a ginseng tea for you.

324
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,420
Drink it. Good for your brain.

325
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,390
When I make big money,

326
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,700
I'll take you to eat hot-pots all around the world!

327
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,990
I've been touched enough
since you can think that way and say that.

328
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,390
Later,

329
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,590
I met dad.

330
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,140
I found that he married another woman.

331
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,540
With other kids.

332
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,010
Although I hate him very much,

333
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,910
I still wish that he could be happy.

334
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,660
I feel that I'm living a happy life.

335
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,230
Very happy.

336
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,400
My only concern is that I have too many fans.

337
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,160
I'm afraid that they'll recognize me every time I go out.

338
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,110
Boring!

339
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,500
Try again.

340
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,010
That day we worked very late,

341
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,070
my broker sis Annie sent me some chicken soup.

342
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
Dull!

343
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,270
Try again.

344
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,630
That signing session...

345
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,090
Boring!

346
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,890
Look at your performance.

347
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,890
Look at Ye Muxi's.

348
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,890
Look at your eyes, so empty.

349
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,200
Confession of life can best mobilize an actor's emotions.

350
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,330
But look at you.

351
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,330
Where are your emotions?
Give me some.

352
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,400
Try again!

353
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,500
I can't. I can't.

354
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,420
I also need a break.

355
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,200
Listen, you're besieged!

356
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,530
Put down your arms and surrender!

357
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,820
I can spare you life.

358
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,570
Listen, I won't surrender!

359
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,590
Listen.

360
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,750
This is the final duel between you and me!

361
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,330
Only one of us will live!

362
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,080
You're dead!

363
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,080
Don't try me!

364
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,650
My bike is broken.

365
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,210
Lend yours to me.

366
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,480
Come and get me.

367
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,200
So naughty. Let me give you a ride.

368
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,250
My bike is broken.

369
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,700
Lend yours to me.

370
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,970
Come and get me.

371
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,480
What are you doing?

372
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,240
This is the final duel between you and me.

373
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,980
Cut the crap. Come on.

374
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,760
One.

375
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,290
Two.

376
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,670
Three.

377
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,650
Four.

378
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,490
Five!

379
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,800
What's wrong?

380
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,900
I find it so hard.

381
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,910
Why I can't make it till now?

382
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,580
Maybe I'm not a performance material.

383
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,120
I better be a little fatty.

384
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,310
Nonsense.

385
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,900
In fact it's very simple.

386
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,870
How did you make it?

387
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,310
I don't know, either.

388
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,640
Anyway, I think I should be natural.

389
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,760
And think about someone I care about.

390
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,760
Just the one I talked about, my brother.

391
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,620
I think you can do it when thinking about
the one you care about.

392
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,760
The one I care about?

393
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,650
What?

394
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,950
In fact, only Ye Muxi knows about this matter.

395
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,790
So, please help me keep it a secret.

396
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,470
When I was a kid, I was fat.

397
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,300
Very, very fat.

398
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,300
I had no friends.

399
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,500
Because they all mocked me, excluded me.

400
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,730
I was really angry back then.

401
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,840
I always vent my anger on my mother.

402
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,850
Because I thought it was all her fault.

403
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,920
She indulged me.

404
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,420
She made delicious food for me.

405
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,020
She made me become a big fatty.

406
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,850
A laughingstock.

407
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,290
One day, I had a fight with my classmates.

408
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,690
They said I was a pig.

409
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,520
I was furious.

410
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,740
When I went back home,

411
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,730
I found my mother had made
a table of delicious food for me again.

412
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,990
I was so angry that I turned the table over.

413
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,990
I shouted to her, crying.

414
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,330
It's all your fault.

415
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,170
You make me become a fat guy.

416
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,330
You make me disgusting. I hate you!

417
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,500
But mother didn't say anything.

418
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,770
She squat down quietly.

419
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,520
To clean up the dishes.

420
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,720
I... I was shocked.

421
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,990
Because I saw her tears.

422
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,980
That was my first time to see mother crying.

423
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,250
I always thought...

424
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,250
She's a very strong woman.

425
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,000
She always smiles to life.

426
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,860
I didn't expect that she would cry.

427
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,480
Since that day,

428
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,800
I find that mother smiles or cries all because of me.

429
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,100
It's been so many years.
But I still owe her an apology.

430
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,900
I love you.
