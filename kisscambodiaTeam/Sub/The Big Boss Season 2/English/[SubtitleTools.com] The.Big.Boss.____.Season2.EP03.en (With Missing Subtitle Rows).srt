Episode 21

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,830
Ye Muxi

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,980
You can not remember

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,780
When you were seven years old

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,400
I once had told you

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
the story of green teeth

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,940
I have a good news to tell you

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,020
a sequel

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to know, I'm not listening

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Yexi

40
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,040
You are dingling in the daytime

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Toss this and toss that

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,440
What's wrong with you ?

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No fever

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,750
Nothing wrong with your eyes

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,290
Let me check your pulse

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Come come come

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,480
Women is less safe and impatient

48
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,460
Hmm

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,320
There is a bit of irritability

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,780
Your face is a little bit

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
suspicious

52
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,040
But for me

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,500
I still have to persuade you

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,340
The rivers and lakes is so dangerous, stay at home is more secure

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,420
Do not say I and Danyi bad

56
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,280
We just want you to be safe, isn't it right?

57
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,400
You are muffled without a word

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,740
Is there any thoughts to talk about ?

59
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,920
How do you not talk to me

60
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,960
But also let the most annoying person

61
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,560
Live with us

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,540
I am 16 years old this year

63
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,140
Soon will be 17 years old

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,960
Plus a few months in mom's stomach

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,820
I am 18 years old

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,060
I am a woman

67
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,460
An adult woman

68
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,660
I can make my own choice

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,540
Make your own decisions

70
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,780
But you did not ask me

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,700
You did not think about my idea

72
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,540
You did not ask my decision

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,540
You're guilty because you don't care about me

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,240
And then count you are my brother

75
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,540
Have you ever thought about me

76
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,260
Wait wait wait

77
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,640
I am your brother

78
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,880
Am I not your brother ?

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,080
Of course it is a matter

80
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,420
How can I let you go out

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,660
One more thing

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,920
Danyi is also a kind, good hearted boy

83
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
He has some trouble

84
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
He come to live here

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,940
What's wrong?

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Do you know Danyi

87
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,440
Do you really know him?

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,660
Do you know him ?

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,420
Do you think you know him better ?

90
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,610
Have you ever been with him for ten years

91
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,120
Elementary, middle and high school

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,720
Do you have it?

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,220
No

94
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,840
I have!

95
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,060
Do you feel that

96
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,700
You know he has a lot of good habits

97
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Let's not talk about his good habits, since right now

98
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,240
he's living in our house let's talk about his bad habits

99
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,680
What if he comes to my room at night

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,030
What if I am bathing and he peeks then what do i do?

101
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,940
He is going to use my toothbrush, my blanket, my chair,

102
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
What if he uses my markers?

103
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,150
He can't use my markers! I cannot let this happen

104
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,980
What if he eats my snacks?? This cannot happen too

105
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,900
In addition, your room is there and his room is there

106
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Although it's so close, in one second

107
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,740
in that one second

108
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,710
in the one millisecond

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,760
what if in that second, he comes and kill me

110
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,450
he muffles my scream, you won't hear it

111
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,380
will you hear it? You won't!

112
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,510
Ok, what you have depicted is indeed very dangerous

113
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,120
and it embeds a lot of horror

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,600
From observing your actions

115
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,590
I can come up with a conclusion that

116
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,680
you are extra talkative today.

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,170
I want to leave home now. You don't care about me, I'm leaving now.

118
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,940
Robber and pervert

119
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,840
Maybe robbing is possible,

120
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,980
but pervert is definitely out of the picture.

121
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,590
You are thinking too much.

122
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
What do you mean?

123
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,050
Why did you enter my room? Get out.

124
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,610
I've been standing by your door for a long time,

125
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,630
just wanted to come in to say hi

126
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,560
I have my own privacy, don't you know that?

127
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,300
So if we can't tolerate one another,

128
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,490
we can't live together.

129
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,120
Mind you, this is not even a marriage, what are you talking about.

130
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,770
Dan Yi's house floor has some problems

131
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,840
you know this too, don't you?

132
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,390
Helping others is happiness,

133
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,980
you should know this!

134
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,940
Ok, I would say more, you settle the rest yourself

135
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,070
In addition,

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,530
Please believe me, I won't do anything bad to you.

137
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,590
You should give a criminal

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
What are you looking at?

139
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,370
What's wrong?

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,060
Why are you looking around my room? What's wrong with my room?

141
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,320
Listen to me,

142
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,750
no random person is ever going to enter your room

143
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,460
even they could, they wouldn't be able to leave

144
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,000
even the mosquitos can't enter, just rest assure.

145
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,280
My room is exceptionally perfect.

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,340
Come, come, Dan Yi, eat more, eat more

147
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
Dan Yi, eat more, eat more. Thank you, Yi Han

148
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,800
Thankfully you came into our house

149
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,190
otherwise you won't know how hard it is for me to wake Mu Xi up

150
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,090
need about 7 to 8 times of waking up.

151
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,680
The breakfast today is really good,

152
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,690
it has brought back the old times. So wonderful !

153
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,570
I'm so happy.

154
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,580
Of course, Dan Yi is now staying at our house

155
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,640
Your brother has to whip out some good dishes for him.

156
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,460
You culinary skills has really improved a lot.

157
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,810
Hurry eat, eat more. Don't scald your mouth.

158
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I can hear it,

159
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,380
you are trying to shut me up

160
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
do you have any hidden motive?

161
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,110
Is it after eating steamboat,

162
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,620
you don't want to wash the dishes?

163
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,380
What? Do I look like that kind of person?

164
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
I... I won't do that !

165
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,120
It's okay, you don't have to.

166
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,460
I have to pay the rent if I am living here,

167
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,300
but

168
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,010
I have already used finished last term scholarship money

169
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,130
What about this,

170
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,590
I will clean up the house to cover the rent.

171
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,160
This morning, I have cleaned the bathroom

172
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,450
I did simple packing

173
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,040
No wonder I felt that something was wrong.

174
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,170
I tell you, you shouldn't leave your toothbrush

175
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,000
lying on the top of the sink, you will get sick easily.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,050
I have always placed my toothbrush like this, but I have not fell sick

177
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,830
But that's because your immune system is strong,

178
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,560
but after a while you will definitely fall sick.

179
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,410
So what? I will put it wherever I like, don't touch my stuff

180
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,910
I am just putting your toothbrush into the cup.

181
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:49,830
How would you know if the soy sauce bottle likes lying down or standing,

182
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,340
and you are not it so you don't know what it likes.

183
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,130
Why is your debating skills so much better than your language skills.

184
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,530
but you still have to put your toothbrush into the cup

185
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,630
but

186
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,200
that's my toothbrush, I understand what it wants

187
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,130
it tells me that it likes lying down

188
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,700
it likes it, so what do I do, you understand?

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Ok, ok ok.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Stop quarelling.

191
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,850
Er, Dan Yi in this case

192
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,830
you just have to make sure that the house is clean.

193
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,840
The packing and arrangement aspect

194
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,450
I also can't do anything about it

195
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,120
But you don't have to worry,

196
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,740
I will credit you for your efforts.

197
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,230
To reward you, I have decided

198
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,340
that today I will buy you a

199
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,280
beanbag sofa so that you can sleep more comfortably.

200
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,180
Thank you Yi Han, bro.

201
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,650
But

202
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,040
if there are no used socks stuffed under the sofa

203
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,650
I think my quality of sleep will be much better.

204
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,670
You're right.

205
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,270
Come, come eat more.

206
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,290
But Yi Han bro, I think steamboats lack some nutrients

207
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:15,720
Tomorrow morning I will cook some red glutinous rice porridge

208
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,110
plus some salted eggs and red bean buns.

209
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,000
Tomorrow after school, I will go to the market

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,950
to buy the red dates.

211
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,740
These red dates are really good

212
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,200
super fragrant and sweet.

213
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,570
Dan Yi

214
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,120
you should have came to our house earlier

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,160
We welcome you, stay longer

216
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,420
Kill ! Kill !

217
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,390
Yes ! Yes ! Yes !

218
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,170
Stop it, stop it. Seat down.

219
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,130
Why are they up there?

220
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,150
Did you watch too many teen shows?

221
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,980
Walking on this street,

222
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,360
I feel so regenerated, filled with energy

223
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
and hence went up.

224
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,360
This is time when I unleash my usefulness

225
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,940
You both are not even close to reaching it.

226
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
How about this,

227
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,230
we climb onto one another.

228
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,540
Ok then you bend down,

229
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,770
I should be at the top.

230
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,090
You are a girl, if you are on top it is not very appropriate

231
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,540
That's right, so what should we do?

232
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,100
Ok ok I'll go down.

233
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,890
Good luck !

234
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,040
How about you come in front.

235
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,040
This is not very appropriate right

236
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,200
Forget it, forget it.

237
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Let me think first.

238
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,840
There's nothing that we can use to hit them down.

239
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,580
How about this, we use our bags to hit them down

240
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,940
Right?

241
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,600
Ok let me try first.

242
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,830
No use, no use.

243
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,250
Half an hour ago, it was still very clean here.

244
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,720
It's my house, I do what I like.

245
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,660
I say, Ye Mu Xi can you respect others effort

246
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,200
When did I not respect?

247
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,300
I have spent my efforts cleaning this place

248
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,680
Touch you neck and ask yourself do you have any conscience?

249
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,340
Of course I have.

250
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,580
If I have no conscience, look

251
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,140
I would have done this.

252
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,250
Pick it up,

253
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,190
Pick it up. No i won't.

254
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,990
Why are you childish, you better hurry pick it up

255
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,890
That is food, don't waste

256
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,030
I'm not wasting it

257
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
So actually cleaning up is such a simple thing to do.

258
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,780
Move away, move away.

259
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Move

260
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,910
Move

261
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,650
Make way.

262
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,580
Such a mess.

263
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,040
Where are my markers?

264
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,320
Why are the caps on?

265
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,420
Why are they on the markers?

266
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,970
LIAO DANYI

267
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
LIAO DAN YI !!!

268
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,890
Tell me what happened,

269
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,420
there's perfume smell on you

270
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,500
You definitely created trouble again

271
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,410
its the fault of your nose.

272
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,390
Speak properly, tell me exactly what happened.

273
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,530
I was just playing a joke on him.

274
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,280
A joke?

275
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,670
There must be a line to a joke right

276
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,520
It's for his good.

277
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,010
For his good? Stop talking nonsense.

278
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,800
I tell you

279
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,140
I tell you, Dan Yi this young man

280
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,160
is a guest in our house

281
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
how can you treat him like that ?

282
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,700
Ya right, Liao Dan Yi we really need you

283
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,910
Still talking back,

284
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,040
Dan Yi, you shouldn't leave

285
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,250
you are a guest that I invited to our house

286
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,440
Look, the past two days that you came

287
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,280
and I need to praise you

288
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,130
you have done a good job in cleaning the house

289
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,100
not only did you improve the environment of the house

290
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,960
and every time when I come home,

291
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,410
I always feel that this house is filled with youth energy

292
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,930
Ya that's right.

293
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,660
You shut up.

294
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,100
Dan Yi young man,

295
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,290
Mu Xi is just a little immature,

296
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,540
don't be petty.

297
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,910
She's just an immature young child,

298
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,650
that's right I'm just a young immature child

299
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,760
and there's also a big immature child, we both need you

300
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,510
Dan Yi young man, how about this,

301
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,410
just think of her as a fart,

302
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,420
just let her go, let her go that's it.

303
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,340
Brother, you.... you

304
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,160
You what you, Ye Mu Xi,  I'm telling you

305
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,820
hurry apologise to Dan Yi. Why should I?

306
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,840
Ok, fine you don't want to apologise is it?

307
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,420
I'm just an immature young child, I don't know anything.

308
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,290
Ok fine, you don't want to apologise?

309
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,400
I can't cure you, Ye Mu Xi I'm telling you

310
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,300
if you don't apologise, from tomorrow onwards,

311
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,120
steamboat will be cancelled, no more of it.

312
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,800
Steamboat??? You...

313
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,680
You what you. I tell you

314
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,160
tomorrow morning I will throw the hotpot away.

315
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,310
We won't be eating steamboat anymore.

316
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,670
The hotpot???

317
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,430
Our very own hotpot?

318
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,210
Did you even think about it, 6 years of relationship and you are letting it go because of him

319
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,170
How do we eat steamboat then?

320
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,240
We must eat steamboat ! Did you think about my feelings

321
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Ok ok I don't want to hear what you say

322
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,470
Steamboat!!

323
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,880
Come Dan Yi come here.

324
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,330
Really did you think about my feelings

325
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,200
You shut up. Ye Mu Xi, I'm telling you,

326
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,270
if you want to eat steamboat, I'll tell you one way

327
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,510
From today onwards, you be a good person

328
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,580
be gracious and kind

329
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,910
and

330
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,000
from today onwards, remember

331
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,700
you cannot disturb Liao Dan Yi normal way of life. You promise me.

332
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,940
Why should I promise you that? He is the one that is disrupting my life.

333
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,060
Let me tell you about my markers, the ones that I have to remove the caps before drawing

334
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,220
Every pen cap was placed on the markers

335
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,230
Do you know that everytime I have to open the pen caps,

336
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,290
all my inspirations just vanish like that. Do you know that being an artist,

337
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,240
must use a marker that gives me inspiration.

338
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,490
What do you want? I ask you do you know why those markers need to have caps?

339
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,600
Say it. That's because those caps are to prevent ink from evaporating

340
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,660
and extend their lifespan.

341
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,030
Even if I don't know,  do I need you to say it?

342
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,560
You don't even know how to cherish your materials,

343
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,160
confirm won't be able to draw beautiful drawings.

344
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,410
You have the guts to say that?

345
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,940
and then, and then what

346
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,460
Ok ok stop quarrelling.

347
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,110
You also take a chill pill,

348
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,590
Yi Han bro, I didn't want to quarrel with her.

349
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,760
but she's really too much

350
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,230
It's just drawing but when I opened her sketchbook

351
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,180
those drawings are practically a child's painting

352
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,260
Eh what you mean by a child's painting, do you even understand arts?

353
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,540
Do you know how to draw? You don't know how so of course you don't understand.

354
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,060
You didn't get my permission and

355
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,040
doodled on my textbooks. You still have to guts to say.

356
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,270
You even destroyed the umbrella that my best friend in elementary school gave me

357
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,040
Mu Xi, I have to reprimand you for this.

358
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,130
Why did you destroy his umbrella?

359
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,470
In addition, you didn't get my permission to change my pencil case

360
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,510
to a pink color one.

361
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,400
I really really really hate pink color

362
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,450
