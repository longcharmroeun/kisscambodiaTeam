Episode 22

31
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,640
Don't worry. I'll take the responsibility.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,900
I made you ill.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,340
So I'll take good care of you.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,940
Don't worry, I'll fix you.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,860
Hand.

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,370
What?

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,500
My hand...

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,060
What?

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,100
You're pressing my hand.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,020
Sorry.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,620
Liao Danyi.

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,970
Liao Danyi.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,500
Liao Danyi.

44
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,290
Liao Danyi.

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,120
Liao Danyi. You can't sleep!

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Liao Danyi. You can't sleep! You can't die!

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,970
You'll die in sleep.

48
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,480
Liao Danyi. Liao Danyi.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,220
I thought you were going to die.

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm not in a snowy mountain!

51
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,480
Ye Muxi.

52
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,240
I hate you.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,330
You want more water?

54
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,650
Okay, don't worry. I'll go get water.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,420
Okay. Wait, roger that.

56
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,480
Where is he?

57
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,450
Really? He has been burnt into ashes?

58
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,960
Feel better?

59
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,810
Much better.

60
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,200
God, do you still feel weak?

61
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,700
You scared me to death last night. Your high fever.

62
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,340
I sweat a lot last night.

63
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
My quilt is wet.

64
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,810
Sorry.

65
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,320
Thank you for taking care of me.

66
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,940
You're welcome.

67
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,100
Try some soup I made.

68
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,340
The millet is from Lvliang, Shanxi Province.

69
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,890
The soup you made is quite delicious.

70
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,080
It might not have been cooked thoroughly.

71
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,500
I will go boil it a little while.

72
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,050
Soup is good.

73
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,810
The elders like soup too.

74
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,620
But from my experience.

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Soup is not enough for the patient.

76
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,420
You also need some other food.

77
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,690
Come.

78
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,290
Eat this in three hours.

79
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,860
This one in six hours.

80
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,410
Before meal. After meal.

81
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,770
So attentive. That's unexpected.

82
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,980
I'm quite attentive, okay?

83
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,770
And you know what.

84
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,860
For things I like, I'll do my best.

85
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,400
That's true.

86
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,650
I made you ill.

87
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,840
So I'll apologize.

88
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Sorry.

89
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,400
Sorry.

90
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,970
That high fever makes me a little dizzy.

91
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,160
I forgot it.

92
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,690
That's great.

93
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,960
Who is that?

94
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
Huang Nan.

95
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,130
Huang Nan?

96
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,520
What day is it today?

97
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,080
I'm a patient.

98
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,500
How can I tell you?

99
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,780
Today is 16th, Sunday.

100
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,770
I might have promised them something.

101
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,900
What did I promise them?

102
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,490
How would I know?

103
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,420
They will come in.

104
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll go check.

105
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,530
No, no, no!

106
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,900
You go hide yourself.

107
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,340
Why would I do that?

108
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,770
Or shall I hide?

109
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,940
Okay.

110
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,930
I'm the Commissary in charge of studies, right?

111
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,380
That high fever turned you to a fool?

112
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,580
This is my home.

113
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,650
The world knows it.

114
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,020
There're just me and my brother.

115
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,140
Do you want the whole world think that

116
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,540
you're living with me?

117
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,490
Then where shall I hide?

118
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,720
The bathroom.

119
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,410
No, no, no, no.

120
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,900
What if any one of them wants to use the bathroom.

121
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
I'll get busted.

122
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,370
Then where?

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,370
In here.

124
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,040
I mean, I'll stay in here.

125
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,140
My... My room?

126
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,740
Okay, off you go.

127
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,800
Hurry, open the door.

128
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,340
But my room....

129
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,380
Go, go, go....

130
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,640
Hi, guys.

131
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,290
What took you so long?

132
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,890
I.... Well, I...

133
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,320
I was sleeping, didn't hear you.

134
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,170
That doesn't like your style.

135
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,290
No, I was...

136
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,360
and I used the toilet.

137
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,860
Didn't hear the closestool's sound.

138
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,800
I was washing my hands.

139
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,800
Doesn't need to explain that...

140
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640
No, no.

141
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,370
I'm scrupulously clean, I gotta
wash my hands before I open the door.

142
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,540
Do you feel she is so abnormal today?

143
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,740
Indeed! So abnormal. Abnormal.

144
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,490
Enough!

145
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,680
You two are always in a replay mode.

146
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
I feel so dizzy!

147
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,860
Like echo of the cuckoos in the valley.

148
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,660
Listen to me, I'm the hunter now.

149
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,240
I'll shoot cuckoos first.

150
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,250
And cook you two.

151
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,460
Shut up.

152
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,420
Such a heartless hunter.

153
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,780
Evil, heartless!

154
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,290
Enough, enough.

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,810
Why brought you here today?

156
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,640
You forgot?

157
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,080
You said you want to help us with our study.

158
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,720
Right.

159
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,100
After Liao Danyi helped us with our study.

160
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,500
We made a lot of progress.

161
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,020
You said that narcissist is too cocky.

162
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,460
Did I say that?

163
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,880
Didn't you?

164
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,850
You also said you will drag his nose off.

165
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,200
Put it in his mouth.

166
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,650
And use your Yezi Kongfu

167
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,250
to beat his teeth into his nose.

168
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,770
You also drew a picture of that.

169
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,290
You can't deny it.

170
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
Wait!

171
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,100
What's that?

172
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,080
My toy fell off on its own.

173
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,370
Why are you blushing?

174
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,420
I'm not.

175
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,810
Liao Danyi is such a nice guy.

176
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,640
Why would I say something bad behind his back?!

177
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,740
Didn't you say he is a scumbag?

178
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,540
Scumbag?

179
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,860
Liao Danyi, it's impossible.

180
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,640
I wouldn't say that about him.

181
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,840
You said even a scumbag is better than him.

182
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,720
Right.

183
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,800
And you also said,

184
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,360
You want that guy who is worse
than a scumbag kneel in front of you.

185
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,340
Right, right. Kneel in front of you to worship you.

186
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,290
Wait!

187
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,260
I mean it, wait! Sit down!

188
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,690
That really fell down on itself.

189
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,170
Is that?

190
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,890
Brother Yihan, are you up there?

191
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,700
No, no, no.

192
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,570
My brother is not in.

193
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,730
I forget to close the window.

194
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,940
So it fell down on itself.

195
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,330
I'll go close it.

196
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,890
- I'll come with you.
- No need!

197
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,640
My room.... Trust me. you don't want go in there.

198
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,200
Besides, a boy shouldn't go into a girl' room, right?

199
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,180
I'll go with you, then.

200
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,540
No! Sit!

201
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,540
Strange.

202
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,980
Strange. Strange.

203
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,220
Why did you throw things down?!

204
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,570
Why did you throw things down?!

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,370
You talk behind me.

206
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,090
- Talk behind me.
- Wait!

207
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,720
We got company. Lay down!

208
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,220
Big boss, you're so strange today.

209
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,970
Right, it's so noisy in there.

210
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,900
What happened?

211
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,760
Nothing. I'm here alone.

212
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,410
You're really strange today.

213
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,060
We need to check inside.

214
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,680
That...

215
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,460
Fine.

216
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,740
In fact, there's a man in my room.

217
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,380
My new boyfriend.

218
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,400
I was gonna tell you guys.

219
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,620
But didn't find a right time.

220
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,300
Besides, today we were dating.

221
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,720
I forgot to tell you.

222
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,440
But I think it's a good chance.

223
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,640
You can go meet him.

224
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,520
He is in there. Come in.

225
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,460
Monitor, you have a boyfriend?

226
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,620
You have a boyfriend!

227
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,700
Hurry, hurry.

228
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,170
That's hilarious!

229
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,600
That's hilarious!

230
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,620
We'll wait you downstairs.

231
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,460
Hilarious!

232
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,780
Keep still!

233
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,940
Monitor, we're leaving. You're so funny.

234
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,740
Monitor is so humorous.

235
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,080
Bye.

236
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,300
Okay, class begins.

237
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,690
Today we'll gonna learn the way we look.

238
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,170
Unit one.

239
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,820
[Sword II]

240
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,850
[Sword III]

241
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,860
[Sword VII]

242
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,560
[Sword VI]

243
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,330
[Sword VIII]

244
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,520
[Sword VIII ]

245
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,010
[ Sword IX ]

246
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,890
[ Death ]

247
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,500
We are gonna use

248
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,680
Hanxin's trick in the lesson you are learning.

249
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,960
It's called Sneak In.

250
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,920
Seems quite impressive.

251
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,450
To make him confused.

252
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,850
After you draw his attention,

253
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,700
then you perform another action plan in the dark.

254
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,420
So you mean.

255
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,140
In class, if Liao Danyi tells me to focus on class.

256
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,330
I should do the opposite.

257
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,360
To draw his attention, right?

258
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,260
Smart!

259
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,120
So I'm gonna pretend I'm sleeping.

260
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,050
When he lets down his guard.

261
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,680
I can fight him back hard.

262
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:12,040
Fight back, back, back.

263
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,930
Wait a second.

264
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,580
Wonder girl.

265
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,010
We can talk! We can talk!

266
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,520
Don't!

267
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,160
Don't beat us! Don't beat us!

268
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,160
Don't fight, don't fight.

269
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,210
That hurts. Hurts.

270
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,860
Stop!

271
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,560
Could you use another character than this?

272
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,210
There's a square.

273
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,260
There's a character "Bow".

274
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,250
If you use character "Bow" or square.

275
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,930
You can beat us as long as you want.

276
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,780
I like this character, shut up!

277
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,280
Didn't you tell me to draw his attention and

278
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,210
Beat back, back, back?

279
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,980
Where's that?

280
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,490
Why only I got beaten?

281
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,440
That's because....

282
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,500
I've run out of words.

283
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,280
Wait, wait, wait!

284
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,000
Stop beating us!

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,760
Stop!

286
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,720
I have a question.

287
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
What is that?

288
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,360
Why he is always the one who gave you the bad idea.

289
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,250
But I also got beaten?!

290
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,690
Seems so!

291
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,480
Because I like it!

292
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,410
Don't beat me, don't, don't!

293
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,280
I'm dead!

294
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,960
What kind of strategy are you gonna use?

295
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,860
I know a kind of secret weapon.

296
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,130
Called Arrow Blow.

297
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,290
That kind of secret weapon

298
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,130
is from Amazons.

299
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,880
and rain forest in south America.

300
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,690
The local people in America use that tool to hunt.

301
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,880
Although that is not a powerful weapon,

302
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,460
but it's very accurate.

303
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,900
Even without the help of poison,

304
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,060
it can still catch and kill some

305
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,100
birds and little animals.

306
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,900
That Arrow Blow usually came with poison.

307
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,810
Bravo!

308
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,960
Ye Muxi.

309
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,920
Read the letters on the blackboard please.

310
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,890
Okay, sit.

311
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,720
Miss, may I ask where's Mt. Zhou?

312
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,120
Are you asking about the one in Zhejiang Province?

313
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,330
Exactly, that famouse Mt. Zhou.

314
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,010
You got the right person.

315
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,930
That Mt. Zhou is famous for porridge and shirt.

316
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,880
That one?

317
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,520
You know it.

318
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,800
I want to visit my spiritual homeland.

319
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,180
My homeland of my life.

320
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,010
In my life,

321
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,360
If I can have porridge and shirt, some homely food.

322
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,400
I think I can't ask for more.

323
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,260
Miss, do you want to taste some?

324
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,970
Sir, please come with me.

325
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,680
Screw you!

326
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,570
Who wants your porridge?! I'll go back and eat hotpot.
