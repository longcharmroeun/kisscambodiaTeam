The Big Boss

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,840
Episode 27

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,510
Cut! Camera A, camera B, playback.

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,500
Any problem with this shot?

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,980
No.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,270
How about the voice? Any bloopers?
No.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,310
Lighting?

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,650
Director, lighting is okay.

35
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,690
Okay. Pass. Keep it.

36
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,070
How is that, sis Annie?

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,510
You've done a great job, Xiaodong.

38
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,559
But I don't understand.

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,420
Why do you value this thing so much?

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,170
Remember what happened to Chi Wanjun?

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,140
After she refused a boy's love improperly at school,

42
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,160
paparazzi used that boy

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,580
and spread rumors to damage her reputation.

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,580
Caused many negative effects on her.

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,560
As a students' idol, your image is very important.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,260
Besides, I've done some study on that girl Yali.

47
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,120
Her family background is very good.

48
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,530
Might help your career more or less.

49
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,110
Believe me, Xiaodong.

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,410
Follow the path that our company paves for you.

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,880
You'll have the entire world under your feet.

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,740
Or, you still don't believe me?

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,480
Of course I believe you, sis Annie.

54
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,890
All right. Are there too many activities for you lately?

55
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,760
You have dark circles around your eyes.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,260
Go have some rest.

57
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,690
Remember, Xiaodong.

58
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,000
Everything that we do is for you.

59
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,950
I know.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,240
I promise, our company and I will spend all our time

61
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,620
and energy on you, and only you.

62
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,810
Xue Xiaodong. Xue Xiaodong.

63
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,270
Don't worry. I'm here not to do something improper.

64
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,850
I want to tell you that I've bought all the VIP seats

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,090
in the first two rows for your next concert.

66
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,430
So can I be the president of the third fans club of yours?

67
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,430
Thank you so much, Yali.

68
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,210
But, the fans club...

69
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,100
Yali.

70
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,270
In fact you didn't need to spend so much.

71
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,660
Let's talk about some details about the fans club.

72
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
Excuse me.

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,340
Teacher.

74
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,320
You seem not one of our Class Ten, right?

75
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm a student of Class One.

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,170
Then why didn't you go back to Class One
but come to our Class Ten?

77
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,780
Okay. I'll go back now.

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,320
Teacher, let me introduce myself.

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,980
I know who you are.

80
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,880
You don't, right?

81
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,360
And you don't know my profession.

82
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,990
I know your profession.

83
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,840
Nothing but to build cheap idols in this faithless times.

84
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,530
To make huge profits.

85
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,810
Am I right?

86
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,159
You may leave now.

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,230
Fine. I'm leaving.

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,230
Bye, teacher.

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,050
Xiaodong, good luck.

90
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,720
Sorry, teacher.

91
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,210
I shouldn't bring my broker to school.

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,270
Xiaodong, as your teacher,

93
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,270
I feel obliged to remind you.

94
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,870
You're here to study, not to sing.

95
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,580
I hope you can be serious about your study.

96
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,530
So even if those speculative people
abandon you after using up your value,

97
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,110
at least you can rely on what you've learned

98
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,820
to establish yourself in society.

99
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,820
Okay. Got it. Thank you, teacher.

100
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,290
Go back to your seat.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,110
Right, my new album will be released soon.

102
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,590
Good luck to me!
Good luck!

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,780
Bestseller!

104
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,010
Thanks.

105
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,620
What's up?

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,020
My bottleneck period.

107
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,430
So I think, should I change to another style?

108
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,510
To surprise people with one try.

109
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,510
Yet still accord with populace aesthetic.

110
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,320
That's what I'm good at.

111
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,860
Are you sure? What you're good at is not

112
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,230
to scare people with one try?

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,330
So funny.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,060
Well, after all we're friends, right?

115
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,210
I said I can, then I can.

116
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,870
All right...

117
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,640
I can help, too.

118
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,140
My gratitude is in this wine.

119
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,390
No, in this coke.

120
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,000
Drinking and drinking? I... I want food.

121
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,030
May our watermelon alliance grow bigger!

122
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,410
Watermelon?

123
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,500
I don't want to any fruit like watermelon.

124
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,220
It's a nickname for Xiaodong's fans.

125
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,100
Aren't you silly?

126
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,740
But I'm not his fan.

127
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,280
I am.

128
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,920
All right.

129
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,930
Anyway, thanks, you guys.

130
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,190
Let's start eating!

131
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,090
Eat. Eat.

132
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,230
Don't eat my meat!

133
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,180
Yours. Yours. Here. Here.

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,710
Speaking of that He Lvxi in Class One.

135
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,270
He really has many funny stories.

136
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,350
My brother and I were in the same class
with He Lvxi back in middle school.

137
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,450
One day, we two went to take a shower.

138
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,120
Guess what we had seen?

139
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,610
What had you seen?

140
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,340
We saw He Lvxi serving instant noddles with the bath water.

141
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,690
Can you believe that?

142
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,910
My god!

143
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,200
Listen to me.
When we raised the national flag,

144
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,640
he walked in the front.

145
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,210
His trousers had a seam split.

146
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,680
Guess what color was his under-pant?

147
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,490
Floral, with strawberries!

148
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,130
Why should a man wear a strawberry under-pant?

149
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,950
My god!

150
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,000
I remembered.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,110
We lived in the same dorm with him back in middle school.

152
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,700
So we took bath together.

153
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,070
One day, I saw him walk in the bathroom.

154
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,520
I asked, why did you bathe with shoes on?

155
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,830
He replied, so I can wash my shoes over the bath!

156
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,620
Speaking of shoes, I remembered one thing.

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,030
Once his classmate exchanged his shoes with some girl's.

158
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,110
He wore them for a whole month.

159
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,910
And that pair of shoes were pink!

160
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,740
How could he fail to find that?

161
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,710
Why didn't he wear those pink shoes today?

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,380
Sanitary inspection.

163
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,330
Right. Right, I remembered another thing!

164
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,020
Once when we were in school...

165
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,640
When we went back to the dorm,

166
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,010
at the door we saw a...

167
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,380
At first I thought it's a shoe.

168
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,390
But later I found it's a sock!

169
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,910
Very sticky, very stiff, standing right there.

170
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,990
Can you believe that?

171
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,760
So smelly!

172
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,080
What socks is he wearing today?

173
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,750
Lvxi, do you still have that sock?

174
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,560
-Lvxi, time to wash your socks.
-So smelly!

175
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,960
What a beautiful tune!

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,150
A tune that feels like this.

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,440
It feels like being caressed by a breeze.

178
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
So relaxing.

179
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,870
It must be related to clouds.

180
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,230
Or ocean.

181
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Done!

182
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,600
The lyric!

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,450
So fast?!

184
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,450
Yes. Come on. Sing it out loud.

185
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

186
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,080
Beyond the mountain, beyond the sea.

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,790
There are living a mysterious master.

188
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,340
If you ask him what does he want to sing?

189
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,420
He'll secretly shoot you with trench mortal.

190
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,000
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,950
Indeed very powerful.

192
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,010
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

193
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,250
A shot will send you back home.

194
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,660
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

195
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,170
Indeed very powerful.

196
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,310
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

197
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,050
A shot will send you back home.

198
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,430
Doesn't it fit well?

199
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,640
Fit what?

200
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,520
What the hell did you write?

201
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,260
Listening to his tune, I could only think of this.

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,960
Whether you listened to his tune or not,

203
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
what you could think would still be this, okay?

204
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,530
But I think trench mortal is pretty cool.

205
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,740
Sorry.

206
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,840
Suddenly I entered into the world of trench mortal.

207
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
What kind of world is that?

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,660
You really beat me.

209
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,070
Let's think about other themes.

210
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,210
Xiaodong?

211
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,730
Trench mortal?

212
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,350
-Xiaodong?
-Trench mortal?

213
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,950
Xiaodong?

214
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,140
Think about that.

215
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,100
Trench mortal is really an interesting theme.

216
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Right! I think so!

217
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,200
Ye Muxi. I have another tune here.

218
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,390
Help me.

219
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,690
Okay. I got this!

220
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,330
Okay. I have so many ideas.

221
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,820
This one seems good as well.

222
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,470
So awesome!

223
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,180
Yes.

224
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,780
Then we can write this...

225
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,870
Have you... Have you heard of Doraemon?

226
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,490
Right. Then we can add it to this.

227
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,230
Then this...

228
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,610
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

229
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,600
Trench... Trench... Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

230
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,460
One, two, three. Three. Three. Three...

231
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,580
Trench mortal.

232
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,210
Tr... Trench... Trench... Trench mortal.

233
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,650
Ye Muxi.

234
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,140
I gotta tell you something.

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,370
Please don't disturb my inspirations.

236
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,230
Something really important.

237
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,920
Let's talk outside.

238
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,350
Go ahead.

239
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,010
Right here?

240
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,690
Ye Muxi.

241
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,490
You and Xiaodong are best friends, right?

242
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,520
You also hope his career can grow better and better, right?

243
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,720
Of course.

244
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,990
I want to tell you that...

245
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,920
The lyric that you wrote seems a little inappropriate.

246
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,440
No. I think it's pretty appropriate.

247
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,480
Those blades and mortals you wrote...

248
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,190
Don't you feel it's too low-age?

249
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,190
What did you mean?

250
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,540
Means too childish.

251
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,090
Totally different from his style.

252
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,850
Childish...

253
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,500
Look, this is called interesting, you know?

254
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,360
Interesting songs should have interesting lyrics.

255
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,090
It's a match.

256
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,160
Interesting?
I don't find it interesting at all.

257
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,250
Don't impose your aesthetic on other people.

258
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,750
Or feel everyone's aesthetic is the same as yours.

259
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,730
He'll lose fans like hell, you know?

260
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,570
Well, your lyric is good.

261
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,910
Mine is rubbish, right?

262
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,250
No need to explain.

263
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,690
Your job now. I don't want to write any now.

264
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,750
Where are you going, Ye Muxi?

265
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,750
I got an emergency.

266
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,570
Lvxi.

267
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,140
What's up, Miss Xinyi?

268
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,220
Do you think I'm charming?

269
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,530
In you boys' eye...

270
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,210
Am I kinda a popular girl?

271
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,320
Do you think I'm a cute girl?

272
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,700
Miss Xinyi, don't be like this!

273
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,760
In my heart, you're an idol!

274
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,350
If you flirt with me like this every day, I'm gonna go crazy!

275
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,860
What should I do?

276
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,640
My heart beats so fast! Miss Xinyi.

277
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,360
Sadness of this city.

278
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,200
Turns into hope in this moment.

279
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,160
The second line and the fourth line.

280
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,420
Which one is better?

281
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,890
Look.

282
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,940
Shanqi?

283
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,060
Shanqi.

284
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,050
Look, the second line and the fourth line.

285
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,070
Which one is better?

286
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,350
I think, the latter is better.

287
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,240
The former doesn't rhyme very well.

288
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,090
Makes sense.

289
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,740
Needs modifying.

290
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,050
Well, your lyric is good.
Mine is rubbish, right?

291
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,750
Xiaodong.

292
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,100
Although I want to help you write the lyric,

293
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,600
I gotta go to do something right now.

294
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,510
What's that?

295
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,450
Something very important.

296
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,060
Excuse me.

297
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,170
In the past, I didn't like making friends.

298
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,640
Nor communicating with other people.

299
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,100
Every day, I just sat before the computer.

300
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Felt very happy facing the computer.

301
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,600
But someone changed me.

302
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,140
Who?

303
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,849
Ye Muxi.

304
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,820
Big boss?

305
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:11,689
She showed up.

306
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,420
Made me feel the communication between people

307
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,870
seems a little different from facing the cold screen.

308
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,380
There's temperature.

309
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,440
So after I came to Class Ten.

310
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,870
Being with everyone else,

311
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,339
and the one I admire the most,

312
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,490
I've been every happy every day.

313
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,350
What are you making?

314
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,350
A tomb.

315
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,040
Whose tomb?

316
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,030
Our friendship's tomb.

317
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,990
Don't take it so seriously.

318
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm joking. Just making a mound.

319
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,470
But I still have to apologize for what I said to you.

320
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,480
Never mind. No big deal.

321
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,730
Not angry now?

322
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,240
I didn't get angry. It's no big deal.

323
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,030
All right. We still are best friends.

324
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,910
In fact, the lyric you wrote sounds pretty good.

325
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,530
Don't lie to your conscience.

326
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,530
Otherwise I'll be struck by lightning.

327
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,600
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

328
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,340
Bombs tanks into ashes.

329
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,910
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

330
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,910
Makes you die fast.

331
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,160
What are you laughing at?

332
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,050
Sounds awful.

333
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,430
You sing, then.

334
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,260
Listen, you gotta feel this song.

335
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,620
Feel.

336
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,920
Feel it?

337
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Okay. Come, let me teach you.

338
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,920
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

339
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,560
Bombs tanks into ashes.

340
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,590
Right. Right. Right.

341
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,130
Feel it. Right. Try again.

342
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,260
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

343
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,620
Bombs tanks into ashes.

344
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,040
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

345
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,650
Makes you die fast.

346
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,000
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

347
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,190
Makes you die fast.

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,330
Right. Right. Feel it!

349
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,120
Eighty points!

350
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,680
Brother, I got...

351
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,310
Eighty points.

352
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,440
Brother, you're so awesome!

353
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,890
I only got seventy points.

354
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,530
What's your secret of this success?

355
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,650
Awesome, brother.

356
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,830
Eighty points.

357
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,960
Awesome. Awesome.

358
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,530
Eighty points. Eighty points. Eighty points.

359
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,660
It hurts!

360
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,060
Congrats! Huang Yi got eighty points.

361
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,280
Now, warm applause to Huang Yi!

362
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,190
Sir.

363
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,220
Do you need a paper worth eighty points?

364
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,090
Look at this. Look at this. Eighty points.

365
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,950
Tiancheng, can't believe that I got eighty points!

366
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,640
Look. Look at this. Look, eighty points!

367
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,740
Tiancheng, just take a look at this.

368
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,740
It's really eighty points.

369
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,650
