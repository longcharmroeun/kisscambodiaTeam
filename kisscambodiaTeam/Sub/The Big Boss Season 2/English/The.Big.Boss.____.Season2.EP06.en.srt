1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,546
Have you watched the idol drama I performed?

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:03,373
They said I'm such a poor actor.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,066
So my broker arranged me some Performance Lesson.
And told me to go.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,986
Performance Lesson?

5
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:10,586
My family name is Biao.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,106
You can call me Miss Biao.

7
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,240
The famous Director's name is Famous.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,413
So the Performance teacher's name must be Performance.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,680
Little girl, what are you talking about?

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm not that shameless like director Famous.

11
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,613
Called himself Famous.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
My name is Beauty Biao.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,786
Lion!

14
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:40,733
Gorilla!

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,906
Electronic Fan!

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,333
Electronic Fan?

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,453
Electronic Fan?

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,466
Look at your performance.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,266
Look at Ye Muxi's.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,586
Your eyes are so empty.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,106
Life story is...

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,680
The best way to enhance your enthusiasm.

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,853
Look at you.

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,800
Where are your emotions?

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,733
-You're dead!
-I'll kill ya! 

26
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:50,693
One. Two. Three.

27
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:52,626
Four. 

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,360
Five!

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,546

30
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:20,813

36
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:45,506
# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,520
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

38
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:53,546
# Waiting, the signal for running #

39
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,546
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #
# After class, we laugh and sing #

40
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:03,106
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #

41
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:04,626
# On the way to the future #

42
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:07,280
# Thunder and storm won't matter #

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,533

The Big Boss
Episode 24

56
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,040
Guan Xinyi.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm one of the class committee of Class Ten.

58
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,106
I'm responsible for what Huang Nan and Huang Yi did to you.
Don't take it to the heart.

59
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,586
I'll punish them.

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,693
Please wait here for a while

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
Why are you looking at me?

62
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,600
Danyi is back?

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,893
Brother.

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,733
Nothing. Nothing.

65
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,946
Something is going on here?

66
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,666
Brother.

67
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,840
She is just my classmate.

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,253
Classmate. Really?

69
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,320
It's true.

70
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,186
Classmate.

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
Guan Xinyi, he is my big brother.

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,146
-Hello, I'm Ye...
-His name is...

73
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,813
Liao Yihan.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,813
I'm Liao Yihan.

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,160
Hello, brother.

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,053
Hello.

77
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,426
I won't interrupt your two.

78
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll go write my stuff.

79
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,333
Go for it, brother.

80
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,280
Go for it.

81
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,373
Sit.

82
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,413
Why did you call me here?

83
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,400
I like you.

84
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,386
Ye Muxi. I like you.

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,746
Not the friend kind of like.

86
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,986
Would you.... Be my girlfriend?

87
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:30,666
Say it.

88
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,346
I like you.

89
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,213
I like to watch you smile.

90
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,120
I like to see you bump into my world.

91
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,640
I like you messing around with me.

92
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,466
I like the true myself in front of you.

93
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,920
I... I really like you,

94
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,280
Not that kind of like to a friend.

95
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,333
Would you be my girlfriend?

96
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:12,226
I do.

97
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,266
Cut!

98
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:31,466
God! Look! You're much better!

99
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,586
Look, look! That's impressive!

100
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,253
I almost bought it!

101
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,800
That's real something!

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,240
You made a great advance! Amazing!

103
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:42,560
I bought that you love me part! Gosh!

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,666
Gosh! Gosh! Again, again.

105
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,733
Go on, go on, go on.

106
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,880
Did you see? Did you see?

107
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,520
Did you see?!

108
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,826
Today is your first lesson.

109
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,920
Xue Xiaodong. Your score is...

110
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,280
Flunk.

111
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,533
But, you have potential.
I knew....

112
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,853
Little girl.

113
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,160
I like you very much.

114
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,733
I hope you can really think about to be an actress.

115
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,266
I'm just a normal girl.

116
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,706
Not an actress.

117
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,999
That industry is too complicated.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,680
No, no.

119
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,586
Fine.

120
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,160
Thank you for your sincere performance today.

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
Thanks.

122
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,880
Thank you, teacher.

123
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,480
Performance is quite interesting.

124
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,106
Right.

125
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,066
One day you'll realize it.

126
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:13,706
It's not for you.

127
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:35,080
So this is Liao Danyi's home.

128
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,426
Do I need to refine the make-up?

129
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,493
Bathroom?
Oh, there.

130
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,173
Damn, I've ran out of stories.

131
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,280
No inspirations.

132
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,760
Inspiration, Inspiration

133
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,773
What shall I do?

134
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,000
Brother.

135
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,213
Yezi.

136
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,773
When did you come back?
Already changed into your pajamas?

137
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,720
I'm back for a long time.

138
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,253
And you know what?

139
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,933
I went to have a performance lesson.

140
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:13,826
How did that go?
It's quite interesting.

141
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,146
I know you must be good.

142
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:18,653
I'll go have some rest.
Off you go.

143
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,440
And Liao Danyi.

144
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:21,853
What?
I mean,

145
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,613
He snores every night.
So noisy!

146
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,573
Yezi, now we're all living under the same roof.
So be magnanimous, okay?

147
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
No grudges will last overnight.

148
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,880
It's okay.

149
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Go, sleep.

150
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
Brush your teeth.

151
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,093
Good night.

152
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,440
Don't know what to write. I give up.

153
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,880
Right.

154
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,733
Must cook some breakfast for Yezi and Danyi.

155
00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:51,010
Better prepare a little.

156
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Guan Xinyi.

157
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,320
Your clothes is dry now.

158
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,893
Monster!

159
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,053
What just happened?

160
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,813
Why do I feel so tired?

161
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,106
I also feel it is more exhausted to play than to study.

162
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,586
I'm so tired.

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,786
Stop!

164
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,533
Don't move! Don't move!

165
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,240
My waist. My waist!

166
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,586
No, I don't want to move. My leg cramped.

167
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,586
Wait. Wait.

168
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,666
Are you feeling better?

169
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,626
Let's go. Let's go.

170
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,093
-I gotta go back and sleep for two days.
-No more play.

171
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,586
I need two days sleep too.

172
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,186
Exhausted.

173
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,893
Meijing!

174
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,226
Shanqi!

175
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,066
Shanqi.

176
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,346
What's wrong?

177
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,706
I started to burp this morning.

178
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,186
I can't stop it.

179
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,493
I can help.

180
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,933
Waiter, a glass of water.

181
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,960
Shanqi, Meijing.

182
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,133
What's wrong?

183
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,906
I burped a whole morning, until now.

184
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,986
Shanqi tried many ways.

185
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,186
But it didn't stop.

186
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,386
That's right.

187
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,186
The eight trigrams tells me.

188
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:06,240
You're in very bad luck today.

189
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,746
How can we turn her bad luck into good luck?

190
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:17,333
Follow the compass.

191
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:29,826
Stop!

192
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,933
That's the place. Northeast.

193
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,640
If you stand here for one forth incense's time.

194
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:42,040
You bad luck will disappear.

195
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,453
[ Restroom ]

196
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,933
Shanqi.

197
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,573
Hi, hi.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,653
Hi Meijing.

199
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,773
What happened?

200
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:22,360
I burped a whole morning until now.

201
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:26,506
Shanqi and Weiwei tried many ways but all failed.

202
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,933
That's reason.

203
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,213
Come with me.

204
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:35,560
Where're we going now?

205
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,666
I know a way.
If you get spooked,

206
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,853
You'll stop burping.

207
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,973
Then where're we going?

208
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:45,200
To see Li Yao.

209
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:57,026
Li Yao. Come down!

210
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:02,280
What's it?

211
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:12,760
Meijing.

212
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,080
I heard you need my help?

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,333
We have tried every way.

214
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,013
Why none of them worked?

215
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,400
Maybe it's destined.

216
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,760
We can't change it.

217
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,533
Don't get upset.

218
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,773
We will.... Find a way!

219
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,586
Are you okay?

220
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,400
I don't know what's happening to me.

221
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,333
Is that a kind of contiguous sickness?

222
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,080
That's impossible.

223
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,400
I think it's...

224
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,573
Destined!

225
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,240
Seriously?!

226
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:12,999
Coming. Coming.

227
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,666
- Danyi, it's you.
- Brother Yihan.

228
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,719
Brother Yihan.

229
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,133
Have you seen my grandma?

230
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:20,492
I didn't.

231
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,480
Grandma?

232
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,665
-I've to go.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
What is that?

233
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,745
Tell us.

234
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:26,933
What happened?

235
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
My grandma ran out from the nursing home again.

236
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,613
Where did that old lady go?

237
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:39,533
She is making my life miserable!

238
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,240
That old lady.

239
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,866
Call the police.

240
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,813
The police won't take the case
unless it's over forty-eight hours.

241
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,693
What shall we do?

242
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,613
Let's do this.

243
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,693
Yezi. You and Danyi.

244
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,053
Go search around the nursing home.

245
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,653
I'll go to the pedestrian zone.

246
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,453
We'll go find her separately.
When we find her, inform each other, okay?

247
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:06,773
Keep in touch.
If any of us find her.

248
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,333
-Okay.
-Go, go.
Hurry, Yezi. Let's go.

249
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,466
So sad!

250
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,093
- So sad! 
- Huang Nan, Huang Yi.

251
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:47,546
What's wrong?
Don't mention it.

252
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:52,866
I'm so in a bad luck today.

253
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:53,906
What's wrong?

254
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,546
Who bullied you?

255
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,640
He insisted to try the high-level skate board move.

256
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,773
So he ended up like this.

257
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:02,093
Let's go.

258
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:03,280
Live with it.

259
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
No, not that.

260
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm not crying for my knees.

261
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,653
It's my skate board.

262
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:11,973
Skate board?

263
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,040
Before he could get up.

264
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,613
An old lady stepped on our skate board and slipped away.

265
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:18,680
An old lady?

266
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,333
It's a limited version.
Took by an old lady like that.

267
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,613
What kind of old lady?

268
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,360
About sixty or seventy years old.

269
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
Move, move, move.

270
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,826
Gimme.

271
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,186
Stop! Stop!

272
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:52,666
Stop running.

273
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,440
Stop!

274
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
Grandma?!

275
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,386
Where did she go?

276
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:00,480
That way.

277
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,173
She is so fast!

278
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:03,613
We can't stop her!
Let's go.

279
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,040
Remember to tell her when you see her

280
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,506
We admire her so much!
And could she return my skate board?

281
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,120
Return our skate board!

282
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,826
One, two, three. Woodman!

283
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
One, two, three. Woodman!

284
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,506
One, two, three. Woodman!

285
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:02,293
Okay, now we know the direction.
Won't be far.

286
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,786
She should be okay.

287
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,706
I know too little about my grandma.

288
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:08,386
I didn't know she can play skate board.

289
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,346
That's a piece of cake for her.

290
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,266
I heard when she was young,
she surfed in the ocean a lot.

291
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,146
Her sense of balance is great!

292
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,413
I'm so ashamed.

293
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,080
Even you know her more than I do.

294
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,240
I also feel it strange.

295
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,653
She has so many amazing stories.

296
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:21,840
She didn't tell you?

297
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,146
My grandpa died before I was born.

298
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,093
Then no matter what my parents said,

299
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,813
grandma insisted to live at home.

300
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,826
She said she must protect her home.

301
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,786
Later, the old house was torn apart.

302
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,520
We planned to let her live with us.

303
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,306
But we didn't expect she seemed
had collapsed with the house together.

304
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,120
Then she became like this.

305
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,480
My father insisted to send her to the nursing home.

306
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,546
No wonder I didn't see her when I was young.

307
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,520
She always took care of me.

308
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,333
She has been very strict to me.

309
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,573
I can only go see her in the weekend.

310
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,240
And we don't talk much.

311
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:58,386
- Fedi. My Fedi.
- Calm down.

312
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,693
I'm gonna go save Fedi, let go of me!

313
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,293
I must save Fedi.
- Calm down.
- I must save Fedi, let go!

314
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,826
Fedi! My Feidi!
Protect it. I'll go find Zorro.

315
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:46,520
Thank you.

316
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,293
This old lady is such a heroine!
Skate board?

317
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,853
Fedi.

318
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,306
One, two, three. Wood.... Man...

319
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,306
One, Two.

320
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,373
Gosh! So scary!

321
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:19,480
One, two, three, woodman.

322
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:25,693
One, two, three, woodman.

323
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,200
Hi, Miss.

324
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,866
Have you seen this old lady?

325
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,346
No.

326
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:56,173
Thanks.

327
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,066
Don't mention it.

328
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,506
Hi, have you seen this woman?
No, haven't.

329
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,386
Hi, have you seen this woman?

330
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,613
No, no.

331
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:15,346
Thanks.

332
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:16,266
It's okay.

333
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,346
We can't go on like this

334
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,200
Must narrow it down.

335
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,373
Otherwise, it's like looking for a needle in the ocean.

336
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,546
How shall we find her?

337
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:41,640
How?

338
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:48,440
We must know where did she go?

339
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,213
How to know that?

340
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:51,826
How?

341
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,040
First, we must know what she is thinking.

342
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,680
Grandma always talks about grandpa.

343
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,186
Grandpa?

344
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,680
But he has passed away.

345
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:10,346
Could she go to visit his tomb?

346
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:12,560
That's impossible.

347
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,853
Grandpa doesn't have a grave.

348
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,360
She won't go there.

349
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,946
She won't.

350
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,986
She won't.

351
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,146
It's impossible.

352
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,320
That will be hard.

353
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,453
It's all my fault.

354
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,320
Since she was ill.

355
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,000
I never took her illness seriously.

356
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,386
And I never bothered to know her past.

357
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:34,773
If I tried to know it.

358
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,933
This wouldn't happen.

359
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,040
It's okay, don't worry.

360
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm here.

361
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,706
Don't be afraid. We will find her!

362
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:06,786
I know it!

363
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,493
I know it!

364
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,853
I know it!

365
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,386
One, two, three, woodman!

366
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,813
One, two, three, woodman!

367
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,080
One, two, three, woodman!

368
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:56,386
Woodman!

369
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,693
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

370
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:20,920
You two came.

371
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,000
How did you know I'm here?

372
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:25,426
Grandma, don't ran out by yourself.

373
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,880
We're so worried about you.

374
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,266
This place,

375
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,066
is the place where your grandpa left.

376
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,880
Danyi,

377
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:48,320
Grandma is getting older and older.

378
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,360
There're a lot time I'm in confusion.

379
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,080
When I'm myself.

380
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:57,053
I realize that,

381
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,440
So many people, so many things, so many places

382
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,840
I can't remember it at all.

383
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,706
But only this place.

384
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:20,306
I don't want to forget.

385
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,066
Grandma, grandma, grandma.

386
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,373
Grandma, grandma!

387
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,653
Grand...grandma!

388
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,480
Look, you two are so silly.

389
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,573
You thought I'm dead?

390
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:55,813
I won't die that young.

391
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:57,320
I'm very strong!
Look, look!

392
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,653
I'll live to see the end of the world.

393
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,893
Yes.

394
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,146
Okay, now. You go sit over there by yourself.

395
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,773
I need to say something to Yezi alone.

396
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,160
Go, go.

397
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:12,866
Go, go.

398
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,586
I'll go find you soon.

399
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:23,013
Yezi.

400
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:26,533
Why did you know I'm here?

401
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,600
I peeped at your letter in the box.

402
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,973
You peeped in my box?

403
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:37,186
So you and Danyi were looking for me?

404
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
We're not family.

405
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:42,733
I'm also worried about you.

406
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,000
Your hand.

407
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:55,080
This is for you.

408
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,906
Isn't this the bracelet in your box?

409
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,306
Yes, it is.

410
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,346
It's my gift for you.

411
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:04,800
Take it.
No, I can't.

412
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,546
Take it. Grandma told you to take it.

413
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:10,933
It's not expensive. It's cheap.

414
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,453
But you can't throw it away.

415
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:13,760
Can't lose it.

416
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:18,813
Let's go.

417
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,386
Walk me to that shitty nursing home.

418
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:26,293
Although I don't want to.
But I have to go.

419
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,453
Right.

420
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,466
Otherwise.

421
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:32,093
They'll search everywhere for me.

422
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,920
Why the bracelet is with you?

423
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,200
Grandma gave it to me.

424
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,026
Be careful with it.

425
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,400
What? Want it?

426
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,293
I can give it to you if you want.

427
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,173
No need.

428
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,653
Since grandma gave it to you.
Keep it safe.

429
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,733
Yali, what're you doing?

430
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,973
Monitor.

431
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,986
As a student from Maple Leaf Middle School.

432
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,426
I hope you can pay attention to your behavior outside.

433
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:11,106
Sorry, monitor.
You must remember you're one of us.

434
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,733
Be proud of Maple Leaf today.
And Maple Leaf will be proud of you in future.

435
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,800
Go pick it up.

436
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,666
Yes.

437
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,626
Yali, as a man.

438
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,533
Of course I can pick it up for you.

439
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,813
But I want you to remember this lesson.

440
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,613
Let's go watch The Fast and the Furious 8 next week.
-Okay.
-They say it's amazing.

441
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,133
I heard so.

442
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,360
I've seen the one to seven episodes.

443
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,386
Me too. I was gonna...
Classmates, what're you doing?

444
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,880
You must know that your priority is study.

445
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,666
Don't let puppy love virus

446
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,253
infect your pure mind.

447
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,560
Remember you're one of the Maple Leaf.

448
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,613
Be proud of the Maple Leaf today.

449
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,506
The Maple Leaf will be proud of you in future.

450
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:54,720
Understand?

451
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:55,826
Understood.

452
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,333
I hope you two can keep an appropriate distance.

453
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,133
That's so cool!

454
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:06,160
It's so boring.

455
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,213
So much homework.

456
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,600
Let's go out...

457
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,760
Students, are you from Class Ten?

458
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes.

459
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,320
What're you wearing inside?

460
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,506
What kind of trousers is that?

461
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,186
I hope you can wear your uniforms properly.

462
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,493
Remember you're one of the Maple Leaf.

463
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,386
Be proud of the Maple Leaf today.

464
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:24,146
The Maple Leaf will be proud of you in future.

465
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:26,613
Wear your uniform well.

466
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,440
What a jerk?!

467
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,300
So handsome!

468
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,013
The vice-chairman of the student union.

469
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,613
An ace in every lessons,

470
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,506
handsome 

471
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,400
and well-educated man.

472
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:48,293
Of course.

473
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,133
When Guan Xinyi is not by his side.

474
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,413
Miss Xinyi. I'm here!

475
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,866
Miss Xinyi. You're so beautiful!
Full score.

476
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,106
Miss Xinyi. You're so pretty today.
Miss Xinyi, have you dined?

477
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,693
We have a meeting today.

478
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:09,253
When shall we go?
Miss Xinyi, Miss Xinyi. I mean...
