1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,472
Brother, you know what?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,360
To be honest, I always have this idea
about the final episode of One Piece.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,392
I think...

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,400
Gol路D路Roger's son isn't Ace.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,832
But Luffy is.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,512
Ace is more like Monkey路D路Dragon's son.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,840
But the navy wants to kill Roger's son.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,448
So Luffy is the one they're after, not Ace.

9
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,392
I think Ace must have died for Luffy.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,432
Eiichiro Oda must have the same idea with me.

11
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,800
Among all the animes.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,632
Small Carp Adventures is my favorite.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,584
Think about it.

14
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,992
Small carp, it's so inspirational.

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,168
Look, after so many difficulties, 
He finally learned magic.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,528
He saved the whole Carp Village.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,768
That's great! So inspirational.

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,368
In fact, I also want a little white dog like Crayon Shin-chan's.

19
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,696
No passion.
Our mom would never let us raise pet.

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,656
And I also want a Doraemon.

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,096
So we can sleep half an hour later than we usually do.
We open the door, it'll be our school!

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,088
And we won't need to do our homework.

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
But no,

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,904
there's no such a thing in the world.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,552
# In the lonely sky, and lonely rain comes down #

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
I know how to sing it.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,656
-I wanna know the name.
I don't know, either.

28
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,264
You know I can never remember the name.

29
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:41,808
Have you done your homework?

30
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:43,152
I'm just about to ask you.

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,040
I only wrote down my name.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,432
I haven't written a word.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,616
What shall we do?

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,760
When will the class begin?

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,080
# Head held high, stride forward #

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,320
# Dream big, break the limits #

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,800
# Work hard for the future world (No limits) #

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
# Draw one thousand and one fairy tale plots #

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,528
# Growth speeds up, give full play to youth #

40
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,528
# Running, with schoolbag on our back #

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,768
# Sunlight, goes into our coat #

42
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:25,184
# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

43
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:29,056
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

44
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,152
# Waiting, the signal for running #

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,112
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #

46
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,448
# After class, we laugh and sing #
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,208
# On the way to the future #

48
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,592
# Thunder and storm won't matter #

49
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:51,104
# Forever young heartbeats #

50
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:55,856
# Head held high, stride forward #

51
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,112
# Dream big, break the limits #
# Blue sky, green campus (handsome lads) #

52
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:06,480
# Review the new self again and again #

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,504
# Memory speeds up, give full play to youth #

54
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:13,664
# Head held high, stride forward #

55
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,904
# Dream big, break the limits #

56
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:20,416
# Work hard for the future world (no limits) #

Episode 30

63
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:17,488
Last night, the werewolves killed Zhu Shanqi.
She has no words left.

64
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,695
I'll remind you again.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Hope all of you can follow the rules.

66
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,384
Please confirm your identity cards.

67
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,288
Don't let other players see your cards.

68
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:45,440
Now it's getting dark, please close your eyes.

69
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,904
Werewolves, open your eyes.

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
Werewolves, meet your companions.

71
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,984
Werewolves, kill a player.

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,208
Now, go back.

73
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,470
Day breaks.

74
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,608
Last night, the one got killed by the werewolves is...

75
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,336
Ye Muxi.

76
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:15,568
Yezi.

77
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:18,640
Yezi, are you okay?

78
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:24,464
I just got an identity.

79
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,872
What is my identity?

80
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:27,760
You're a hunter.

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,640
What is that?

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,752
Now you can shoot one person.

83
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:34,128
It's you!
-Trust me, it's not me.
-Not me!

84
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,480
It's you!

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,456
It's not me, boss.

86
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,080
It's you?
No, No, not me, boss!

87
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:39,792
You!
Boss, I'm innocent!

88
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,048
You?
Shoot me, so I can die with you.

89
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,432
You?

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,256
I'm the judge!

91
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,440
You? You?

92
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,100
Boss, boss.

93
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,032
It's not me! Not me!
Boss, it's not me!

94
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,152
You!

95
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,344
Yezi.

96
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,760
Yezi, Yezi. Why you're so silly?

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
Boss.

98
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,696
Yezi, Yezi, Yezi!

99
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:10,064
I still can't pull the trigger at any of you.

100
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,736
Yezi!

101
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,248
Do you wanna continue or not?
Okay, okay. It's time for a speech.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,592
Time for a speech.

103
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:22,160
Speech.

104
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,488
Shen Wei, you begin.

105
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,400
Hurry.

106
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,296
I don't know. I wanna observe a while.

107
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,064
I don't know!

108
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,512
Day breaks.

109
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:38,784
Game over.
Werewolves win!

110
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:41,824
What?

111
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,232
Zhu Shanqi

112
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,656
Why vote on me? He is the wolf!
why vote on me?!

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
He told you, he is a werewolf!

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,464
Zhu Shanqi,

115
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,592
Can you listen to me?

116
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,640
With no personal emotions in, okay?

117
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm a prophet.

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,512
I checked last night that Xue Xiaodong is a werewolf!
Why didn't you listen?

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,224
I don't wanna listen, no, no!
He is a prophet?

120
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,744
What does that mean?! What does that mean?!
You, you, don't do a thing.

121
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,360
You, you, you too!

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,928
You're my friend. But you didn't save me?!

123
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,952
Listen, you owe me an explanation.

124
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:12,848
How could I save you?
I can't speak!

125
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,968
It's okay, it's just a game.
-Just a game.
-You guys are a bunch of...

126
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,656
Calm down, calm down.

127
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,704
It's dark. Close your eyes.

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,128
So how should we play this game?

129
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm so nervous even with my eyes closed.

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,096
I'm so afraid of getting killed.
Don't kill me, don't kill me.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,448
Finally, I'm the werewolf.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
Don't waste this chance,

133
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,920
who shall I kill?

134
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,352
That feeling to dominate other people's life 
Feels great.

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,664
Not the werewolf, I don't know how to do that.

136
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:54,448
Great, I'm a civilian.
Hope Xue Xiaodong is also on my side.

137
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,576
Witch, that's really my thing.

138
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,320
At least I can save myself.

139
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,064
In the cruel world,
you have to be selfish if you wanna survive.

140
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:24,448
Sorry, guys.
I won't use the saving card that easily.

141
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
Last night, Xue Xiaodong is out.

142
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,967
Now it's Huang Yi's turn.

143
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,239
It's so difficult.

144
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,120
Now I'm so confused.

145
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,168
I don't know how to play this.

146
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,800
I don't know who are the werewolves.

147
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,984
I'll listen to the others.

148
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:52,352
Anyway, I'm one of the good guys.

149
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,160
What're you looking at?! I'm not the werewolf.

150
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,984
But if any of you vote me out

151
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,376
or kill me.

152
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,368
Then I'll ....

153
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:08,656
Don't be mad.

154
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,112
I don't know who are the werewolves.
Anyway, I'll listen to you guys.

155
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,960
So cute!

156
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,384
Huang Nan, you wanna say something?

157
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,720
Last night, I've talked with Huang Yi.

158
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:32,496
It's very clear now.

159
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
As for the werewolf.

160
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,576
We have known it.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,528
Then who that is?

162
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:42,000
The werewolf is... What's it to you?

163
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,472
Why should I tell you?

164
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:44,496
You think I'm stupid?

165
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,168
If I tell you.
then what is left to play with?

166
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:47,776
Wanna trick me?

167
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:49,328
Pass!

168
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,730
Okay, okay, guys.

169
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,008
After these speeches.

170
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,608
and non-nutritive deductions.

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,336
I think each of you has realized the identity of the others.

172
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,560
I'll not keep it implicit anymore.

173
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,416
This time, I'm not afraid of being killed by the werewolves.

174
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,512
Because I'm the hunter.

175
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:13,616
So far, 

176
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,408
no one has suspected my identity.
So it's confirmed I'm the hunter.

177
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,480
I hope you won't vote me out.

178
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,360
So I can lead you to catch the werewolves.

179
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,616
If I die in this round.

180
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,328
Then I'll take a werewolf down with me.

181
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,128
Let's begin with the first night.

182
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
The first night, Zhu Shanqi got killed.

183
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:38,848
The first I suspect was Ye Mui

184
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:42,368
Why? Zhu Shanqi and Ye Muxi are besties.

185
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,176
And newbies.

186
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,104
Only the newbies would kill each other.

187
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,936
So Zhu Shanqi is possibly killed by Ye Muxi.

188
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,256
That's right, what my brother told me yesterday.

189
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,728
But after last round,

190
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,464
Ye Muxi was voted out by all of you.

191
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,432
But game was not over.

192
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,624
Then I realized

193
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,008
I made a huge mistake.

194
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,392
Ye Muxi's speech has exposed she is a prophet,

195
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,136
A girl like Ye Muxi whose brain doesn't work so well.

196
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,008
She is dead as a prophet.

197
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,416
That won't affect anything.

198
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,704
So the question remains.

199
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,352
No one died in the second night.
So the werewolves must have killed.

200
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,912
And the werewolf must have used the cure.

201
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,064
Am I right? Shen Wei.

202
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,992
Why are you asking me?

203
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,368
I don't know anything.

204
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:39,888
Stop faking.

205
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:40,816
We all know it.

206
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,520
She? How could she be the werewolf?
Right, why did you say that?

207
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:45,840
Do you have any proof?

208
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,024
Don't interrupt me.

209
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,464
I didn't say she is a werewolf.

210
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,808
She is the witch.

211
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,600
Didn't you see?

212
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:56,560
Shen Wei always uses fortune-telling to use the witch card.

213
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,928
Maybe she likes the witch.

214
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,008
Thinks it suits her.

215
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,056
She saves herself every time.
Didn't save any of you for once.

216
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:06,192
Did you see it?

217
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,488
It's so obvious.

218
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,392
You also found that?

219
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,816
So cute!

220
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,520
After Yezi got executed.

221
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
Xue Xiaodong got killed by the werewolves.

222
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:24,704
Now it's very clear.

223
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:27,360
Yezi, Zhu Shanqi, Xue Xiaodong.

224
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,576
They're all the good guys.

225
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,008
Shen Wei is the witch. I'm the hunter.

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,512
Who are the guys left?

227
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,272
Huang Nan, Huang Yi and Li Yao.

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,088
Li Yao has been proved.

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,832
She must be the good guy,

230
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,390
Now let's cut the crap.

231
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:50,384
Back to the point.

232
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,144
Huang Yi, you're always playing dumb.

233
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,520
You think I don't know?

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,296
Huang Nan, your words don't make sense.

235
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,608
You have been misleading us,
to make a mess.

236
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,088
So I suggest we should vote Huang Yi out first.

237
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,368
Then Huang Nan.

238
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,376
Game over.

239
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,576
Anyone wants to vote Li Yao?

240
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:17,504
Shen Wei?

241
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,144
Huang Yi?

242
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,984
Huang Nan?

243
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,120
Anyone wants to vote Xiong Tiancheng out?

244
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,608
You....

245
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,136
This game is so difficult!

246
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:35,344
You talk too much.

247
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,168
Who are you? To steal my thunder?

248
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
You're ended miserably.

249
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
You deserve it.

250
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,312
We'll kill you first.

251
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:56,432
Why me?

252
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,472
The talker seems more suspicious.

253
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:00,912
Right, right.

254
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,696
This game is too difficult.

255
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,024
What? what?

256
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,608
I don't know.

257
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,400
A wolf's head.

258
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,072
I... I'm a werewolf?

259
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,360
Why you didn't tell me?

260
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,552
Why you don't believe me?!

261
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:27,600
You, don't do a thing.

262
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,168
You, you, you too.
You're my best friend. You didn't save me?

263
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,776
Listen, you owe me an explanation!
How could I save you?!

264
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:39,904
My death is so unfair.

265
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,808
I'm just a civilian.

266
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,152
Now I'll summarize.

267
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,240
You girls. Can't you take a good look?!

268
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,456
I'm so cute.

269
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:50,048
I can't be the werewolf!

270
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,880
Werewolves, please open your eyes.

271
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,464
Werewolves, meet your companions.

272
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,104
Werewolves, kill a player.

273
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,384
Couples, open your eyes. Discuss.

274
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,344
Couples , do you know what you are supposed to do?

275
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,920
Are you excited because you can open your eyes 

276
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,248
while the others can't?

277
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
Okay, you can close your eyes now.

278
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,264
Close your eyes.

279
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:18,864
Why me? Why me?

280
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,136
Shanqi, Xiaodong. You trust me, right?

281
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,128
Trust me.

282
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:24,720
Yezi, I'm so sorry.

283
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
We don't know who are the werewolves.
Sorry about this.

284
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:29,088
Not me. Not me.

285
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,368
We'll just light one person up.

286
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,288
Light it up, maybe there'll be some surprise.

287
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,032
No, I'm not the werewolf!

288
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,900
come on, let's do this.

289
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,976
No, No!

290
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,080
No!

291
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,472
No!

292
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,352
What's so hurry?

293
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,600
I saw you thinking.

294
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,480
I didn't want to disturb you, so I was going out.

295
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,744
Scared?

296
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,232
Who is scared?

297
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:30,000
I think you're not only scared.

298
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,728
And you're sweating now.

299
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:39,200
Sweat? Where?

300
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,328
You can't talk fluently.

301
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:46,432
You are.

302
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,000
Stop it.

303
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
I know you're a werewolf.

304
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:52,848
We're brothers.

305
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,296
You think I didn't know you?

306
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,896
When you're scared.

307
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,960
You can't talk fluently.

308
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,672
How about this?

309
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,288
We'll vote you out tomorrow.

310
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,608
So you can be free.

311
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,896
I'm a werewolf?

312
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,040
That's a venomous slander!

313
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,464
You were the one sneering towards my statue.

314
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,688
You wanna kill me?

315
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,928
What brothers?

316
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,944
You despicable man!

317
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,248
Sneer? What're you talking about?

318
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,184
Stop faking!

319
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,024
You were the one sneering towards my statue.

320
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,200
I saw my noodles almost ready.

321
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
So I was so happy.

322
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,088
So I smiled.

323
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Well, do you still got some left?

324
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,032
I want that too.

325
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,976
Brother, I'm sorry.

326
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,752
We're brothers.
But I suspected you.

327
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,608
We're brothers, don't need to apologize.

328
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:10,208
As long as you know it now.

329
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,904
Right, we're brothers.

330
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,590
Brothers united will beat anything.

331
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,064
We must unite.

332
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:17,184
We're a team.
Right, you're right.

333
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,136
Those fools need us to lead them to victory.

334
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,432
Good pal.

335
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,272
Nice buddy.

336
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,184
Brother, you're smarter than me.

337
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,456
Enlighten me.

338
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,616
Good, you know I'm smarter.

339
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,440
Now, I'll analyze it for you.

340
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,152
First, from Zhu Shanqi's death.

341
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:44,304
We know it's not Xue Xiaodong.

342
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:46,192
Why is that?

343
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,120
Think about that.

344
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,720
Zhu Shanqi and Xue Xiaodong.

345
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,688
An idol and his fan,.

346
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:51,584
Think,

347
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,960
which idol would kill his idol?

348
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,472
Make sense.

349
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,712
Next, we can eliminate Yuan Ke'er.

350
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,128
To be honest,

351
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,528
She seems very cold outside.

352
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,768
But according to my observation.

353
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,920
She is very warm-hearted.

354
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:17,824
And she is so cute.

355
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,200
That makes sense, too.

356
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,152
Shen Wei doesn't look like the werewolf, either.

357
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,600
Think about it.

358
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,072
She is too cute to be the werewolf.

359
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:34,784
She is so cute!

360
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,368
I really want to pinch her face.

361
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,216
And Li Yao.

362
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,960
She can't be the werewolf.

363
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:44,064
Why is that?

364
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,296
I don't want to get beaten by her.

365
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:52,944
Who is left?

366
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,824
Our big boss.

367
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,768
Yezi.

368
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,424
Impossible.

369
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:05,130
Think, she is a fool.

370
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,520
If she is the wolf.
She will kill herself.

371
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:09,584
Right.

372
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:11,616
So, she can be eliminated.

373
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,088
As for Xiong Tiancheng.

374
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:17,050
According to my observation 

375
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,944
He is more like a prophet than a werewolf.

376
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,960
He has got this strict logic.

377
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
I almost bought it.

378
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,880
Brother, so

379
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,656
Most of them are eliminated.

380
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,144
Who is still left?

381
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,632
Come on, let's start from the beginning.

382
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:36,432
The beginning.

383
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,992
Not Yuan Ke'er.

384
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:40,672
Not Shen Wei.

385
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,464
Not Li Yao.

386
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,496
Not Xiong Tiancheng.

387
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:45,200
Not Xue Xiaodong.

388
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,016
Not Xue Xiaodong

389
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:48,304
Who is left?!

390
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:53,616
Brother, I trust you.

391
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,552
-Brother, I trust you too.
-Hug, hug, hug.
Let's do it again.

392
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,496
Well, well.

393
00:21:58,496 --> 00:21:59,760
Not Yuan Ke'er.

394
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,696
Not Xiong Tiancheng.
Not Ye Muxi.

395
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:03,312
Not Xue Xiaodong.
Not Xue Xiaodong

396
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,304
Not Shen Wei.

397
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,488
Not Li Yao.
- Who is left?!
- Who is ...

398
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,112
Brother.
It's okay, it's okay.

399
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,520
Let's do it again.

400
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,392
Slowly, slowly.

401
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:19,712
I really don't know.

402
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:21,536
Who are they?

403
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,376
Anyway. Brother, I trust you.

404
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:24,368
I trust you.

405
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:26,480
Let's vote together.

406
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,352
I think it's a great idea!

407
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,584
I won't vote you out.

408
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,688
Me either.

409
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,192
After tonight. 

410
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,840
We can kill anyone we want.

411
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,200
We can free anyone we want!

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,048
Vote them out!

413
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:36,720
Vote them!

414
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,968
tomorrow, we'll win!

415
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:39,776
We'll never lose!

416
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,712
We win!

417
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:45,152
Victory is ours!
We're the strongest!

418
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,560
Strongest!

419
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,624
Two men died last night.

420
00:23:00,784 --> 00:23:03,664
Which are Huang Nan, Huang Yi.

421
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:06,400
One is killed by a werewolf.

422
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,208
One is killed by the hunter.

423
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,840
They didn't leave any notes.

424
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,672
Now you take turns to speak.

425
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:14,832
Werewolves, please execute.

426
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,048
Werewolves, go back.

427
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:19,872
Prophet, open your eyes.

428
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:26,128
Prophet, please identify.

429
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,208
This means good guys.

430
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,296
This means werewolves.

431
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:32,032
Now the witch, open your eyes.
The person who died last night is "him".

432
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,432
Prophet, close your eyes.

433
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,288
Witch, open your eyes.

434
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,224
Last night, the one who died is "Him".

435
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,576
Do you want to use the cure?

436
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,072
Do you want to use the poison?

437
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,768
Who are you gonna intoxicate?

438
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:36,352
Save or not?

439
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:39,616
Poison or not?

440
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,080
Witch, please go back.

441
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,648
Day breaks.

442
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,456
Yesterday nobody died.

443
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,400
Players, discuss begins.

444
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,104
Well, I don't know.

445
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:55,120
You, Shanqi.

446
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,368
First, I think Xiaodong can't be the werewolf.
Why is that?

447
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,440
Xiaodong has such long legs.

448
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,568
Werewolf can't have such long legs like that.

449
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,976
So he can't be the werewolf.

450
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,008
Yezi and Shen Wei.

451
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,480
I don't think it's them.

452
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,560
Because we're all so kind.

453
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,496
Superstar路Xiaodong, who do you think is the most likely werewolf?

454
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,944
I don't know if you have noticed that...
the looks on Nan and Yi's face at the first day breaks.

455
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:23,488
I didn't.

456
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,096
They had eye contact.

457
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,864
Like this, see?

458
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,896
Then I'll keep an eye on them in next round.

459
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,248
But in my heart.

460
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:38,160
You're the most unlikely werewolf.

461
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,696
Your eyes are so kind and sincere.

462
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,456
Every word from you made me so touched.

463
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,856
Lazio路July trusts me with all her heart.
I'm away too far.

464
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:57,008
Xiaodong, what's wrong?

465
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,104
Miss Lazio路July,

466
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,792
I have something to tell you.

467
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,384
I also have something to tell you.

468
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,688
I can't stand it.

469
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,448
In fact...

470
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:13,008
I...

471
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,896
Good luck, good luck.

472
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,704
Who shall we kill the next?

473
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,880
I think... Yezi.

474
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,416
So the most likely werewolves,

475
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:31,472
must be that two.

476
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:32,272
You two.

477
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:33,936
Don't go, don't hide.

478
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,952
Right, you.

479
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,968
You.

480
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
Yes, you.

481
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,080
But, this game is so terrible.

482
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,536
Why you're all werewolves?

483
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:52,848
You are one.

484
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,352
Pass.

485
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
According to my analysis.

486
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,888
You three are the most likely werewolves.

487
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:03,360
Who killed me?

488
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,568
I'm a good person.

489
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,296
Because it's my first time to play this.
I don't know how you play it.

490
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,352
I think Ye Muxi is right.

491
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,928
I think we should listen to her.

492
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,128
Today, we're gonna burn

493
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,936
Zhu Shanqi.

494
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:31,936
Come on, tie her up! 
- No!

495
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,968
No, no, not me. Help!

496
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:36,304
Wait!

497
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm done with this.

498
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,712
I'm done burning one of my dear friends every night.

499
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,240
Don't you have any feelings?

500
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,448
Not even a little sympathy?

501
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,352
Every day, guess who is the werewolf.

502
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:51,600
Who are the others.
Have you thought for the werewolves?

503
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,160
This game is so cruel.

504
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,128
Have you? Have you?

505
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,552
Don't you think the werewolves have their reasons?
They don't want to be werewolves, either.

506
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,688
He didn't want to kill anyone.
He has feelings, too.

507
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,448
As from today, I decide,

508
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:09,840
I will find out the werewolves.

509
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,944
I'll help them.

510
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:12,208
You know that?

511
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,592
I'm the witch this time.

512
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,672
Listen, I'll find the cure.

513
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:18,032
I will save the werewolves.

514
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,328
No more killing my friends.
No more killing werewolves.

515
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:21,712
Who?

516
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:24,336
Who is with me?
Me!

517
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:27,216
I'm with you.

518
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:31,936
I'm done with it.

519
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,856
I admit it.

520
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:35,552
I'm the werewolf.

521
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:37,808
I'm the killer.

522
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,096
I don't want to kill anyone anymore.

523
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,672
Every full moon night, I can't control the desire of killing people.

524
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:46,944
Aren't we friends?

525
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:48,880
I hope you can save me.

526
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,640
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.

527
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:52,496
I'm also a werewolf.

528
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:53,872
I support Yezi.

529
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,128
Werewolves should have the right to choose.

530
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,176
I... I don't want to kill anyone anymore.

531
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,872
Do you know how painful it is to kill a person?!

532
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,080
I don't wanna kill anyone.
Yezi, I don't wanna kill anyone anymore.

533
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,496
Okay, we'll save you.

534
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:12,864
Who are we?

535
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,560
We're friends.

536
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:16,240
We're family.

537
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,160
We're family.

538
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:21,440
Right, Yezi, I'm on your side.

539
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,256
We can try to make a cure for the werewolves.

540
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,720
We... We can help.

541
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,848
Maybe there is a way.

542
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:32,064
Right, family.

543
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,976
Family.

544
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,656
Family.

545
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,208
Family.

546
