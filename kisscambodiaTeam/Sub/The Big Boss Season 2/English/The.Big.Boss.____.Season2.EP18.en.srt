00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,968
Episode 36

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,672
You came.

29
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,600
What's wrong, Xiaodong?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,256
Has Liao Danyi been transferred to Class One for a long time?

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,136
You bet.

32
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,152
His seat is empty for so long.
It makes me feel so sad every time when I see the vacancy.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,016
Vacancy is not only on his seat.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,496
What else?

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,544
So is Ye Muxi's seat.

36
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:31,344
Recently, she is either in the library or on the way to it.

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,576
Do you feel that Ye Muxi has changed?

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,168
Right, right. She has turned to a lady.
She is very gentle to everyone.

39
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:40,256
Yeah, even her voice is so gentle.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,392
Right, right. 

41
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:45,696
But her hair looks so pretty.

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,256
Listen, now she is so attentive in class.

43
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,376
No more scrawling.
Right, right. Her score leaps and bounds.

44
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,144
But which one do you like better?

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,808
The new one or the old one?

46
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:05,440
Anyway, makes me feel quite strange.

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,976
Right , right.
It's just.

48
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:09,152
I can't tell.

49
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,112
Right, right.

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,328
I wanted to say this a long time ago.
You all feel that, right?

51
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,400
She is totally different from before.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
She has no energy.

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,408
I don't think she feels happy now.

54
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:22,368
To be honest, we all saw it.

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
Although Ye Muxi has changed in a good way.

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,352
But also in a wrong way.

57
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:28,192
When Liao Danyi left,

58
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:29,872
His all plans have worked.

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,024
He wants to give Ye Muxi a chance to grow up.

60
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,408
Seems she really does.

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,704
But don't you feel she is covering something?

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,816
She is not really happy.

63
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,528
But look,

64
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,528
Liao Danyi and Ye Muxi,

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,280
they two have this weird and tense relationship.

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,600
That can't last forever.

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,904
I miss the old days when we were all together and happy.
Me too.

68
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:58,768
So we're gonna help them.

69
00:03:58,832 --> 00:03:59,840
How?

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,568
That's why I called you here.

71
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:02,800
To discuss how.

72
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:05,824
The way Lian Danyi treated monitor is not what he said.
More bark than bite.

73
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,264
Liao Danyi is so stubborn.

74
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:10,464
Won't say anything.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,704
So we must create a chance.

76
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:15,808
To ask them out.

77
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,855
Talk face to face.

78
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,848
But in their condition,

79
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,880
how to make them two talk nicely?

80
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,208
To let them sit down and talk!

81
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,064
Sit down is not necessary,

82
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,320
as long as they can be in the same space.

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,336
We have to make them stay in the same space.

84
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,240
Lock them behind iron gate.

85
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,616
It can't be a scary place, need to be romantic.

86
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,544
Need some item from the romance story.

87
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,128
It's better at night.

88
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:53,536
With some dim light, will be better.

89
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,984
Since we have the same thoughts,

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,624
the best place for that should be...

91
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,848
School!

92
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,032
Amusement park is fine.

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,704
Since that.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,464
Let's make a plan.

95
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,168
First, on Saturday, I'll hand the ticket to Ye Muxi.

96
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,768
Ask her to the amusement park.

97
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,992
We'll hand one ticket to Liao Danyi.
Ask him to the amusement park.

98
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,304
So they can be together alone.

99
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,400
Saturday, the amusement park is crowded.

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,696
Alone is not possible.

101
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,480
Then let's choose a day off.

102
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:43,264
So I will ask Ye Muxi to the amusement park on the day off.

103
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,376
There's no electric on the day off.

104
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,656
The equipment won't work.

105
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,816
Then we'll turn the power on by ourselves.
How to make them stay together?

106
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,104
To make them play the merry-go-round.

107
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,768
If it's merry-go-round,
they won't be able to talk.

108
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,272
Send them on the sky wheel.

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,616
Light some romantic firework!

110
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,536
Lure Ye Muxi onto the sky wheel by food.

111
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,168
Snacks!

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Then we'll tell Liao Danyi through broadcast that

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,264
Ye Muxi is waiting for him.

114
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,752
Then we steal the key.
Let them go in and close the door!

115
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,264
As long as they can stay alone together,
they'll make it up.

116
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:39,376
Succeed!

117
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:50,528
Sorry.

118
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,304
It's all my fault.

119
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:53,808
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:54,928
I also did wrong.

121
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:57,728
Then, don't transfer to Class One.
We're still friends.

122
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:01,440
Okay, I won't go.

123
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:02,896
We're still friends.

124
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,824
Let's go, let's go.

125
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,672
Time to eat.

126
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,744
Barbecue! Barbecue!

127
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,536
I can't see a flaw.
Then let's do this!

128
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,328
Where're Huang Nan and Huang Yi?

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,984
Where's Shanqi?

130
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:31,856
Xiaodong,

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,544
do you need some mosquito-repellent?

132
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:35,856
It's okay, I'm fine.

133
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:43,280
Shanqi, why're you laughing.

134
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:47,040
When it occurs to me that Ye Muxi and Liao Danyi

135
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,832
will be back together because of us,

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,328
I feel so happy.

137
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:55,648
Hope nothing will go wrong.

138
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,232
It won't.

139
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,144
Everything is under our control.

140
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
The lovers finally are back together.

141
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,176
We played a critical role.

142
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,504
Later, we'll light this firework into the sky.

143
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,912
So romantic!

144
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:14,320
Li.

145
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,232
Do you remember Hua from bumper cars factory?

146
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,984
Yes.

147
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,736
Every morning at a quarter past eight,
she will pass by my door on time.

148
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:26,592
In a pink bath towel.

149
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,768
Don't wander too far.
Back to our topic,

150
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,736
See, in so many philosophies.

151
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,623
Why Hitler chose Nietzsche?

152
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,640
Such an aggressive kind?

153
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,432
If he didn't choose him,

154
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,328
Would the history change to a totally different direction?

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,008
In that world,

156
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,984
Will Hua still be covered by a bath towel?

157
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,864
The starry sky is so beautiful.

158
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,304
Yes.

159
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:02,928
Under that starry sky,

160
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:06,864
Our sky wheel looks even prettier.

161
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:07,872
Right.

162
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,344
So pretty.

163
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:14,752
Li, isn't today should be the day off?

164
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,520
The sky wheel should be dark.

165
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,400
Oh, screwed!

166
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,680
Let's go. Let's go.

167
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:26,400
But why are they still not here?

168
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,912
No worries.

169
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:28,336
- So many mosquitos here.
- No worries, no worries.

170
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:29,216
It's okay.

171
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,296
It's so late.

172
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:40,800
What're you doing here?
None of your business.

173
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
Security.

174
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:46,352
Stop!

175
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,808
Stop running!

176
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,432
What's wrong?

177
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,272
What is that sound?

178
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
What's going on?

179
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,736
Li. Li.

180
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,424
Seems our firework has exploded.

181
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:16,288
No.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,984
Huang Nan, Huang Yi.

183
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,408
Someone is after them!

184
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:20,048
Run!
Hurry, run!

185
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,656
Stop running! Stop!

186
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,080
Stop!

187
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:27,824
Stop running! 

188
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:37,312
Snacks.

189
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,360
Who is that?

190
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,424
Who opened the equipment?

191
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,384
Where's that?
Who stole our key?

192
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,168
You.
You, don't run!

193
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:49,584
Don't run!
Stop her, stop her!

194
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,200
Don't run!

195
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,912
Don't run!

196
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:56,064
Over there!

197
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,128
-Ye Muxi!
-We finally catch you.

198
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,392
Ye Muxi, are you okay?

199
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,368
What're you doing here?

200
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,136
Who is he?
I'm security.

201
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:11,856
Who are you?

202
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:12,960
Li.

203
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:14,272
Li.

204
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:15,504
Are you okay?

205
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,656
It's not right.

206
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,736
Shouldn't he faint after I hit him?

207
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,152
You two, come with me to the security room!

208
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:23,936
Tell me

209
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,048
How did you get the key?

210
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:28,336
Sorry, sir.

211
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:32,112
I know this doesn't seem true.

212
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:36,048
But I really don't know it's the day off.

213
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,752
In fact, I think I have figured out the whole thing.

214
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,456
I think should be some students from 
our Class ten planned this for some reason.

215
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,856
Our Class Ten?

216
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,760
You're no longer from Class Ten.

217
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
What the heck are you talking about?

218
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:56,064
It's so obvious, okay?
You're just a couple who sneaked in to date, right?

219
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:00,416
A pretty girl and a handsome boy.

220
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,776
Must be a couple.
This couple feeling.

221
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
Makes us so jealous.
Thought provoking!

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Look at you young generation.

223
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Knows nothing about rules!

224
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,272
Have seen too many movies?

225
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,872
Too many idol dramas?

226
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:15,952
It's late in the night?

227
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,344
Romantic?
You're disturbing someone, you know?

228
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,448
You've affected people's life, you know?

229
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,640
I was gonna watch my Baskets tonight.

230
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,544
I was gonna watch Horace And Pete.
And you...you opened the equipment?!

231
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,256
Do you know how much electric you've wasted?
If boss finds out,

232
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,720
he'll deduct our wages, you know?!

233
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,784
Our wages are so poor already, you know?!

234
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:36,768
It'll be harder for us to find a girlfriend, you know?!
Watching you two showing off your love
makes us more angrier, you know?!

235
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:41,360
What's that called?

236
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,656
Single dog abuse.
Right!

237
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:45,824
Not right!

238
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:46,704
You're a dog.

239
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:47,984
No, Li.

240
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,328
That's harsh.
It's what exactly you were thinking !

241
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,120
What...what I mean to say is...

242
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:56,000
Flashbomb. Right, flashbomb!

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,752
What flashbomb?

244
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,240
The word you're thinking was single dog abuse.

245
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,816
No. I swear I was gonna say flashbomb!

246
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,672
You swear? What's that gonna do?

247
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:07,632
What do you mean?

248
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,552
You know what I mean.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,192
Say it, out.

250
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:14,512
Never mind.
Say it.

251
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,944
I hate people when they save a half.

252
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,584
I know what you wanna say.
Must be about the poker game that night!

253
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,648
You must have cheated!

254
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:26,304
I didn't. I didn't. I didn't!

255
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,584
I've told you a hundred times!

256
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:29,360
My card was folded.

257
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,296
What a coincidence.

258
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:32,208
You folded two, three and five
To against my leopard?

259
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,456
And you won me twelve in one round!
I'm say it on my parents' name.

260
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:37,536
You still won't believe me?!
I gave you twelve.

261
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,736
You insisted!

262
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,528
Listen ,if I knew you don't believe me.

263
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:44,144
I wouldn't take that money.
Enough, enough. Stop it.

264
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,696
Aren't you ashamed?

265
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,520
I mean it.

266
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,376
If you don't believe me, I'll return it now.

267
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,552
I said I believe you.
This is over, over.

268
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,456
Now.

269
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,656
Listen to me.

270
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,896
Money doesn't matters.

271
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,216
But reputation does!

272
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:12,624
Heine said it, life can't blossom in lies.

273
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:13,664
Tagore also said it,
The hypocritical sincerity is more hideous than devils.

274
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,376
Fine.

275
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,168
There's no point in this.

276
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,328
Just twelve Rmb.

277
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:23,456
I'll return it now!

278
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:25,488
One.

279
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:26,832
Two.

280
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:36,432
Students, do you have ten yuan?

281
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,920
Us?

282
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
Yes, yes. Lend it to me.

283
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,904
I have.

284
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:40,880
Lend it to me.

285
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,608
I'll return it via Wechat.

286
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:47,152
Well..

287
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,592
I'll scan yours.

288
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:49,360
Scan, scan.

289
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:51,360
Okay.

290
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,296
Receive.
Click Receive.

291
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,816
Thanks.

292
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:05,584
Where did Ye Muxi and Lian Danyi go?

293
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:08,384
Who knows, our priority should be hiding from those two guards.

294
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,576
They two are quite scary.

295
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,720
When can we leave this place?

296
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,080
So worried.

297
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,896
So, we can leave...
Sit back.

298
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,512
Do you have any idea what kind of trouble you're in today?

299
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:25,168
Although I don't know which law you're against.
But there must be one!!

300
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:32,400
Although you both are good-looking,

301
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,752
maybe we'll let you go without calling the police.

302
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:40,528
Don't think before your political lesson by us,

303
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:41,792
we would let you leave.

304
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,056
No, I mean.

305
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,232
It's their first time.

306
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,784
Just let them go.

307
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,424
Why're you looking at me like this?
You're doing this again.

308
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,224
What do you mean by that?

309
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:55,856
You're always like this.

310
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,616
You have to go against me every time.

311
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,360
Do you know how much he likes to be a teacher?

312
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,152
Last time, we went to eat the Northeast cuisine.

313
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,272
I only said one word.

314
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:09,744
It's tasty.

315
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,376
Next time when we go to Northeast.

316
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,056
We must try some authentic Northeast cuisine.

317
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,224
Then this man,

318
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,512
he had given a long speech of There's no such thing in Northeast

319
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,432
during that meal!

320
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:24,304
This course is invented by the outsiders to mock the Northeast people.

321
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,064
It's just a meal!
It's a knowledge point okay?

322
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,440
So you can learn something over a meal.

323
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,704
I don't want that.
I just want to have my dinner peacefully!

324
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,568
Look, you're over thirty.

325
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,488
Why you just don't want to learn anything like a kid?

326
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:36,384
Who is like a kid?

327
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,152
Look, you don't know him.

328
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:40,608
He and I are roommates.

329
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,408
He can't even take care of himself.

330
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:45,280
Threw his underwear everywhere.

331
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,744
Never put the trash in the trashcan.

332
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:48,896
You can't imagine
how painful it is to live with this man.

333
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:53,872
I can.

334
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:55,792
How could you say that?

335
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,904
You think what you do is clean and tidy?
It's called crazy!

336
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,392
Always scrubbing your security badge.
His clothes are either in washing or drying in the sun.

337
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,608
That never ends.

338
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,792
The worst is,

339
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,655
the most disgusting thing is,

340
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:11,968
he even cut his vibrissa on time.

341
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:13,104
His vibrissa!
A weirdo, right?

342
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,704
That's weird.

343
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:17,424
But if you don't cut it,

344
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:18,752
would you let it show out in the air?

345
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:19,552
Exactly.

346
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,063
We've been working together for two years.

347
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,792
We almost spend every day together.
This man,

348
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,048
one day, I asked him for a hundred yuan.
I lend it from him.

349
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:30,704
He told me, 

350
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:33,040
I must return it in one week.

351
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,888
Otherwise, I must pay him two hundred.

352
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,744
I didn't think twice and said okay.

353
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:39,056
I lent in on Wednesday,

354
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,752
And I paid him back the next Wednesday.

355
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,960
He still asked me to pay him two hundred.

356
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,488
Did you miss something?

357
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:47,664
Did you pay it back on Wednesday?

358
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,288
It was a quarter past zero o'clock on Thursday.
A quarter.

359
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:53,296
Fifteen minutes!

360
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:56,192
What's the big deal!

361
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,472
That's away too far.

362
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,136
If you knew that,

363
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:00,640
Why you didn't it earlier?

364
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:05,210
That has no human feelings.

365
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:06,448
It's not about human feelings.
It's a principle.

366
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,912
What's not a friend should do!

367
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:10,016
What do you mean by that?
Fine. What about Li?

368
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,736
What about her?

369
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,904
Listen to me,

370
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:19,024
Li is a girl who is quite close to us.

371
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,744
She operates the merry-go-around in our park.

372
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,296
We are quite close.

373
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,512
One day, we went to sing in a KTV bar.
He was busy, so he didn't come.

374
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:31,104
So me and Li were playing truth or Dare.

375
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,576
There's one topic ,I got dare.

376
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,352
So I kinda kissed Li.

377
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:39,040
I promised Li that I will never tell anyone.
But I can't bear it. so I told him.

378
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,056
So I told him, do not tell Li about it.

379
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,696
Don't let her know that he knew I kissed her.
And he promised he wouldn't tell Li.

380
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:48,352
Then what?

381
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:50,240
Li came to play with us the next day.

382
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:52,160
The first thing he said is

383
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,904
I heard you two kissed yesterday.

384
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:57,872
How could you do this?

385
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,280
That just came out.

386
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,672
I didn't mean to.

387
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,984
Just came out?

388
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,488
Do you know that hurts Zhang and Li?

389
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,288
Do you know that you let Zhang down?

390
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:09,824
He said it just came out.

391
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:11,120
Why do you have to criticize him?
That's enough.

392
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,136
The power of word could raise a dead from the grave.

393
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:16,432
Could bury a person alive.
Could turn a dwarf into a dinosaur.

394
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,840
Could break a dinosaur.

395
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,152
Look, look.

396
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:22,144
More lessons.

397
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,552
You're always like this.

398
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:26,880
Why all the trifles are big troubles in your mouth?!

399
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:30,048
Because nothing of you is just a trifle to me!

400
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:31,408
What?

401
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:34,688
Zhang.

402
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:38,880
Listen, I can't stand you anymore.

403
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:44,432
Tell me, are you gonna never let go that thing about Li forever?
Yes, so what?

404
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
We're over.

405
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:53,168
We're over. What's the big deal?!

406
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,944
Okay.

407
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,184
Two years' relationship.

408
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,120
You just gonna throw it away?

409
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:01,120
It's not that easy.

410
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,496
You said it's over.

411
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:04,784
What do you want?
A big fight at least!

412
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,688
How dare you?
-You think I don't dare to touch you?
-Come on.

413
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,296
Come and touch me.
Here, take this.

414
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:13,376
No, no, don't.
Too soft!

415
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,504
You should do it like this.

416
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,176
Like this!
No, no, don't.

417
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,984
Don't.

418
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:22,720
Don't, don't. Enough. Stop.

419
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,016
Enough, enough.

420
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,760
Don't fight.

421
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,368
Bro, bro.

422
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,904
Bro, don't.

423
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,288
Does it hurt?

424
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm okay.

425
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:48,992
Why are you so silly?

426
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:50,208
Hit yourself.

427
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,568
You girls know nothing.

428
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:54,944
I know it.

429
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,752
You didn't want to hurt Zhang.
But you didn't want your friendship to end like this.

430
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,064
So you put up some drama to imply him.

431
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:06,864
Right?

432
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,520
In fact, Zhang cares about you.

433
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:16,416
He doesn't.

434
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:20,976
If he doesn't care about you, he wouldn't say so much.

435
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,776
The truth is, every thing he said about you is true.

436
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:25,856
But you're proud.

437
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,280
You don't want to admit.

438
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,432
You wanna change.

439
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:32,592
But you don't him to know you care about those things he said.

440
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,376
So...

441
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:35,232
In a sword,

442
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:36,624
You're too proud.

443
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,624
You should go apologize.

444
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,464
Why should I?

445
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,256
You know it.

446
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:48,064
You're too strict with him.

447
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:52,096
Although I saw you didn't really to hurt him.

448
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,928
But how could you do that to your good friend?

449
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,008
What you did was wrong.

450
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,408
I don't understand it.
What I did...

451
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:03,392
He always talks without thinking first,

452
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:04,592
he has upset so many people.

453
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:06,384
There're not a lot people in the park would talk to him.

454
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:07,536
What I did 

455
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:09,088
is for his good.

456
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:09,952
I know.

457
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:12,464
But have you put yourself in his shoes?

458
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,008
You two came here at the same time.

459
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,168
You're better than him in every aspect.

460
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:19,600
Won't that hurt his pride?

461
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:21,904
You keep saying that he wouldn't change.

462
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,992
What about you?

463
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:27,120
Have you thought about how to change him in a better way?

464
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:28,800
Besides,

465
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
What do you expect of him?

466
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,688
To change him into you?

467
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:37,072
Who told you your life is better than his?

468
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,744
Is he the only person who doesn't want to change?

469
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:46,208
But he is so annoying.

470
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,344
Then why are you willing to spent so much time with him?

471
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:53,328
In fact, you also admire him.

472
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,072
You also want to be like him. 

473
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,200
Excellent and perfect.

474
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:01,792
In fact, you also thought about
to live a real life like him everyday.

475
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:05,552
Just being honest.

476
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:06,992
Would that be happier.

477
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,096
He is the only one in the world who understands you the most.

478
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,656
So if he disappeared like this,

479
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:15,808
wouldn't that be a pity?

480
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
In fact you know it.

481
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,632
What you felt about him is more like curious and admire.

482
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,448
Because he is always doing something against your experience.

483
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,080
But still so happy.

484
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,840
You didn't know when did he become 

485
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:35,584
your only connection with this world.

486
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,488
You know it.

487
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,160
He is not that bad like you said.

488
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,280
You complain so much, just want to draw him closer.

489
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,200
So you can reach him easily.

490
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:47,152
In fact you should see it earlier.

491
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,440
You wanted to change him so much.

492
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,680
But in the end, you're the one who is changed.

493
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,736
You can't erase him.

494
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:03,968
Because he has become the most important part in your life.

495
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,288
So go and apologize.

496
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:07,856
To your best friend.

497
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:12,384
So go make it up.

498
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:13,776
With your enemy.

499
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,432
Well...

500
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,736
Li is such an easy l girl.

501
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:28,320
She has been seeing our manager a long time ago.
And she is flirting with our colleagues.

502
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,200
I don't want to see you get hurt.

503
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,896
So I did it on purpose.

504
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,688
Why you didn't tell me earlier?

505
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:39,312
I think things like this don't need explanation.
No, I mean, are you a fool?

506
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:42,160
I'm a fool.

507
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:43,824
I'm the biggest fool.

508
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:46,816
Zhang!

509
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:47,888
Li!

510
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:02,160
Well...

511
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:03,728
Can we leave now?

512
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,704
Where... Where are you going?
Let's have kebabs together!

513
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,736
No. No. Don't you see?

514
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,688
We've detained this young couple for a long time.

515
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:13,648
They still have to...

516
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:14,816
No. That...

517
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,368
We're really not a couple.

518
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,720
Understand. We understand.

519
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,384
Why do you wink at me?

520
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:22,496
Right, Li.

521
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,920
It occurs to me that your book called Love in the Time of Cholera,

522
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,752
is still in my place.
I gotta go get it to you.

523
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:31,584
It seems that tomorrow, our company's stage-play team

524
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,104
is gonna rehearse Uncle Vanya!

525
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,056
-Yes. We haven't recite our lines yet!
-Yes.
Let's go. Hurry. Hurry.

526
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,384
Let's go.

527
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,952
We...

528
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,216
Don't say anything.

529
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:12,960
Don't need to say anything.

530
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:14,784
No matter why you came here.

531
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:16,128
And leave here.

532
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,464
We'll forever give you our best wishes.

533
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,104
Remember to come visit us often.

534
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:25,520
Bye-bye.

535
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:02,496
Ye Muxi.

536
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:04,320
Ye Muxi.

537
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,640
Do you remember we played hide-and-seek when we were kids?

538
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,936
That time, I went to the Olympian math class.
I left you alone out there.

539
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:10,192
I ignored you.

540
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:11,776
That made me very guilty.

541
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:14,848
So since then, I thought I should be responsible for your growth.

542
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,760
That's why I missed one exam and came to Class Ten.

543
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,280
Because I was concerned about you.

544
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,352
In fact, I didn't send Xiaotian to the Animal Control.

545
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:25,792
I adopted him by myself.

546
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:27,568
Later, I was afraid that I can't take good care of him.

547
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,344
So I entrusted Mr Wu to take care of him.

548
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:31,728
Now he's living a good life.

549
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:33,072
I check upon him every week.

550
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:34,896
In fact, I also didn't blame you for what happened to grandma.

551
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:37,248
Because you accompanied her to spend her last days wonderfully.

552
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,552
In fact, I didn't want to transfer to Class One.
But my father threatened me.

553
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,896
If I didn't, he would come to our school and make trouble for you.

554
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,384
So I did.

555
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,312
All right, I'm done.

556
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,888
Don't feel guilty.

557
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,240
Aren't you silly?

558
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,008
You're always like this.

559
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:02,240
Everything you do, you think it's for my good.

560
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,712
And then be proud of yourself.

561
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:04,784
Am I Superman?

562
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,176
Do I know what you're thinking about?
If you don't tell me, how could I know?

563
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:08,208
Can I read mind?

564
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,952
Superman can't read mind. He can only fly.

565
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:10,592
Nonsense.

566
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:12,656
His... His eyes can emit laser!
The point is not about that laser.

567
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,184
Forget it. I don't want to argue with you.

568
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:16,912
Do I want to argue with you?

569
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:18,864
What kind of good student are you?

570
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,928
You're totally an idiot!
You think you can shoulder everything by yourself?

571
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,576
Are you... Are you looking down upon me?

572
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:25,872
I...

573
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:28,080
Liao Danyi.

574
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:29,744
Listen to me.
From now on, don't hide anything from me.

575
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:34,528
No matter it's good or bad, you're gonna tell me!

576
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:35,728
And we'll shoulder it together!

577
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:36,672
Because...

578
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,856
Because I'm your boss.

579
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,312
Hear me?

580
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,040
Got it.

581
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,712
My boss.

582
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:06,880
Wait a minute!

583
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:10,270
Don't be like this. Don't.

584
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,552
Lucky that we came in time.
Otherwise you're gonna fight again!

585
00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:13,536
Yes. Yes.

586
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:14,400
Sorry.

587
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,760
This is my idea.

588
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
It was gonna help you patch things up.
Didn't expect...

589
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:22,992
It's okay. We patched things up.

590
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:24,240
Really?

591
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,808
That's great!

592
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:27,504
Liao Danyi doesn't need to go to Class One, then.

593
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,752
Still need to.

594
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,472
All the formalities are handled.

595
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:33,280
Can't be kidding before such things.

596
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,432
How could this happen?

597
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:36,352
Didn't you patch things up?

598
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,152
Yes.
The storyline should be, after you patch things up,

599
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,976
you volunteer to go back to Class Ten.

600
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:42,464
And we give high fives!

601
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:44,560
And we've already chosen our BGM.

602
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,536
It goes like this.

603
00:29:48,864 --> 00:29:49,664
All right.

604
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,584
What on earth are you talking about?

605
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:53,536
Life is not a written idol opera.

606
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:55,584
How could we just do whatever we like?

607
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,256
But it's fun just because of that.

608
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,312
Right, Shanqi?

609
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,328
Let's play sky wheel?

610
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:06,656
Better not.

611
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:08,144
Those two guards...

612
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,528
They're on our side now.

613
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,112
We could play whatever we like.

614
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:15,888
It seems that you really want Li and Zhang lose their job?

615
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,920
Target, sky wheel.

616
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,736
Go!

617
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,816
I'll stay with Xiaodong! Let's go!

618
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:24,688
Shen Wei.

619
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:26,352
Shen Wei.

620
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:29,952
In fact, I've fallen for you long ago.

621
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:32,400
Sorry.

622
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
You're not my type.

623
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:35,728
Look, she refuses you!

624
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:37,456
Only takes half a second this time.

625
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:39,584
What about me? Me?

626
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,976
This is okay.

627
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:14,576
Miss Xinyi.

628
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:15,936
You're upset?

629
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:18,512
No.

630
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:22,064
But you always cross your fingers when you're upset.

631
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:23,904
And lean against the back of the chair.

632
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,712
Won't sit very tight.

633
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:32,816
I'm upset or not, doesn't it have anything to do with you?

634
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:34,192
Aren't you annoying?

635
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,472
Yes, I might be upset.

636
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:37,280
But do you have any way to solve my trouble?

637
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,256
You don't.

638
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:42,304
Can you leave me alone for a while?

639
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:50,208
When you feel upset, eat snacks.

640
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:53,408
This is your favorite snack since you were a kid.

641
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:56,000
Eat some and you'll feel better.

642
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:03,872
If you don't want to eat the snack, it's okay.

643
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,544
Last time, you said that you like little animals.

644
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:07,808
Paper cranes.

645
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,432
So I learned how to make paper cranes.

646
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,864
Now I can fold one very quickly.

647
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,064
Six seconds for each.

648
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:17,872
If giving ten minutes, one hundred paper cranes.

649
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,984
If you need, I can fold one at any time.

650
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:28,416
If you don't want to see me,

651
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:30,272
I can put it in the drawer.

652
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,640
If you want one, just pick it up.

653
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:39,600
And...

654
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,880
Last time, I broke your mug by mistake.

655
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,496
I've fixed it.

656
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:50,128
Look.
Although it looks uneven, it becomes very burly.

657
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,312
And I've disinfected it.
It can be used. Don't worry.

658
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:00,080
I know, it means a lot to you.

659
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:01,952
If you can't use it,

660
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,568
I'll order another one online.

661
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:05,568
Delivered in two days. Very fast.

662
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:10,640
No need.

663
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:12,896
This one will do.

664
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:22,288
Tell me.

665
00:33:23,744 --> 00:33:25,200
What's so good about me?

666
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:27,840
Why do you have to follow me all the time?

667
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:29,024
Why?

668
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:31,632
You're the blooming flowers over the trees.

669
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:34,160
You're a swallow twittering between the beams.

670
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:35,952
You're love.

671
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,008
You're warmth.

672
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,432
You're hope.

673
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:41,696
You are the spring of this world.

674
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,352
As long as you're happy, I'll be happy.

675
00:33:56,464 --> 00:33:58,224
Don't you know you're really childish?

676
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:01,328
Pasted the mug with stick band.
How could I drink water from it, then?

677
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,176
And these snacks.

678
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,352
We're not allowed to eat snacks in school!

679
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,439
Don't you know?

680
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:22,944
Be happy, Miss Xinyi.

681
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,359
As long as you're happy, I'll be happy.

682
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,424
Wipe your tears.

683
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,744
What tears?

684
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:37,552
Did you see me crying?

685
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,864
Or shedding tears?

686
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,600
You're lightning. You're light.

687
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,288
You're the only legend.

688
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,048
I only love you.
You're my superstar.

720
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:34,720
# After class, we laugh and sing #

721
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,928
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #

722
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,528
# On the way to the future #

723
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:42,944
# Thunder and storm won't matter #

724
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,440
# Forever young heartbeats #

725
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,064
# Head held high, stride forward #

726
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:52,240
# Dream big, break the limits #

727
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,768
# Blue sky, green campus (handsome lads) #

728
00:37:56,768 --> 00:38:00,704
# Review the new self again and again #

729
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,616
# Memory speeds up, give full play to youth #

730
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,728
# Head held high, stride forward #

731
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:10,064
# Dream big, break the limits #

732
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:14,576
# Work hard for the future world (no limits) #

733
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:18,736
# Draw one thousand and one fairy tale plots #

734
00:38:18,928 --> 00:38:23,472
# Growth speeds up, give full play to youth #

735
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:50,080
Are you happy?

736
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,824
Yes.

737
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:52,960
What about you?

738
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,840
In fact, I don't like the colorful running.

739
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,848
Pigments go into eyes.

740
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:58,640
And clothes become hard to wash.

741
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,112
Like many things.

742
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,744
It looks more wonderful than you experience it.

743
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:09,392
Well, are you happy?

744
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,576
Yes.

745
00:39:29,776 --> 00:39:30,672
Liao.

746
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:31,984
Didn't you go to Class One?

747
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:33,120
Why come back?

748
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:36,112
I missed one course during the class transferring exam.
