How the steel was tempered?

144
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,780
You were not reading it at all!

145
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780

146
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,250
Still pretending?

147
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,250
You're pretending that you're well educated, right?

148
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,370
No. I...I didn't.

I told my mom.

151

You can't trust a blind date.

152
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,290
And she dressed me like this.

153
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,930
So embarrassing. Bye.

154
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,800

155
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,020

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,290
Open the door!

159
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,800
That's how we met the first time.

160
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,450
How is that? Exciting?

161
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,700
Amazing, like a story.

163
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,130
Look what you said. Bummer.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,380
Then what?

165
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,880
Then?

166
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,920
Then, in two ticks.

167
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,880
We were in the Republic of China era.

168
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,010
There were so many people in the capital.

169
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,730
Why are you following me?

170
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,410
I told you, I have a bad impression about you.

171
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,880
I...

172
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,760
I want to confess to you something.

173
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,420
I did see you since you were still far.

174
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,970
But...

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,610
I wanted to leave a good impression.

176
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,890
So I was quite embarrassing.

177
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,610
So, I stood there.

178
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,210
Quite nervous.

179
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,780
You were nervous?

180
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,340
Yes.

181
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,610
I was quite nervous as well.

182
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,980
After grandma started to talk.

183
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,640
She couldn't stop.

184
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,200
She started to tell me the story about her and grandpa.

185
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,980
Even I can tell.

186
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,090
Some of that is true, some not.

187
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,140
Because that had jumped from
Song dynasty to Republic of China era.

188
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,100
And the location ranged
from the Imperial Palace to Mt. Hua.

189
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,780
But I still enjoy it.

190
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,120
Because it's a story.

191
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,980
Story is memory with imagination, right?

192
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,740
Why do they look like me and Liao Danyi?

193
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,500
What're you thinking about?!

194
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,440
Make it easier for you to understand. Just that.

195
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,770
Okay.

196
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,450
A bottle of wine for your girl?

197
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,850
Thanks, thanks.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,210
You keep this.

199
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Then we came to the age to get married.

200
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,880
That's quite exciting.

201
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,780
Once more....

202
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,840
You open the door....

203
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,960
Honorable judges, dear classmates. Good morning.

204
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,380
Welcome to the first school-level debate competition.

205
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,980
Today is the final debate competition.

206
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,700
First, Let me introduce the Pros: Boya Middle School.

207
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,210
And the Cons: Maple Leaf Middle School.

208
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,140
Today, our topic for debating is

209
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Whether it's unfilial to say no to the elders.

210
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,020
Menci said, a filial son should respect the elders.

211
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,850
They not only gave us our life.

212
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,920
And they raised us.

213
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,370
They worried about us, day and night.

214
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,450
Even the animals know to love their parents.

215
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,080
Don't we humans need to?

216
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,320
The opposite side, I think you have mixed two conceptions.

217
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,860
We have never denied anything about respecting our parents.

218
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,290
or being filial to parents.

219
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Respecting and being filial to parents

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,520
doesn't mean to do whatever they say.

221
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:48,240
Menci didn't say a filial son
should obey all of orders from parents.

222
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,570
But when they get old.

223
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,000
We're all they have.

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
If we do things against their wishes,

225
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,730
wouldn't that make them feel sad?

226
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,130
Don't you feel it hurtful?

227
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,060
The opposite side,

228
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,580
I think you should understand
which one is more important,

229
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,090
one moment or a lifetime?

230
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,940
If you do wrong things
against principles to make parents happy.

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,720
Is that the real filial thing to do?

232
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
People all make mistakes.

233
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,660
So at that time,

234
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,140
people around them should
help them to make the right choice.

235
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,490
Not play up to them.

236
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,580
The opposite team doesn't want
to disobey their parent to upset them.

237
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,200
Then are you willing
to watch them make bigger mistakes?

238
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,800
Until there's nothing can be done?

239
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,980
Bitter pills, and sweet poison.

240
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,880
I think you don't need me to explain it.

241
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,290
I totally disagree the square one debate on my side.

242
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
Student, which side are you on?

243
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,450
Can't get me!

244
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,490
Stop running.

245
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,580
- Catch ya!
- You can't!

246
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
You can't!

247
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,970
So beautiful.

248
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,770
Such a beautiful view.

249
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,220
Let me recite a poem for you.

250
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,690
Like you play music with the woods.

251
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,860
Please consider me as your musical instrument.

252
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,090
Even my leaf would wither like the woods do.

253
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,280
Your extraordinarily harmonious and strong spirit,

254
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,180
will make a deep autumn song from me and the woods.

255
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,440
Your strong soul is also my soul.

256
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,610
I will become the strong you.

257
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,850
Please let me...

258
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,940
Why are you sleeping?

259
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,850
It's so boring.

260
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,840
-Always recite poems.
-Get up.

261
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,380
Poems are very beautiful.

262
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,930
I like this poem very much.

263
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,660
I hope you will like it too.

264
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,050
I told you to read more books.

265
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,140
But you wouldn't listen.

266
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,680
When we met the first time.

267
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,800
I was reading how is steel was tempered.

268
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,340
You said I was posing.

269
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,090
Right. Because that book is not interesting.

270
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,600
Then what do you like?

271
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
I can climb the tree.

272
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,530
Let's race. See who will get to the top first.

273
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,250
Come down. It's too dangerous.

274
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,980
I can do it.

275
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,760
Be careful.

276
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,660
Come down.

277
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,250
I'll catch you.

278
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,850
Come.

279
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,980
Come down.

280
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,080
Come down.

281
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,760
I can catch you.

282
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,900
I can catch you, jump.

283
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,370
You...

284
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,250
What are you doing?

285
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,580
Nothing.

286
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,640
Then why didn't you hold my hands?

287
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,040
They said that will make you pregnant.

288
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,780
Is that too soon?

289
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,400
Slow down. Slow down.

290
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,760
So we joined hands

291
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,530
to China Photo Studio in Wangfujing streets

292
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,280
and took a marriage photo.

293
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,760
It's colorphoto.

294
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,820
I was wearing a red apparel.

295
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,740
Your grandpa was wearing a Chinese tunic suit.

296
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,610
He used some hair oil

297
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,620
So handsome!

298
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,970
The opposite side two square.

299
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,620
How do you comprehend the word "NO"?

300
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,140
"NO" means to deny and reject.

301
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,820
So you have denied your parents?

302
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,530
Of course not.

303
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,410
So what kind of people do you think your parents are?

304
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,080
My parents are excellent and great.

305
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,200
and caring.

306
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,960
So you admire your parents

307
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,090
Respect your parents?

308
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,060
You can say that.

309
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,130
So can I say you're filial kid?

310
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,050
Of course I am.

311
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,520
So according to you,

312
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,650
A kid who respects her/his parents
without going against them

313
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,200
should be considered as a filial kid?

314
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,290
Well, well.

315
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,760
So, cherish that, students.

316
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,330
Time lapses.

317
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,020
The elders don't have too much time with us.

318
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,740
To do things they want

319
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,280
for us, it's not much.

320
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,360
But for them, it can bring them huge happiness.

321
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,200
What other reasons do we have to not cherish that?

322
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,770
So we should seize the moment.

323
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,540
Don't let them down.

324
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,090
Xiao Yuwei. You really shot a bullet!

325
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,500
Of course I will.
Don't you remember what you have done?

326
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,800
Xiao Yuwei, do you really have to?

327
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,010
What do you mean?

328
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,780
That's necessary!

329
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,330
You did a wrong thing.
Of course you should get this.

330
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,400
All these dramas.

331
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,260
It's just about an electronic blanket!

332
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,360
What electronic blanket?

333
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,340
You're doing this again.

334
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,290
You're always like this.

335
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,930
Never take my word seriously.

336
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,210
I said I was wrong.

337
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,210
I said it. okay?

338
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,020
When did you say that?

339
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,180
Not okay. You are doing this again.

340
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,080
Every time when you admit you're wrong.

341
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,660
You'll say. I was wrong, okay?

342
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,100
What okay? Is that a threat?

343
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,530
You don't mean it at all!

344
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,010
Your apology is not serious.

345
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,780
If you really think you were wrong.

346
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,220
You wouldn't say that.

347
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,420
Did I mean to piss you off?

348
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,680
I... I was trying to reason with you.

349
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,250
-You always shoot me.
-No more that!

350
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,330
Of course I'm right. Come on.

351
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,240
I didn't fire, okay?

352
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,360
You didn't fire,

353
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,010
but you hurt me by words!

354
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,890
My heart is broken, bleeding.

355
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,460
I... Take this!

356
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,690
Come here, come here.

357
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,760
I said come here, come here!

358
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,010
I'm gonna fire.

359
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,880
Come on.

360
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,460
- I'm gonna fire!
- Yeah, really?

361
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,450
I'm gonna fire!

362
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,320
You really did?!

363
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,370
You shoot me?

364
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,000
If you keep doing it, I'll throw it.

365
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,570
Come on, throw it. you dare?

366
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,930
Bully me, bully me.

367
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,460
You open fire on me!

368
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,560
I want divorce! Divorce!

369
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,770
Why did I marry you?

370
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,380
I want divorce. Come here!

371
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,330
One. Two. Three!

372
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,780
Today, this problem must be settled.

373
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,860
You will not let me explain it no matter what?

374
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
Of course not.

375
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,540
I have my reason.

376
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,220
But you can't beat my son!

377
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,090
I was teaching him.

378
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,520
He is also my son.

379
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,170
You know that? You heart doesn't hurt?

380
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,530
But he stole from people.

381
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,480
You should talk to him nicely.

382
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,360
Talk to him nicely? Did he listen?

383
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,840
But you can't beat him!

384
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,490
I'm his father.

385
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,730
I should teach him.

386
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,450
He said he didn't mean to do it.

387
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,850
-He didn't mean to steal it?
-He picked it from the floor.

388
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,040
You're his mother.

389
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,380
A kid steals pins will be a thief who steals gold.

390
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,840
You spoil him too much.

391
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,720
What if he grows up and becomes a bad guy?

392
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,560
Enough.

393
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,000
Don't be angry.

394
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,180
I'll talk to him nicely next time.

395
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,850
Don't be angry.

396
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,640
If you beat him, I'll beat you.

397
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,840
Okay.

398
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,800
Don't be angry.

399
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,220
Grandma, you're here.

400
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,440
Yezi, I didn't realize I said that much today.

401
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,290
Why do I always talk so much whenever I see you?

402
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,920
I heard you live nearby.

403
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,860
Right.

404
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,130
Take grandma to check your place.

405
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,180
Wh....why?

406
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,090
Don't ask why.

407
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,120
Take grandma to your place now.

408
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,280
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

409
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,770
Nice speech from Pros Square three.

410
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,580
Let's hear the statement from Cons Square One.

411
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,760
Today's topic is actually a problem in my life.

412
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,770
Before I came here,

413
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,740
I had to make a choice.

414
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,000
My grandma, she loves me so much.

415
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,140
She loves everyone in my family.

416
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,220
But now she is more than eighty years old.

417
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,160
Sometimes, she could be
a painful choice in our family.

418
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,850
So, what is the best for the elders.

419
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,900
I ask myself a thousand times everyday in my heart.

420
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,900
I don't want to talk about now and forever.

421
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:19,770
To be honest.

422
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,210
I treat everyday like it's the last day we have together.

423
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,080
Danyi, tell your dad.

424
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,130
If he doesn't want me.

425
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,820
Then just ignore me.

426
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
Why did he send me here?

427
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,660
With these people around every day,

428
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,730
I'm not happy, you know?

429
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,490
I can go out rent a house myself.

430
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,810
I can make money.

431
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,600
I can raise myself.

432
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
I won't be his problem.

433
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,500
You know that? Okay?

434
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,050
Grandma. Don't talk nonsense, okay?

435
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,140
I'm not talking nonsense!

436
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,860
My dear grandson.
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

437
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,730
Grandma. I...

438
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,160
Since you all think I'm crazy.

439
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,300
Fine, I'm crazy.

440
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,260
You're all spies of Vilter.

441
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,540
Get out! Get out!

442
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,610
Get out!

443
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,420
Grandma. What do you want to say?

444
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,580
I just want to tell you

445
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,900
A bad wife will destroy your whole life!

446
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,500
Grandma.

447
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,450
That's beautiful! Okay!

448
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,050
So Beautiful. Yes.

449
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,770
But why did I say no?

450
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,660
In fact, it's not because I'm selfish.

451
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,060
It's because I think that's love.

452
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,370
It's a virtue in life.

453
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,580
To pass love along.

454
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,160
I think

455
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,920
when all things come to an end.

456
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,060
I can tell my grandma with no guilt or regret.

457
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,010
Grandma.

458
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,920
I love to listen to you all my life.

459
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,080
I totally disagree the statement of Square One.

460
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,540
His logic is a mess,

461
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,680
That's moral pollution.

462
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,240
And I totally can't accept his appearance!

463
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,580
This student, please be serious.

464
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,450
Sorry, sorry.

465
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,810
Boss, boss.

466
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,610
Don't worry.

467
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,280
I'm writing the last two thousand words.

468
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm not lying, how is that possible.

469
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,400
Impossible.

470
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,130
My mistake, last one thousand words.

471
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,850
Give me some time. Will finish it soon.

472
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,480
Okay, okay.

473
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,360
Brother.

474
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,100
Yezi, you're back.

475
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,890
Who is this old lady?

476
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,970
Brother, be careful of her.

477
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,980
Be careful?

478
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,080
Did she bully you?

479
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,240
No, no, no.

480
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,220
Too dirty.

481
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,660
What too dirty?

482
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,160
Madam, you must have lost.

483
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,360
Clean it up.

484
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,860
Clean it up now!

485
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,120
Stop talking.

486
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,250
You must have lost.

487
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,380
Come, I'll send you home.

488
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,170
Clean it or not?

489
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,100
- Clean it or not?!
- Yes, yes. Yes.

490
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,320
Clean it or not? Clean it or not?

491
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,250
Louder! Clean it.

492
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,040
Yes, yes!

493
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,080
Hurry up. Clean it all up!

494
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,090
Okay, okay, okay.

495
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,740
Look, look, look.

496
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,000
Here, here!

497
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,850
Hurry, hurry.

498
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,640
So slowly.

499
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,980
Hurry, clean it up!

500
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,650
paper, paper, so many papers.

501
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,360
Fold it well. Hurry.

502
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,560
Look, that way.

503
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,460
Hurry, behind that.

504
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,960
Look, look.

505
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,500
Look, look.

506
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,480
Look, look.

507
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,140
Look at your desk. Look.

508
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,090
What the hell is this?

509
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,010
You eat and have things left!

510
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,490
Lazy pig, lazy bones, stupid donkey.

511
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,340
Hurry, clean it!

512
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,200
Hurry, hurry!

513
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,930
I'm so pissed!

514
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,460
I'm so tired.

515
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,530
Look, look. I knew it.

516
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,690
So sloppy.

517
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,100
Look, dust!

518
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,420
Yezi.

519
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,890
Why do you have a photo of you
and Danyi when you were both young?

520
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,180
So funny. So funny.

521
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,940
Look, look.

522
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,220
How cute you were!

523
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,140
Right?

524
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,080
I forgot I have this photo.

525
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,880
But I was a little ugly  back then.

526
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,570
Not at all.

527
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,610
He was.

528
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,370
You were ugly.

529
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,860
Not him.

530
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,490
I mean he was ugly in a cute way.

531
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,200
I didn't expect he would become so annoying.

532
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,010
I have so many photos like this one.

533
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,820
I hide them away.

534
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,850
Do you wanna see it?

535
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,330
Then come with me.

536
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,650
Come, come, come.

537
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,410
Come.

538
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,920
Dear brothers.

539
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,610
After eighty-one disasters.

540
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,060
I can finally show you this beautiful episode!

541
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,620
You know, nice things will never be too late.

542
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,010
Hope you can see my sincerity in my work.

543
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,180
Okay, that's it.

544
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,620
Brother, I'm leaving with grandma.

545
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,490
Okay, bye. Bye.

546
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,160
We're leaving.

547
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,220
Bye, bye, bye.

548
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,740
Finally!

549
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,360
Listen to me.

550
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,160
Remember to clean your house every day.

551
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,640
Yes, yes, yes.

552
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,490
Who sent her?

553
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,770
What did I do?

554
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,260
Did I press delete?

555
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,980
I didn't press delete, did I?

556
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,420
I didn't press delete.

557
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,260
I didn't press delete. Gosh!

558
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,380
What kind of life is this?!

559
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,280
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

560
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,060
Now I'll announce the result for the debating competition.

561
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,530
The winner is

562
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,610
Maple Leaf Middle School.

563
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,820
Miss Xinyi, we win! We win!

564
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,170
We win!

565
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,410
We're the winner, you're the loser.

566
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,410
We're the winner, you're the loser.

567
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,340
Let's leave.

568
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,020
Follow me!

569
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,760
We're the winner, you're the loser.

570
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,040
Wait for me, wait for me.

571
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,060
What took you so long?

572
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,490
Sorry.

573
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,820
What if anything happened to...

574
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,730
His penis.

575
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,650
- Look, how cute he is.
- Grandma.

576
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,930
What're you doing?

577
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,980
Watching your childhood photo album.

578
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,560
Okay, you're sending me to prison again.

579
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,730
You're happy now?

580
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,120
Grandma, don't say that.

581
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,480
Yezi, I trust you.

582
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,860
Come to see me every weekend in the nursing home.

583
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,580
Okay.

584
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,620
Pinky promise.

585
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,370
It's a deal.

586
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,450
Ye Muxi. I didn't expect you could actually help.

587
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,890
What do you mean?

588
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,760
Usually, you would mess things up.

589
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,330
I...

590
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,010
I did well.

591
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,860
Why do I hear the sound of water?

592
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,960
Water?

593
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,560
Water?

594
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,840
That door.

595
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,400
Anyway, because of my mistake.

596
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,180
There is a flood in Liao Danyi's room.

597
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,840
I need privacy, you know?

598
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,970
We have different viewpoints.

599
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,450
How could we live together?!

600
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,500
I heard that.

601
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,760
Well, I need to talk to you. Yezi.

602
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,810
You know the floor of Danyi's house is in flood, right?

603
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,520
Consider it a joy to help others.

604
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,970
It's what a wonder girl does.

605
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,240
You know that.

606
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,920
You're a wonder girl.

607
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,260
I won't say any other things.

608
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,250
Deal with it.

609
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,410
You know that.

610
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,040
But that depends.

611
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,440
Besides...

612
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,320
Please believe me, I won't do anything to you.

613
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,770
So, to sum it up.

614
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,770
This guy is living in my house temporarily.

615
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,570
My god.
