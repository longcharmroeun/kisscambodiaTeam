00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,730
Go!

188
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,080
We knocked down the monitor!

189
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,500
Please return to where you started.

190
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,370
Right. We don't have substantial bodies.

191
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,630
It seems that we forgot this important point.

192
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,860
It's okay. It's okay. Next time we'll work better.
Right. Right. The important thing is that we've participated.

193
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,310
Let's go. Let's go.

194
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,320
The weak left one after another.

195
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,120
The war was about to end.

196
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,330
And the powerful embraced their final faceoff.

197
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,590
You're dead.

198
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,590
Please return to where you started.

199
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,990
You're dead.

200
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,250
Please return to where you started.

201
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,110
Cheng Ling!
You're dead.

202
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,890
Please return to where you started.

203
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,850
You're dead.
Please return to where you started.

204
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,550
Liao Danyi, it's time for us to have a duel.

205
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,520
You're killed.

206
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,890
Unexpectedly, only us are still alive.

207
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,840
You're killed.

208
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,100
-Let's start. Three. Two. One.
-I told you, you're killed!

209
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,670
I'm not!

210
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,200
This is a new helmet!

211
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,160
I have another life!

212
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,200
Where did you get the helmet?

213
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,420
I stole it from Yuan Ke'er.

214
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,930
Big boss has gone too far.

215
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,200
She's gone too far.

216
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,290
Big boss, you've gone too far!

217
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,030
You're cheating.

218
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,690
-I'm not. When did I cheat?
-Just now.

219
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,410
I didn't.

220
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,870
You're always like this.

221
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,620
You're killed.
Why did you grab other people's helmet?

222
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,440
Aren't you impolite?

223
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,130
You're killed.

224
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,110
I can't hear what you're talking about.

225
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,460
-I can't hear you.
-Why are you so rude?

226
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,480
- Aren't you childish?
-Can't hear you.

227
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,670
You can't grow up, right?

228
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,650
Stop!

229
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,740
All right. I'll give you another chance.

230
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,530
Liao Danyi.

231
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,310
We take you as our brother.

232
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,740
But you?

233
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,050
If Ye Muxi didn't tell us,

234
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,190
we would be kept in the dark till now.

235
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,290
Haven't you gone too far?

236
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,130
Still pretending, aren't you?

237
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,940
Happy birthday!

238
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,080
Happy birthday to you.

239
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,630
Happy birthday to you.

240
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,090
Happy birthday to you.

241
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,440
Happy birthday to you.

242
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,430
Liao Danyi!

243
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,030
Stop.

244
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,160
It's your birthday. You still do cleaning?

245
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,160
Let me help you.

246
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,280
Are you alright?

247
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,930
I'm fine. Do cleaning. I can help.

248
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,290
The monthly exam is coming.

249
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,420
How are you doing with the preparation?

250
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,420
None of your business.

251
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,730
Look, you're not stupid.

252
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,120
Why don't you spend your energy on study?

253
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,120
I can't focus.

254
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,490
Listen.

255
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,960
People like me have difficulty in learning.

256
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,140
In America,

257
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,910
they'll reserve a seat for me in universities.

258
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,760
Stop daydreaming.

259
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,760
You're not in America now.

260
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,740
Besides, you don't have the learning disorder.

261
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,340
You're just lazy.

262
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,370
You're not me. How could you know me?

263
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,370
Ye Muxi.

264
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,530
Anyway, I gotta tell you,

265
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,870
don't cheat in exams.

266
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,020
Got it?

267
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,880
You're dead.

268
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,040
Please return to where you started.
I win!

269
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,850
I win finally!

270
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,500
After so many years, I finally beat you!

271
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,830
Hallelujah!

272
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,440
You're dead.

273
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,000
Please return to where you started.

274
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,580
We win. We win.

275
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,800
We win, right?

276
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,340
What are you doing?

277
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,520
Big boss, I'm Shen Wei.

278
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,140
Why are you still alive?

279
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,820
Shen Wei managed to live till now.

280
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,320
You didn't count deaths.

281
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,240
Today, Saturn is prograde. Wind and fire cooperate.

282
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,870
I knew that something good would happen!
Didn't expect that we would win at last!

283
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,800
Great! So happy!

284
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,840
[ Shen Wei ]

285
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,980
The war on school uniform

286
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,220
culminated in Liao Danyi team's winning.

287
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,220
End of a story.

288
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,940
But the fight between Ye Muxi and Liao Danyi lasts still.

289
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,880
Isn't this pretty good?

290
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,430
I think you all look nice in this clothes.

291
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,580
Indeed,

292
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,580
school uniform is the most beautiful clothes I've ever seen.

293
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Done? Let's go.

294
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,130
Wait.

295
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,920
Put up your sign. Take pictures.

296
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,260
[ I promise, I'll never come to school in strange clothes. ]

297
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,410
Turn left.

298
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,840
Turn right.

299
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,610
Okay.

300
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,460
Done?

301
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,920
Liao Danyi, listen to me.

302
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,270
Although you make us wear school uniform,

303
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,690
you can't stop our free style!

304
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,840
One!

305
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,120
Two!

306
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,050
Go.

307
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,230
Look, kite.

308
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,980
Kite? Flying kite in such a day?

309
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,760
Brother.

310
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,290
It's said that there are many robbers here.

311
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:20,850
You know?

312
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,490
Really?

313
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,070
Really. I saw the news yesterday. Let me find it.

314
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,390
Look. Look. Look.

315
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,230
It's true. So unbelievable.

316
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,600
-Very rampant. Open robbery.
-Yes. Yes.

317
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,170
Look, isn't it?

318
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,340
Your phone!

319
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,440
Bike! Bike!

320
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,890
Excuse me!

321
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:40,670
Lend it to us!

322
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,110
My bike! My bike!

323
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,650
My bike!

324
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,460
Brother, you can't ride bike?!

325
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,400
You don't know that?

326
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,120
I don't!
Are you my brother?

327
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,890
No... I am!

328
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,250
Hurry! Get me up!

329
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,370
It's okay. Just ride.

330
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,050
I'll hold you behind.

331
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:03,700
Okay.

332
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,610
Hurry. Hurry.

333
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,040
Slow down. Slow down.

334
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,720
Slow... Slow...

335
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,700
Slow down! Slow down!

336
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,720
Damn it. Riding bike turns out to be so hard!

337
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,060
Are you gonna give up so easily?

338
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,060
No. I'm not.

339
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,580
Okay. Let's continue.

340
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,060
When Huang Nan and Huang Yi

341
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,790
remember the reason why they learned riding bike,

342
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,120
the sun sets already.

343
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,940
At last, they choose to call the police.
