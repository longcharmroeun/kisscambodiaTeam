1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,192
Yezi, time to get up.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,432
Listen, you're not getting up late today.

3
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:17,552
Even I have to get through eighty-one difficulties,
I will wake you up.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,776
Ye...

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,280
You're up?

6
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:29,088
This...

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,504
Dressing so nice in the early morning?

8
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:32,672
Where're you going?
I've got things to do today, talk later.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,080
Won't have breakfast with you. Bye. Bye.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,296
Yezi. Yezi!

11
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:38,912
What about dinner?

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,816
Not eating breakfast.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,992
Where's she going?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,896
No way.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,240
Something is going on.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,464
Let's go.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
Did you tell your brother about the place we go?

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,432
I didn't, why?

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,632
Because he has been following us.

20
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:44,416
Where're they?

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,184
Brother, why're you following us?

22
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,904
Here's the thing.

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,240
I got up this morning.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,592
Seems the weather is nice today.

25
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:11,376
So I got out to get some fresh air.

26
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:14,000
Well....

27
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,704
You two...

28
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,000
Come.

29
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,832
To be honest, I have thought about this day before.

30
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,344
But I didn't expect,

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,824
that would come so soon.

32
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,024
But it's good.

33
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,952
It's you.

34
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,952
You're better than anyone else.

35
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,048
My Yezi,

36
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,752
her future,

37
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,928
is on your shoulder now.

38
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,096
The truth is,

39
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,464
the reason why I got out with him is...

40
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,288
grandma is ill.

41
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:45,712
# Head held high, stride forward #
# Dream big, break the limits #

42
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:52,448
# Work hard for the future world (No limits) #

# Running, with schoolbag on our back #

46
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,416
# Sunlight, goes into our coat #

47
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:12,688
# Fermenting, happiness in a right heat #

48
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:16,464
# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

49
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,719
# Waiting, the signal for running #

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,744
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #

51
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:26,064
# After class, we laugh and sing #

52
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:30,176
# Striving, our unchangeable pride #
# On the way to the future #

53
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,320
# Thunder and storm won't matter #

54
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:39,152
# Forever young heartbeats #

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,568
# Head held high, stride forward #

Episode 34

68
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,360
Madam, what's wrong?

69
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,712
What's wrong?

70
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,312
Long time no see.

71
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:00,256
Dad.

72
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,440
-Grandma.
-Danyi.

73
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,432
Grandma.

74
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,064
What took you so long?

75
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,744
I miss you so much.

76
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,552
I went to get you some fruit.

77
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,920
Don't need fruit.

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
As long as you're here, it's great.

79
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,744
Come to see me right after school.

80
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:18,688
Okay.

81
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:20,736
Where's your dad?

82
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:22,368
My dad?

83
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,368
He's busy, so he left.

84
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:26,960
Left again.

85
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:29,232
Let him leave, as long as you're here.

86
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,008
I just wanna see you.

87
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,248
Where's Yezi?

88
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,264
Grandma.

89
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,743
Yezi, Yezi.
I'm just asking him about you.

90
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,816
I'm so happy to see you.

91
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,970
You're amazing.

92
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,144
Danyi, give Yezi an apple.

93
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:53,344
Grandma, you eat.
I had enough for today.

94
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:55,808
You eat.

95
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm happy to see you eat an apple.

96
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,744
Okay, I'll eat.

97
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:00,544
Grandma.

98
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,656
I bought those apples for you.

99
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:04,528
Let her eat.

100
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,544
I wanna see her eat it.

101
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:07,712
Stingy.

102
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:08,848
Stingy.

103
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,952
Who is stingy?

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,560
You.

105
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,360
You.

106
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:12,400
You...

107
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,024
I...

108
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,192
I...you...

109
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:14,832
We...

110
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:16,464
We're a team.

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,552
You two.

112
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,696
Every time I see you two,

113
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,968
Laughing and arguing,

114
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,352
Reminds me of me and your grandpa.

115
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,496
When I miss him,

116
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,368
I sit at the beach,

117
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,928
It's like he comes towards me from the sea.

118
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,632
When I'm old,
Your grandpa told me.

119
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:44,608
Hey, old woman.

120
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,680
If one day I died,

121
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,088
cast my ashes into the sea.

122
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
When you miss me, just sit on the beach.

123
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,456
So Danyi,

124
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,616
If my time comes,
Cast my ashes into the sea.

125
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,032
I'll wait for your grandpa to pick me up.

126
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
Grandma.

127
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,768
Grandma, don't say those ominous things.

128
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,392
How is that ominous?

129
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,150
It's life.

130
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,672
Humans all will die one day.

131
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:19,088
But I am not a normal human.

132
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,168
I'm an old fairy.

133
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,800
Can't die even if I want to.

134
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:29,632
So watching you growing up makes me so happy.

135
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,384
I like Yezi.

136
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,176
I like grandma.

137
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,344
Good girl.

138
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,688
We two are from the same school.

139
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,760
You got better scores in school.

140
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,520
Higher points.

141
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,184
More popular.

142
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:49,728
Then you went overseas to study.

143
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,224
You should have better opportunity than this.

144
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,368
But you came to Maple Leaf Middle School.

145
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,008
You have the ability and the qualification
to choose the best class in school, Class One.

146
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:00,720
Aka my class.

147
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:04,496
But you chose the most difficult class,

148
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:06,704
Class Ten.

149
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:08,640
I want to know 

150
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:10,288
were you doing that for me?

151
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:14,592
Miss Luo. I was not.

152
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,312
What's the fun to choose a bunch of good students?

153
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,952
To make the worst the best,

154
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,384
that's more challenging for me.

155
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,096
You.

156
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:26,864
You know what?
In overseas, scores isn't the thing they values.

157
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,528
It's a student's comprehensive ability.

158
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,600
Miss Luo, how do you distinguish 

159
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,288
the good students and the bad students?

160
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,688
I don't know what you mean.

161
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,776
I just want to unlock their potential.

162
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,280
See if those bad students in your eyes 

163
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,120
can make some success.

164
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:58,432
I don't buy it.

165
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,088
Wu Heng.

166
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,816
I know it.

167
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:07,488
If you were not doing this for me.

168
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,296
Then you are doing this against me.

169
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,200
You were like this when we were in school.

170
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
Now you're still the same.

171
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,320
I know you purpose now.

172
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,128
You just want to turn a backward class
to a good class like mine.

173
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,512
To let all the people know that you're better than me.
Right?

174
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,864
So we both need to work harder.

175
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,440
As your companion,

176
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,248
to supervise and urge each other.

177
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,448
I think it's a good thing.
Wu Heng.

178
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:34,528
Every time I try to talk with you,

179
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:35,792
You'll give me a lesson.

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,704
You're a boring man.

181
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,984
Fine, no more business then.

182
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,120
Just enjoying these beautiful sunshine in the weekend.

183
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,296
Grandma, time for your pills.

184
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:04,288
Grandma.

185
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:05,408
Grandma, time for your pills.

186
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:06,192
No!

187
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,016
If you don't eat this, you'll get worse.

188
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,136
You think I'm a kid?
Easy to lie to?

189
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:16,880
Pills are poison.

190
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,104
I know my body.

191
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,168
Grandma, stop playing.

192
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:25,072
What're you talking about?
Why do you sound so like your father?

193
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,768
Pills are all poison. You know?
These pills make me hard to sleep at night, hard to eat.

194
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,904
I have so many nightmares.
I could only lie down here and wait for my time.

195
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,840
Danyi, are you expecting that day would come sooner?

196
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,632
Grandma, what're you talking about.

197
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,312
She doesn't want it, so don't.

198
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,664
Right.

199
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,920
She is not your grandma, of course you're not worried.

200
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,576
I...

201
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:58,880
Grandma.

202
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:03,792
Danyi.

203
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,736
I want this cake.

204
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:07,968
Eat your pills.

205
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,224
Cake first, pills later, okay?

206
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,072
No.

207
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,616
If you want the cake, eat the pills first.

208
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:23,632
I'm dying.

209
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,528
Grandma, grandma.

210
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,856
I'm dying.

211
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,320
Yezi,

212
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,496
After I died,

213
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,688
I have to ask you to take care of my grandson.

214
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:39,488
No, grandma, he is so annoying.
I don't want that.

215
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:43,136
He is not annoying.

216
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,024
Just one flaw.

217
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:47,056
He is stingy.
He wouldn't let his grandma have a piece of cake.

218
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,280
You.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,504
You won't let grandma have a piece of cake?

220
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,152
Pills first, cake later.

221
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:04,032
Let her eat.

222
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,392
No.

223
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,144
Grandma, I want cake, too.

224
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,128
I know.

225
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:22,416
Grandma, I'm gonna go get your lunch.

226
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,120
No need.

227
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:30,080
I don't want lunch.

228
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,584
You wouldn't let me have a cake.

229
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:36,864
So I won't have lunch.

230
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,776
No lunch, then.

231
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,992
Ye Muxi, outside.

232
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,032
Come.

233
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:56,688
What?

234
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,656
Grandma won't eat her pills. What shall we do?

235
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,112
How would I know?

236
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:03,904
Why would you give her the cake?

237
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,000
She likes cake.

238
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,096
She won't eat her pills with cake around.

239
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,848
Then what shall we do?

240
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,384
I have an idea.

241
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,536
It's a cake.

242
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:38,656
What?

243
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,952
Her pill.

244
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:47,872
You want to poison her?!

245
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:50,416
This is the medicine powder.

246
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,944
I just spill it on the cake.

247
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,368
So grandma will eat it.

248
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,384
This is smart.
I'll give her,

249
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,111
Grandma.

250
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,792
Yezi, you're back.

251
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,240
You wanna eat cake?

252
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,304
Of course I do.

253
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,128
Don't eat this.
This one is chocolate flavor,

254
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,152
This one is strawberry flavor. You will like this.

255
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,736
You bought it for me?

256
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,424
Yezi, Yezi, you're my sweet baby.

257
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,320
Since you bought this cake for me.

258
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,624
Get some milk tea as well?

259
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:31,456
Okay.

260
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,512
Okay, okay.

261
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,064
Thanks.

262
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,384
Some days later,

263
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,464
grandma ran out from the nursing home again.

264
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:49,056
But this time, I know where to find her.
Where is that old lady again?!

265
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,880
She is making this hard for me!

266
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,656
That old lady...

267
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:06,928
Dad.

268
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,104
I heard grandma goes to the seaside a lot.

269
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:10,672
Let's check the beach.

270
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,160
That's impossible.

271
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:14,832
The beach is more than ten kilometers away.

272
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,376
How could an old woman get that far?!

273
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,016
Just check around this area.

274
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:22,208
If we can't find her before the dusk.

275
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,552
I'll call the police.

276
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,680
Eyes wide open, and check carefully.

277
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
Yezi, why did you come?

278
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,928
Because you told me

279
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,800
This is where grandpa left.

280
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,320
Good memory.

281
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,136
That's right.

282
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,960
Grandma, they said you're very sick.

283
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,312
Are you afraid?

284
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,696
Yezi.

285
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,640
In this world,

286
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,800
There's nothing that humans can't figure out.

287
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,616
Except one. That no one has figured out before.

288
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,816
Which is, where will people go
and what they will they do after death?

289
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:51,808
Now, it's my chance to find that out.

290
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:56,080
I'm so happy.

291
00:21:56,592 --> 00:21:58,208
Why would I feel afraid?

292
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,584
Not nervous.

293
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:00,976
Not afraid.

294
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,624
Yezi.

295
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,672
I really like you.

296
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
Look, you're growing up.

297
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,144
People will come and tell you,
you need to do this, do that.

298
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:26,416
To make you become sophisticated.

299
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:31,184
They say that will help you in this world.

300
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,272
Just tell them,

301
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:36,112
Get the hell out.

302
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,872
If growing up means to be sophisticated.

303
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,736
I'd rather you'll be a kid forever.

304
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:49,008
Like now.

305
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,904
A pure and innocent little girl.

306
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:14,672
Yezi.

307
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:19,552
My Zorro is coming to get me.

308
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,928
I'm so looking forward to it.

309
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,152
Grandma, grandma.

310
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:38,528
Grandma!

311
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,624
Yezi, you silly girl.

312
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,976
I made jokes like this with you many times.
Why you would never learn?

313
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,048
Okay, tell me a story.

314
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,816
I want to hear a story.

315
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,136
Okay.

316
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,344
Once upon a time.

317
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,760
There's a princess.

318
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:06,032
Called Snow White.

319
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,176
She was the fairest
and the most beautiful girl in the world.

320
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
But because of that,

321
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,392
many people were jealous of her. Especially that witch.

322
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,784
So she sent some men to kill her.

323
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,456
But they couldn't.

324
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:26,448
Because she had a good fate.

325
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,848
She was very powerful.

326
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:31,664
Many people loves her.

327
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,456
Every people who saw her.

328
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:35,920
But...

329
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,768
Me and grandma were sitting there for a long time.

330
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,416
Until Liao Danyi and his dad came to the beach.

331
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,968
After you found my mom,

332
00:24:57,968 --> 00:24:59,728
why you didn't tell us?

333
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,984
Grandma said, she doesn't want you to know.

334
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,816
Who gave you the right to make decision of my family?!

335
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:09,168
This is your friend?

336
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,808
Little girl, listen.

337
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,728
This isn't over.

338
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,024
But first, you need to stay away from my family as from now!

339
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:26,672
Danyi!

340
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:09,696
Several weeks after that thing,

341
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,000
Grandma passed away in her sleep.

342
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:43,952
Although he is a governor.

343
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:45,472
Looks so careless.

344
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:47,904
But in fact, he is a hero.

345
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:18,320
That's so beautiful! Okay!

346
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,456
This way, this way.

347
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,944
Kill him, kill him.

348
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:50,592
Go!

349
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,496
Game.

350
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,584
Although I don't play it, but I know.

351
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,328
Many games can be replayed again after you finish that round.
To get more bonus.

352
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,072
So you could get to the end sooner.

353
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,376
Or maybe even get a better result.

354
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,800
It's called Game In Hard Mode.

355
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:13,200
If you fight like this, your account will be a waste.

356
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
You have to play it again.

357
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,136
She has passed away.

358
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:21,488
It's the nature rule.

359
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,208
One day, I'll pass away as well.

360
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,080
So will you.

361
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,720
So, don't be sad.

362
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,384
In Maple Leaf School

363
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,688
how did you end up in Class Ten?

364
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,664
I missed a course.

365
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,472
Why you didn't retake that test?

366
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,808
I know you're still the best student.

367
00:28:51,808 --> 00:28:53,472
But environment matters.

368
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,640
Luckily, me and your school master are close.

369
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,728
I arrange a make-up test and re-classgrouping for you.

370
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,248
Dad.

371
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,136
What if I tell you I don't want to go to any other classes?

372
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:07,536
Why is that?

373
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,792
For your friends?

374
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,040
Especially that girl.

375
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:19,136
I dislike her very much.

376
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:24,240
If she told us about your grandma's whereabouts at once.

377
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,976
Maybe...

378
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:34,112
I can blame her death on her.

379
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,136
But if you stay away from her,

380
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,704
I can leave her alone.

381
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,576
Do you understand?

382
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,456
Danyi, I hope you can go to Class One.

383
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:50,704
Go to A college after graduation.

384
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:53,920
Followed by two years study overseas.

385
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,856
After you come back,

386
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,032
I can arrange you in a famous corporation as a supervisor.

387
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:01,520
Not like me.

388
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,560
Struggling in the business circle.

389
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:07,296
That's the life I've planned for you.
All about you.

390
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,256
University dad wanted to go.

391
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,680
Country dad wanted to go.

392
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:21,248
Corporation dad wanted to go.

393
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,568
Dad has treated me as his Game In Hard Mode.

394
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,744
Dad has found me a new place to live.

395
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:09,472
I'm moving out tonight.

396
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:15,856
I'm transferring to Class One.
