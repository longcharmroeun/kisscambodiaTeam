Episode 33

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,710
Why did you come here?

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,970
Don't say anything.

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,760
You must come here asking for help, right?

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,730
Well, tell me your birthday respectively.

34
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,589
June... June sixth.

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,440
Yours?

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,110
September fifteenth.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,270
September fifteenth...

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,000
You're a Virgo.

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,500
Very thoughtful and agile.

40
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,650
A strong existence among women.

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,290
But during Mercury retrograde, you seem a little slack.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,530
You must be kind to friends around you.

43
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,800
Then it'll help your study and career.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,630
As a Gemini, you're lively and active.

45
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,030
But during Mercury retrograde, you seem a little downcast.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,870
You gotta keep positive in life.

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,700
Meanwhile, actively participate in collective activities around you.

48
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,190
Then it'll help your finance rebound a lot.

49
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,770
Miss Xinyi...

50
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,870
Well...

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,450
Let me give you some material help.

52
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,240
Miss Xinyi, we have money now!

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,860
Thank you! Thank...

54
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,550
This... This is invalid.

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,220
You're welcome. You're welcome.

56
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,740
Don't say anything.

57
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,570
You're hungry, right?

58
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,450
Come with me.

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,280
In this world,

60
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,930
the most delicious thing is spiritual food.

61
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,270
Come, read it with me.

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,590
The mountain's height never matters.

63
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,590
It'll be famous if housing immortals.

64
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,580
The mountain's height never matters.

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,770
It'll be famous if housing immortals.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,050
The water's depth never matters.

67
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,540
It'll be ethereal if holding dragons.

68
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,690
The water's depth never matters.

69
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,450
It'll be ethereal if holding dragons.

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,060
A humble room as it is, it showcases my virtues.

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,190
A humble room as it is, it...

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,560
Miss Xinyi. Miss Xinyi.

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,210
Please save her!

74
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,500
-Miss Xinyi!
-It hurts!

75
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,290
Knowledge is power.

76
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,200
Read more and you'll be alright.

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,430
Miss Xinyi, wake up!

78
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,680
-A humble room as it is, it showcases my virtues.
-Miss Xinyi!

79
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,810
Miss Xinyi.

80
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,040
This can be divided into six portions.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
We have food for two days.

82
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,410
I'm a princess.

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,340
How should I suffer this?

84
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,530
Miss Xinyi.

85
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,530
Please have your breakfast first.

86
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,200
Please maintain this pen for me.

87
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,940
Okay.

88
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,120
What pen is this?

89
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,310
This is...

90
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,530
The Will-lost Pen! A fabled epic pen
left by ancient gods which can command everything!

91
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,720
The Will-lost Pen?

92
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,360
It's said that whoever has this pen can control the entire world.

93
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,300
For this pen, many people had killed or been killed!

94
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,920
Since then, this pen disappeared. No one knows its whereabouts!

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,670
Didn't expect.... Didn't expect...

96
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,480
Didn't expect that it's in your hands!

97
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,620
Be careful. Keep it safe.

98
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Okay. Okay. Okay.

99
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,930
Where should we place such a valuable stuff?

100
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,270
Safe box! Safe box!

101
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,010
Right. Right. Safe box. Safe box.

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,450
No. No. No.
We... We should take a pic and post it on Facebook.

103
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,810
Right. Right.

104
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,590
Let's go.

105
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,660
Camera. Camera.

106
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,500
Let's go.

107
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,060
Camera! Camera!

108
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,050
No!

109
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,730
Star Tianlang falls.

110
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,050
No good intentions.

111
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,190
Disaster!

112
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,670
You thief!

113
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,180
Give me back that pen!

114
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,650
Shut up.

115
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,630
What brought you here?

116
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,240
That is my pen!

117
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,230
Do you know what paper fears and what cloth fears?

118
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,080
Fire and scissors, just in case.

119
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,060
That's not funny. Listen to mine.

120
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,170
Once upon a time, someone (was) called Xiaoming.

121
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,520
Xiaoming didn't hear that.

122
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,970
I... I have a funnier one.

123
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,920
This slap...

124
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,630
Comes so suddenly.

125
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:34,530
I have a little donkey. But I've never ridden on it.

126
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,120
One day, I went to the market with it on impulse.

127
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,790
My hands...

128
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,650
Nobody. Nobody but you.

129
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,840
I was drunk alone.

130
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,800
But other people in couples.

131
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,470
Watching them with my eyes.

132
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,340
I wished nothing but get a girlfriend.

133
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,160
Who is tender and plays the zither.
Like two swallows happy in purple bamboos.

134
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,540
For this spoony girl, I'm willing

135
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,440
to travel a thousand miles to find her!

136
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,290
Why she can't be controlled?

137
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,960
My will is not as weak as theirs!

138
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,280
I'm gonna destroy this pen!

139
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,610
No. Wonder girl.

140
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,160
If this pen is destroyed,

141
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,920
there's no pens in our village.
You'll never finish your homework!

142
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,120
To save you guys, this is no big deal!

143
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,200
The sin of being unable to finish homework,

144
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,200
let me bear it by myself!

145
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,510
Monitor.

146
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,580
Big boss.

147
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,330

148
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,810
Miss Xinyi!

149
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,080
Miss Xinyi! Miss Xinyi!

150
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,020
Just because of that.

151
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,250
My pen got broken.

152
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,370
So I didn't do my homework last night.

153
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,860
Can I copy yours?

154
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,770
Boring.

155
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,030
You don't believe me?

156
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,960
Where's the trust between people?

157
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,850
[ Maple Leaf Middle School Spring Sports Meeting ]

158
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,970
What does the zoo have?

159
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,890
Giraffe!

160
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,260
Lion!

161
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,190
Rabbit!

162
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,070
Elephant!

163
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,720
Ostrich!

164
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,300
Monkey!

165
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,530
Turtle!

166
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,560
Danyi, play with us!

167
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,250
Finally, we're outdoors.

168
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,530
But you play such a game?

169
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,960
Didn't you sign up for sports events?

170
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,030
Don't need to get ready?

171
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,680
Never mind.

172
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,700
We never won for once since childhood!

173
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,360
We're used to it.

174
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,830
Yes. Yes. We're used to it.

175
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,790
But I can seckill them!

176
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,900
Yes, big boss.

177
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,400
But this time, we're okay.

178
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,160
You know why?

179
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,680
Why?

180
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,310
We have Cheng Ling!

181
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,670
Come on!
Hands! Legs! Hands! Legs!

182
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,180
What does the zoo have?

183
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,320
Blue sky. White clouds.

184
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,230
Cellphone. Spicy strips.

185
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,230
Such a sports meeting.

186
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,040
Perfect!

187
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,990
Li Yao.

188
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,120
Why no one around us?

189
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Got it.

190
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,990
But.

191
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,270
Today, whether our class, 

192
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,610
will win or not doesn't matter.

193
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,240
Anyway, we can't possibly win.

194
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,810
It's enough if Cheng Ling wins.

195
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,790
Makes sense.

196
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,290
It's okay. It's okay.

197
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,650
Competitions are just competitions.

198
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,420
Right?

199
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,090
We'll lose anyway.

200
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,420
It's enough if Cheng Ling wins.

201
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,620
It's enough.

202
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,920
Friendship comes first, competitions second.

203
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
-Yes. Whatever.
-Such a good day today.

204
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,680
It's enough if Cheng Ling wins!

205
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,680
The sun is in a right position.

206
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,260
Cheng Ling! Go for it! Cheng Ling! Go for it!

207
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,350
Pray for you!

208
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,800
Go for it! Cheng Ling!

209
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,580
Cheng Ling! Go for it! 

210
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,480
Relax. He'll win. Don't worry.

211
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,860
Go for it.

212
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,610
Go for it! Go for it!

213
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,470
Go for it! Go for it!

214
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
Miss Xinyi.
Go for it! Go for it!

215
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,660
Miss Xinyi.

216
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,960
We'll get the first place today.

217
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,170
Go for it! Go for it!

218
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,700
Hurry! Go for it!

219
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,100
Cheng Ling! Cheng Ling!

220
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,579
Make way! Cheng Ling!

221
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,220
Tell me.

222
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,300
Did you knock that student down deliberately?

223
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,760
Our Class One must defeat Class Ten.

224
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,270
But in a fair and square manner.

225
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,970
In future, I don't want to see you play any tricks.

226
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,030
Got it?

227
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,210
Leave.

228
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,160
Come. Here. Here.

229
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,540
Cheng Ling, are you alright?

230
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,140
Are you alright?

231
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,390
Cheng Ling, how do you feel?

232
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,390
Sorry. I didn't get the first place.

233
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,820
They've gone too far.

234
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,170
I saw that clearly.

235
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,170
A student of Class One tumbled him down.

236
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,170
Ye Muxi, where are you going?

237
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,460
Let's go. Let's go.

238
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,390
Wait for me here. I'll be back soon.

239
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,480
Guan Xinyi!

240
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,660
Make way!

241
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,740
Miss Xinyi, I got this.

242
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,390
Don't you Class One feel ashamed?

243
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,930
What did you mean?

244
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,550
Someone knocked him down. You know?

245
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,730
What happened just now is just an accident.

246
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,220
Accident?

247
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,960
Let me show you what's called accident!

248
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,430
Guan Xinyi.

249
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,850
Competitions should be open and fair.

250
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,700
Isn't that way too far?

251
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,630
Liao Danyi.

252
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,250
That's really not what you thought.

253
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,610
That's just a misunderstanding.

254
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,860
Besides, Class One defeated Class Ten.

255
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,420
It's a matter of course.

256
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,650
Guan Xinyi.

257
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,570
Today, we just wanted to experience the competitions.

258
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,140
But, the total points.

259
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,670
We Class Ten will get more points than you Class One!

260
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,010
Let's go!

261
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,450
It's really not like what you thought.

262
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,850
You should feel luck that you left fast!

263
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,750
I'm so mad.

264
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,260
Listen to me.

265
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,190
By all means, we must defeat Class One!

266
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,240
Ye Muxi!

267
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,550
Listen to me.

268
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,040
I really understand your feelings now.

269
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,140
I know Class One defeated Cheng Ling by despicable means.

270
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,850
But if we defeat Class One in the same way,

271
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,850
aren't we the same despicable as them?

272
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,960
So Cheng Ling still won't feel happy.

273
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,320
Am I right?

274
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,940
Yes, monitor.

275
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,550
So, I need you to promise me.

276
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,350
In the following competitions,

277
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,060
don't use any indign means.

278
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,800
If we want to win, we win fair and square.

279
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,320
Can you promise me?

280
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,320
Look into my eyes and say it.

281
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,530
Can you promise me?

282
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,590
Yes.

283
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,590
Okay. Let's go compete.

284
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,890
You all hear that?

285
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,330
Monitor promised Liao Danyi.

286
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,520
Said that she won't use any despicable means

287
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,090
to deal with Class One.

288
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,840
But...

289
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,270
We didn't promise him.

290
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,560
Look at Xiong Tiancheng, can he possibly win?

291
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,360
Without this!

292
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,420
He can't win.

293
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,960
What's this?

294
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,840
This is laxative.

295
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,410
Let's go.

296
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,210
Bro, thank you. Drink some water.

297
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,610
Okay. Okay. Good luck.

298
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,170
Come, drink some water.

299
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,770
Winner!

300
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,770
Come. Thank you. Drink some water.

301
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,850
Nice, bro!

302
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,130
Good luck! Good luck!

303
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,650
You'll definitely get the first place!

304
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,420
Good luck! Good luck!

305
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,680
Come on. Let me drink some.

306
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,260
-Don't.
-Drink what?

307
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,200
Come. Drink some water.

308
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,450
Come on. Drink more.

309
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,440
Here, let me help you.

310
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,970
Okay. The first place.

311
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,140
Amazing.

312
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,210
I made it.

313
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,200
I made it! I jumped over it!

314
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,200
I jumped over it!

315
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,690
Ke'er, actually, you didn't.

316
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,510
Good luck! Good luck!

317
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,140
I wanted to compete with you long ago.

318
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,180
Today the chance comes finally.

319
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,070
I'm gonna let you know what's called the elite of elites.

320
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,630
Good luck! Good luck! Good luck!

321
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,850
Good luck! Hurry up!

322
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,310
Go for it! Go for it!

323
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,930
Go for it!

324
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,930
Liao Danyi, good luck!

325
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,840
Liao Danyi!

326
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,450
Don't mind me! Run!

327
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,220
Why don't you leave?

328
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,400
What are you doing?

329
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,810
I won't leave any friend behind.

330
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,320
Come. Let's go to the terminus together.

331
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,610
Okay!

332
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,430
Boss! Good luck! Boss! Good luck!

333
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,120
Class Ten! Class Ten! Class Ten!

334
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,230
I can't make it without you guys!

335
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,990
Our success is created by us!

336
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,060
You!

337
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,110
And you!

338
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,470
Class Ten, bravo!

339
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,510
Bravo! Champion! Champion! Champion!

340
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,440
Class Ten!

341
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,500
Anyone can get me up?

342
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,990
[ Shorter bangs ]

343
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,390
Shanqi.

344
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,430
Can you help me cut my bangs?

345
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,240
I tried but couldn't do it right.

346
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,990
But I'm afraid that I will ruin it.

347
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,360
No. No, you won't.

348
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,050
You're so clever. You'll do a good job!

349
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,810
Shen Wei, you're so cute.

350
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,130
You'll look very nice whatever it'll be.

351
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,400
But I'll be very careful.

352
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,230
Okay.

353
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,490
Just a little bit shorter.

354
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,370
You'll look very beautiful after this.

355
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,100
How is that? How is that?

356
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,610
Didn't I say 'just a little bit shorter'?

357
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,370
Yes. Just a little bit, shorter.

358
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,420
Didn't I say 'just a little bit shorter'?

359
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,170
I did make it just a little bit, shorter.

360
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,850
Didn't I say 'just a little bit shorter'?

361
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,480
Are you deaf?

362
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,060
I did make it just a little bit, shorter.

363
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,060
I mean, a little bit shorter than it was!

364
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,440
You idiot!

365
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,870
I thought, you want it shorter than it usually is.

366
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,350
Sorry.

367
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,870
Never mind.

368
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,070
If being cute works,
will my bangs come out by itself?

369
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,500
But, but the two sentences sound alike.

370
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,470
Different understandings, different meanings.

371
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,470
So it's partly my fault?!

372
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:00,940
I wanted it to be just a little bit shorter than it was!

373
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,990
I think this is very funny.

374
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,480
Let me post it on Facebook.

375
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,910
Come on, take a pic.

376
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,970
My bangs...

377
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,970
How could you post it so soon on Facebook?

378
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,570
There is nothing to be mad about.

379
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,960
Just your bangs. Not that serious.

380
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,300
You know what?

381
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,980
In this world, there are three irretrievable things.

382
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,570
Knowledge acquired.

383
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,150
Meals eaten.

384
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,150
And my bangs!

385
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,910
Well, I'll cut mine for you.

386
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,260
Can they be linked to mine? You idiot!

387
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,200
Whether I'm an idiot or not
has nothing to do with your bangs, okay?

388
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,480
-It has everything to do with my bangs!-Why is that?

389
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,280
Just because you're an idiot.

390
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,910
You didn't hear me clearly.

391
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,800
No wonder you're called Zhu (pig) Shanqi. Zhu Shanqi!
Aren't you a pig?

392
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,230
Listen.

393
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,020
Don't make fun of my name as you like.

394
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,360
Everyone could mishear.

395
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,220
Besides.

396
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,260
Don't keep nagging like an old lady.

397
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,710
Do you know how much important my bangs mean to me?

398
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
It's huge! A matter of life and death!

399
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,580
Don't you know teenager girls!

400
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
It's just some damn bangs!

401
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,700
What's the big deal?

402
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,980
That's because you don't know

403
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,040
how much it matters to people with or without bangs!

404
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,890
With bangs.

405
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,420
Without bangs.

406
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,240
See?

407
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,990
See their difference?

408
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,990
You idiot!

409
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,640
Okay. I'm an idiot.

410
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,830
And you?

411
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,550
Your fortune-telling every day, murmuring incantations.

412
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,480
Anyone understands that? So quirky.

413
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,270
You deaf, stupid idiot, apologize to me!

414
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,270
Apologize? Okay.

415
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,950
Sorry!

416
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,030
Done.

417
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,720
Not to that. Apologize to me!

418
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

419
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,770
Shen Wei, I won't repeat this again.

420
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,440
Don't think you can yell at me

421
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,270
just because you look cute!

422
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,240
Don't think you can cut my bangs as you like

423
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,150
just because you look beautiful!

424
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,270
Don't think you can play tough to me
just because your fortune-telling always works!

425
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,430
Don't think you can cut my bangs as you like

426
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,140
just because you bounce about every day

427
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
and are popular among boys!

428
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm very popular?

429
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,730
My fortune-telling always works?

430
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,740
Yes.

431
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, you're very popular.

432
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,880
Shen Wei, you're really very cute.

433
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,530
Don't yell at me.

434
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,190
Shanqi, you're so cute.

435
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,000
Be careful when you cut my bangs next time.

436
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,170
I didn't mean to do that. Sorry.

437
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,180
But you're really super cute.

438
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,150
You, too.

439
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,030
-You're cutest.
-You, too.

440
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,830
Come on. Help me check if I have

441
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,950
good luck in love today.

442
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,020
Okay. Okay.
