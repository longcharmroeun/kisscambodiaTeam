# Hi, monitor, I'm all ready #

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,150
# Waiting, the signal for running #

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,080
# Class begins, my mind is dancing #

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,320
# After class, we laugh and sing #

00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,670

Katherine, Alina

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,970
The Big Boss

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,790
Episode 35

29
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,650
Miss Xinyi.

30
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,000
I always followed you.

31
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,330
Follow me today.

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,900
Look at this place.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,560
Why did you bring me into Class Ten?

34
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,559
Look at these desks.

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,909
These test papers.

36
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,310
And that blackboard.

37
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,430
Do they have a single certificate of merit?

38
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,130
But from such a class,

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,590
some student is gonna transfer to our Class One.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,080
I know that.

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,720
But...

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,340
Class Ten is a bad class.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,170
He transfers to our class. It's a shame to our Class One!

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,590
Liao Danyi is the No. 1 in the entire grade.

45
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,210
He's qualified to transfer to our class.

46
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,390
But... But don't you forget?
Liao Danyi and Ye Muxi.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,500
And all the students in Class Ten.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,330
What did they do to our Class One?

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,990
Do you forget the blackboard newspaper issue?

50
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,120
The sports meeting?

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,140
Isn't it a telltale?
We lost because we were not as good as them. 

52
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,530
But Class Ten is a bad class.

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,130
-Isn't it inappropriate...
-Enough!

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,830
If you're thinking about such unimportant things,

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,040
you better focus your energy on yourself.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,690
You're losing your title as the No. 100 in our grade.

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,270
I'm disappointed at you.

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,360
Think about it yourself.

59
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,270
I hate Liao Danyi!

60
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,520
I don't understand.

61
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,520
Why do you value him so much?

62
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,260
Whether I value him or not is my own business.
What's it to you?

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
I hate all the people whom you value.

64
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,540
Brother Liao, you're gonna leave like this?

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,350
So disloyal.

66
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,670
Yes.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,340
We can never play in the same class again.

68
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,700
How about throw a farewell party?
Yes.

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,810
No need.

70
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,430
We'll still be in the same school.

71
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,870
We'll meet a lot.

72
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,660
Wang Anshi once said,

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,880
The loyal never pretends himself to get honor.

74
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,830
The faithful never breaks his promise to get profits.

75
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,430
An educated gentleman must be resolute and broad-minded,

76
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,430
for he has taken heavy responsibilities and a long course.

77
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,810
But....

78
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,260
If you leave like this,

79
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,530
won't Ye Muxi feel sad?

80
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,209
I think it's not a bad thing for her.

81
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,590
I've kept her under strict control.

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,290
As time passes by, she'll kinda rely on me.

83
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,030
My departure, maybe...

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,130
is a chance for her to really grow up.

85
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,310
A farewell party?

86
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,740
We gotta throw a farewell party.

87
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,290
We'll celebrate by ourselves. Don't invite him.

88
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,580
Let's celebrate the departure of the evil boss.

89
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,680
Wang Anshi once said,

90
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,250
The loyal never pretends himself to get honor.

91
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,030
The faithful never breaks his promise to get profits.

92
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,350
What did you say?

93
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,820
But if Liao Danyi leaves in a such a quiet way,

94
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,660
you really won't feel sad?

95
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,900
Why? Do I look unhappy?

96
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,270
I'm very happy!

97
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm extremely happy.

98
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,350
I... Finally he's gonna leave.

99
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,630
Why would I be unhappy?

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,690
We should celebrate.

101
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,120
Get high.

102
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,700
Wu Sir.

103
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,370
Danyi, you're here.

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,260
I'll sit an exam for class transferring in days.

105
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,350
If I pass the exam,

106
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,350
I'll transfer to Class One.

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,350
Can you tell me why?

108
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Wu Sir.

109
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,100
Over the past days.

110
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,010
I've had a happy time in Class Ten.

111
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,320
But after thinking over it,

112
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,320
I think only Class One's study vibe

113
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,970
can better help me fulfill my dream.

114
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,970
To get in a famous college.

115
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,870
Danyi.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,810
You may explain to your classmates in this way.

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,830
But you can't fool me.

118
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,570
You want to transfer to Class One, is because of Ye Muxi?

119
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,570
Wu Sir.

120
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,820
I... I...

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,820
You all call me Wu Sir.

122
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,440
We're not only teacher and students, but also friends.

123
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,410
You and Ye Muxi are friends. You and me are also friends.

124
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,870
Have you ever thought of Ye Muxi's feelings

125
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,270
if you transfer to Class One?

126
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,510
Ask yourself carefully.

127
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,460
Transfer to Class One...

128
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,570
Is it really what you wanted?

129
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,250
As a friend, I want to tell you,

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,250
stay in Class Ten.

131
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,530
Whatever difficulty it is, we can face up to it together.

132
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,260
How many days left?

133
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,490
There's an exam for class transferring in days.

134
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,490
If I pass the exam,

135
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,670
I'll transfer to Class One.

136
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,690
Aren't you the No. 1 in the grade?

137
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,090
You'll pass it.

138
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,320
You know what?

139
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,710
I don't buy it.

140
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,260
Whatever you think.

141
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,530
I don't believe that you go to Class One for study.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Remember the day of my registration?

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,030
Back then, in order to help me
sign up in time,

144
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,360
you changed clothes with me.

145
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,360
To block my fans.

146
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,590
Since then, I knew,
you're the same like her.

147
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,650
That's the reason why I like Class Ten.

148
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,370
And you guys.

149
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,050
Since you've made your decision,

150
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,750
best wishes to you.

151
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,750
Liao Danyi.

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,860
Ye Muxi.

153
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,120
This is for you.

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,750
A three-year high school study plan.

155
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,810
If you learn according to it,

156
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,270
you'll see your score improved obviously.

157
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,870
Why did you give it to me?

158
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,710
I just want to complete something.

159
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,270
Thanks.

160
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,970
Ye Muxi.

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
I appreciate your kindness.

162
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,470
But I don't need this study plan.

163
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,800
And I don't need you.

164
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,130
As you know.

165
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,870
I'll transfer to Class One in days.

166
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,110
After I leave,

167
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,590
Xiaong Tiancheng will be your commissary in charge of studies.

168
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,630
Please cooperate with him in his future work.

169
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,750
Over the past days, we...

170
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,620
Thank you, everyone.

171
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,500
[ Head teacher is busy. Self-study! ]

172
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,380
All right. Students.

173
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,300
It ends.

174
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,470
Let's continue our lessons.

175
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,400
Monitor.

176
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,350
Shouldn't you say 'stand up'?

177
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,200
Morning, teacher.

178
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,410
Morning, students. Sit down, please.

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,240
Now, please turn to page seventy-eight.

180
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,550
Take a quick look at the text.

181
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,450
Don't find it odd, everyone.

182
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,210
Liao Danyi is still your fellow student.

183
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,090
It's just, he's transferred to Class One.

184
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,990
Let's continue our study.

185
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,690
Huang Nan. Huang Yi.

186
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,610
Make a schedule as you did before.

187
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,700
Shen Wei.

188
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,000
You may check our classmates' situation.

189
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,350
And report it to me.

190
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,280
If you have any ideas, feel free to tell me.

191
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,010
Xue Xiaodong.
Take charge of music classes.

192
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,540
Teach them to play piano and stuff.

193
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,180
Zhu Shanqi.

194
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,320
Remember to help those students who need extra tutoring.

195
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,240
Mr Wu Heng.

196
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,070
Yezi, what's up?

197
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,360
I don't want to be the monitor.

198
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,370
Ye Muxi, do you want to go KTV?

199
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,830
No, thanks. I'm going home.

200
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Have fun.

201
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,030
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.
A shot will send you back home.

202
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,930
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

203
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,910
Trench mortal. Trench mortal.

204
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,370
Indeed very powerful.

205
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,370
Trench mortal. Trench...

206
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,070
Stop. Stop. Xue Xiaodong.

207
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,850
What are you singing?

208
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,440
Trench mortal.

209
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,440
To my wonder girl.

210
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,690
What's wrong with you?

211
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,970
You're gonna sing this song tomorrow night?

212
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,970
Don't be impulsive.

213
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,970
You're the future superstar.

214
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,150
Don't worry.

215
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,510
I know what I should do.

216
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,920
Some things, if you let slip,

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,570
you'll never make it.

218
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,610
[ Liao Danyi ]
Hi, everyone.

219
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,780
I'm Liao Danyi.

220
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,340
Hereby I request,

221
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,840
to work as monitor of our Class Ten.

222
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,430
Wait!

223
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,850
I, Ye Muxi, want to join the monitor election!

224
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,670
Liao Danyi.

225
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,980
You're the one I hate the most in this world.

226
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,980
How could you do this?!

227
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,310
Ye Muxi, you gotta know.
This is the reality world.

228
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Not those scribbles on your books.

229
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,290
So she will come after you again.

230
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,640
What a nice scene!

231
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,480
What the hell do you want?

232
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,710
This, body language.

233
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,000
People in the world all know it means OK.

234
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,120
-I love you.
-Love you.
You...

235
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,350
You've gone too far!

236
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,020
Big boss, I was wrong.

237
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,380
I'll never do it again.

238
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,240
It's okay. It's okay.

239
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,540
Come with me if you dare!

240
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,780
We can't leave you.

241
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,830
Anyway, you lost.

242
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,360
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!
Idiot!

243
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,620
Liao Danyi sent me a message today.

244
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,500
He says, a date?

245
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,680
Stay with me.

246
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,110
Okay?

247
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,470
No.

248
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,090
Ye Muxi, what were you doing here?

249
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,000
Liao Danyi, you find me.

250
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,890
Let's go home.

251
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,370
You should hide away so I can go find you.

252
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,150
Some other day.

253
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,380
Let's go home to eat hot-pot, okay?

254
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,010
Brother, what brought you here?

255
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,160
I... I'm here to give you some yoghourt.

256
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,910
Take it.

257
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,900
Yezi.

258
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,920
What's wrong with you today?

259
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,040
Why do you look unhappy?

260
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,850
Liao Danyi transferred to Class One.

261
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,640
Sis.

262
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,250
Let me ask you a question.

263
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,590
Tell me.

264
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,780
The one drinks up yoghourt first and the one drinks it up later.

265
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,880
Which one is happier?

266
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,650
I think the one who drinks it up later must be happier.

267
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,140
Why?

268
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,600
Think about it.

269
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,690
The one who drinks it up first

270
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,040
finishes it quickly before fully feels its flavor.

271
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,600
Then has no more yoghourt.

272
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,170
Can only watches the one who drinks it up later...

273
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,800
Tasting it slowly.

274
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,980
Feeling various flavors in the yoghourt.

275
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,630
What the hell are you talking about?

276
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,600
Well...

277
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,300
Lines in the drama are indeed deceptive.

278
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,080
According to the drama,

279
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,680
when someone is upset,

280
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,790
get him some yoghourt.

281
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,600
And then,
tell him a meaningful story over the yoghourt.

282
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,870
After the story, he'll feel much better.

283
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,630
Liar. Liar.

284
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,770
I don't know what nonsense I was talking about.

285
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,970
But I do feel better.

286
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,040
Think, at such a moment,
someone still cares about me and comforts me.

287
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,070
Feel better.

288
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,420
Brother, thank you.

289
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,190
For playing with me over the past ten years.

290
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,230
Don't... Don't say that.

291
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,230
After all, I'm your brother.

292
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,230
It's my duty.

293
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,300
Make room! Make room! Excuse me!

294
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,470
Hurry. Hurry.

295
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,280
No. 100!

296
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
You're the No. 100 in this test.

297
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,700
[ Liao Danyi, Class Ten ]
[ Guan Xinyi, Class One ]

298
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,580
[ Ye Muxi, Class Ten]

299
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,880
[ No. 100 ]

300
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,960
Boss, any response?

301
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,050
Boss is always calm before such trifles.

302
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,740
Can't care less, okay?

303
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,230
Yes.

304
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,550
But, to be honest.

305
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,620
Liao Danyi also scores high for us!

306
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,110
Traitor!

307
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,770
No. 100...

308
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,640
Ye Muxi, you're the best!

309
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,780
Ye Muxi! Ye Muxi!

310
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,290
Ye Muxi! Ye Muxi! Ye Muxi!

311
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,100
Go away. Go away.

312
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,360
Don't you know no noise during lunch break?

313
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,210
Miss Xinyi.

314
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,810
Top 50 are all from our Class One.

315
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,470
But Liao Danyi is the No. 1 again.

316
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,610
That doesn't matter.

317
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,770
As long as he's in our class.

318
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,590
Am I right?

319
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,620
Ye Muxi.

320
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,480
I haven't said congrats to you.

321
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,110
You got a nice score this time.

322
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,100
No. 100 in the entire grade.

323
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,350
Spinster.

324
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,640
None of your business!

325
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,160
Why are you always meddling around?

326
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,570
I find that you really like
poking your nose into other people' affair, huh?

327
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,740
You like whatever an old spinster likes to do!

328
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,450
Let's go. Let's go.

329
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,910
Why should you leave?

330
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,230
You relied on yourself and got the score.

331
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,860
Why should you leave?

332
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,210
They're obviously bullying us!

333
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,740
I really don't know

334
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,520
what your damn Class One is gonna do this month.

335
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,810
You think you're very amazing since you all scored high?

336
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,420
So you can bully others here blatantly?

337
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,100
Why do you get so excited?

338
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm congratulating her sincerely.

339
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,680
Or, the answer has something to do with you two?

340
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,640
What did you mean by that?

341
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,210
Nothing special.

342
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,640
Ye Muxi's score is earned through hard work on her own.

343
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,170
She reviews lessons and studies by herself in the library every day.

344
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,160
Besides, we've lost the source of answers now.

345
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,000
I didn't say you have something to do with the answer.

346
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,680
Don't admit it so fast.

347
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,100
You may eat whatever you like. But don't spread rumors.
We got those answers thanks to someone in your Class One.

348
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,120
Enough.

349
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,870
Well, I hope,

350
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,890
I can see your names on the standings next time.

351
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,900
Goodbye.

352
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,820
Take care.

353
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,220
Ugly woman.

354
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,380
Isn't this Miss Guan Xinyi?

355
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,240
If you wanna congratulate her, say something more.

356
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,960
It's a fruit of your hard work. What's to fear?

357
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,010
I saw you arrive in school at five o'clock every morning.
Read books until the library got closed.

358
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,180
If they don't believe you, let them test you.

359
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,870
To see if you can't explain any question that you answered right.

360
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,510
Raise your head.

361
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,040
I rank at the bottom. But I dare raise my head.

362
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,330
Why you not?

363
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,940
What's wrong with you, Superstar Xue?

364
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,940
Are you preparing for a new soup opera?

365
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,950
Or you want paparazzi to play up it?

366
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,120
Do I need that?

367
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,170
Will you go watch my show?

368
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,620
Yes!

369
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,800
Superstar Xue, you're very popular.

370
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,540
But, so what?

371
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,710
Yes.

372
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,540
Why so cocky?

373
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,970
We're in a school, not society.

374
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,520
Score is the most important thing.

375
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,030
You rank the fifth from the bottom in your class.

376
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,070
Do you have any right to talk here?

377
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,300
Class One has fifty students in total.

378
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,590
But you rank the fiftieth.

379
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,470
You rank the fist from the bottom in your class.

380
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,840
A chicken among cranes, what's the big deal?

381
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,890
Xue Xiaodong...

382
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,890
Miss Guan Xinyi, what else can I do for you?

383
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,890
If no, I shall leave first. Bye.

384
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,260
You...

385
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,410
What makes you invite me to drink coffee here?

386
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,950
To celebrate you being top 100 in our grade.

387
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,080
I think it's nothing to celebrate about.

388
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,980
No.

389
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,790
Through your own effort, you managed to be top 100.

390
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,350
I'm really happy and proud of you.

391
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,370
In fact...

392
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,340
I always want to tell you this.

393
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,810
Thank you.

394
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,090
Thank you for forgiving my tantrums when you first met me.

395
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,470
Thank you for stopping me when I wanted to leave this school.

396
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,320
And staying with me.

397
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,620
Thank you for accompanying me to learn
the most important performance lesson in my life.

398
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,400
And many other things.

399
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,450
So I want to tell you...

400
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,520
You're welcome.

401
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,760
Aren't we friends?

402
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,070
Don't need to say thanks to me.

403
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,860
I'm your friend.

404
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,430
It's my duty to do that.

405
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,040
Right.

406
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,290
I just want to make you happy, Ye Muxi.

407
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,270
Actually I'm pretty fine.

408
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,740
It's just...

409
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
I don't laugh and joke so much as I did.

410
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,040
In fact, I know, that's not right.

411
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,490
Being like that...

412
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,670
Might make some people distaste me.

413
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,180
And think I'm silly and very childish.

414
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,660
I think...

415
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,260
It's time for me to change.

416
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,210
No.

417
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,840
I won't feel you're childish.

418
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,160
And I won't feel you're silly.

419
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,810
And I won't distaste you.

420
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,640
I think you're not really happy now.

421
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,420
I prefer the old you, always laughing and smiling.

422
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,740
You know what?

423
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,530
I started to know this society since I was very young.

424
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
Being a star.

425
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,690
This world is full of plots and schemes.

426
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,170
Interests about money.

427
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,950
To put it pessimistically.

428
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,110
Many people are gonna spend their life in that way.

429
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,880
So was I. Until I met you.

430
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,670
You made me know what's called 'live in the moment'.

431
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,620
And the happiness and importance of 'live in the moment'.

432
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,540
So I want to thank you.

433
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,750
And I also hope you can live in the moment as you did.

434
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,960
I believe.

435
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,130
I will find some way to make you happy.

436
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,760
So, what are you gonna do to help me?

437
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,830
First, please drink up this milk tea.
