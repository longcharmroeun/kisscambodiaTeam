What can I help you?

34
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,310
This is my favorite novel.

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,880
Now I lend it to you.

36
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,870
Why?

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,130
Don't ask.

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,010
I'm looking forward to your feedback.

39
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,700
I'm here.

40
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,310
I want to tell you...

41
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,040
Don't say anything.

42
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,720
Listen to me first.

43
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,630
When mountains have no ridges,

44
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,370
when rives stop running,

45
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,620
I only hope,

46
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,790
I can have the love that never
parts each other even if the world ends.

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,850
Maybe I can only make it come true in my dream.

48
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,650
One is like a cloud in the sky.

49
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,940
Drifting alone.

50
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,950
Sunlight goes through it to illuminate the Earth.

51
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,440
But the cloud itself doesn't know where it's heading to.

52
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,610
You know what?

53
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,330
I love oceans.

54
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,610
Mountains.

55
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,610
Rivers.

56
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,950
Creeks.

57
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,270
And you.

58
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,780
Like a boat in the ocean,

59
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,610
I hope I can dash into your heart

60
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,610

What's the matter?

73
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,330
I don't come to you once there's a matter, okay?

74
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,770
I'm here for Xiaodong.

75

76

Xiaotian!

77
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,200
Why did you run into my room?

78
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,660
Why did you take my pillow to your nest?

79
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,660
You made a mistake. Now you want dinner?

80
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,270
I've told you when you drank from the toilet.

81
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't make mistakes again.

82
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,920
Behave yourself. Okay?

83
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,630
Xiaotian, look at me.

84
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,360
Look at me sincerely.

85
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,130
Don't make mistakes again.

86
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,460
Behave yourself. Okay?

87
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,460
Don't make mistakes again.

88
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,730
Do you hear me, Xiaotian?

89
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,350
Which student can answer this question?

90
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,390
Teacher. Teacher, that...

91
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,880
That... He... He says that he can.

92
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,280
Liao Danyi, come up here.

93
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,310
Sorry, teacher.

94
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,970
I was a little absent-minded.

95
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,970
Didn't hear it clearly.

96
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,880
Okay. Sit down.

97
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,800
Teacher, I got stomachache.

98
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,830
It hurts.

99
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,130
Gotta take a break.

100
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,510
Mr Wu.

101
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,260
Danyi.

102
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,090
I think you're not yourself lately.

103
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,370
Messy hair. Pale face.

104
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,690
Wrong buttons.

105
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,730
And only one sock.

106
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,930
Even your handwriting goes crooked.

107
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,420
If you were some other student,

108
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,530
I will think he has stayed up playing video games.

109
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,630
I've been there.

110
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,640
I understand.

111
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,170
But you, Liao Danyi.

112
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,830
You're not that kind of student.

113
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,850
Tell me.

114
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,350
What happened to you lately?

115
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,730
Danyi.

116
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,400
Have you browsed some illegal website?

117
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,400
Not like that, Mr Wu.

118
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,510
It's because my father went to a business trip.

119
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,500
I stay at home alone...

120
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,430
Got it.

121
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,470
Your father is not home.

122
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,790
So you start to browse some illegal website.

123
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:15,810
Right?
So you start to browse some illegal website.

124
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,470
Right?

125
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,680
Danyi, such websites

126
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,850
will do harm to you teenagers' healthy development.

127
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,720
Do you understand?

128
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,340
Mr Wu, here is the thing.

129
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,620
I've got a trouble back home.

130
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,630
Ms Luo.

131
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,330
Isn't it inappropriate for you
to send me the flower before my student?

132
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,450
Isn't it more inappropriate for you
to be so shameless before your student?

133
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,450
Someone sent me the flower as a gift.

134
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,710
Danyi, let's continue.

135
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,250
The illegal website thing...

136
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,860
Mr Wu, there's really no that kind of website.

137
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,680
That's better.

138
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,220
Then I believe you can adjust yourself well to it.

139
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,220
Pull yourself together.

140
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,810
Excuse me, then.

141
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,740
Bye, teacher.

142
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,400
Okay.

143
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,260
Ms Luo, is it because you've been single for so long

144
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,120
that you bought a flower for yourself

145
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
to gratify your sense of presence?

146
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,770
Get lost.

147
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,870
Normal people don't have that kind of mentality.

148
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,700
Thinking of it that way means you're mentally ill.

149
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,420
I've told you, this flower is from someone else.

150
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm beautiful. Isn't it normal
for people to send me flowers?

151
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,270
Leave me alone. I gotta go to class now.

152
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,900
I forgot to tell you.

153
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,160
I got to know this flower guy online.

154
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,730
We also agreed to see each other
in People's Park this weekend.

155
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,910
To talk about life and dreams.

156
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,590
Ms Luo, may you have a happy date.

157
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,740
What?

158
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,010
Please make way.

159
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,870
Where are you going?

160
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,880
Home.

161
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,570
Why do you rush home after school every day?

162
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,570
Are you hiding something from me?

163
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,660
Tell me. I will keep it a secret.

164
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,500
Nothing.

165
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,250
Tell me.

166
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,370
You're really boring.

167
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,010
I won't tell anyone else. Just let me know.

168
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,660
Trust me.

169
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,810
Shoot.

170
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,770
Indeed, I've hidden something from you for a long time.

171
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,770
I feel that I should let you know.

172
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,960
But I think you can't take it now.

173
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,680
Are you ready?

174
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,910
No, I think you're not.

175
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,400
Relax.

176
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,400
Close your eyes.

177
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,830
Breathe in.

178
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,130
Breathe out.

179
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,970
Breathe in. Breathe out.

180
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,020
Let's go.

181
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,580
Come here, Xiaotian.

182
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,590
Now I want to talk with you about a few problems.

183
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,020
Look into my eyes.

184
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,300
Don't.

185
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,040
Don't make such a grimace.

186
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,160
Look at me.

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,900
Firstly, don't jump on my bed in the morning.

188
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,840
Secondly, Don't bite my slippers.

189
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,060
Thirdly.

190
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,030
Don't drink from the toilet again.

191
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,700
Fourthly.

192
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,700
Also the most crucial problem.

193
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,020
Don't defecate indiscriminately.

194
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,930
If you can observe the rules above,

195
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,490
we'll get along well with each other.

196
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,630
Don't try to avoid eye contact.

197
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,580
Look at me.

198
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,720
I believe you can make it. Okay?

199
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,870
I believe you.

200
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,550
I believe you're a good dog with due virtues.

201
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,010
Let's shake hands like real men do.

202
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,430
Good.

203
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,530
Let's go.

204
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,350
Could you tell me how can I get to Rd. Huachang?

205
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,780
Rd. Huachang?

206
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,080
Walk this way.

207
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,700
Turn left, then turn right.

208
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,940
Turn right again and you'll be there after two blocks.

209
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,100
Okay. Thank you.

210
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,780
No problem.

211
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,260
Young man, why don't you
walk your dog at night but hold a dog leash?

212
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm walking my dog.

213
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,030
Where's my dog?

214
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,300
Haven't seen it.

215
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,970
Xiaotian.

216
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,350
Xiaotian!

217
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,950
Xiaotian.

218
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,590
Xiaotian.

219
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,700
Xiaotian.

220
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040
Xiaotian!

221
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,770
Xiaotian.

222
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,450
Xiaotian.

223
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,710
Xiaotian.

224
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,960
We just made an agreement.

225
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,250
Then you did such a dangerous thing.

226
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,960
You'll get hurt in this way, you know?

227
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,240
As your master,

228
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
I gotta make you remember this lesson.

229
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,060
So I'm gonna beat you.

230
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,530
I'm really gonna beat you.

231
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,490
Here it is.

232
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,570
It's really good that you're safe.

233
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,430
For example, to choose one
from boys in our class as boyfriend.

234
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,880
Which one will you choose?

235
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,790
Which one will you choose, Li Yao?

236
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,140
None of my business.

237
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,060
-Hypothetically
-Yes.

238
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,610
If all boys in the world were killed by a bomb,

239
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,380
except boys in our class,

240
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,300
which one will you choose as your boyfriend?

241
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,420
I choose... To live on my own.

242
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,830
No. You must choose one.

243
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,640
How about this...

244
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,040
Let's go through an elimination process.

245
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,140
The first one.

246
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,140
Xiong Tiancheng.

247
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,230
No.

248
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,800
He writes good essays!

249
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,450
-Yes, such a scholar.
-So talented! Yes.

250
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,810
-Why don't you like him?
-No.

251
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,270
Well, Huang Nan and Huang Yi.

252
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,670
So cute. Makes you happy every day.

253
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,670
They're too noisy and annoying.

254
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,930
-But makes you happy.
-So much fun to be with either of them!

255
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,690
Won't feel upset everyday.

256
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,650
No.

257
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,090
Well, Liao Danyi.

258
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,090
Commissary in charge of studies. Excel at studies!

259
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,440
No.

260
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,790
Are you gonna choose my Xiaodong?

261
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,240
Definitely no!

262
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,140
That's good.

263
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,310
Only one boy left.

264
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,140
Cheng Ling.

265
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,710
Cheng Ling...

266
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,170
Something is going on here...

267
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,510
Enough! Enough!

268
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,210
I'm done. Now it's your turn.

269
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,280
What shall we eat tonight?

270
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,140
There's a newly opened milk tea store at the school gate.

271
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,100
Shall we go try it?

272
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,480
And then...

273
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,070
And then we'll go have some hot-pot.

274
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,350
I'm gonna kick someone's ass!

275
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,070
Where is that milk tea store, again?

276
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,600
Let me Google it.

277
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
Okay. Let's go now.

278
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,600
-Let's go.
-Google it over walking.

279
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,850
Unbelievable! Wait for me!

280
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,610
That Luo Li...

281
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,340
Have a date in a place
where retirees come to have square dances?

282
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,730
What a low taste!

283
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,530
Xiaotian?

284
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,000
Xiaotian, what brought you here?

285
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,090
Xiaotian.

286
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,870
Mr Wu?

287
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,740
Student Liao.

288
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,430
I haven't seen Xiaotian back in school for days.

289
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,570
Because you adopted him.

290
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,620
Yes, but he gives me headaches lately.

291
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,340
High five. High five.

292
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,490
Come here. Come here.

293
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Xiaotian.

294
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,070
No wonder you're in a bad state these days

295
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,760
Because you've been looking after Xiaotian?

296
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,480
Yes.

297
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,340
And your parents are not home.

298
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,670
You look after him alone.

299
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,150
It's really not easy.

300
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,060
In fact, I didn't tell my dad that I adopted Xiaotian.

301
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,500
My dad will be back in a few days.

302
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,130
He won't let me have a pet dog.

303
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,480
-Walks away.
-I think...

304
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,490
Walks away!

305
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,490
Mr Wu!

306
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,740
Ms Luo?

307
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,660
Voice down.

308
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,040
You're stalking her?

309
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,010
What did you mean by that?

310
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,010
Sounds like I'm so vulgar.

311
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,810
You're still too young. Won't understand this.

312
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,510
Here is the thing.

313
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,250
Ms Luo.

314
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,130
You're not young any more.
Still believe in cyber Love?

315
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,570
Ms Luo?

316
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,270
Ms Luo, don't leave.

317
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,770
Stop talking nonsense. What cyber friend?

318
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,770
Haven't seen him yet.

319
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,190
But he's already so romantic.

320
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,080
Attests to his culture attainment.

321
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,110
Compared with some unreliable man, he's much better!

322
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,260
Who is that unreliable man?

323
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,990
One of your cyber friends?

324
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,220
I really don't want to talk with you.

325
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,770
We agreed to meet each other
in People's Park at 3 p.m. this Saturday.

326
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,770
I'm very looking forward to that.

327
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,010
May I ask, in the playback,

328
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,110
why did Ms Luo Li emphasize time and location of the date?

329
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,110
And stopped you from coming?

330
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,410
That doesn't matter.

331
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,310
What matters is, she's on a date with some cyber friend.

332
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,990
This is one hundred percent unreliable!

333
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,930
Me and Ms Luo are good colleague and old classmates.

334
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,110
She's my junior.

335
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,520
Of course I should take care of her, right?

336
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,640
But,

337
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,840
her cyber friend hasn't come till now.

338
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,210
Is he really reliable?

339
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,210
She's stood up?

340
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,450
He's coming...

341
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,220
She waves to him.

342
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,440
And in our direction?

343
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,790
What were you guys doing here?

344
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,200
-Walking dog.
-Watching flowers.

345
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,940
I think you guys are stalking me.

346
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,630
Who's stalking you?

347
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,940
I heard that student Liao adopted Xiaotian.

348
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,340
I haven't seen Xiaotian for days, right?

349
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,290
I missed him.

350
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,900
So I told student Liao

351
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,750
to play with Xiaotian in the park today.

352
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,050
Coincidentally, we bumped into you.

353
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,090
Right?

354
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,360
Ms Luo.

355
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,660
Aren't you gonna meet a cyber friend today?

356
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,530
Where's he?

357
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,290
You're stood up?

358
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,670
Look, what did I told you?

359
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,380
Cyber friends are unreliable.

360
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,750
Artists are unreliable.

361
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,790
Cyber artist friends are most unreliable!

362
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,920
But you wouldn't listen.

363
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,000
Yes. Yes.

364
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,130
Now I feel so bad.

365
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,730
What should I do?

366
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,170
Don't be sad.

367
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm here to help you out, see?

368
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,510
Really?

369
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,560
Yes.

370
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,340
That... That's so great!

371
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,290
Well, where are we heading to next?

372
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,660
I... I feel so embarrassed after being stood up.

373
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,900
How about walking the dog with me?

374
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,010
Okay.

375
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,740
Student Liao.

376
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,520
Let's go.

377
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,200
Let's go.

378
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,460
Teachers, my dog...

379
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,210
Go back home now.

380
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,520
Study hard.

381
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,100
My teachers' acting skills are so not natural.

382
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,270
Student Liao, you have a nice bedroom.

383
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,700
Looks so orderly.

384
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,370
Yes.

385
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,600
Everything's here?

386
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,440
Xiaotian.

387
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,320
Xiaotian, why do you lose weight?

388
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,370
Mr Wu.

389
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,910
Have you abused him?

390
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,480
What are you talking about, student Liao?

391
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,910
I'm an ambassador of love.

392
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,240
I treated him so well.

393
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,290
Am I right, Xiaotian?

394
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,420
Did I treat you well?

395
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,000
Student Liao.

396
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,860
I know you missed Xiaotian very much.

397
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,430
And as requested by Ms Luo,

398
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,970
today I took Xiaotian here to get together with you.

399
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,020
But in the future,

400
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,820
Xiaotian will be in the charge of me and Ms Luo.

401
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,840
And you will focus on study and adjust yourself.

402
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,850
Mr Wu.

403
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,440
Last night, you and Ms Luo, you two...

404
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,890
Me and Ms Luo...

405
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,330
We talked a lot about education.

406
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,840
Had a nice talk.

407
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,780
Student Liao.

408
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,340
Have you mistaken the relationship between me and Ms Luo Li?

409
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,300
No, I haven't.

410
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,840
Me and Ms Luo Li... were schoolfellows.

411
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Now, colleagues.

412
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,150
Although Ms Luo is very casual normally,

413
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,540
deep down,

414
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,120
she's still a little bunny immature.

415
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,050
Look, she's a girl.

416
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,080
Having a date with some unreliable cyber friend.

417
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,470
How dangerous is that!

418
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,560
As her senior,

419
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,610
shouldn't I go to protect her?

420
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,240
With you guys looking after Xiaotian,

421
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,940
I really feel assured.

422
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,940
Also, thank you guys for that.

423
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,400
Just rest easy.

424
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,670
These stuffs are all what I've got.

425
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,510
Including his toy.

426
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,340
Xiaotian.

427
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,440
All right, I gotta take Xiaotian away now.

428
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,800
I'll come again with him to see you some other day.

429
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Okay.

430
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,250
Let's go, Xiaotian.

431
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,010
Xiaotian, let's go.

432
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,160
Xiaotian, what's up? Don't want to leave him?

433
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,710
Let's go home.

434
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,300
Then cook delicious food for you.

435
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,340
Let's go.

436
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,650
Go.

437
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,280
Go.

438
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,490
Why don't you go?

439
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,340
Go.

440
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,200
I will visit you later.

441
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,890
Xiaotian, let's go. Go.

442
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,260
Xiaotian. Xiaotian.

443
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,850
Why don't you go?

444
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,760
Just go.

445
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,910
Xiaotian, just go.

446
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,540
Why don't you go?

447
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,540
Why?

448
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,760
Xiaotian.

449
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,740
Xiaotian. Xiaotian.

450
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,920
Let's go, Xiaotian.

451
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,380
Xiaotian.

452
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,280
Be good, Xiaotian.

453
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,690
Xiaotian.

454
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,230
Be good.

455
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,230
-Xiaotian, just go.
-Let's go, Xiaotian.

456
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,110
Xiaotian.

457
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,420
Xiaotian.

458
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,240
Xiaotian.

459
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,050
Xiaotian.

460
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,490
Xiao...
