The Big Boss
Episode 26

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,653
What're you thinking about?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,866
I'm thinking, it's time to return the favor.

29
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,413
Return the favor?

30
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:06,973
These years,

31
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,333
brother has been cooking nice things for me.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Especially my favorite Hotpot.

33
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:14,533
I think I should do something for him.

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,640
What are you gonna do?

35
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:23,480
An eye for an eye.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,546
He cooks for me.

37
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,493
So I'll cook for him.

38
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,306
Please think twice before you do anything.

39
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:29,946
Are you his enemy?

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,186
I remember the first time,
you almost set the house on fire!

41
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,720
The fire fight truck came.

42
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,200
The second time,

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,493
You poured a bottle of sauce in.
Your brother felt sick for a whole week.

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,000
Then... What should I do?

45
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:47,453
Order some take-out.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,680
Sincerity is what matters.

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,453
So it has to be cooked by you 
to make him feel your sincerity.

48
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,280
Although your cooking skill is a little...

49
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,133
But we can learn.

50
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,866
As long as we start from the basics,

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,173
In some days, 
You will be a good cook one day.

52
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,920
My advice is, cooking lessons.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,853
But if I go there alone.
That will be so embarrassing?

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,506
It's summer vacation.

55
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,706
Your classmates are all free at home.

56
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,853
I think if you call them.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,693
They will all come.

58
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,546
It's deal then.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,386
Liao Danyi.

60
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:53,840
You fool.

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,440
Fool. Fool.

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,493
So handsome!

63
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,493
Liao Danyi.

64
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,226
Why can't I get tired of your photos?

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,266
If you want to win a man's heart.

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,093
Win his stomach first.

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,066
I should go attend a cooking lesson in summer vacation.

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,093
I don't want anyone to see me wearing this.

69
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,160
Hello, dear students.

70
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:02,786
Today, we're gonna learn dessert.

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,453
But I need to remind you first.

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,080
It's really not an easy thing 

73
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,280
if you really want to make some delicious dessert.

74
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,333
Seems students in class Ten have all realized it.

75
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,586
I heard cooking is a very promising career.

76
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,746
Maybe what you need is not a training class.
You should transfer to study in here.

77
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,933
You think that will upset me?

78
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,453
Not at all.

79
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,373
Now I have told you everything.

80
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,973
And you have all the materials.

81
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,160
Now I'll leave the place for you.

82
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,386
It's not clean.

83
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,880
Teacher. Ye Muxi is playing with her food.

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,013
Teacher, is this okay?

85
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,253
Teacher. Ye Muxi is really playing with her food.
Look...

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,413
Like this?

87
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,533
Teacher, look!

88
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,573
Teacher, it's like my heart. Here it is.

89
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,813
I didn't know you're so good at this.

90
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:05,866
As Miss Xinyi's follower.

91
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
It's a basic ability.

92
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,520
I wonder class Ten...

93
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:19,266
What're they doing?

94
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't know. So gross.

95
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,920
So scary.

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,213
So gross.

97
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,133
Add some blood!

98
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,120
Cheng Ling. Try this.

99
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:50,840
Is that delicious?

100
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,533
So yummy!

101
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,826
You're lying.

102
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,706
- Are you okay? 
- So yummy.

103
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,600
It's really yummy.

104
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:05,853
So bitter.

105
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,360
Did you put spicy strip?

106
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,933
I did.

107
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,013
Or it would be worse.

108
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,626
What a waste.

109
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,706
I wonder how is Xiaodong doing.

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,026
This looks so tasty!

111
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,212
Want a bite?

112
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,320
Xiaodong cooked this...

113
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,933
Shanqi. Calm down.

114
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh, one last step.

115
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,400
Be delicious.

116
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,480
Shanqi, don't.

117
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,053
It's so amazing.

118
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:35,213
I see light.

119
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:40,986
Grandpa, grandpa.

120
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:44,133
Wait for me, I'm coming, grandpa.

121
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,853
Shanqi, don't go into the light.

122
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,466
Grandpa?

123
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,693
You two want a bite?

124
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,146
Big boss.

125
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,013
How is Shanqi?
Xiaodong sent her back home.

126
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,893
Hope she is fine.

127
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,146
Li Yao.

128
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,213
Why do you want to learn to cook?

129
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,080
Because...

130
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,053
Try it.

131
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,146
How is it? is that bad?

132
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,093
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

133
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,693
It's my first time to cook.

134
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,866
I will cook better.

135
00:10:55,986 --> 00:10:56,973
Sorry.

136
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,946
You fool, it's very delicious.

137
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,280
But no matter how tasty it is.

138
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,826
It's not as good as one thousandth of you.

139
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,053
Li...Li Yao.
What's wrong with you?

140
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,320
Nothing. You should not learn to cook. 

141
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,560
Why?

142
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:42,306
You have seen it.

143
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,600
It's not easy to make dessert.

144
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,933
Our intention is the thing that really matters.

145
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:49,200
Think about it.

146
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
The dessert you're making

147
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,213
is for the one you love the most.

148
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,693
Make it with your heart.

149
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,520
That will help you a lot.

150
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,146
In fact, I'm doing this for the person
who matters the most in my life.

151
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:01,986
I will make it better than you.

152
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,893
Because...

153
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,720
This is for the one I love.

154
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,826
Every time, when I sleep on the couch.

155
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,960
He would take off his jacket.

156
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
And put it on me.

157
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:22,000
Miss Xinyi. Are you okay? Miss Xinyi.

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm fine. Go on.

159
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,786
And every time when I couldn't sleep.

160
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,160
He would hug me and touch my head

161
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,520
to comfort me.

162
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
To make me feel so safe.

163
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,840
Miss Xinyi. Are you really okay?

164
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,746
I'm okay. Go on.

165
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,173
He also cooks for me.

166
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:57,490
Breakfast, lunch, dinner.

167
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,820
Every meal.

168
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,026
He is so good to me.

169
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,000
I want to make something good for him.

170
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:15,666
Love.

171
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,266
Love. I love you.

172
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,506
I Love you.

173
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,173
Love.

174
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,066
-I love you.
-Love
You...

175
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:29,200
You, you,

176
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
You're away too far!

177
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,626
Miss Xinnyi.

178
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:36,973
Miss Xinyi. Wait for me.

179
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,586
What's wrong with Class one?

180
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,000
Who knows?

181
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,866
Teacher. I'm done.

182
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:48,546
Okay.

183
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,146
Good, not bad.

184
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,293
Thank you, teacher.

185
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,120
Next.

186
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,000
Teacher, please try it.

187
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:09,120
Is it good?

188
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,240
Good, very good.

189
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,546
Thank you, teacher.

190
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,000
Next.

191
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,493
Good. Very good.

192
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,373
Really? I can make dessert!

193
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,373
Good, really good.

194
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,226
We made progress! We made progress!

195
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,120
Goodbye teacher.

196
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,173
Bye, students.

197
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,346
Goodbye teacher.

198
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:44,013
Bye.

199
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,160
Goodbye teacher. See you next time.

200
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,253
Okay. Goodbye, goodbye.

201
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,373
It's so awful.

202
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,440
I'm glad they're gone.

203
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:00,240
It's really hard to make dessert.

204
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,853
Today's topic of Chinese Essay is...

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,320
Those adults.

206
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,066
Which adult will we see every day?

207
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,306
Like Mr. Wu Heng.

208
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,066
How can I describe him?

209
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,600
But not reliable anyway.

210
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,653
And little narcissistic.

211
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:22,826
He is not young anymore.

212
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,280
But sometimes, he is more like a child than us.

213
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,840
But, when he is serious.

214
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,946
Unexpectedly, he really seems like a teacher.

215
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,213
A teacher who barely passed the standards.

216
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,573
In this way, he looks,

217
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:42,266
he is destined to be the head teacher of Class Ten. 

218
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,760
First.

219
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,000
What the hell?

220
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,866
Is this a horror movie?

221
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,906
Students, in this examination.

222
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,973
Your classmate, Liao Danyi
has got the best score in our grade.

223
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,093
It's the forth examination.

224
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,266
Four examinations. Liao Danyi is always the best.

225
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,826
What does that tell you?

226
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,186
That I'm the best teacher.

227
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm very proud.

228
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,506
So all of you should learn from Liao Danyi.

229
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,733
Hear me?

230
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,960
Answer me.

231
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,120
Yes.

232
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,613
This, this, this.

233
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,813
This, this, this.

234
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,760
This, look at this.

235
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,906
Move. Move. Move.

236
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:06,400
Tell me.

237
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,733
Where did you get this book?

238
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,493
Read this kind of things in your age.
Is that right?

239
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,493
You can't even understand your textbook.
This?!

240
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,479
Go back to read your textbook. Hear me?

241
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,786
Move!

242
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,080
Oh my god!

243
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,866
Sorry, sorry.

244
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,880
Wu sir.

245
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,733
Wei.

246
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,453
Compass and fortune telling.
I don't encourage that.

247
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,360
It's superstition.

248
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,760
But today, I want to ask you a favor.

249
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,000
I have been in a bad luck recently.

250
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,920
Can you check it for me?

251
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,000
Since Wu Sir asked.

252
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
Of course I will do it.

253
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,266
But, it's 10MB a time.

254
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,266
What?

255
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm your teacher!

256
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
You asked me for money?

257
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:53,186
Hurry, hurry.

258
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,493
Recently, Mercury is retrograding.
It's easy to get stuck with bad luck.

259
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
But it can be changed.

260
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:03,320
This. As long as you keep it with you every day.

261
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,946
Trust me, your bad luck will go away.
Thanks.

262
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,320
Well, I'll make an exception. I'll charge you eighty.

263
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,480
Eighty?

264
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,746
It's cheap. I charge the others for a hundred.

265
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,533
Do you have changes?

266
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,493
Never mind. 

267
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,426
Gimme.

268
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,933
Keep it between us.

269
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,053
Bye, teacher.

270
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,106
Secret.

271
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:43,120
You've worked hard today.

272
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,733
I'm arranged your schedule of tomorrow.
I'll send it to your phone.

273
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:48,520
Give me a break, Annie.

274
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,506
I have class tomorrow.

275
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,906
-Morning.
-Hi, Xiaodong.

276
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:15,920
What a coincidence.

277
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,893
You're so early.

278
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,880
You're also very early.

279
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,160
I just got here.

280
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,466
How is it?
How is your summer vacation?

281
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,746
Good.

282
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,573
I'm on a touring concert.

283
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,613
You don't say.

284
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,933
I watched. I watched.
- Really? 
- So handsome!

285
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,306
-Hi.
-Hi.

286
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,386
You're so early.

287
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:32,026
Right.
First day in school. Should come early.

288
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,906
Tell me what did you do in vacation?

289
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,426
-I haven't finished my homework.
-Hi, guys.

290
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:40,360
You haven't?

291
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,720
-Morning, classmates.
-Listen,

292
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,840
I was playing rock music my whole summer.

293
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,000
That.

294
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,853
Morning. Long time no see!

295
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:50,160
Long time no see! Miss you so much.

296
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,706
How are you doing lately?

297
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,186
Pretty good.
Just finished my homework yesterday.

298
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,106
Homework? Do we have that?
-Copy ours.
-What homework?

299
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,853
I haven't finished it.

300
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,293
Our new semester has begun.
You still haven't finished your homework.
My god!

301
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,000
Cheng Ling, help me.

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,106
You're good at this.

303
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,546
Don't bully Cheng Ling.

304
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Yezi will be here soon right?

305
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,853
Forget it then.

306
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,160
Where have you been lately?

307
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:16,933
The amusement park is amazing!

308
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:20,146
Aren't you my favorite students?

309
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,026
Hi, teacher!

310
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:23,733
I'm so glad to see you all!

311
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:24,800
Wu sir.

312
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,360
This feels so strange. 

313
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,546
The school is so empty!

314
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:30,440
Seems we're the only students here.

315
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:31,613
What's going on?

316
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:32,240
Right.

317
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,733
It's a long story.

318
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,106
Let me write it down.

319
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,133
Write it down?

320
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,706
In fact,

321
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,760
School has informed all the head teachers 

322
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,053
at the end of last semester.

323
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,226
A teaching building in our school needs a restoration.

324
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,013
All the head teachers had informed their students,

325
00:22:55,773 --> 00:23:00,893
But due to my little negligence.

326
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,853
I forgot to tell you.

327
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,520
So, here, I need to say this to everybody.
[ New semester begins tomorrow ]

328
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,440
Sorry!

329
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,906
Stop there! Stop!

330
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,893
Don't run. Don't!

331
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,720
Okay, Xiaodong, I heard you.

332
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,386
Someone confessed her love to Xiaodong again.
The fifteenth case this month.

333
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,226
Get ready, plan A.

334
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,866
Yali, you know what?

335
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,493
The biggest virtue of you,

336
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,013
is that you never overestimate yourself.

337
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,653
After all, Xue Xiaodong doesn't know you well.

338
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,173
Later, there's a possibility that he might refuse me.

339
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:46,480
But it's okay.

340
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,893
Think about Seiya and Monkey D Luffy.

341
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:50,186
Never give up.

342
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,080
Isn't that the most valuable character of the heroine?

343
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,320
Xue Xiaodong likes music.

344
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,466
Before he can say anything.

345
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,666
I'll surprise him with my singing.

346
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,333
To strike a sympathetic chord.

347
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,133
Finally it's my show time.

348
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,680
I've loved him for two months.

349
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,573
Being brilliant isn't my fault.

350
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,760
Yali.

351
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,333
Xue Xiaodong.

352
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,213
This song is for you.

353
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,653
Someone confessed her love to Xiaodong

354
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:37,893
Look, so romantic.

355
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,733
Hi, classmates, can I have a look?

356
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:51,893
Thanks.

357
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:59,293
Yali, this song is for you.

358
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,386
Thank you for your love.

359
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:06,213
I like music.

360
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,306
Nothing else.

361
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,253
I'm glad that you like me.

362
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,680
But for your love

363
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,560
I can only give you more songs.

364
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,800
Can you be the guardian star of my music career?

365
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,440
Please.

366
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,800
Of course I do.

367
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,906
Xue Xiaodong. You're so amazing.

368
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,946
I see. I'll continue to support you.

369
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:31,080
Thanks.

370
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,213
I have a concert next month.

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,440
Hope I can see you there.

372
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,106
I will. I will.

373
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
My idol just sang a song for me.

374
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,946
That's amazing.

375
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:40,986
Let's go.
I'll take you to join his fans club.

376
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:44,733
I will go buy the ticket now.

377
00:26:44,893 --> 00:26:46,706
Wait for me. I will be there.
Wait for me.

378
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:54,773
Target is gone.

379
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,666
Everyone, clean the site and get your meal.
