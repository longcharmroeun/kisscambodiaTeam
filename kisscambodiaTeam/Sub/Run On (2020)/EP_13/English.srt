1
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:14,330
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,416
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,588
I don't want to do it.

4
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,508
Do what?

5
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,052
Being disappointed.

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,350
It's not your fault anyway.

7
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,523
I don't want to bad-mouth your family.

8
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,691
I just…

9
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:44,277
I just…

10
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,033
What's wrong with me?

11
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:55,330
I've lived well until now.

12
00:00:58,249 --> 00:00:59,459
So what do I lack?

13
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:11,471
I value myself

14
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:14,974
more than anyone else.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,065
So I want to give up.

16
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:28,321
You said I could

17
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,407
make a mistake.

18
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,165
I hoped

19
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,295
that we'd just have problems of our own.

20
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,384
Because that kind of stuff
is something we can work on.

21
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:51,678
It's within our control.

22
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:03,022
But when it comes to external problems,
I have to endure them.

23
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:06,985
And I don't like doing that.

24
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,781
Whenever I was faced with
relationship issues,

25
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:14,033
all I had to do was
just end the relationship.

26
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,161
It was my instinct to run away.

27
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,832
Because I hated letting myself get hurt.

28
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:30,675
This is why I didn't want to meet you.

29
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,013
I knew I'd end up saying this
considering how I felt.

30
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:42,520
Do you want to break up?

31
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:47,984
I'm a coward, aren't I?

32
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,488
The fact that I made you say that first.

33
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,201
So you want to break up.

34
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,305
Where's the courtesy?

35
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,683
Even if you're a coward,

36
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,520
how could you make me say it first?

37
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,151
The only mistake you made today

38
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:32,904
was making me say it first.

39
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,288
You could've slept on it.

40
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,255
Let's give each other some time.

41
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,009
It's the least you can do for me.

42
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,471
I think I deserve that much.

43
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,558
Don't I?

44
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,020
You deserve it. You do.

45
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:19,909
Okay.

46
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,580
Okay then.

47
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,755
That's good enough. I'll be off now.

48
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,778
EPISODE 13

49
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,258
I think my dad knows
that you guys go around holding hands.

50
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,262
I got scared that he might have
a separate file for me too,

51
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:24,474
so I started looking for it.

52
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:26,642
But there wasn't one.

53
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:28,728
You're his daughter.

54
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,396
Seon-gyeom is his son.

55
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:35,735
There is this guy I love.

56
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:39,655
My dad put him through a lot as well
behind my back.

57
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:42,992
How did he handle it?

58
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,745
He always ran away,
and I always went after him.

59
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:48,998
I stopped counting
once it reached the fifth time.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,003
I'd go anywhere to find him
no matter where he runs off to.

61
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:59,300
I wonder how Seon-gyeom will react
if you ever run away from him.

62
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,846
Haven't you ever thought
that he might run away?

63
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,890
Seon-gyeom never runs away.

64
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,395
Do you think

65
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,316
I don't deserve to be with Seon-gyeom?

66
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,027
Are you treating me like a mean
sister-in-law already?

67
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,737
Don't think of me like that.

68
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,866
I sometimes feel like I don't deserve him.

69
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,203
When I'm with him,

70
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,581
I sometimes end up
being faced with my flaws.

71
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,251
And I lose focus on my work.

72
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,712
I'm able to focus better on work
if my love life is stable.

73
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,381
Love is great.

74
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:44,303
But I never want to lose focus on my work
no matter what happens.

75
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,474
It's kind of like losing myself.

76
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:54,772
I'll try to help Seon-gyeom
the best I can.

77
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,108
But I'm also quite a mess these days.

78
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,486
I figured it was only right

79
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,240
to tell you first
before telling Seon-gyeom about it.

80
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,163
I hope he never finds out.

81
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:15,877
I just want us to concentrate
on each other for now.

82
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:25,136
By the way, why do you go after him
every time he runs away?

83
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:29,682
Because I know how much he loves me.

84
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,269
That's why he runs away.

85
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,515
Will you turn off the alarm?

86
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:16,604
My class begins in the afternoon.
Turn off the alarm.

87
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,401
Have fun running.

88
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:33,329
You don't always have
to overcome everything.

89
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,789
You can rest on the weekends.

90
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,620
SEO DAN-AH

91
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:20,751
Her grandfather, father,
and older brother…

92
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,170
Wait. They all have "myeong"
in their names

93
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,715
except for Ms. Seo.

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,176
Is it because she's pretty?

95
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:32,096
And I don't see Seo Tae-woong.

96
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,140
Is he really a competitor?

97
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,267
Ms. Seo is way too attractive.

98
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:40,396
It's Ms. Seo's birthday soon.

99
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,690
I see. Okay.

100
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,984
First, let's apply for the charity run.

101
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:49,905
I'm done applying.

102
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,912
Gosh, I was hoping you'd respond,
but I didn't get anything out of you.

103
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,259
Is something wrong?
You didn't even go running today.

104
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:12,428
My goodness.

105
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,847
Tell me what's on your mind.

106
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,933
Don't take it out on the laundry.
These are our clothes.

107
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,186
Does she

108
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:24,982
really want to break up?

109
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:31,405
Did I give her a hard time
while we were together?

110
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:35,576
I thought I tried my best,

111
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,662
but was that not enough?

112
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:43,083
Did that pile up

113
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:49,173
and eventually make her explode
because of my dad?

114
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,886
Now I totally get why you weren't
folding the laundry properly.

115
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,849
Is there anything I can do to help?

116
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,523
If you're done with that milk,

117
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,401
wash the carton and recycle it.

118
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:13,656
You got it.

119
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:19,328
Then can I ask you for a favor as well?

120
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,372
It's nothing big.

121
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,419
Sure. Go ahead.

122
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:33,467
I thought you never wanted
to eat japchae again.

123
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,470
I need to use the ingredients I bought.

124
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,853
That's not what I meant.
You can find recipes online.

125
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,521
So why ask me for help?

126
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,607
What if I know the recipe?
It needs to taste good.

127
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,112
How could everything taste so bad
when you chop so well?

128
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:56,282
-Maybe your mouth is the problem.
-My mouth is always the problem.

129
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:58,826
Is there anything else I need to chop?

130
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:05,124
May, I kind of get why you cook.

131
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,545
While I was cooking,

132
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,966
I only thought of how dull the knife was

133
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,845
and if I had to chop the garlic
or mince them.

134
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,516
"I should send resumes tomorrow
so I can keep myself busy with work."

135
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:27,187
I didn't think of that kind of stuff.
It was kind of like running.

136
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:28,939
It's a different form of meditation.

137
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,152
That's why I always ask you
to be my cooking assistant.

138
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,154
Do you see the big picture?

139
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,365
That's what makes you a great CEO.

140
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:42,036
You need to rest like it's an obligation
in order to last in this business.

141
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,664
Working is resting.
You're always busy with work yourself.

142
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,374
After I started my own firm,

143
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,711
I realized that CEOs also love
receiving monthly paychecks.

144
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,464
My dream was to live off monthly salaries.

145
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,758
Why did I have to start my own business?

146
00:12:57,384 --> 00:13:00,012
The movie you worked on
is going to hold a preview,

147
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,180
so come watch it with him.

148
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,933
You should watch your subtitles
on the big screen.

149
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:07,394
Oh, that.

150
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,397
It's like you.

151
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:13,859
That's how I feel about that movie.

152
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,824
Don't disappear.

153
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,745
Be with me forever.

154
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,331
I won't.

155
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:34,546
I said that only to run away myself.

156
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,342
Maybe I'm a piece of trash.

157
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,220
I really need to watch what I say.

158
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,721
What are you thinking?

159
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,641
It's the weekend, and I'm overcoming it.

160
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:47,601
Today's a weekday.

161
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:50,145
I'm so quick to lecture others.

162
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,897
Today's a weekday.

163
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:06,662
FAMOUS RICE BURGERS

164
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:10,624
Where's the valet?

165
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,843
Why are you suddenly
asking about the ballet?

166
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:24,763
"Ballet"?

167
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,350
The valet…

168
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,270
Who's going to park my car?

169
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,981
People do that for you?

170
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,317
I've never heard of that before.

171
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,281
Who told you to park here?

172
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,742
-Then where should we park?
-You can't park here.

173
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,618
Why aren't you using honorifics?

174
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,413
I'm sorry. Just a second.

175
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:53,000
My school is nearby,
so let's just park the car there.

176
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,669
We'll leave. Sorry.

177
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,263
It better be worth all this trouble.

178
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:08,390
You told me you want to know
what's inside me.

179
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,352
I'll show you before I put it inside me.

180
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,363
Did you think I might kiss you?

181
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,824
I'd be lying if I say no.

182
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,788
I thought I hurt you.

183
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,831
Do you know how rude it is to say that?

184
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:36,085
You tend to hold a grudge.
And it lasts quite a while.

185
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,045
What exactly did I do to hurt you?

186
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:40,381
It's better to tell me than to sue me.

187
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:41,632
Sue you? Why?

188
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,343
Do you think you'd win
if you file a lawsuit against me?

189
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,346
-It's for your own sake.
-Why would I sue you?

190
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,014
Why must we fight at all?

191
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,850
-You have no friends, do you?
-Why would I need friends?

192
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,310
You don't make friends out of need.

193
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:55,020
You just naturally make them.

194
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:58,941
Then do you want to be my friend?

195
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,905
You just hurt me by saying that.

196
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,326
I hurt you again? What hurt you?
How did I hurt you?

197
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:14,164
You didn't tell me
it's your birthday soon.

198
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:16,291
Do you have any plans then?

199
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,673
No, I don't. And I never will.

200
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,302
Then can we have a party and go on a date?

201
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,470
No.

202
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,397
Are they harvesting the rice?
What's taking so long?

203
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,359
Are you sure you're free that day?

204
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:44,528
-When?
-On your birthday.

205
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,571
I'm free.

206
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,074
Then let's meet.

207
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,409
Don't bring that up again.

208
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,704
What's the big deal about my birthday?

209
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,622
It's the day you were born.

210
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,876
Being born is a miracle in itself,

211
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,128
but you're also healthy and dating me.

212
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,384
What do you get out of
celebrating birthdays?

213
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:08,552
Their heart.

214
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:11,680
That stuff disappears.

215
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,057
It lasts longer because it's invisible.

216
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,310
Some feelings
even grow stronger with time.

217
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,564
You'll regret wasting your time.

218
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:23,150
I don't even know what will happen
in an hour.

219
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,194
Will you please meet me that day?

220
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,987
I'll tell you what happens in an hour.

221
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,323
-You're being bossy again.
-Let's just meet

222
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,909
another day to eat
and go for a drive like today.

223
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,869
-No.
-Stop saying no.

224
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,954
-I forbid you.
-You forbid a lot of things.

225
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:37,664
-No.
-You always say no to me too.

226
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:40,250
Your rice burgers are ready.

227
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,471
Let's stop.

228
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,723
Stop what?

229
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,851
We shouldn't argue
in front of the burgers.

230
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,273
Then what should we say?

231
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:04,942
"It's delicious."

232
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:09,696
It's delicious.

233
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,740
Why can't we meet on your birthday?

234
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,409
-So it's okay when you do it.
-Of course, yes.

235
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,578
-Couples spend time…
-Who says we're a couple?

236
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:20,707
Now that really hurts me.

237
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,584
I hurt you again?

238
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,546
Among all the stuff you said,
this hurt me the most.

239
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,800
What am I to you?

240
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,347
A vending machine.

241
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,476
If you cry again,

242
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,104
I might have to fix my vending machine.

243
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,399
After you bought me coffee,
I looked up all the vending machine menus.

244
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:47,359
I noticed that they sell hot chocolate.

245
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:50,153
I'm done eating.

246
00:18:51,822 --> 00:18:53,365
Don't take it out on the food.

247
00:18:57,578 --> 00:19:01,456
I wanted to catch Yeong-il's match,
but it wasn't broadcasted.

248
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,042
Articles flew out though.

249
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,547
He came in second place
at the National Sports Festival.

250
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,135
He only came to Seoul
to prepare for the event.

251
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,762
What if my presence made him lose focus?

252
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,934
He wouldn't have been a champion
if he was fazed by that.

253
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:25,981
Without you, I'm all alone.

254
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:29,151
Then you'll keep winning first place.

255
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,778
Maybe it was your presence
that motivated me.

256
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,116
I think he's just in a slump.

257
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,623
Would he come to help me train

258
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,666
-when he's devastated?
-Here he comes.

259
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,687
On your mark.

260
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,735
Get set.

261
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:45,644
Take it easy, will you?
You won't be competing soon

262
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,104
and the season is over.

263
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,400
Yeong-il, will you continue
to ride your motorcycle?

264
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,235
I came here by car today.

265
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,321
Then what's with the helmet?

266
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:59,116
It's like a prop.

267
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,245
So it's your schtick?

268
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,747
Who taught you that word?

269
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:12,212
How can I give it up
when I enjoy being fast?

270
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:15,215
Seeing anyone go past me
makes my blood boil.

271
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:18,385
You know I came in second
at the National Sports Festival.

272
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:21,888
Never have I seen
anyone's back on the tracks,

273
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:23,265
but I did yesterday.

274
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:25,726
How did it feel?

275
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,228
Seeing the back of his head?

276
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,314
It wasn't all that bad.

277
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:37,529
But you just said that seeing the back
of one's head makes your blood boil.

278
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,490
It's not like I can look away though.

279
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:45,871
-I'll get some more beverages.
-No, I'll go.

280
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,374
-I won't be comfortable.
-But your leg…

281
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,542
It's fine.

282
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,174
The one who beat me said in an interview

283
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,260
that his goal was to break my record.

284
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:04,264
If I had come in at 10.00 seconds,

285
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,600
his record might've been under that.

286
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,604
If I run faster, those trying to beat me
will run faster too.

287
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:14,608
Our juniors running faster isn't so bad.

288
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,861
Exactly, and that's a pity.

289
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,490
That's what I think about that,

290
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:24,576
although others may think I'd be annoyed

291
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,119
that they're faster than I am.

292
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,546
-What was that for?
-I was comforting you.

293
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,636
-Don't do that again.
-Then win the race.

294
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,929
Stop it, will you?

295
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,021
Ms. Seo, let's say you have a kid

296
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:54,397
and that kid's all grown up.

297
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,025
How on earth
am I supposed to imagine that?

298
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,444
You hate that your son's dating a peasant.

299
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:02,906
You gave them a bribe
so that they'd go away

300
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:04,783
and threw a fit at their house.

301
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,910
But what if they didn't break up?

302
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,996
That parent must have a lot of free time.

303
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,749
Mr. Jeong, be careful what you let in!

304
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:16,461
Can I get you a drink? Tea or coffee?

305
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,630
I'd like a glass of cold water, please.

306
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:19,839
Mr. Jeong!

307
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,719
Why would you ask me that?

308
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,973
Because you're on the same level
as Assemblyman Ki.

309
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,017
Hold on.

310
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:33,019
Did you just say we're on the same level?

311
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,647
No, you did. You called me a peasant.

312
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,569
He'll be too busy soon
to keep caring anyway,

313
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,988
-so just stay put.
-Busy with what?

314
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,576
I see you don't watch the news.

315
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,870
This afternoon, the preparatory committee
of Happiness and Freedom Party

316
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,456
confirmed its own election guidelines.

317
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,041
After failing to unify
the opposing parties,

318
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,294
Assemblyman Ki and Assemblyman No

319
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:59,796
-look to run…
-I wonder who'll run for president.

320
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,965
The two are known to be the front-runners.

321
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,259
-As if I care.
-Assemblyman Ki has maintained

322
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,761
a high approval rating during
his four terms.

323
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,306
Meanwhile, Assemblyman No
is right on his tail.

324
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:13,560
He might win the in-house election,
but will never become a president.

325
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,645
I guess some would vote for him.

326
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:17,564
-Like whom?
-People like you.

327
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:20,317
Never.

328
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,197
You're still in the lead among
the assemblymen and women,

329
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:30,577
but party members seem to be
leaning toward Assemblyman No.

330
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,915
I see he'll be somewhat of a nuisance.

331
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,335
The opinion poll isn't
in your favor either.

332
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:40,795
It shows that the people want a new face.

333
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:50,138
Have my contingency plan ready

334
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:53,016
so that I can ruin him when I need to.

335
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:54,559
Yes, sir.

336
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:57,771
Should I continue to keep tabs
on your son?

337
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,358
What's the use? Leave him be.

338
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:05,111
I'll deal with the girl once and for all.

339
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,115
My gosh, this is exhausting!

340
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:17,499
Ji-woo, can you not be the first lady?

341
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,210
I'll lose my job if you stop acting.

342
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,671
As if anyone would let me be one.

343
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,798
I always consider
how your future will unfold

344
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:26,925
since it's directly linked to mine.

345
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:30,095
I chose my career over motherhood
to build an impressive filmography,

346
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,931
so why would I sacrifice it
for his career?

347
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:37,560
I wish to be known as Yook Ji-woo
and not someone's wife

348
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,729
until my coffin is shut and nailed.

349
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:41,773
This is my life we're talking about.

350
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:46,152
You know, Director Lee
has been giving us the eye.

351
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:47,320
This won't do.

352
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,658
Let's go and slice the rest up.

353
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:55,537
Ms. Oh, I have a question to ask too.

354
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:59,874
Why do people meet on birthdays?

355
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,293
Because it's a birthday.

356
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,838
He seems to be planning an event,

357
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:06,589
but my birthday isn't worth that.

358
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:08,675
I might be willing
to celebrate his though.

359
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:10,677
You're allowed but he's not?

360
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,346
That's always been the story for me.

361
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,141
I see you made up
after he ruined the painting.

362
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,395
This is the first time
someone's asked me out.

363
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,480
Is everything new for you?

364
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:23,982
Sorry about the sarcasm.

365
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,025
Well, you came to me first today.

366
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,069
Are you heading home?

367
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,612
I'll give you a ride on my way.

368
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:31,322
I haven't had my coffee yet.

369
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:33,074
No.

370
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,326
I forbid you from saying no to me.

371
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,578
No.

372
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:41,458
-I'll get going.
-Sure.

373
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,668
-Take care.
-You too.

374
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:11,237
I shouldn't have worked here.

375
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:15,867
Welcome.

376
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,827
One Americano to go, please.

377
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,303
It's a thief.

378
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:38,223
The thief is washing the dishes
to make a clean getaway.

379
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,352
What? Hey, it's you. Wait, are you drunk?

380
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:44,437
Look. It's a thief.

381
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,688
A thief?

382
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,318
I'm not a thief. My name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

383
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,363
Seriously?
Although he does often steal things.

384
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:56,783
-What do I steal?
-People's hearts.

385
00:27:57,492 --> 00:28:00,203
He's my roommate.
You saw him asleep before.

386
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,248
Anyway, over here is my BF.

387
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:05,667
You know what that is, right? Best friend.

388
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:08,878
Well, I'm…

389
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:11,756
I mean… I'm Lee Yeong-hwa's friend.

390
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:16,136
-I'll be in the bathroom.
-Sure.

391
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:20,765
Are you all right? Want some honey water?

392
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:23,643
Do you like him?

393
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:27,814
The kid who painted that.

394
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,454
Is it fun for you to mess with him?

395
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,667
Is that what he says?

396
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:50,628
It's pretty obvious.

397
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:52,297
Obvious?

398
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,966
Obvious how? Like the size of my drink?

399
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,261
You must pick your toys randomly.

400
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:00,054
I can't tell who's messing with who.

401
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,640
The daughter of a CEO
dating a regular college student?

402
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:06,811
You seemed clueless,
so I made it obvious for you.

403
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:09,022
I see you size up people
in a subjective way.

404
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:11,065
Likewise.

405
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:15,111
Your attitude is backing up my suspicion.

406
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:17,488
It means I need another trump card.

407
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:19,908
Despite having everything in this world,

408
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,243
you'll have the advantage
since you're his friend.

409
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,621
If friendship is used
as a bargaining chip,

410
00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:26,414
he'll choose you over me.

411
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,835
Why would I do that to him?

412
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:40,303
Here's the coffee you ordered.

413
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,932
Is not answering questions
a trend these days?

414
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,019
The answer you wanted isn't on the menu.

415
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,760
What should I do?

416
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:23,846
I don't feel good.

417
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,932
Do you feel queasy? Have some water.

418
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:27,850
Do you want to throw up?

419
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,817
What's up? Is something wrong?

420
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,110
You…

421
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,115
Have you been studying for the TOEIC exam?

422
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,451
-It's right around the corner.
-What?

423
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:48,913
I'm worried we won't get
to go to the States together.

424
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:52,375
What? Why would you worry about that?

425
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:55,503
I've been studying, okay? So don't worry.

426
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:57,297
Right.

427
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:01,092
Are you leaving?

428
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:04,012
Can you make it home yourself?
Let me take you.

429
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,805
No, I should manage on my own.

430
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,438
An order for Yook Ji-woo's movie came in.
It's for a film festival.

431
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,690
You didn't leave your number
on your resume,

432
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,276
so they contacted you through us.

433
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,569
You must be out of it.

434
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:22,363
The one she's currently filming?
Killing Day?

435
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,823
It'll take a while to wrap up.

436
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:26,492
No, the one she filmed before that one.
Code Name Candy.

437
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:27,827
No way.

438
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,289
She played a drug dealer
by the name of Candy.

439
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,332
I can't believe it.

440
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:35,251
Are you going to be all right?

441
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:38,379
She's his mom.
And the wife of that assemblyman.

442
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:41,132
To me, she's just an actress.

443
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,801
I can't pass up
on the once-in-a-lifetime chance.

444
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,595
You saw how he is with his son.

445
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,638
I'm worried he'll do that with his wife.

446
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:50,099
This is just a job, all right?

447
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,769
Don't make it out to be a personal matter.

448
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,067
Hey, Mi-joo.

449
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,069
Seriously?

450
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:12,914
I'm sorry, May.
My frustration got the best of me.

451
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,458
You've been harsher before.

452
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:17,585
Right. I was once a menace.

453
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,047
Do you apologize to him this easily too?

454
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,674
-You're not the same.
-Why are we different?

455
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:25,176
To keep seeing you,

456
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,845
I should apologize
as soon as I realize my wrongdoing.

457
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,182
You overlooked so many
of my mistakes in the past.

458
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:34,477
At times like this,
you prove you're quite stable.

459
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:38,022
You acknowledge when you're at fault
and apologize quickly.

460
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,190
But what?

461
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:41,401
I avoid matters
when my love life's involved?

462
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,611
I blame my shitty dating experience.

463
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:46,906
Whenever issues surface,
I try to solve it right away,

464
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:48,658
but they just wanted to break up.

465
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:50,284
You and your shitty ex-boyfriends.

466
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,162
"History will repeat itself,
so I should dump him first."

467
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:55,206
How could I not think that way?

468
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,707
You would.

469
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,960
It's like I was born to be abandoned,

470
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:01,963
-so who would like that?
-No one would.

471
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,090
So what references can I turn to

472
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:07,176
-when he asks for a break?
-None.

473
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,055
You do realize he's not like
your shitty ex-boyfriends though, right?

474
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:12,723
I do.

475
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,103
Do you know how far
my thought process has reached?

476
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,441
"I didn't like him enough
to muster up the courage

477
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:24,152
and face the conflicts.

478
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,738
I don't love him enough

479
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:30,324
to put myself
through the wringer for him."

480
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,618
-Don't ever do that.
-Of course.

481
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,746
Being in love means
you should protect one another.

482
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,039
That's right.

483
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:39,500
Damn! Stop thinking so far ahead.

484
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,586
This isn't what the break is for.

485
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,547
I know. This is me avoiding
the situation too.

486
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,849
-Right eye.
-The right.

487
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:04,901
-Where are you going all dressed up?
-What? Dressed up?

488
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:06,903
I have to look reliable.

489
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,290
-Blink.
-What?

490
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:21,709
Do that when someone says
you're not reliable.

491
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:24,879
-Like this?
-Yes.

492
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:30,176
Your eyes are… You know.
So make use of your talent.

493
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:33,638
All right.

494
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:35,973
"Hello."

495
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:40,811
Hello, I'm here to represent
the athlete, Kim Woo-sik.

496
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:43,314
SEJEONG CITY HALL
TRACK TEAM

497
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:51,822
I'm sorry to tell you this
when you've waited so long.

498
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,950
The coach is off at a training camp.

499
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:57,703
Well, that's fine.

500
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:59,622
Here.

501
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:03,459
These are Kim Woo-sik's stats.

502
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:06,963
Could you make sure that he takes a look?

503
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:08,464
-Sure.
-Thanks.

504
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:18,140
Hello, I'm here to represent
the athlete, Kim Woo-sik.

505
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:19,267
Sure. Come on in.

506
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,644
Hello.

507
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,479
Mr. Ki. So this is how we meet.

508
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:26,566
I'm the manager
of the Jieum Construction Track Team.

509
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:27,984
-Have a seat.
-Right.

510
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,777
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

511
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,989
I heard the rumor about
you being Kim Woo-sik's manager.

512
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:34,156
Right.

513
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:36,325
I hope your father's well.

514
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,704
Yes, he's good.

515
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:42,456
Anyway, I'm here on behalf of Kim Woo-sik,

516
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,167
-not as my father's son.
-I'm just making small talk.

517
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:47,295
So how is Kim Woo-sik doing?

518
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,380
He's been working hard on his recovery.

519
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:55,261
Here. These are Kim Woo-sik's stats.

520
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:57,680
Also attached are the results

521
00:35:57,763 --> 00:35:59,473
of his recent physical examination.

522
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,726
The rumor must be true.

523
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:04,395
You're representing him.

524
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,482
You see, people have been saying
that you're a nobody now.

525
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,738
Why are you supporting a whistleblower

526
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:16,490
with the resources you have?

527
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:19,035
I'm frustrated, that's all.

528
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:21,662
You're not going to be able
to help him like this.

529
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,168
I don't quite follow.

530
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,047
These stats would be enough
if it were yours.

531
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,342
We'd even be glad to sign Kim Woo-sik
as a two-for-one deal.

532
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,385
I didn't mean to offend you.

533
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:40,222
-I hope you weren't offended.
-Of course not. I'm fine.

534
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,976
-Thank you for your time then.
-No worries.

535
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,339
I miss her.

536
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,308
Wasn't it nice to spend
some time together?

537
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,728
It's about time we cut this out.

538
00:38:08,811 --> 00:38:11,522
Ms. Kim says we're like a couple
in our sixties.

539
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:15,109
Why don't we end the date
with a movie and a GB?

540
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,445
What's a GB? Ginger beer?

541
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:19,947
Gruesome beer?

542
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,615
You're being absurd.

543
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:23,909
GB means a glass of beer.

544
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:26,746
As if a glass is ever enough.

545
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,914
-Seriously?
-It never ends with one glass.

546
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,834
-How about 12 bottles?
-Come on.

547
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:51,687
I guess she's fine.

548
00:38:54,523 --> 00:38:55,566
I'm glad.

549
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,029
I'm glad. I really am.

550
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:16,670
Don't you feel safe

551
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,256
when you're sitting in a dark theater?

552
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,716
That's why I like theaters.

553
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:39,819
TRANSLATION: OH MI-JOO

554
00:39:57,002 --> 00:40:00,256
TRANSLATION: JANG BYEONG-UK

555
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,307
If I timed myself today,

556
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,434
it might have been
a little over nine seconds.

557
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:14,228
Nine seconds? Is that good?

558
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,689
Gosh, of course. Totally.

559
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:22,611
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

560
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,765
Is it because I played
video games yesterday?

561
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,310
Did I play for too long?

562
00:40:55,311 --> 00:40:56,312
How long has it been?

563
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:58,022
What do you mean?

564
00:40:58,898 --> 00:40:59,899
Do you have the yips?

565
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:02,276
YIPS, SUDDEN LOSS OF SKILLS
IN EXPERIENCED ATHLETES

566
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,611
I don't know.

567
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,246
Have you stopped wasting your time
on other people?

568
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,998
Yes, thanks to a tattler.

569
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:19,460
You've been the best all this time.
Why the yips now that you're with me?

570
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,629
Maybe it's because I was the best…

571
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:24,673
It's my duty to report.

572
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:27,426
Is it the company's motto to tattle?

573
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,345
Were you really on a diet?

574
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:32,806
I know you'd ask me to lose weight
if I was modeling your clothes.

575
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,142
You know we don't have a double standard.

576
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:39,021
You're an athlete, not a model.

577
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:41,065
It's a problem
if it affects your main job.

578
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:42,900
How do you know that that's the cause?

579
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,235
Because it's our job to locate the cause.

580
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:46,820
We're considering everything.

581
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,573
Does it hurt to look nice
for a commercial?

582
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:50,824
The shoot is global.

583
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,243
You're known for your skills,
not your body.

584
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:55,537
Then what do you expect me to do?

585
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,416
Why is everyone bitching at me?

586
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,585
What do you want me to do?

587
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:03,879
What should I do?

588
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,597
Are things tough these days?

589
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:16,183
We just

590
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,436
wanted you to train more comfortably.

591
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,063
Why do people keep crying in front of me?

592
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,691
My life's been shitty these days.

593
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,401
Don't provoke me.

594
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:29,446
-She's sick. Let's go to a hospital.
-Ms. Seo, please.

595
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,448
Watch what you say.

596
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:34,368
Why should I?
The core problem will remain the same.

597
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,203
She needs to get well if she's sick.

598
00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:41,959
Eun-bi, don't you worry, okay?

599
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,877
Don't take it to heart.

600
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,089
I was worried…

601
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:06,817
Just tell me if you don't know.
You've been at it for 15 minutes.

602
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,069
You should be done before Ye-jun comes.

603
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,572
I'm not killing time.

604
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,240
I just need a bit more time.

605
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,325
Then at least jot something down.

606
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:17,161
Is it all in your head or something?

607
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,418
I've confirmed the sketch.
You may begin coloring.

608
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,628
She texted me.

609
00:43:26,712 --> 00:43:28,338
-I should…
-No useless replies.

610
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,176
She told me not to reply.

611
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,220
I've never felt happy
to be told not to do something.

612
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,474
-What's with that face?
-Why? Am I handsome?

613
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,436
Goodness, you look like a handsome idiot.

614
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,688
I'm an idiot in love. Jealous much?

615
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,899
-I guess it's good being an idiot.
-No, it isn't.

616
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:48,609
-I'm not jealous at all.
-Liar.

617
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,070
-No.
-No.

618
00:43:58,494 --> 00:43:59,870
What are these balloons for?

619
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,248
Now you're asking
after blowing all of them?

620
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:04,583
To throw Ms. Seo a party.

621
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,502
I even bought a gift.

622
00:44:07,836 --> 00:44:09,254
So you've made it up the tower.

623
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:10,798
What tower?

624
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:13,550
You mean Rapunzel?

625
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:16,553
Do you know what happens in the end?

626
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:20,682
The prince tries to climb the tower

627
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,684
and becomes blind

628
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,520
because he approached her.

629
00:44:25,103 --> 00:44:27,397
I guess he saw the witch, not Rapunzel.

630
00:44:28,148 --> 00:44:30,984
That's not it. The witch made him go blind

631
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,278
because he saw Rapunzel.

632
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:34,863
Don't you know cause and effect?

633
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:40,994
This wasn't what I wanted to get at.

634
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,581
I guess I'm weak when with you.

635
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,211
Move.

636
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:54,967
I ordered a cake from your cafe.

637
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,468
It's going to look pretty.

638
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:58,345
So what if it is? It should be tasty.

639
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:01,849
And I borrowed my roommate's car.

640
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:04,977
I'm going to make the balloons float
out of the trunk.

641
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,103
You get it, right?

642
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,564
They need helium to float.

643
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,693
You should've told me sooner.

644
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,194
You just told me now.

645
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,616
Right. I should buy some helium.

646
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,287
Hey, they will shrivel up by then
if you do it today.

647
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:25,706
I told you in advance.

648
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,584
Why did you tell him that?
We could've ruined it!

649
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,961
What? Ruin what?

650
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:33,505
Quit your nonsense.
You're not ruining anything!

651
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:34,715
-I will!
-Don't!

652
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,174
-I will!
-Don't!

653
00:45:36,258 --> 00:45:37,134
I will!

654
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:41,138
You should focus on your love life,
not his.

655
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:42,806
Are you an idiot?

656
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,724
Me?

657
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,475
Is this a WWJD thing?

658
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:49,354
And you say you've quit church.
What a man of virtue.

659
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,231
That's Confucianism.

660
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,232
Good for you.

661
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,026
You should change your name to Jesus.

662
00:45:57,112 --> 00:45:58,363
Why are you so sensitive?

663
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,199
Being a senior must be a free pass.

664
00:46:02,284 --> 00:46:03,285
Ye-chan.

665
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:06,580
Why have you been so edgy today?

666
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,540
It's because I'm a senior. So what?

667
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:10,709
I'm studying all day
to get into a university.

668
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:13,170
I'm already irked
that you're college students.

669
00:46:13,754 --> 00:46:15,213
Do you like Yeong-hwa?

670
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:17,090
Over my dead body.

671
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,259
I have high standards. No, thank you.

672
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,053
Go buy some hotteok for me.

673
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:23,263
Sure.

674
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:24,932
Hello.

675
00:46:27,142 --> 00:46:29,561
-It's nothing much.
-Thank you.

676
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:31,813
What brings you here, ma'am?

677
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:34,566
I haven't been attentive
to Ye-chan lately.

678
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,652
I'm worried she might be
bottling things up

679
00:46:36,735 --> 00:46:38,570
and will explode soon.

680
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:41,281
I heard school violence is severe
these days.

681
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,368
Ye-chan wouldn't do such a thing.

682
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:48,580
I'm not talking about her being the bully.
I'm afraid she's the victim.

683
00:46:48,664 --> 00:46:50,374
I found some bruises on her.

684
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:53,335
That's probably from boxing.

685
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:56,088
Ye-chan gets along very well
with her friends.

686
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:57,172
Sorry?

687
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,342
From what again?

688
00:47:00,842 --> 00:47:02,970
They keep making us do things together.

689
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,097
I guess we're really going to debut.

690
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,640
That's the trend these days.

691
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,058
Tae-woong.

692
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:10,352
Explain these comments
on your social media.

693
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,020
What?

694
00:47:12,521 --> 00:47:14,648
We were done ages ago,

695
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,692
so why are you still following me, babe?

696
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:20,237
Stop thinking about me, babe.

697
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,989
That little…

698
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,657
What a psycho!

699
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,617
"Babe"? Has he gone insane?

700
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:27,953
Delete them before the fans go berserk.

701
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:30,831
Thank god that happened
after our radio show.

702
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,249
Damn it.

703
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,127
Are you glad our fans didn't
bombard the live comments?

704
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,212
What a great leader you are.

705
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:38,672
That's my job.

706
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,923
Damn it.

707
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,300
I'll keep the car running, so come out.

708
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,512
He's unbelievable.

709
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:48,890
-Our fans are going to get hurt.
-You call cannot be reached…

710
00:47:48,974 --> 00:47:50,809
This bastard isn't picking up.

711
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,653
I deleted, unfollowed, and blocked you.

712
00:48:01,737 --> 00:48:03,864
You better not leave any more comments.

713
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:14,958
Who told you that you could call me?

714
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:16,334
Do you want a beating?

715
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,136
No, thanks.

716
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,390
That was a rhetorical question.

717
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:34,895
I'm busy preparing for a birthday party.

718
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,356
I hope this is
our last time talking, babe.

719
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,901
Who cares if you're preparing
for a birthday party?

720
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:50,827
Mr. Jeong, it's me.

721
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:53,288
What's Dan-ah's schedule today?

722
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,375
Okay. Got it.

723
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,336
Where are you going?

724
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:01,129
Somewhere.

725
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,092
-The company would want to talk with us.
-None of it is true, so why?

726
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,843
It's not my fault.

727
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:09,179
It's not mine either,
but I should still go

728
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:10,555
because I'm the leader.

729
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:11,932
Damn it.

730
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:17,104
Hey, babe! Over here!

731
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:25,821
I mean, I'm glad
we don't have class today,

732
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:27,447
but you look pathetic right now.

733
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,699
-So does your face.
-Talk to the hand.

734
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,496
No! Have you gone insane?

735
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:36,081
A birthday party for my sister?

736
00:49:36,164 --> 00:49:38,625
-Seo Tae-woong?
-Why are you here?

737
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:41,419
Wait. What did you just say?

738
00:49:41,503 --> 00:49:42,796
Have you gone insane?

739
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,798
Don't ruin her day. Call it quits.

740
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,508
No, before that.

741
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:47,759
What?

742
00:49:48,927 --> 00:49:50,053
Your sister?

743
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,557
Don't act so friendly.
Even I've never called her that.

744
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,934
Then what else should I call my sister?

745
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:58,228
She's my sister!

746
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,188
What?

747
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,440
You were siblings?

748
00:50:02,524 --> 00:50:04,484
We still are, you asshole.

749
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,945
Who are you to plan my sister's birthday?

750
00:50:07,028 --> 00:50:08,155
Me?

751
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:11,491
I'm her vending machine! So what?

752
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:14,411
What are you rambling on about?

753
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:17,247
Hey, what are you doing?

754
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,333
Oh, god. What are you doing?
My gosh, do you even know who he is?

755
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,503
-You're damn crazy.
-Who is he?

756
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,715
Ye-jun! How dare you push my friend?

757
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:28,383
-You little…
-Ye-jun!

758
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:29,718
-Ye-jun!
-Come here!

759
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:31,678
-Ye-jun!
-You pretty boy!

760
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,388
-You asshole!
-Stop!

761
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:34,764
Who the hell are you?

762
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:36,683
-Gosh.
-Let's talk this out.

763
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:38,602
-Hold on.
-Who are you?

764
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:39,728
-Oh, no.
-Come here!

765
00:50:39,811 --> 00:50:42,189
Why were you so late? I'm outnumbered.

766
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,857
I was parking. Yeong-hwa, wait.

767
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,151
Don't do that! No!

768
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:47,611
-Hold on!
-Oh, dear!

769
00:50:47,694 --> 00:50:49,863
-You little…
-Guys!

770
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,406
-Come here!
-Oh, come on!

771
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:54,910
My hair! Time out!

772
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:02,125
-Hey, you!
-Fight outside!

773
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:04,252
-Get out!
-Get out!

774
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:05,629
Let go of me!

775
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:18,493
Mi-joo. Seon-gyeom. You're here.

776
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:20,787
Hey.

777
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,665
-Have you been well?
-As always.

778
00:52:23,748 --> 00:52:26,543
-Let me go.
-You let go first.

779
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:27,752
Goh Ye-chan!

780
00:52:28,461 --> 00:52:29,838
-Mom?
-Ms. Dong.

781
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,256
Hello, ma'am.

782
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:33,216
-Who is she?
-She's her mom.

783
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,051
What? Boxing?

784
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:37,304
Seriously, boxing?

785
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:40,890
-Were you aware of this?
-No, ma'am.

786
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:42,767
-Were you in on it too?
-No, ma'am.

787
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,771
Mr. Jeong, don't tell me you knew as well.

788
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,273
Well…

789
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:55,113
What's going on?

790
00:52:55,697 --> 00:52:56,823
Is this a gathering?

791
00:52:56,906 --> 00:52:59,034
-Ms. Seo!
-Dan-ah!

792
00:52:59,117 --> 00:53:01,578
-What's going on?
-Let me explain.

793
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:11,671
Hey, Mi-joo!

794
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:40,492
You, brat. Let's talk at home. Follow me.

795
00:53:40,575 --> 00:53:42,494
-Wait.
-Ms. Seo, I'm taking a half-day.

796
00:53:42,577 --> 00:53:43,703
-Let me go.
-Follow me!

797
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,957
-Ye-jun, don't forget my bag!
-Is this the only cafe in Seoul?

798
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:51,336
Why are you causing a scene at my cafe?

799
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:52,670
Why?

800
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,116
What happened to your hand?

801
00:54:22,617 --> 00:54:24,953
I'm going to get it checked out today.

802
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:26,287
I think it's due to work.

803
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:30,542
The fireworks I bought were too big.

804
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,168
There's so much to clean up.

805
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,046
Why are you here?

806
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,714
I was invited.

807
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:39,634
And I owe Ms. Seo so…

808
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,431
Would you have still come
if you knew I'd be here?

809
00:55:18,673 --> 00:55:21,676
Damn it. I told you not to do it.

810
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:23,094
This is all because of you.

811
00:55:23,178 --> 00:55:24,637
Both of you, quiet.

812
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:27,974
I wasn't loud.

813
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:29,726
You have a loud voice to begin with.

814
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:31,644
I feel like an outcast.

815
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:33,563
You guys are too harsh.

816
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:36,065
Make sure you clean everything up.

817
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:38,568
And stop causing a mess
at someone else's workplace.

818
00:55:46,117 --> 00:55:47,243
By the way,

819
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:49,496
how are you two related?

820
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,331
Your name wasn't on the family tree.

821
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,459
I'm a bastard.

822
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,423
A bastard?

823
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:05,011
This is a secret,
so keep it on the down-low.

824
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:06,221
What?

825
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:08,681
Okay.

826
00:56:14,145 --> 00:56:15,230
And

827
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:18,358
today isn't her birthday.

828
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,277
It's fake. She wasn't born today.

829
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,405
She was born before Myeong-min,

830
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:28,409
but Dad only registered her birthday
after he was born.

831
00:56:29,994 --> 00:56:31,746
I really didn't want to tell you this,

832
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:34,457
but I did so you wouldn't ruin
her day again.

833
00:56:44,592 --> 00:56:45,885
It won't take long.

834
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,638
Goodness. When will you clean that up?

835
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:50,849
-It's okay. You can go first.
-Okay.

836
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,547
Hello?

837
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:27,302
-Right now?
-Yes.

838
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:29,929
I can't seem to reach Ms. Bang.

839
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:34,309
She probably has bad reception.

840
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,355
Okay.

841
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:46,446
Why are you doing such a poor job?

842
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,698
How are we to trust her with our kids?

843
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:49,782
I'm truly sorry.

844
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,867
What's going on?

845
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,621
Sir, Su-bin got in a fight
with another student.

846
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,833
-He's here instead of her--
-Are you educating them properly?

847
00:57:58,917 --> 00:58:00,585
Where are her parents?

848
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:02,378
He's that athlete.

849
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:04,297
Are you him?

850
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,716
You were in charge of them
before the scandal.

851
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,720
We've filed in our complaints.
I refuse to let you train my son.

852
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,056
He has no right to train anyone.

853
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:16,267
Forget it. Where's the coach?
I want to see her right now.

854
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:20,396
I'm struggling to manage everything.

855
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:26,361
I'm sorry.
It's all because I'm a lousy adviser.

856
00:58:26,444 --> 00:58:27,487
Don't say that.

857
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:31,157
Is Su-bin in class?

858
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,494
She's not here.

859
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:37,246
She's been suspended starting today.

860
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:41,084
The victim's mother demands
an apology from her parents.

861
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,795
But Su-bin… You know her story.

862
00:58:43,878 --> 00:58:45,838
We shouldn't be apologetic

863
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,882
after only hearing one side of the story.

864
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:52,929
If she's still at fault
after hearing her side of the story,

865
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:54,514
then I'll apologize to them.

866
00:59:40,852 --> 00:59:43,187
You shouldn't drink
while taking these antibiotics.

867
00:59:43,271 --> 00:59:46,315
Do you mean I can't drink for a week?
They gave me a week's worth.

868
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:48,609
Don't forget to keep your hand
bandaged when showering.

869
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,280
Are you sure I can't even have one sip?

870
00:59:52,363 --> 00:59:53,948
You know my answer.

871
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,506
Hello. Here's the prescription.

872
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,633
Okay. One minute.

873
01:00:12,717 --> 01:00:13,885
Okay.

874
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:18,264
Mi-joo.

875
01:00:18,347 --> 01:00:21,184
-What?
-Hello.

876
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:23,102
I can't believe I ran into you here.

877
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,858
I love your fingernails.
Did you do them yourself?

878
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,276
Yes, it's my hobby.

879
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,905
Mi-joo, you can talk casually.

880
01:00:33,988 --> 01:00:35,698
-Should I?
-Yes.

881
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:37,867
Did you go to that hospital?

882
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:41,120
I have inflammation in my fingers.

883
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:45,583
I fell down some stairs.

884
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:49,128
I'm usually good at avoiding them

885
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,838
but I couldn't that day.

886
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,925
Are you being bullied at school?

887
01:00:57,595 --> 01:01:00,306
That student ridiculed me and said
I couldn't learn anything

888
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,016
from someone who committed assault.

889
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:06,813
Does Mr. Ki know about this?

890
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:12,985
I don't think I can lie to his face,

891
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,278
so I've been dodging him.

892
01:01:14,362 --> 01:01:16,405
I don't want to hurt him.

893
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:23,704
They said the track and field team
could break up because of me.

894
01:01:25,873 --> 01:01:27,250
How is that your fault?

895
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:28,709
Are you a big shot?

896
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,634
I shouldn't be laughing,

897
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:39,220
but that was hilarious.

898
01:01:39,303 --> 01:01:40,680
I tend to be funny.

899
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,564
If I tell them the truth and reconcile,

900
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,900
do you think everything
will turn out well?

901
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:57,697
Should I tag along with you?
I have a lot of free time.

902
01:01:59,323 --> 01:02:00,908
This is my problem.

903
01:02:01,909 --> 01:02:03,870
If I run away…

904
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:08,499
-No, if I do--
-Then let's have some tteokbokki.

905
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,334
I know a tasty place.

906
01:02:10,418 --> 01:02:13,171
Ms. Oh Mi-joo, Ms. Lee Su-bin.
Your medication is ready.

907
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:14,505
-Okay.
-Okay.

908
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:23,181
Hello.

909
01:02:23,764 --> 01:02:25,474
I'm Lee Su-bin.

910
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:27,101
I have something to tell you.

911
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:29,937
So you're the girl.

912
01:02:30,021 --> 01:02:31,731
Bring your parents, not you.

913
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:34,650
I live with my aunt.

914
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:37,069
And she's very busy.

915
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,738
I want to apologize.

916
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:41,574
And I don't deserve to be suspended.

917
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,410
You really are ignorant, aren't you?

918
01:02:44,493 --> 01:02:47,163
Chang-seop grabbed me first,
so I tried to stop him--

919
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:50,499
Hey. How dare you blame my son?

920
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,669
Bring your aunt then.
I have no business with you.

921
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,964
This is the problem with ignorant kids.

922
01:03:03,971 --> 01:03:05,097
Hey! Who are you?

923
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,641
Who are you? Are you crazy?

924
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:08,559
A bit?

925
01:03:09,143 --> 01:03:10,353
Hey!

926
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:14,440
Are you nuts?

927
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:15,942
-I am.
-What?

928
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,444
I'm totally nuts,
and I don't know what I'm capable of.

929
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,905
Treat her like you just did again
if you're curious to find out.

930
01:03:20,988 --> 01:03:22,365
Then I'll really throw this.

931
01:03:23,157 --> 01:03:25,493
Who are you to meddle in our affair?

932
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:27,203
Me? I'm her sister.

933
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,416
What's the big deal about having parents?

934
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:35,211
Let's go eat some tteokbokki.

935
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,380
Su-bin!

936
01:03:39,507 --> 01:03:41,259
Did you cry? She did this, didn't she?

937
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:42,718
-Let me go!
-Hey!

938
01:03:42,802 --> 01:03:44,804
Why are you doing this?

939
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,347
Did you make her cry?

940
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,640
So?

941
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,142
Why do you want to join track and field?

942
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,477
Why would you?

943
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,771
You bad-mouthed Mr. Ki.

944
01:03:53,854 --> 01:03:55,439
Let me go!

945
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,567
I did that out of jealousy

946
01:03:59,193 --> 01:04:00,736
since you liked him so much.

947
01:04:02,029 --> 01:04:04,448
Why would you be jealous?

948
01:04:04,532 --> 01:04:06,033
Because I like you!

949
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:08,369
That's why.

950
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:11,664
What?

951
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,542
You idiot! You fool!

952
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,670
I told you to study.
Now you want to join the track team?

953
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,090
Don't be cruel to her.
I'm going to protect her.

954
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:24,093
Who are you to protect her? Come here.

955
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:26,846
Goodness, kids these days
are so passionate.

956
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,265
-Su-bin!
-Stop calling her name!

957
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:30,558
Let's go.

958
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:34,312
What do you think about him?

959
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:36,188
-Well…
-That hurts.

960
01:04:38,649 --> 01:04:39,525
Su-bin.

961
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,194
What took you so long? Did you eat?

962
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,447
-Hello.
-Hello.

963
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,365
Who is she?

964
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,701
She's a friend. I like her.

965
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,953
-I see.
-Hello.

966
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:53,372
I wanted to buy her dinner.

967
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,623
Were you waiting?

968
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:56,125
It's okay.

969
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,669
Your track and field teacher came today
as well.

970
01:04:58,753 --> 01:05:00,338
He waited for a long time.

971
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:02,882
I think he's left.

972
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,427
I guess he came again. It's cold today.

973
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:10,264
You can talk to him later.
It's a happy ending after all.

974
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,266
Thank you for today.

975
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:14,560
-Don't mention it. Go.
-Goodbye.

976
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:16,520
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

977
01:05:16,604 --> 01:05:17,605
Let's go.

978
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:19,940
Are you okay?

979
01:06:14,787 --> 01:06:16,956
-Seon-gyeom--
-Don't go.

980
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,586
I won't, so let go of this.

981
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,004
I know you will.

982
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:32,221
Let me go, and we'll talk.

983
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:34,849
Wait. Let's just stay like this
for a minute.

984
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:37,935
I've…

985
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:42,523
never been stubborn about anything.

986
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:47,236
So I don't know how to do it.

987
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:52,658
But could you not teach me?

988
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:55,619
Not teach you what?

989
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:01,876
How to break up.

990
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,968
You can teach me everything else,

991
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:18,225
but could you not teach me that?

992
01:07:24,982 --> 01:07:26,150
Can you just…

993
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:32,531
like me?

994
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,373
Please.

995
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:48,088
Please, Ms. Oh.

996
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,415
Catch me if you can.

997
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,585
Do I still look like a kid to you?

998
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:28,796
Yes, and that's exactly why

999
01:08:28,879 --> 01:08:30,589
I should keep you close at all times.

1000
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:32,925
You didn't come home last night.

1001
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:34,593
-Yes.
-Are you not coming home again?

1002
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:38,013
I'm so frustrated that I can't sleep.

1003
01:08:38,097 --> 01:08:41,058
It wouldn't be that hard
to figure out where he is.

1004
01:08:41,141 --> 01:08:42,268
What about you?

1005
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,311
-How dare you run away?
-What? Me?

1006
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:48,148
I knew she was crazy,
but not to this extent.

1007
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:49,316
Where should I sleep tonight?

1008
01:08:51,485 --> 01:08:52,361
I'll pounce on you.

1009
01:08:52,444 --> 01:08:56,448
-I miss you.
-Why don't you join our agency?

1010
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,783
I'd like us to work together.

1011
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,243
You did a good job.

1012
01:08:59,326 --> 01:09:02,121
Then why don't you come over
for some ramyeon?

1013
01:09:02,997 --> 01:09:04,790
We'll have the house to ourselves.

1014
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:11,171
