00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,847
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,891
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,081
Why did you decide to cook for me?

4
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,248
FINALE

5
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,126
I often cooked while you were asleep,

6
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,711
but we never got to eat together.

7
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,005
Yes, I remember.

8
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,635
You were awake during the day,
but I was awake during the evening.

9
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,387
But now we're both awake during the day.

10
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,640
Thank you.

11
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,768
For what? For my existence?

12
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,686
That too.

13
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,438
I mean, my sister.

14
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,066
Thank you for listening to her
and comforting her.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,319
That's something I'm not good at.

16
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,031
I see.

17
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,574
I'll try some.

18
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,003
It's delicious.

19
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,091
It's as good as the food I ate
in the Riviera.

20
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,843
Is it a famous restaurant?

21
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,222
No. Whenever I finish a project,
I feel the urge to go on trips.

22
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,558
When was it again?

23
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:27,021
The movie I once worked on was shot
in a vacation spot in Italy.

24
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,273
The movie was in English.

25
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,025
And while I was working on the movie,

26
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,070
it made me feel like a foreigner
living there.

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,114
The city was so beautiful.

28
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,994
So I gathered all my savings
and went there

29
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,495
to pretend like I lived there.

30
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,872
Did you go alone?

31
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,499
Yes. I'm good at traveling alone.

32
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,753
I don't even look at the map on my phone.
I just follow the signposts.

33
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,839
I enjoy spending time alone like that.

34
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,470
Tell me more. I want to hear more.

35
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,726
On my flight back,
I watched a German movie,

36
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,186
and the subtitles were fairly good.

37
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,730
And?

38
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:13,109
Whenever I went to a restaurant or a cafe,
the people there were all foreigners.

39
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,320
I usually have no trouble hearing English,

40
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,323
but not everyone there spoke English.

41
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,491
So were you frustrated?

42
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
No.

43
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,040
I actually liked
that I couldn't fully understand

44
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,833
the language there.

45
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,295
I only needed to say what was necessary.

46
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,796
For example?

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,800
Stuff like,
"Hello. How much is this? Thank you."

48
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,179
Talking about it makes me
want to go there again.

49
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,976
When do you plan to go again?

50
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,103
I'm not sure.

51
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,689
Let's go together next time.

52
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,655
I'd love to be there

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,448
together.

54
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,079
I'll let you tag along.

55
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,872
Let's go together.

56
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,249
Pack up.

57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,918
Right now?

58
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,045
I need to go to work tomorrow.

59
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,214
I guess I can't go with you.

60
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,300
I was just kidding.

61
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,344
I wasn't going to go right now.

62
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,262
That's a pity.

63
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,820
Dan-ah.

64
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,202
Dan-ah, you're here too.

65
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,918
You did a great job of keeping it from me,
so I came late.

66
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,297
You made me look like a horrible daughter.

67
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,883
You're too pretty to be
a horrible daughter.

68
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,345
I must say, it's nice to see

69
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,681
all of you together.

70
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,731
I loved you.

71
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,902
So what?

72
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,240
That's it.

73
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,834
Get some sleep.

74
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,256
Dad.

75
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,242
-Myeong-min.
-Let's talk later. I'm busy.

76
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,371
He passed away less than five minutes ago.

77
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,457
You should be grieving.

78
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,004
I was always the one
who took care of him, not you.

79
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,342
Fine. I get it.

80
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,887
But have some respect for him.

81
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,267
You seem pretty relaxed.

82
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,562
Go ahead and do what you think is right.

83
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,774
I'll be the one to be promoted anyway.

84
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,946
Is the car ready?

85
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,489
Okay.

86
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,493
SEO DAN-AH

87
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,083
EXECUTIVE SEO DAN-AH GRIEVES
AS SHE LEAVES HER HOUSE

88
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:06,175
EXECUTIVE SEO DAN-AH GRIEVES
AS SHE LEAVES HER HOUSE

89
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,761
I forgot that she lived in a castle.

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,439
ASSEMBLYMAN KI JEONG-DO

91
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,276
Sir, it's urgent.

92
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,991
I just fell asleep.

93
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,369
This is confidential,
but Chairman Seo just passed away.

94
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,957
What? What did you just say?

95
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,337
What about the marriage?

96
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,715
Where's my wife?

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,633
Did she free her schedule?

98
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,636
She'll be free for two days soon,
but she's going to the States.

99
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,514
She has a final meeting
for a Hollywood movie.

100
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,768
And how should we handle
your daughter's scandal?

101
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,563
She might not even get married.

102
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,109
We should continue lowering
No Geun-seong's approval rating.

103
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,360
Just leave it.

104
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,071
What do you mean?

105
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,574
Didn't you promise Eun-bi
that you'd take care of it?

106
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,285
That useless kid.

107
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,829
I raised him with so much care,

108
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,665
but he's completely useless.

109
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,751
-Sir.
-Hey.

110
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,629
When will you ever learn?

111
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,881
If you want to continue working with me,

112
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,467
you need to stop
caring about such petty issues!

113
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,623
-Long time no see.
-No.

114
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,041
What?

115
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,129
-Whatever it is you're about to say.
-Aren't you going to ask what happened?

116
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,590
Will you tell me if I ask?

117
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,925
Yes.

118
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,058
The Chairman passed away.
We haven't had his funeral yet.

119
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,195
Are you okay?

120
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,659
I'm too busy to grieve for him

121
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,996
because I need to get ready
for the next step.

122
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,665
So I'm not sure.

123
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,501
That's not something you have to
think about to know.

124
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,128
Sometimes,

125
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,132
it felt like I was
waiting for him to pass away

126
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,301
like an ungrateful child.

127
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,350
But then again, the Chairman…

128
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,939
I mean, my father was no different.

129
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,776
I mostly referred to him as the Chairman,

130
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,696
and he was also used to that.

131
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,658
After seeing the Chairman pass away,

132
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,578
I started to think

133
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,874
that the same thing
could happen to me someday.

134
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:40,181
You have a bright future ahead of you,
so I want you to spend your time wisely.

135
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,726
And I don't think
I should be a part of that.

136
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,730
So?

137
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,399
We both knew

138
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,110
how this was going to end.

139
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,237
How am I supposed to know how it'll end

140
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,824
-until it's over?
-I can't be your happy ending.

141
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,828
I really don't have the time anymore

142
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
because I need to keep moving up.

143
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,255
I'm going home.

144
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,093
Don't follow me.

145
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,678
If you do,

146
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,641
I swear I'll kill myself.

147
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,897
You're going to threaten me
with your life?

148
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,026
Yes, because I know it'll work.

149
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,742
He's right.

150
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:52,503
I'm sorry. I should have been the one
to enter your world.

151
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,172
Instead, I dragged you into mine.

152
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,592
You're running toward the finish line,

153
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,929
but I'm heading for the halfway point.

154
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,185
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,611
Why aren't you sleeping?

156
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,321
I don't want to waste my time,

157
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,740
so I'm grabbing onto it.

158
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,702
If you've already

159
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,623
decided to end this,

160
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,418
I'm going to do my best to postpone it.

161
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,546
I'll do just that.

162
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,396
Is this where you live these days?

163
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,441
Yes, it's better than staying at a hotel.

164
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,527
What about you, sir?

165
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,614
Relax and just talk to me
like you did when you were a kid.

166
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,948
I resigned.

167
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,117
You resigned?

168
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,661
Isn't my dad neck-deep into the election?

169
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,289
Maybe it's because I've had
my hands dirty for a while,

170
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,166
I started to wonder
if I was always this way

171
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,169
or if I had let the job
get the best of me.

172
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,087
Especially these days.

173
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,967
Your father started

174
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,637
Eun-bi's scandal.

175
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,807
He wanted to lower No Geun-seong's rating
and gain a positive image

176
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,060
by handling it like a gentleman.

177
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,312
He wasn't doing anything
about her scandal,

178
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,897
and I found out that was why.

179
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,363
Why are you telling me this?

180
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,489
I've always

181
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,159
liked you and Eun-bi.

182
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,703
I wanted the best for you guys,

183
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,997
but I'm sorry if I hurt you.

184
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,042
I was blinded by your father.

185
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,172
This reminds me of when we first met.

186
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,341
When we first met?

187
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,469
Was I more young and handsome?

188
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,638
You wanted to become
a righteous politician.

189
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,349
And as young as I was,
I really admired you for that.

190
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,023
Thank you for telling me.

191
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,401
I wish you all the best for your future.

192
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,694
Are you aware

193
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,196
that your parents are talking of divorce?

194
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,533
There's nothing I can't say
since I'm leaving.

195
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,743
But it probably won't happen.

196
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:34,456
I'm sure your father
also kept tabs on your mother.

197
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,458
See you then.

198
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,372
Can you talk?

199
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,709
Oh, you're home?

200
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,295
I'm hungry.

201
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,637
I tried my best,
but I don't know how it'll taste.

202
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,847
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

203
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,566
How does it taste?

204
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,532
I followed the recipe,
but it's not what I imagined.

205
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,618
Do you think the recipe was the problem?

206
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,370
Or am I just a bad cook?

207
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,247
No, I love it. It's really delicious.

208
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,333
My gosh.

209
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,585
You're too kind.

210
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,549
-Try the other side dishes.
-Okay.

211
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,805
Are you trying to comfort me?

212
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,724
Why would I try to comfort you?

213
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,852
Because that's how I feel right now.

214
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,563
Why? Did something happen?

215
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,484
It's about my sister.

216
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,654
My sister received

217
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,075
a lot more affection from Dad than I did.

218
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,161
But she was also tormented
a lot more than I was.

219
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,040
He always told us
that it was his way of loving us.

220
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:44,586
But most of the time, it was hard for us
to think of it that way.

221
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,761
Today,

222
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,888
I heard

223
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:01,937
something shocking about my sister.

224
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,483
If she's kept in the dark about this,
it'd make her look like a fool.

225
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,864
So I don't think I can keep it a secret.

226
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,534
But if I tell her, she'll be hurt.

227
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,079
And I don't want to see her get hurt.

228
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,250
You always

229
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,421
put your thoughts to action,

230
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,507
and you never regret it, right?

231
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,553
But why are you so hesitant now?

232
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,099
Why are you here?

233
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,943
That's because you were also hurt

234
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,781
by what you heard.

235
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,120
I guess you didn't know.

236
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,999
You still have so much you don't know.

237
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,682
Stop assuming how your sister will react.

238
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,728
Just tell her.

239
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,232
Tell her how you feel.

240
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,862
And if she gets hurt, hug her like this.

241
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,283
Isn't that what family is for?

242
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,995
So that's what family is for.

243
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm glad you know now.

244
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,004
Thank you.

245
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,264
You're lying.

246
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,599
Tell me you're lying.

247
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,018
Tell me you're doing this
because you hate Dad.

248
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,104
You're free to think of it that way.

249
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,355
Knowing this

250
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,066
isn't going to change anything.

251
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,944
Should I tell the world?
Should I expose the truth?

252
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,655
If that's what you want, go ahead.

253
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,953
Let's say I do. What about Dad?

254
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,539
He's the one who used his own daughter
for his success.

255
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,875
And what about your life? Your scars?

256
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,960
Ryan believed me.

257
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,254
That's all that matters to me.

258
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,214
The rest will

259
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,884
fade away with time.

260
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,972
-Why would you do that for him?
-Because we're a family.

261
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,266
You just said we're a family.

262
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,351
What about it?

263
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,357
I guess there's nothing we can do
since we're family.

264
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,903
I really didn't want to do this.

265
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,821
Do what?

266
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,906
I'm going to tell Mom.

267
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,953
That was unexpected,
but quite fresh coming from you.

268
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,456
But isn't it a bit too childish?

269
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,541
I never did it as a kid,
so I'm trying it now.

270
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,920
I hear it's normal to tell Mom
when Dad does something wrong.

271
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,216
You must have made a lot of new friends.

272
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,801
Hey, Mom. Are you busy?

273
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,857
Ji-woo, let's choose
what to wear to the airport.

274
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,109
Studying English paid off.

275
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,903
-Hollywood--
-I can't go to the US.

276
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,240
What? But your flight is today.

277
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,951
Didn't I notify you of your schedule?

278
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,535
The final audition

279
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,162
- for the project is--
- I know.

280
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,457
-And I can't go.
-Ji-woo, wait.

281
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,542
Don't mess with me. It isn't funny.

282
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,002
I'm not trying to be funny.

283
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,713
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

284
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,965
The boss will kill me.

285
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,134
I'll kill him before he kills you.

286
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,846
You trust me, don't you?

287
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,015
I honestly don't right now.

288
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,558
What's gotten into you?

289
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,018
Hollywood?

290
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,522
Another chance will come by
as long as I'm working.

291
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,691
But doing nothing
while my child is in pain?

292
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,239
Think of everything I achieved
at the expense of neglecting them.

293
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,118
I'll go back to being an actor tomorrow.

294
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,787
But Ji-woo!

295
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,458
That bastard Hyun-jin is dodging my calls.

296
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,546
He can't just resign and be done with it.

297
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,674
What? I thought you were--

298
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,555
Hey, Ki Jeong-do.
How far are you taking this?

299
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,517
How dare you use our kids
to show off your fake fatherly love?

300
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,650
Does your father know?

301
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,446
You know,

302
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,699
I thought you married me out of love
at the very least.

303
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,786
Even in this moment,
you're worried about my family's funding?

304
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,999
I'll be taking the kids,
so fight me in court if you have an issue.

305
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,584
I'll ask for a steep alimony.

306
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,835
Yook Ji-woo.

307
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,299
How dare you shove a divorce in my face!

308
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,635
I wonder why I thought
that divorce wasn't my decision to make?

309
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,262
It's my life, after all.

310
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,225
Ji-woo, don't be this way.

311
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,729
I'm sorry, honey.

312
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,483
Jeong-do,
good luck with preparing for the election

313
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,485
all by yourself.

314
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:47,365
Get in my way
and I'll tell my dad what you did.

315
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,283
Got it?

316
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,546
Who do they think they are?

317
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,260
It looks delicious!

318
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,596
We'll let it age
and make kimchi stew with it.

319
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,018
I told my mom to stop making
too much kimchi.

320
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,104
She sends me some all the time.

321
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,815
Your family seems harmonious.

322
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,652
I guess you can say that,
but we're poor at communicating.

323
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,362
Just look at my name.

324
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:30,867
Right. Your mom named you Mae-hui,
but your dad registered your name as May.

325
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,829
I didn't know what my name was
until I started school.

326
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,164
Mom called me Mae-hui
while Dad called me May.

327
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,708
I couldn't tell
whether my name was Mae-hui or May.

328
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,877
How can that not drive a girl crazy?

329
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,549
"That which we call May by any other name
would smell as sweet."

330
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,968
That's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.

331
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,095
You're a bona fide Shakespeare.

332
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,304
I love you, darling.

333
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,728
Families argue when they're together
and miss each other when they're apart.

334
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,274
Your family just loves
each other very much.

335
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,402
I always believed
that I was alone in this world,

336
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,738
but that wasn't the case most of the time.

337
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,657
Although you're not actually family.

338
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,410
You don't have to be legally bound
to be considered family.

339
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,287
Or be related by blood for that matter.

340
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,040
My mom calls you her youngest daughter,
you ingrate.

341
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,210
You're right.

342
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,922
I haven't been good to the woman
who gave birth to my darling.

343
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,174
When will we go see her?

344
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,634
Right. We haven't been to her in a while.

345
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,304
May, why don't we make kimchi next year

346
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,639
with our neighbors
who live away from their families?

347
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,141
And we'll send your mom some.

348
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,436
Have at it.

349
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,896
I prefer buying my kimchi.

350
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,522
Come on. Let's do it.

351
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,861
-Ms. Seo.
-Yes?

352
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,201
It's too early for the meeting.

353
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,161
Lee Yeong-hwa is here.

354
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,918
-Invite him in.
-Sure.

355
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,135
You said you'd go and die,

356
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,179
but here you are.

357
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,931
I didn't want to waste your time.

358
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,601
Time may be most important to you,

359
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,813
but you're most important to me.

360
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,899
The best I could do for you

361
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,027
was to move on as quickly as possible.

362
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,290
Don't you want it?

363
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,126
It's your painting.

364
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,932
So here it is.

365
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,978
Didn't you say it was yours
until you handed it over?

366
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,273
You've put your heart into it.

367
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,983
You've already…

368
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,029
taken it away from me.

369
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,617
So…

370
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,579
Would you like it back?

371
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,459
Keep it.

372
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,006
Until it fades away from within you.

373
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,804
Keep it with you,

374
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,893
then throw it out with the recyclables.

375
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,316
You said that was important.

376
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,997
You…

377
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,435
I'm…

378
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,939
still the same.

379
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,943
Nothing you do…

380
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,823
makes me hate you. I just keep liking you.

381
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,703
That being said,

382
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,583
it's still my choice to keep liking you.

383
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,266
Will you forbid me from doing so?

384
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,937
No.

385
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,440
Go ahead.

386
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,734
Do whatever you want.

387
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,212
Live long.

388
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,758
And don't fall ill.

389
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,972
My first love.

390
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,067
Where's my answer?

391
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,325
I'll live long.

392
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,330
I won't fall ill.

393
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,301
You're back.

394
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,601
Seon-gyeom.

395
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,447
Seon-gyeom…

396
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,615
<i>Yeong-hwa.</i>

397
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,493
I helped you reach your goal.

398
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,456
So what's your dream?

399
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,000
It's being with you forever.

400
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,379
I'll try to make that come true.

401
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,259
Seon-gyeom…

402
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,532
It's true that it'll never come true.

403
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,871
It will never come true.

404
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,340
Let me get you a new glass.
The ice has melted.

405
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,930
Why have you been
sighing like that all night?

406
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,306
What's going on?

407
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,602
Something is always going on.

408
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,687
There's too much going on,

409
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,481
so I let him go.

410
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,442
The young man you were interested in?

411
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,986
I must've shown interest
for quite some time.

412
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,364
I'm done doing that though.

413
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,951
They say we all have a jewelry box
we want to keep to ourselves.

414
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,497
What's in it doesn't always
have to be jewelry though.

415
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,708
It can be sea glass
you found at the beach,

416
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,627
a shell,

417
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,713
or it can be a button
from someone's school uniform.

418
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,757
Anything that can be a memory.

419
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,260
Something that
serves as a sparkling memory

420
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,346
that I keep in a jewelry box
only I can open.

421
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,014
It's a way of

422
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:59,602
saving a precious moment
you might never get to experience again.

423
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,896
Something like that.

424
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,651
He's a bit big for a jewelry box.

425
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,569
Then why not…

426
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,115
get yourself a bigger box?

427
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,120
You have a point.

428
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,789
So what do you have in yours?

429
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,000
My jewelry box is tiny.

430
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,960
It holds the key to my first house.

431
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,338
It's gone,
now that the area was redeveloped.

432
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,258
-Welcome.
-Hello.

433
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,845
I can't believe you made me seek you out.

434
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,763
Why did you look for me?

435
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,432
Mr. Jeong asked me to.

436
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,891
He must think we're close.

437
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,686
So what's going on?

438
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,772
I'm not curious, so don't answer.

439
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,065
I'm just here to drink.

440
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,817
I'd like a vodka martini.

441
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,277
Shaken not stirred.

442
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,780
May I ask your name?

443
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,782
"Bond, James Bond".

444
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,745
How cheesy.

445
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,880
Should I clear the glasses?

446
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,133
I always leave empty glasses
and bottles on the table.

447
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,762
I see. To each one's own then.

448
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,183
I…

449
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,977
I knew it all along.

450
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,109
Yet, I kept seeing him.

451
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:34,739
And while doing so,
I wanted him to never leave my side.

452
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,784
I wanted him to keep coming after me

453
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,620
no matter how many times
I drew a line between us.

454
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,373
So that I could see him whenever I wanted.

455
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,751
Yeong-hwa isn't clairvoyant.

456
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,673
I knew very well how it would end.

457
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:57,512
Everything I like ends up as regret.

458
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,182
So you might not have liked him
just to be free of regret.

459
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,894
That was my intention.

460
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,855
But I couldn't

461
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,608
control my heart as I wished.

462
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,457
You're buying tonight, right?

463
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,086
Everything here seemed a bit expensive.

464
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,928
As if I'd let a peasant pay for my drinks.

465
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,473
I don't mind being called a peasant today.

466
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,019
I'd love to be one too.

467
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,771
Do you want to trade places?

468
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,939
No way.

469
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,927
LEE YEONG-HWA
HONGUK UNIVERSITY

470
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,262
<i>One college student.</i>

471
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,805
Do you need a student discount?

472
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,557
Sure thing. Just a second.

473
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,066
I forgot that I lost it.

474
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,029
I'm home.

475
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,197
What are you up to?

476
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,952
What's this?

477
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,871
A gift.

478
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,581
A gift?

479
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,292
That's out of the blue.

480
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,882
No way.

481
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,678
-Seon-gyeom--
-I even stocked the shelves

482
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,096
with butane gas.

483
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,808
I went to see an exhibition today,
but I couldn't get a discount

484
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,394
because I didn't have
my student ID with me.

485
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,687
So I didn't see it.

486
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,065
You know,

487
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,693
I'll just let it hurt when it does.

488
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,362
I can be all right

489
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,781
when the pain stops.

490
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,827
On the outside,
it may seem like a sad ending.

491
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,913
But my time with Ms. Seo

492
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,167
has taught me the emotions
to keep growing.

493
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,214
That must be why
she kept calling me "kid."

494
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,299
So that I'd learn.

495
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,181
It probably allowed you
to lay the foundation.

496
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,309
A future with her may not happen,

497
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,603
but without her,

498
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,356
you may not have been
mature enough in the future.

499
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,112
Something like that.

500
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,324
Someday,

501
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,245
my memory of her may fade away…

502
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,123
but that's okay.

503
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,669
She'll still be in here.

504
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:29,932
Film festivals never used to invite me
no matter how I tried.

505
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:35,396
It must have been your translation
that got me this invitation

506
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,523
to the Dubai Film Festival.

507
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,193
My gosh, no way. That's great news!

508
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:45,031
Congratulations.
Doing all those revisions paid off.

509
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,073
Right, the revisions.

510
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,577
I've pestered you with those revisions
despite my poor English.

511
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,287
I get it though.

512
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,749
It's your written work
being translated to another language.

513
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,084
You annoyed me to hell as well.

514
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,171
I blame myself for pushing your buttons.

515
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,133
You certainly have a way with words.

516
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,469
You got angry with me often.

517
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,304
It seems like only yesterday

518
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,848
when I saw the post you made
looking for a translator.

519
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,060
You always changed the subject
when at a disadvantage.

520
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,855
I came across it by chance in between jobs
and was drawn to it.

521
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,817
"The movie's great, but you're the worst."

522
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,694
You swore at me a lot.

523
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,321
Seriously?

524
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,492
Can't you see I'm trying to put on
my rose-tinted glasses?

525
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,409
Come on.

526
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,204
Anyway, I owe it all to your involvement.

527
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,872
Thank you.

528
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,332
Now? Really?

529
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,877
I'm helping you
put on your rose-tinted glasses.

530
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,131
Unbelievable.

531
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,009
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

532
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,010
Thank you. Truly.

533
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,975
What's this?

534
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,144
Why are you all dressed up?

535
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,815
I got a job as an agent.

536
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,443
No way! I'm so happy for you!

537
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,946
Congratulations. I'm so proud of you.

538
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,531
What are you craving? It's on me.

539
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,199
Is there anything you want?

540
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,159
Do you want that star up there?

541
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,869
Just say the word, and I'll get it.

542
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,788
It's okay, I don't need it.

543
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,290
Thank goodness. I couldn't do it anyway.

544
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,961
I'll buy the meal since I landed the job.

545
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,463
-"When hungry, bang"?
-Since I'm hungry and it's cold,

546
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,507
let's have pork backbone stew.

547
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,093
You even tell me what you want now.

548
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,971
I'm so proud of you. You're all grown up.

549
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,849
There you go again. I'll do it too.

550
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,810
Then grow up already.

551
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,438
No way.

552
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,232
Don't we click perfectly now?

553
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,650
I can't believe this.

554
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,068
<i>Well, what's your job?</i>

555
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,112
-Are you John Wick or something?
-Who is that?

556
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,114
-Do you not know him?
-No.

557
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,741
I see.

558
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,244
But why a pervert?

559
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,872
-Me?
-No.

560
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,915
Me.

561
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,252
-Are you a pervert?
-No.

562
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,338
That felt like just yesterday.

563
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,799
We've always clicked.

564
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,260
Whom have you been talking to?

565
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,389
Anyway,
don't you carry your gun around anymore?

566
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,433
I haven't seen it in a while.

567
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,936
I've stored it somewhere secret.

568
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,024
Speaking of which…

569
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,402
Are you really not a pervert?

570
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,988
-Hey.
-Are we talking casually now?

571
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,823
-Should we?
-No.

572
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,908
Fine.

573
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,452
Let's go.

574
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,508
-Are you busy tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

575
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,345
Myeong-min told me
to attend something tomorrow.

576
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,181
I see. I'm also going.
to the general stockholders' meeting.

577
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,101
I want you to be my brother

578
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,479
tomorrow.

579
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,107
Just for tomorrow?

580
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,654
Weren't you always my brother?

581
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,198
Keep being one from now on.

582
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,992
Dan-ah!

583
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,121
Don't get all affectionate.

584
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,546
Ta-da!

585
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,257
Gosh. What is this for?

586
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,842
Congratulations on getting a divorce.

587
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,054
Thank you for being a wife and a mother

588
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,558
despite being famous for who you are.

589
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,893
Am I no longer your mom?

590
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,062
Were you ever one to begin with?

591
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,647
I'm just following in your footsteps.

592
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:49,942
My daughter.

593
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,861
You've grown up so well
despite me not being there.

594
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,738
That's not true.

595
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,949
When you were little,

596
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,452
all the other moms were there
for their babies,

597
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,329
but I wasn't.

598
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,708
Since you were all called "mom,"

599
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,586
I thought all moms were the same
when they weren't.

600
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:15,134
Thanks to you, I learned fairly early
that all moms are different.

601
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,930
You need to work, right?
I'll get going now.

602
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,557
Where are you going?

603
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,061
I'm going to take some time
and look at the sky.

604
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,233
And at times, the sea.
I want to live an ordinary, peaceful life.

605
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,827
One Americano to go, please.

606
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,626
I'm sorry.

607
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,461
What?

608
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,590
I think I was rude last time.

609
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,136
I shouldn't have poked
at your feelings like that.

610
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,531
Do you like him?

611
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,743
The kid who painted that.

612
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,912
I do like him.

613
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,248
You were the first to ask me that,

614
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,126
so I wanted to answer you.

615
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,131
All I had to say was yes.

616
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,514
To be honest,

617
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,685
I didn't want to get married,
so I lied about being gay to my family.

618
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,315
It may have been a lifetime of worry
for someone else,

619
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,318
but I used it as an excuse.

620
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,655
I'm sorry.

621
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,410
Here's your coffee.

622
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,336
What's this?

623
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,173
Did we always have a vacuum cleaner?

624
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,760
Yes?

625
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,719
You're back.

626
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,560
What's this? Something's off.

627
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,605
What could it be? I wonder what it is.

628
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,902
-Did you drink again?
-No, I'm sober today.

629
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,071
It's rare for you
to come here sober at night.

630
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,781
I met Ms. Seo.

631
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:45,659
What?

632
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,120
Where? Why?

633
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,789
She apologized to me.

634
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,420
Why would she? And why just to you?

635
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,255
She never apologized to me.

636
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,342
Then she must think she did you no wrong.

637
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,594
Did you really break up?

638
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,555
I still like her. Why?

639
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,224
Damn it. Whose side are you on?

640
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,439
You're my first love.

641
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,947
What? What are you saying?

642
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,242
I think it's done.

643
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,663
The end of my unreciprocated love.

644
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,501
How do you know when it will end?

645
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,878
-Can you tell?
-When it's almost done.

646
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,800
It'll only be over once I know it's done.

647
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,513
Damn it.

648
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,016
How is that complete?

649
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,604
It's only complete if it's reciprocated.

650
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,525
Why are you crying when I'm not?

651
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,151
I don't know, you asshole.

652
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,243
You really are my weakness.

653
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,995
I feel so much better.

654
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,414
I'm glad I rehearsed.

655
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,254
-Hello.
-Hello.

656
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,215
This is my athlete, Kim Woo-sik.

657
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,968
Hello, I'm Kim Woo-sik.

658
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,097
I've heard a lot about you. Welcome.

659
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,474
It's nice to meet you.
I hope we get along.

660
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,351
Me too.

661
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,526
<i>I came in first place today.</i>

662
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,986
<i>I shed tears of joy.</i>

663
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,280
<i>My fans said my tears are like pearls.</i>

664
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,865
Then go and sell them.
Who's that next to you?

665
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,077
<i>He's a fellow unit member, Lucien.
He's the leader.</i>

666
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,580
Is this room bugged?

667
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,670
<i>The vote for presidential candidacy
took place today</i>

668
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:05,215
<i>for the Happiness and Freedom Party,</i>

669
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,509
<i>during which Assemblyman Ki Jeong-do</i>

670
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,513
<i>lost by a slim margin against
Assemblyman Noh,</i>

671
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:15,183
<i>Assemblyman Ki has announced
his retirement following his loss.</i>

672
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:19,354
<i>Meanwhile, regarding
the recent accusations of an affair,</i>

673
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,148
<i>Assemblyman Noh has released a statement</i>

674
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:26,403
<i>denying the accusations and issued
an apology to all parties involved.</i>

675
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,673
Did you buy a new laptop?

676
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,760
You always used to borrow mine.

677
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,803
I thought I needed one for myself.

678
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,348
I bought one before starting off
on my new journey.

679
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,641
Did you get a nice one?

680
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,019
I'm not tech-savvy,
so I just bought the latest one.

681
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,898
The color looks so refined. It suits you.

682
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,692
Good luck on your new journey.

683
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,487
Good luck next semester.

684
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,073
I need help with my assignment.

685
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,616
Can you model for me later?

686
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,160
I'm quite busy.

687
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,040
I even cheered you on just now,
and you did the same.

688
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,501
I don't have many chances
to draw a dynamic model.

689
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,378
As an athlete, you're perfect.

690
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,756
I quit running ages ago.
Do you have some time now?

691
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,967
Follow me, and I'll show you
what real sports is like.

692
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,648
Are you warming up?

693
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,901
-Come here.
-Hello.

694
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,946
This is Kim Woo-sik.

695
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,572
He'll be your dynamic model.

696
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,950
Hello, I'm Lee Yeong-hwa.

697
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,618
"Yeong-hwa," as in movie?

698
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,246
That's incredible. I love movies.

699
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,372
-Really?
-Yes.

700
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,873
I hear that often.

701
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,085
He wants to draw you running today.

702
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,005
-Are you an artist?
-Not yet. I'm still a student.

703
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,298
I hope to be…

704
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,218
after I graduate.

705
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,762
I've never spoken with an artist before.

706
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,390
Next time, draw a mural
for our alternative school.

707
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,516
Why should I?

708
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,061
I introduced him to you.
It'll be your way of repaying me.

709
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,105
Sure. How big is the wall?

710
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,857
I can't do it alone if it's too big.

711
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,150
The students will help.

712
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,487
All they do is run, so I want to give them
something refreshing to do.

713
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,906
-Sure.
-Yeong-il!

714
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,868
Hello.

715
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,373
Why

716
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,208
don't you train with your team?

717
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,960
You only have a kind voice.

718
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,338
Who is he?

719
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,301
Hello, I'm Lee Yeong-hwa.
I'm his roommate.

720
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,596
Do you live with him?

721
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,181
How?

722
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,266
Just fine?

723
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,143
I see.

724
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,311
I'm Kwon Yeong-il.

725
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,772
I'm his friend.

726
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,732
You're his friend?

727
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,692
How?

728
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,195
That's enough.

729
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,033
I don't see your helmet.
Did you leave it on your bike?

730
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,618
I sold my bike.

731
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,246
I came here to give you this.

732
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,421
"Groom, Kwon Yeong-il"?

733
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,381
-Are you getting married?
-Yes.

734
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,385
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

735
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,096
-I'm sorry I only brought two.
-That's fine.

736
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,557
You're finally getting married.
Congratulations.

737
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,642
Thanks.

738
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,605
What is it?

739
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,564
They bicker often.

740
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,150
-Is that right?
-Were you seeing someone?

741
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,986
-Yes, for ten years.
-Since you're modelling,

742
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,488
do you have a favorite pose?

743
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,781
-Me?
-Ten years?

744
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,533
I need to draw something dynamic.

745
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,201
-How about me running?
-Sure.

746
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,788
Do you really think Mom just wanted
to come camping today?

747
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,125
We couldn't come because of your exams.

748
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,919
The two of us went a few times,

749
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,046
but, today, you're here as well.

750
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:14,173
So you came without me.

751
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,808
Ye-chan, you're of legal age now.
Have a glass of wine.

752
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,893
This is my first time!

753
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,108
Ye-jun, pour her a glass.

754
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,625
When you were around eight, you asked me,

755
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,837
"Mom, do you regret having me?"

756
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,755
I don't remember.

757
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,926
-What did you say?
-I couldn't answer.

758
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:02,346
I had you at the young age of 21.

759
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,724
It felt like you saw right through me.

760
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,728
So I tried to cover up the sense of guilt
with motherly love,

761
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:11,397
but it didn't work well.

762
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,026
Why would you feel guilty?

763
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,743
I was too busy taking care of others

764
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,203
to be by your side.

765
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,791
And because I got divorced too soon.

766
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,585
But…

767
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,922
everyone's different.

768
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,966
-That's right.
-And being different

769
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,719
isn't wrong.

770
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,640
That's right.

771
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,643
You're all grown up, Ye-jun.

772
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,648
The exhibition will last
for about two weeks.

773
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:55,316
Okay.

774
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:01,405
I think I get the rough idea,
but what is it exactly?

775
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,120
<i>Yeong-il is getting married.</i>

776
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:11,165
<i>He had been in a relationship--</i>

777
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,876
-Seon-gyeom, I'm here.
-I'm coming.

778
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,421
Come in and warm yourself.

779
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,383
What's wrong?

780
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,551
-Did something happen?
-Something did happen.

781
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:25,763
-What is it?
-Remember when I subtitled

782
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,391
that Korean short film?

783
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,851
Yes, you really liked the movie.

784
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:34,355
Yes. It didn't do so well here,
but they loved it abroad.

785
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,944
The director is overseas
attending a film festival right now.

786
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,278
Look at this.

787
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:45,449
"Oh Mi-joo. You were here today as well."

788
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,119
I've never received
something like this before.

789
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:52,498
I'm going to continue doing my best
no matter how big or small a project is.

790
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,419
-I'm good when I put my mind to it.
-Of course, you're great.

791
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,923
I really liked the message it relayed.

792
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:04,885
"Delicate and sensitive individuals
should live happy lives.

793
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,139
Those who are polite
shouldn't be looked down on."

794
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,807
This seemed to be the message.

795
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:15,104
I finally understand why you like movies.

796
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,772
-Now?
-Yes.

797
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,150
Right, I have something to do.

798
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,776
Bring me your diary.

799
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,948
Didn't you say diaries were personal?

800
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:28,242
I won't read it, so bring it.

801
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,121
This is my diary.

802
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,961
I promise I won't read it. I swear.

803
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,382
Don't you worry. I really won't read it.

804
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:56,520
Here.

805
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,230
GREAT JOB

806
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,066
"Great job"? What is this?

807
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,109
"Great job."

808
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,237
It's a stamp.

809
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,699
Don't teachers usually stamp this
on their students' diaries?

810
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,327
Am I a kid again?

811
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,746
Great job, little Seon-gyeom.

812
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,335
Stamps are perfect for kids,
don't you agree?

813
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:21,712
You're right.

814
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:24,131
-Aren't you proud?
-I am.

815
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,269
Congratulations, vice-president.

816
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,482
Don't forget "youngest".

817
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,442
It sounds even better
because it's so surreal.

818
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:50,741
We did it, Mr. Jeong.
We made our fantasy come true.

819
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,244
It was only possible because it was "us."

820
00:56:58,541 --> 00:56:59,625
That's true.

821
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,301
SEOMYUNG ART MUSEUM

822
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:16,517
We have some amazing new talent this time.

823
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,310
I hope you'll like them.

824
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:21,981
It doesn't matter if I like them.

825
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,191
Our patrons should like them.

826
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,779
You can go about your work.
I don't mean to keep you.

827
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,322
Okay.

828
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:30,841
Me too.

829
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,098
I miss you too.

830
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,526
They look good on you.

831
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:35,114
Both the shoes and my painting.

832
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,747
It's because they're yours.

833
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:52,673
Aren't you going to

834
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,175
share your thoughts on the painting?

835
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,345
<i>How do you paint like that?</i>

836
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,848
What kind of life did you live…

837
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,518
I wondered what you were made of
to have painted like that.

838
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,192
I eat a lot of rice burgers.

839
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,903
I go to exhibits and watch movies often.

840
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:19,617
And I'm not entirely sure
what I'm made of.

841
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,411
-I've never checked inside.
-I don't know either,

842
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,747
but your painting was dark and unsettling.

843
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,793
I've been inside your heart,

844
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,632
and it was radiant.

845
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,261
I'll make today

846
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,847
my real birthday.

847
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,902
Happy birthday, Ms. Seo.

848
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:06,789
-Can we take a break?
-Sure, in a little bit.

849
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,582
Let's rest here.

850
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,210
We just started running.

851
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,222
We'll probably never fully understand
each other, right?

852
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,516
Yes.

853
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,060
We're different after all.

854
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:34,191
You have your world, and I have mine.

855
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:37,569
But we could align our worlds
next to each other, couldn't we?

856
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,157
So let's not be disappointed
even if we can't understand each other.

857
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,952
That's impossible to do.

858
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,831
Instead, we'll stick to
whatever's possible.

859
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:55,587
Have I…

860
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,591
ever told you that I love you?

861
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,140
I think this is the right time.

862
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:10,728
The time to say "I love you"?

863
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,064
I love you.

864
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,199
Break's over.

865
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,452
What?

866
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,579
What? I thought you loved me?

867
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,000
Do you want to go watch my movie later?

868
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,838
Then watch me watch the movie.

869
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,089
You like me, right?

870
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:41,800
I didn't say anything.

871
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:45,095
I can read you like a book now
because you love me.

872
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,477
Shouldn't you say something?

873
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,396
Why do you have to ruin a happy ending?

874
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,859
<i>What's a happy ending? How do you get it?</i>

875
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,195
Many movies have happy endings,

876
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,571
like <i>The Sound of Music</i>.

877
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,200
What is that?

878
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,411
It's that musical
they show you in music class.

879
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,246
It was <i>Secret</i> for us.

880
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,457
They must show <i>La La Land</i> these days.

881
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,794
This is coming from someone
who has seen all sorts of movies.

882
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:19,087
Happy endings are just a fantasy
and an illusion

883
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,381
created by civilization.

884
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,634
How can it be real
when it doesn't even exist?

885
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,177
You're so pessimistic.

886
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,305
How would you define it anyway?

887
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:31,558
Is it living a long and happy life?

888
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:37,731
You're born into this world alone
and will die the same way.

889
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,316
Let's say you have a soulmate.

890
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,152
But you're separated the moment you die.

891
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,779
That's why it's an illusion.

892
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,073
You could reunite in heaven.

893
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,784
Only person you'll meet in heaven
is Keanu Reeves.

894
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:49,952
Who is that?

895
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,247
-John Wick.
-John Wick?

896
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:58,502
I don't think he'll go to heaven.
He's a killer.

897
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,215
Do you think there's even an afterlife?

898
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,927
But isn't Constantine
the Keanu that goes to heaven?

899
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,429
You're right. I got them mixed up.

900
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,307
Wait, how did you know
that John Wick was a killer?

901
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,060
-I looked it up.
-Did you?

902
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:19,356
My happy ending is
having adorable children

903
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:22,526
-with the woman I love.
-How would you have kids?

904
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,944
Through the power of science.

905
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,487
That's not what she meant.

906
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,948
Live long until you can have kids.

907
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,117
What about you? What's your happy ending?

908
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,619
Can we share it?
Our love will last forever.

909
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:36,123
I lied to my family that I was gay
because I didn't want to get married.

910
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,626
Aren't we wasting time talking about this?

911
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,627
Let's just drink.

912
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,005
I also don't know anything
when it comes to movies.

913
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:45,340
-Should we make a toast?
-Sure.

914
01:04:45,424 --> 01:04:47,092
We need something to toast to.

915
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:49,928
Let's see.

916
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,765
How about my marathon run?
We could toast to that.

917
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,100
-If there isn't--
-Sure.

918
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,059
-Okay?
-Okay.

919
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:58,145
-All right. Cheers…
-Cheers…

920
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,355
-Join us, will you?
-Come on, Ms. Seo.

921
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,858
-What do I do?
-Just clink it.

922
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,235
One, two, three.

923
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:08,071
-Cheers to finishing the marathon!
-Cheers to finishing the marathon!

924
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:31,094
YOU CAN DO IT, EVERYONE!
FROM MI-JOO, SEON-GYEOM

925

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, JI-WOO

926
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,365
Hey.

927
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,743
Hello.

928
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,541
Seon-gyeom. Mi-joo.

929
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,838
