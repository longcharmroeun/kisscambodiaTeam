00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,974
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,282
SEOMYUNG CHARITY MARATHON

4
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,466
I completed the race, right?

5
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,512
I can't believe I did it.

6
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,139
-I'm so excited.
-Me too.

7
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,725
-Is the race over?
-Yes.

8
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,143
What about you?

9
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,395
Did you finish soon?

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,529
Gosh. They're so mean.

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,491
They could've waited for me.

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,743
But I did.

13
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,124
I waited

14
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,626
until I could see you.

15
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,263
It's my first time finishing a race.

16
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,732
I often made you wait.

17
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,403
And every time I did,
you always waited for me.

18
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm more fascinated by this moment.

19
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,995
I've made a wise decision to wait for you.

20
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,001
I'm glad I waited.

21
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,253
Me too.

22
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,048
Did you watch <i>E.T.</i>?

23
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,260
-Did you watch the movie?
-No, I didn't.

24
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,262
I see.

25
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,435
I actually practiced a lot
so I'd be able to finish the race.

26
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,937
-I wanted to surprise you.
-I don't believe you.

27
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,774
I kept a record every time I ran.

28
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,651
I have evidence. Do you want to see?

29
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,153
My gosh, seriously.

30
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:19,032
I'm so proud of myself
for becoming a runner.

31
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,327
What? You're not going to believe me?

32
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,412
My gosh.

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,082
Catch me if you can.

34
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,588
Why aren't you coming? Seriously.

35
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,382
-What? I was--
-Come and catch me.

36
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,761
-Try and catch me, okay?
-Okay, fine.

37
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,429
All right. Go on.

38
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,515
-Catch me if you can.
-I'm going to catch you.

39
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,268
-Catch me if you can.
-I'm seriously going to catch you.

40
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,570
You offered to drive me home.

41
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,072
I didn't know he'd be here.

42
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,325
Then who was supposed to drive?
You told me you don't drive.

43
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,952
And I was too tired to drive.

44
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,205
If I knew he was going to join,
I would've taken the bus.

45
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,374
Mr. Jeong, stop the car.
He wants to get off.

46
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,253
I felt awkward in the hallway
because you didn't let me inside.

47
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,712
Why would you come inside?

48
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,923
You were neither the doctor
nor the patient.

49
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,842
I wanted to be there for you.
You let Mr. Jeong inside.

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,136
-Should I stop the car?
-Take me to my house.

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,597
Stop yelling. It's giving me a headache.

52
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,599
You secretly watched me sleep.

53
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,934
So why can't I do the same?

54
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,019
I just watched you.
I didn't do it secretly.

55
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,898
Will you shut up?

56
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,858
Ms. Seo.

57
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,861
Was that too vulgar of me?

58
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,365
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

59
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,966
Take care of yourself.
I'll get mad if you get sick.

60
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,719
You should go on inside.

61
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,722
Mr. Jeong, please take good care
of Ms. Seo for me.

62
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
What's with that guy?

63
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,238
-Mr. Jeong.
-Yes?

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,450
Am I doing the right thing?

65
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,786
-With what?
-With this.

66
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,374
How am I supposed to end it well?

67
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,795
Why are you thinking about ending it
when you've only just started?

68
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,966
What? Does that mean you support me?

69
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,178
I thought you couldn't support me.

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,016
I feel like I should since you're not
even supportive of yourself.

71
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,730
Every time I liked something,
it always came to an end.

72
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,815
The same happened with soccer.

73
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,278
I never liked something
knowing it'd have to end someday.

74
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,909
So you're scared that what happened
with soccer might also happen

75
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,827
with Mr. Lee?

76
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,789
No, I'm sad.

77
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,222
Cheers.

78
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,849
Cheers. You did great today.

79
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,228
DRIED FISH MIX

80
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,231
It's so nice and cool.
This place sells good beer.

81
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,069
Are you memorizing the menu?
Hurry or I might finish this.

82
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,405
I'm not good at choosing what to eat
with alcohol.

83
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,907
-You know I'm an LW.
-Choose whatever.

84
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,202
No, not that.

85
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,371
Dried pollack goes with beer.
Soup is for soju.

86
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,580
Dried pollack it is.

87
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,583
I thought you wanted me to choose.

88
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,544
You're talking back again.

89
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,879
What exactly is talking back?

90
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,340
-What you did just now.
-It was just a question.

91
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,135
Ma'am, can we please get
a dish of dried pollack?

92
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,594
Sure.

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,226
There's actually something on my mind.

94
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,854
Ma'am, can we also have <i>jjamppong</i> soup?

95
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,896
-Sure.
-There.

96
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,023
Are you ready to listen?

97
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,402
You're scaring me.

98
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,363
I'll try not to sound too scary.

99
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,456
I met my dad, and he told me
I'm free to date whoever

100
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,999
as long as I marry Ms. Seo.

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,918
So,

102
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,047
you can date anyone
as long as you marry Ms. Seo?

103
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,012
There's no telling what they're thinking.

104
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,144
-Can we have another glass of beer?
-Sure.

105
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,148
My dad thinks he's doing me a favor.

106
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,317
Does Ms. Seo know about this?

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,153
I heard this today,
so I didn't get a chance to ask her.

108
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,739
-But I'm sure she feels the same.
-What if she doesn't?

109
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,200
That crazy woman is full of surprises.

110
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,202
My gosh.

111
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,330
Should we just go
and apologize to your dad?

112
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,541
That's what he wants
and it's not that hard to apologize.

113
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,503
I won't let you how easy it may be.
Why would you?

114
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,129
You've done nothing wrong.

115
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,298
That's a very relative matter.

116
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,925
People have different viewpoints.

117
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,179
And your father thinks
I'm doing something wrong by dating you.

118
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,557
Don't ever say that again.

119
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,809
I'm not okay with it.

120
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,896
Gosh, you're such a straight arrow.

121
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,607
Thank you.

122
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,943
Okay, let's stop talking about this.

123
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,903
Let's talk about us.

124
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,404
How's work?

125
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,283
Woo-sik has gotten a lot better.

126
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,329
He might even be doing
better than before in some aspects.

127
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,332
Then will he be able to run again?

128
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,167
I really wish him the best.

129
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,879
I'm currently trying to find
a team for him.

130
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,798
One of them seems optimistic about it.

131
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,050
Then will he enter a race right away?

132
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,928
He needs to wait until spring
for the next season to begin.

133
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,221
You guys have seasons?

134
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,890
My first goal is to get Woo-sik
back on track

135
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,603
and see him start the race.

136
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,522
Once I do that,

137
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,900
I'll think about what to do next.

138
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,118
I think I finally get how you live life.

139
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,830
You told me

140
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,709
there was no one in front of you
after you outran each player.

141
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,963
You just focus on what's in front of you
and do things step by step.

142
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,465
I realized that's how you do things.

143
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,679
You even smiled at me for the first time

144
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,640
when you almost made a nine-second record.

145
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,892
If I timed myself today,
it might have been

146
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,477
a little over nine seconds.

147
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,188
Nine seconds? Is that good?

148
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,649
Gosh, of course. Totally.

149
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,030
I really loved your smile.

150
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,701
But for some reason,
it also made me feel sad.

151
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,995
I just felt that way.

152
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,748
It was the first time

153
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,586
I ever told anyone about that.

154
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,840
Nine seconds is a big record
and a huge barrier for us.

155
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:38,262
But you were there
when I said it out loud.

156
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:43,225
And you were there
when I could actually say it.

157
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,688
So what about that?

158
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,399
That's what the nine-second record
means to me now.

159
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,820
Gosh, you're making me blush.

160
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,530
My goodness.

161
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,616
If I keep going,
you might make a move on me.

162
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,410
I'm not going to
since you're looking forward to it.

163
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,750
What's the matter?

164
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,295
-Are you upset?
-No way.

165
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,673
I'm not upset at all.

166
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,597
-I'm full.
-Me too.

167
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,394
Thank you for celebrating
my first marathon race.

168
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,896
-No problem.
-Thank you.

169
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,235
To be honest,
there's something that worries me.

170
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,614
Something's worrying you?
And you're going to tell me?

171
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,533
You get better day by day.

172
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,410
This is how it must feel to raise kids.

173
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,121
Do I still look like a kid to you?

174
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,666
Yes, and that's exactly why

175
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,543
I should keep you close at all times.

176
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,170
What's worrying you?

177
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,006
Director Dong offered me a job

178
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,926
at the agency as an agent.

179
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,970
Hey, this is like <i>Jerry Maguire</i>.

180
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,682
-"Show me the money."
-It's Ki Seon-gyeom.

181
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,851
Then it's "Seon-gyeom Ki."

182
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,604
Gosh, I'm tipsy.

183
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,607
I think I'm easily getting drunk
thanks to the long run.

184
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,944
I think it'd be safer for Woo-sik

185
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,906
to have an agency supporting him
instead of just me.

186
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,871
You should also think about
what's good for you.

187
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,998
It's also your life.

188
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,625
Right.

189
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,920
Will you be okay working with Ms. Seo?

190
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,298
You guys have different values and goals.

191
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,011
I'm sure we'll butt heads
for the same reason.

192
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,222
Not everyone has what you have.

193
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,266
Your family is famous, you're handsome,

194
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,351
and you always got
the second-highest record.

195
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,519
But what about Woo-sik?

196
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,397
What does he have to offer?

197
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,274
His talent, of course.

198
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,903
In the end, the team just wants
the best record and a medal.

199
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,032
If it's because Ms. Seo doesn't know,

200
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,326
I just need to show her that he can do it.

201
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,913
She quickly accepts things
when you show her results.

202
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,791
Just a second.

203
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,504
Speak of the devil.

204
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,881
MS. SEO DAN-AH

205
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,717
Why is she calling you
at such a late hour?

206
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,554
"Dan-ah, I'll prepare everything
for your wedding.

207
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,348
Just show up to the ceremony."

208
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,767
Who sent you this?

209
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,393
The chairman. My father.

210
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,313
How am I the only one not to know?

211
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,315
Exactly. What kind of nonsense is this?

212
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,942
Seon-gyeom, did you know?

213
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,860
I think he planned this with your dad.

214
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,280
He said I could date anyone
as long as I marry you.

215
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,491
That's all I know.

216
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,326
What does Ms. Oh think?

217
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,119
She's not totally irrelevant

218
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,121
since you're seeing him
and are close with me.

219
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,498
Since when?

220
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,584
Are you guys seeing each other?

221
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,710
No.

222
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,506
Should we just get it over with
and tell them we will?

223
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,675
-Will you get lost?
-This is my office.

224
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,804
Why don't we just live together?
It will be much easier that way.

225
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,516
I can't believe this. That'd be the most
uncomfortable thing on earth.

226
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,518
Okay, fine.

227
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,354
Seon-gyeom, do you have a plan?

228
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,314
Isn't that why you brought her?

229
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,150
We clearly don't want to marry each other.

230
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,405
I don't really mind, but I bet she does.
So let's just say I don't want to.

231
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,490
How grateful.

232
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,201
My dad's probably going to focus
on the election.

233
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,203
Our marriage was never the issue.

234
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,330
He just needs Chairman Seo's support.

235
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,501
So let's just buy some time
and back out last minute.

236
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,006
You make it sound like
it's a really big plan

237
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,215
even though it's not.

238
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,634
All that negotiating
made you turn a bit cheeky.

239
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,846
It's nice and simple.
I won't have to waste my time.

240
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,055
Okay.

241
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,230
What are you looking at?

242
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,648
-Am I beautiful?
-No.

243
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,818
How would that make me feel?
Do I not look beautiful?

244
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,945
Don't you have more to say?

245
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,031
Next time. I'll see you.

246
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,283
Let's go.

247
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,377
Aren't you going to tell her
that you're going to apply as an agent?

248
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,504
There are principles.

249
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,423
So I should apply first.

250
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,466
I see.

251
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,927
I'm glad you started writing a diary.

252
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,929
You can use that
when you write your cover letter.

253
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,264
-You know what that is, right?
-Yes.

254
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,059
Where are you off to now?
Are you going home to work?

255
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,438
You can go without me.
I actually need to talk to her.

256
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't know what it's about,
but don't hit her.

257
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,278
-I'll try not to.
-Go easy on her.

258
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,863
Okay, I will.

259
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,323
-Bye.
-Bye.

260
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,998
And you say we're not close?

261
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,004
I tried not to let this bother me
because I didn't want to seem petty.

262
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,548
But why did you say that?

263
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,636
I can't help it.
It's been ages since he liked someone.

264
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,766
And how do you know that?

265
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,726
I was the last person he liked.

266
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,270
You provoked me that day.

267
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,355
Ms. Oh.

268
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,524
That was ages ago. Why are you still--

269
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,942
Because I'm a loser.

270
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,780
I just stated the truth.
I don't know how to provoke people.

271
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,199
I guess you were
just born with it, my lady.

272
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,910
"My lady"? Why are you calling me that?

273
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,162
Don't you know <i>The Handmaiden</i>?
Lady Hideko.

274
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,873
"You will eventually love him, my lady."

275
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,166
I don't know any of that.

276
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,461
Anyway, I'm asking you

277
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,214
why you talked as if Seon-gyeom
once had feelings for you.

278
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,892
Even if he was just
a track and field athlete,

279
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,311
he would've gotten offers
from many other agencies.

280
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,983
But he chose to sign a deal with me
among all those agencies.

281
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,151
That's what I meant.

282
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,740
That's what you meant by that?

283
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,034
You should've listened until the end.

284
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,494
You were the one
who took it the wrong way.

285
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,290
I couldn't help but take it that way
considering your tone

286
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,833
and the timing.

287
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,335
See? It wasn't my fault,
but you're blaming me again.

288
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,046
Regardless of the process,

289
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,423
you still played a part in
bringing us together.

290
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,966
You're like Cupid.

291
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,136
There's no need to thank me.

292
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,221
But why didn't you also call Yeong-hwa

293
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,890
to discuss the marriage issue?

294
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,976
He can't contact me for personal reasons.

295
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,144
You could've called him.

296
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,731
You're right.
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

297
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,274
Because I just thought of it.

298
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,693
Oh, and one more thing.

299
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,488
Stop calling him late at night.

300
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
Bye then.

301
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,825
Seriously?

302
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,917
<i>The moral of this story is,</i>

303
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,378
don't trust people.

304
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,924
Just trust the situation.

305
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,551
The situation.

306
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,391
So let me ask you something.
Why don't we work together?

307
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,728
Why are you shaking so much?

308
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,820
You're pretty even when you sweat.

309
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,572
Do you have hyperhidrosis?

310
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,449
-Hey.
-Yes?

311
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,575
I'm a cop.

312
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,415
So,

313
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,418
don't trust the person,

314
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,088
but the situation.

315
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,215
I have hyperhidrosis.

316
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,843
It doesn't change the fact
that you're a cop.

317
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,970
A cop with hyperhidrosis.

318
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:06,103
Where did I put my gun?

319
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,147
I'm doomed.

320
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,817
"Name, date of birth,

321
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,695
work experience…"

322
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,322
Work experience?

323
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,825
What has you all serious today?

324
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,744
-My resume.
-I see.

325
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,664
My work experience though--

326
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,667
There's not much to write
having been an athlete all my life.

327
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,671
All I've been is an athlete
on a national team.

328
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,089
Annoying jerk.

329
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,635
Just stick on a large photo
and you're golden.

330
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,014
It should be the appropriate size.

331
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,434
I know that much, you know.

332
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,770
You don't know what really matters.

333
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,647
Your face, right?

334
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,526
Stick on a large photo.
I gave you my advice, okay?

335
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,362
Don't you forget it.
I gave you my advice just now, okay?

336
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,365
Seon-gyeom, a huge photo of yourself!

337
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,408
I'll get going then!

338
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,161
Don't forget it, okay?

339
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,632
Do you feel that bad for me
because I came in second?

340
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,884
Why pity me like this?

341
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,054
I don't feel bad for you,
so why would I pity you?

342
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,639
This isn't like you though.

343
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,183
I earned money in a secondhand sale
for the first time.

344
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,852
I did sell it at a low price,

345
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,939
but it's better than keeping it with me.
I feel elevated in a way.

346
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,024
What did you sell?

347
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,486
Textbooks and mock tests
for the state exam.

348
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,072
You've been studying?

349
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,618
Yes, I even took classes
at the academy run by Seong-geun.

350
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,372
I'll never come in second place again.

351
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,918
-As if you can promise that.
-It's my determination.

352
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,171
It should be yours as well.

353
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,215
Sure thing.

354
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,218
Also, don't pay today.

355
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,137
How dare you offer
when I'm way your senior?

356
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,722
It'll be on me, so eat up.

357
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,934
Can I order more? Like a pizza?

358
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,395
-Excuse me!
-Hey.

359
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,569
We need to talk.

360
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,698
How dare you come here. Are you insane?

361
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,075
I have nothing to say.

362
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,159
Hey.

363
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,121
Stop playing hard to get.

364
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,456
-I told you to stop.
-Ye-jun.

365
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,002
And who may you be?

366
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
Did my son cause you trouble?

367
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,006
No.

368
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,633
-Excuse me?
-Mom.

369
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,848
-Mom, you see--
-Don't explain.

370
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,812
Starting this weekend,
you're coming to church with me.

371
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,523
-Mom.
-Don't!

372
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,692
I'm gay.

373
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,195
No. I doubt it.

374
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,576
You can deny it all you want,
but this is who I am.

375
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,778
So much for being his mom.

376
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,158
I was preoccupied with other kids

377
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,704
to realize what was happening.

378
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,062
Are you crying?

379
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,564
Seriously?

380
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,695
I like men too, you know.

381
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,240
What?

382
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,659
What's so special about liking men anyway?

383
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,206
I wanted to come out properly,

384
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,126
not get caught like this.

385
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,592
-You didn't have to bring one.
-It was in my pocket.

386
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,761
Did I blow my nose with that?

387
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,347
Anyway, it's cold. Let's go.

388
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,725
If Mom gets mad with you,
I'll take your side.

389
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,396
Why have you been nice to me?

390
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,691
Because it's annoying
when you're sulking all the time.

391
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,985
Can I blame my CSAT score on you?

392
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,155
-No.
-Exactly. So start walking. It's cold.

393
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,908
What a loser.

394
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,619
REASONS FOR APPLYING

395
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,550
Will I not be able to fulfill my dream
yet again this year?

396
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,221
Can you ask how much a gas stove is?

397
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,851
Seon-gyeom?

398
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,353
Seon-gyeom!

399
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,274
A gas stove. Ask how much one costs.

400
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,652
I can tell what you're thinking
because of your eyes.

401
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,697
It's your lack of attention
that made me this way.

402
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,032
How much is the gas stove?

403
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,285
A decent one would be
50,000 won to 100,000 won.

404
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,205
I never had enough money
after paying rent and expenses.

405
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,333
Yet you have enough to buy booze.
Why do you need one though?

406
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,253
It'd be nice to grill
some pork belly on the rooftop.

407
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,549
Wouldn't Mi-joo have one?
I should get all cute and ask her.

408
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,718
Why would you get cute with her?

409
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,428
Don't. I'll do it instead.

410
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,109
-Are you busy?
-<i>Well, I was working.</i>

411
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,487
Do you perhaps have a gas stove?

412
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,864
<i>A gas stove? Probably.</i>

413
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,032
<i>Why do you ask though?</i>

414
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,660
Yeong-hwa wants to grill
pork belly on the rooftop.

415
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,286
<i>What? No way.</i>

416
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,914
<i>I'll lend it to you if you let me join.</i>

417
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,207
Sure.

418
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,708
-Come on.
-Welcome!

419
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,086
-I'll take that.
-Hey, it's me.

420
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,005
Gosh, your hands are frozen.

421
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,926
It was all worth it
with you and the pork waiting.

422
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,011
-It wasn't necessary though.
-Oh, please.

423
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,221
The other one.

424
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,642
-It's frozen too.
-Your hands are warm.

425
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,354
I'd love to invite Ms. Seo over too.

426
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,481
It's your house, so do as you please.

427
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,568
We're only allowed to talk
about my paintings.

428
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,861
What's wrong with you?

429
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,658
What about that incident
in your hometown then?

430
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,577
I'm not allowed to call her yet.

431
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,912
Then just talk about the paintings.

432
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,791
-Why don't I give you a tour?
-You're a genius.

433
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,544
This is the sleeping area.

434
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,380
I sleep on the couch
while Yeong-hwa sleeps over there.

435
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,716
-Doesn't it get cold?
-It's all right.

436
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,801
Ms. Seo.

437
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,511
No, please don't hang up!

438
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,306
-He drew this.
-Don't pick up just to hang up.

439
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,266
-This is a first for me.
-It's about work.

440
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,767
-He's quite good.
-I'm done now,

441
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,227
so come by the house.

442
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,856
-Right this moment. That's right.
-Goodness.

443
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,817
Are you finished? Is this it?

444
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,402
No.

445
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,446
Then you lied to Ms. Seo?

446
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,699
I'm "almost" done.
I just chose to omit that.

447
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,453
Then that makes it a lie.
No wonder she tells you off.

448
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,790
So when will we eat? I'll grill the meat.

449
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,251
I once worked part-time
at a barbecue joint.

450
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,130
It's time to go shopping.
We'll go together.

451
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,508
You should have had everything ready
before calling me!

452
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,011
You two can go.

453
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,971
The walk over here was tiring.

454
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,349
Rest over there where it's warm.

455
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,809
-Bye.
-Should I? Okay, then.

456
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,317
Why keep buying booze in bulk
when you don't even drink much?

457
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,527
That's how I always buy alcohol.

458
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,115
Don't they have cases of soju here?

459
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,034
Cases? A whole case?

460
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,244
Who drinks all that?

461
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,538
They will if it's there.

462
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,295
What the hell?

463
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,673
Seon-gyeom, no. Are you kidding me?

464
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,801
How much meat are you willing to buy?

465
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,552
We're a party of four.

466
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,223
And two packets of meat will be enough.
Jeez.

467
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,642
They'll eat it if it's there.

468
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,604
Who is this "they" you're referring to?

469
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,606
-My colleagues.
-Your colleagues?

470
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,443
You mean athletes?

471
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,946
Oh, athletes.

472
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,533
They sure must eat a lot.

473
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,952
Well, who am I to complain?

474
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,372
What about pork neck?

475
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,098
Will this be enough?

476
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,309
-Right?
-Right.

477
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,438
It's Ms. Seo!

478
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,524
-What's going on?
-Hi, Ms. Seo.

479
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,152
Isn't it obvious? We're having a barbecue.

480
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,905
So where's my painting?

481
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,994
One, two…

482
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,329
Ta-da!

483
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,331
Picturesque, right?

484
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,251
This is a barbecue. I want my painting.

485
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,753
In my heart.

486
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,466
Are you willing to take it out of there?

487
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,094
This is the only thing
I have in my heart though.

488
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,597
Yeong-hwa, cut it out.

489
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,850
-I'll hold Ms. Seo back.
-The painting's nearly done.

490
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,351
I just wanted you to--

491
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,437
Sue me. The settlement will be generous.

492
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,272
-Goodness.
-Exactly how much?

493
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,940
-What your pain is worth.
-Ms. Seo.

494
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,485
Please calm down.
You'll only hurt yourself.

495
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,694
How is that the issue?

496
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,154
Okay, then.

497
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,032
I'll push him instead.

498
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,869
We'll say he slipped and fell.
Are you with me, Seon-gyeom?

499
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,579
As if it's that easy.

500
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,164
What if it is?

501
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,583
What if I break an arm from the fall?

502
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,419
-I won't be able to paint.
-Just your arm?

503
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,881
You have my blessings for once, Ms. Seo.

504
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,342
Though I really don't want to.

505
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,054
Just have some barbecue.
Burning it will be a waste.

506
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,556
-Help Ms. Oh, will you?
-Hurry.

507
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,559
Your hands must be cold.

508
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,276
I'd rather have soju or beer.
Why mix the two?

509
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,239
My temper sure has dwindled.

510
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,660
Come join us and stop distracting us.

511
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,453
This isn't a standing party.

512
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,872
-You should listen to Ms. Oh.
-Exactly.

513
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,833
And sit on that dump of a chair?

514
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,502
-It's cooked well.
-We're seated just fine.

515
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,381
If you had told me,
I would've bought my own drink and glass.

516
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,717
You never asked me
before dragging me to the East Sea.

517
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,427
Leave if you're going to complain.

518
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,223
Mi-joo, why are you being mean
when she actually showed up?

519
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,018
Why are you yelling at her
when it's your fault?

520
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,187
He's right. Be more attentive toward her.

521
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,774
If my putting up with this
will make things better,

522
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,234
that's what I'll do.

523
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,165
This is my first time trying pork belly.

524
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,800
My friend.

525
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,890
Didn't you call her here
to enjoy this with her?

526
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,476
Why aren't you making her a lettuce wrap?

527
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,521
It should be self-made
to fit our preferences.

528
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,356
Wait, stop.

529
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,150
That'll be a waste of booze.

530
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,110
Here. I'll drink that.

531
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,613
My dear athlete, you make one for me.

532
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,156
Don't you dare.

533
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,450
Stop calling him as if he's yours.

534
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,076
His contract ended ages ago.

535
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,579
Can you even remember his name?

536
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,584
-You've got to be kidding me.
-Do you? What is it then?

537
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,887
Wait, I really can't remember.

538
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,096
Hold on. I know.

539
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,266
Don't play games with me.

540
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,977
Let me look it up online.

541
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,816
You need to know my name
in order to look it up.

542
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,110
Your last name is Ki,

543
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,446
so I might luck out
with search recommendations.

544
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,406
Ms. Seo, what about my name?

545
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,991
I want to verify that you know.

546
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,576
You're Vending Machine.

547
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,249
-What about my name?
-It's Oh Mi-joo.

548
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,460
My heart just skipped a beat.

549
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,296
Actually, I think I'm offended.

550
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,383
A runner on the national team.

551
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,845
-Ki Seon-gyeom!
-Here you go.

552
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,138
-After--
-Open up.

553
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,686
What's with him?

554
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,773
-How was the pork belly?
-Are you bundled up?

555
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,942
-It wasn't bad.
-We'll eat it again sometime.

556
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,110
Sure.

557
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,451
-May, what are you doing here?
-Hi, Mi-joo.

558
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,206
All of you were present
during that mess at the cafe.

559
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,207
Hello.

560
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,835
It's been a while, roommate.

561
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,548
-What are you doing here alone?
-Actually, I'm with someone--

562
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,008
Where did he go?

563
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,801
Ji-hyun.

564
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,429
Jeong Ji-hyun.

565
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,681
Jeong Ji-hyun? I know that name.

566
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,559
It's Mr. Jeong's name.

567
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,769
You don't know
because you never call his name.

568
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,771
-I see.
-What the--

569
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,689
Ji-hyun?

570
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,071
What were you doing up there?

571
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,035
Well, you see--

572
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,705
Well, I always wanted my first date

573
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,082
at a playground with a slide.

574
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,003
This wasn't in your schedule today,
Ms. Seo.

575
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,089
Ms. Seo? The one who called you that day?

576
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,425
Your mean boss.

577
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,927
Mean?

578
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,346
May, when did I ever say that?

579
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,057
What?

580
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,685
Ms. Seo, you see--

581
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,148
I'll explain everything.

582
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,925
<i>At that moment,</i>

583
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,596
something in me exploded as well.

584
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,641
Thinking of that makes me--

585
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,476
Then don't think about it.

586
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,979
You really did startle me that day, May.

587
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,566
This is what you call a natural encounter.

588
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,235
Oh, I see what you mean.

589
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
I'm glad it was romantic for someone.

590
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,034
I was returning to the office
when he followed me.

591
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,412
Excuse me.

592
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,666
Here.

593
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,586
My name is Jeong Ji-hyun.

594
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,255
Sorry?

595
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,341
I know it's rude to ask a stranger this,

596
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,344
but--

597
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,972
But--

598
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,226
Are you perhaps seeing someone?

599
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,562
Sorry?

600
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,940
Are you perhaps married?

601
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,860
Sorry?

602
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,281
I guess I should've asked you this first.

603
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,494
Are you okay with dating men?

604
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,747
Sorry?

605
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,669
Roommate, didn't you say
that you were an asexual?

606
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,963
I'm not against romance though.

607
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,882
I cover a wide range on the spectrum.

608
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,843
-She's not against dating people.
-I see.

609
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,929
And that was before I met you, Ji-hyun.

610
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,934
May, please. People are watching.

611
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,564
I'll hold back on calling you
on weekends, Mr. Jeong.

612
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,066
I should respect your personal life.

613
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,360
Please do.

614
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,198
He's just too sweet
to say anything that could upset others.

615
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,449
Sorry?

616
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,577
How did he make this image for himself?

617
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,622
It's none of your business.

618
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,169
If you lie to me like this again,

619
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,463
I'll dangle you from the rooftop.

620
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,590
You say that like you mean it.

621
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,966
Are you saying I don't?

622
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,677
Is this you saying you'll be back?

623
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,305
Maybe I should move here.

624
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,349
Not my place. Seon-gyeom's there.

625
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,689
To be honest,

626
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,735
I called you to give you these.

627
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,957
You better stop lying to me.

628
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,459
I'll give you a gift
on your real birthday too.

629
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,506
I support your long-lost dream.

630
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,141
Then will you be giving me a soccer ball
next time?

631
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,853
Well…

632
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,817
You better pretend
like you didn't expect it.

633
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,735
Look completely surprised.

634
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,737
Promise me.

635
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,244
What?

636
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,162
Am I too beautiful?

637
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,334
This is such an unexpected sight.

638
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,130
You underneath the streetlamp.

639
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,301
Who are you to judge?

640
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,970
I would have never imagined.

641
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,642
But even if I did,

642
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,686
my most beautiful imagination

643
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,731
would've never compared
to what I'm seeing right now.

644
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,404
I'm truly happy that I could witness this.

645
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,367
Me too.

646
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,203
I have

647
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,332
a new goal.

648
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,042
You need my cooperation again?

649
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,588
You can stay where you are.

650
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,091
I'm going to keep some distance

651
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,136
so that I can always see you.

652
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,264
If I'm too far, I can't see you.

653
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,849
If I'm too close,

654
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,561
you'll block my field of vision.

655
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,105
So I do need to cooperate.

656
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,537
Why isn't she picking up?

657
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,498
Pick up, please.

658
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,169
Where are you?

659
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,213
<i>Me? I'm home, working.</i>

660
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,257
Don't you know who's here?

661
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,218
<i>Code Name Candy.</i>

662
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,594
Hurry over.

663
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,725
Goodness. Could you wait a bit longer?

664
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,478
Sure. I'm the one who came unannounced.

665
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,064
May I sit down?

666
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,817
I was too out of it
and forgot to offer you a seat.

667
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,819
-Please.
-Here?

668
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,410
Thank you for the snacks.

669
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,912
If you're bored,

670
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,455
could you sign a poster for me?

671
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,707
Sure. As many as you'd like.

672
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,917
Thank you.

673
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,965
Why are you dressed like that?

674
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,259
I had no time to put on makeup.

675
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,052
-Do I look weird?
-You look suspicious.

676
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,304
Take them off unless you've had surgery.

677
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,432
You're right.
Should I just say that I did?

678
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,517
Choose either the hat or the glasses.

679
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,060
No, I didn't wash my hair.

680
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,982
You're her fan. She's going to adore you.

681
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:43,941
Go on.

682
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,117
I've been thinking hard.

683
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,703
"Fair as milk," right?
From that film festival.

684
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,582
Yes, you're right. I can't believe it.

685
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,210
This is unbelievable.
You're truly fair as milk these days.

686
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,005
I was so proud of myself for remembering.

687
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,882
Oh, Ji-woo.

688
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,635
I thought you'd bring up some other topic,

689
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,928
so I was quite tense.

690
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,264
Why would you be tense
about chatting with me?

691
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,016
Do I make you nervous?

692
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,352
That too.

693
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,606
And I thought you knew before coming here.

694
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,274
Of course, I did.

695
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,944
Tae-ri told me that thanks to Director Han

696
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,864
and your subtitles, she went abroad

697
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,783
and walked down the red carpet
numerous times.

698
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,288
She's so kind to have said that.

699
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,624
We're in the same agency.

700
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,251
At times, she feels even closer
than my own family.

701
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,336
I see.

702
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,925
When will you send the coffee truck?

703
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,719
Can I do that?

704
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,388
Of course. You and Seon-gyeom
should send one.

705
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,394
I'm not sure if he can chip in
since he's jobless right now.

706
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,563
He's not jobless.

707
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,649
Then?

708
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,067
Haven't you heard?

709
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,362
No.

710
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,155
He's--

711
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,575
I'm nervous right now,
so I forgot the word.

712
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:21,205
He's-- What was that word again?
It was Jerry Maguire's job.

713
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,333
You know-- Oh, God.
This is driving me crazy.

714
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,417
Gosh.

715
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,920
Oh, an agent.

716
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,965
Gosh, I'm so stupid.

717
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,557
TO: OH MI-JOO
BE HEALTHY

718
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,268
I don't need any snacks with my drinks.

719
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,602
This feels so fulfilling.

720
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,229
What did she say?

721
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,274
Ms. Yook didn't ask you
to break up with him too, did she?

722
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,901
No, she just thanked me
for subtitling her movie

723
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,112
and said she liked going abroad as well.

724
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,449
We didn't talk for that long,
but it was evident that

725
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,034
they're mother and son for sure.

726
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,327
Haven't you heard?

727
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,746
No.

728
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,792
For a brief moment,
she reminded me of Seon-gyeom.

729
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,588
Since you've seen Candy in real life,
I'll expect you to be more efficient.

730
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,298
Of course. Cheers.

731
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,926
Cheers to our honey's love life.

732
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,221
You haven't dated in a while.

733
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,889
We're not dating.

734
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,517
Ji-hyun is just following me around.

735
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,436
He is? Why?

736
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,439
Do you really not know?

737
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,274
No.

738
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,360
You still don't know? Let's break up.

739
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,445
No.

740
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,613
That's so awful.

741
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,697
Honey.

742
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,657
You acting cute is just terrible.

743
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,943
They all ran away.

744
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,779
Where will you go now?

745
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,448
I don't know.

746
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,743
This place wasn't bad.
I was at least fed once a day.

747
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,497
It wasn't bad?
They treated me like I was homeless.

748
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,124
We are homeless.

749
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,209
Right.

750
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,386
You know how to kill people?

751
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,429
She must be experienced.

752
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,890
I killed them before they could get to me.

753
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,019
What will you two do now?

754
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,606
We'll find a similar place
or starve to death on the streets.

755
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:57,027
Nothing changes the fact
that we've been abandoned.

756
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,488
Then would you like to join me?

757
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,328
I'll give you everything

758
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,789
you've ever wanted but never got.

759
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,082
-For example?
-For example?

760
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,626
Let's see.

761
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,837
They always need time to think.

762
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,630
-Don't scammers do that?
-Yes.

763
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,299
First, since I now have two daughters,

764
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,593
why don't you call me Mom?

765
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,564
I could see a sequel
coming out in the future.

766
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,607
This is a cliffhanger.

767
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,742
Did you stay up all night?

768
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,829
May, I think <i>Code Name Candy</i>
will have a sequel.

769
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,040
In the final scene, Candy finds some kids
that she needs to protect.

770
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,752
Why are you spoiling it? I'll kill you.

771
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,173
In the sequel, she needs to strive

772
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,966
to protect what's dear to her.

773
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,968
A sequel is a must.

774
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,804
This movie hasn't even been released.
I hate you.

775
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,514
I'm sorry.

776
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,185
Did you read the news?

777
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,895
-About what?
-You probably didn't.

778
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,773
KI EUN-BI AND ASSEMBLYMAN NO'S AFFAIR

779
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,524
-Gosh.
-Is this true?

780
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,195
Probably not. It seemed like
she was dating someone younger than her.

781
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,238
People have gone berserk.

782
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,492
Why are you so emotional?

783
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,411
This is linked to Ji-hyun's workplace.

784
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,038
Isn't she in their agency?

785
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,790
You're right.

786
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,875
You're so thoughtful.

787
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,128
I just remembered
that she was Seon-gyeom's sister.

788
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,882
Thanks to what you've done to him,

789
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,676
he's now about to ruin
my daughter's reputation.

790
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,182
It can't be.

791
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,060
No, right?

792
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,063
Poor Ji-hyun.
He'll probably work overtime today.

793
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,941
I should call off our date first.

794
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,951
Seon-gyeom, where are you?

795
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,455
Do you want to come over when you're done?

796
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,334
Okay, see you. Bye.

797
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,712
Gosh.

798
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,051
I should be of help
since we've exchanged numbers.

799
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,470
<i>Ms. Ki, this is Oh Mi-joo.</i>

800
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,890
<i>If you ever need to talk,</i>
<i>feel free to come over anytime.</i>

801
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,351
<i>No one will suspect that you'd be here.</i>

802
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,689
Okay. I'll call you back later.

803
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,485
Didn't I say that
we should ask her ourselves?

804
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,279
Mr. Jeong, where's Eun-bi?

805
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,738
<i>She's not at the hotel.</i>

806
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,448
<i>I'm on my way to her parents'.</i>

807
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,825
Okay.

808
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,828
For today, let's tell them
that we're waiting for her reply.

809
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,372
If we still can't reach her tomorrow,

810
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,040
we'll claim that it's groundless.

811
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,335
I will request an exorcism this year.

812
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,837
At all costs.

813
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,387
-Hi, Mom.
<i>-Did you read the news about Eun-bi?</i>

814
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,306
What news?

815
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,641
Don't ask any questions.

816
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,560
Just go and comfort her.

817
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,979
I'm currently out of town due to filming.

818
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,650
If you weren't,
would you have gone yourself?

819
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,321
You sure know how to make me feel guilty.

820
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,907
No, I still wouldn't have been able to go.

821
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,867
I need to film

822
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,037
and memorize my English lines
for the audition in Hollywood.

823
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,789
Take good care of yourself.

824
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,708
You have such a busy schedule.

825
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,337
Am I being too selfish?

826
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,590
She must be troubled
by that ridiculous article.

827
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,760
And yet, I'm still here.

828
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,386
If you were to leave,

829
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,348
your fans would be disappointed in you.

830
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,562
PRESIDENT SEO DAN-AH

831
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,733
I'm sorry.
We kind of have an issue right now.

832
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,485
Don't worry. It's okay.

833
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,862
Is it because of Eun-bi?

834
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,490
So you know.

835
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,701
Don't worry too much.
It's our concern anyway.

836
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,871
I'm afraid Ms. Seo is still
having a meeting outside

837
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,914
and will be late.

838
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,958
I'm not here to see her.

839
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,210
Then why are you here?

840
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,463
As soon as I greeted you,
you told me to wait here.

841
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,549
How silly of me.

842
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,511
I automatically thought
that you were here to see her.

843
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,057
You don't look too well. Are you okay?

844
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,018
No. I've been bombarded
with a lot of bad news.

845
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,105
So why are you here?

846
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,442
I'm here to apply for that position.

847
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,488
You offered me the position,
so I thought I should submit it myself.

848
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,368
This is quite thick.

849
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,373
-You must've put in a lot of effort.
-Yes, I put my heart into it.

850
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,792
I'll take a thorough look.

851
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,920
You should work. I'll go now.

852
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,880
I hope to see you during the interview.

853
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,800
Hello?

854
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,845
Of course, it's not true.

855
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,308
Did you read the news?

856
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,227
Yes, on my way here.

857
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,731
I can't reach her either.

858
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,400
About those photos--

859
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:33,238
Eun-bi was the one who let me in on it.

860
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,785
You two met?

861
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,246
She visited me.

862
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,500
She probably wanted to warn me in advance.

863
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,256
She must have liked you a lot.

864
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,550
I'm honored.

865
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,553
According to what she told me,

866
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,474
it seemed like your father kept an eye
on his family members

867
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,810
and even had files on you.

868
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,980
Is this true?

869
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,319
I'd say there's a possibility.

870
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,201
I'm not sure
if I understood him correctly.

871
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,662
He could have just said it out of spite,

872
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,373
but what he said bothered me quite a bit.

873
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,838
She must be here.

874
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,799
Who?

875
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,220
I wanted you guys to talk in a safe space.

876
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,186
Ryan won't pick up my calls.

877
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,106
You've always found him no matter what.

878
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,610
I'm scared that he'll stop running away
and just break up with me.

879
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,405
-Would you like some more water?
-Yes, please.

880
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,242
Thank you for inviting me over.

881
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,161
I have no one to talk to
since I have no friends.

882
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,998
Since you invited me,
I decided to come here brazenly.

883
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,585
-Would you like some alcohol?
-I don't drink.

884
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,754
I don't think I'll be able to stop myself.

885
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,554
I did have tea with him.

886
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,806
But we were waiting for my father.

887
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,016
Am I truly innocent?

888
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,310
Will he trust me?

889
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,062
I can't live without him.

890
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,649
-You've lived well without him.
-You're wrong.

891
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,568
Did you know him since you were a baby?

892
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,863
You should be completely honest with him.

893
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,407
He must feel the same way
you're feeling right now.

894
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,201
How can I be honest with him
when he won't even pick up?

895
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,496
You could text or email him.

896
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,958
I didn't think of that.

897
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,459
It never crossed my mind.

898
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,671
What if this affects Father's election?

899
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,673
At a time like this,

900
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,342
you should put yourself first.

901
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,471
Let's be selfish for once.

902
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,059
You've changed a lot.

903
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,063
I should tell him myself
that it's not true, right?

904
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,901
Oh, dear.

905
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:17,986
Should I tag along?

906
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,114
And make things worse?

907
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,992
Thank you for the water.

908
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,953
Don't worry too much.

909
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,830
Swing by if it's too much to handle.

910
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,207
I'm always home.

911
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,751
Thank you.

912
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,337
<i>It's not true.</i>

913
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,757
I would never cheat on my boyfriend,
let alone with a married man.

914
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,509
Of course.

915
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,137
If I don't trust my own daughter,
who will?

916
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:50,977
You are more-- No, a million times
more famous than that nobody.

917
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,397
This was the best way for him
to make himself known.

918
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,568
Trust me. I'll take care of everything.

919
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,862
Okay.

920
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,533
Right, I should stop by my agency.

921
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,701
I'm sure it's chaotic.

922
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,495
Yes, you should.

923
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,414
Focus on training.
This is a crucial time for you.

924
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,626
All right. I'm sorry.

925
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,629
I feel like I dragged you into this.

926
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,298
Don't say that.

927
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,968
Thank you for believing me.

928
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,935
Did you get in touch with her?

929
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,687
We've given our reply for now.

930
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,564
Once the dust settles,
we should make a formal announcement.

931
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,360
How dare they call my athlete
a gold digger?

932
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,739
Do they seriously want to call someone
as successful as her a gold digger?

933
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:48,910
We're collecting the malicious posts.
We'll do everything we can

934
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,537
to see that they're punished.

935
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,873
She must be troubled as well.
Let's wait until tomorrow.

936
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,502
Check with Seon-gyeom just in case.

937
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,588
She must have talked to him
since he's her brother.

938
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,300
I'll try to find her myself.

939
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,093
Yes, ma'am.

940
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:24,112
I wish you weren't too invested, sir.

941
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,114
You're tormenting yourself.

942
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,617
This is my fate.

943
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,244
I should give it my all

944
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,706
no matter how big or small the matter is.

945
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,293
Should I rearrange your schedule?

946
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,919
You're barely sleeping these days.

947
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,631
Say that once I even have
enough time to sleep.

948
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,426
At times I feel

949
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,554
that this is too much for me to take.

950
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,681
I'm tired of forcing myself to smile.

951
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,393
My body just can't take it anymore.

952
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,833
Ms. Seo, good shot.

953
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,961
How did you find me?

954
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,843
I thought you'd be training
amid all this drama.

955
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,095
Is the scandal true?

956
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,722
What do you think?

957
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,851
We dealt with this issue once before
but here it is again.

958
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,811
My father wants me to be patient.

959
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,020
He'll take care of it.

960
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,315
I'm sure our agency doesn't need
to listen to him.

961
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,985
Or is he your agent?

962
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,532
I'm happy as long as you're okay.

963
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,118
Don't tell me

964
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,121
you came because you were worried.

965
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,581
I just came to golf.

966
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,755
She didn't go easy on me even once

967
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,507
although I'm not even an athlete.

968
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,677
Are you sure about that?

969
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,761
I see.

970
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,018
<i>I'm done with the painting.</i>
<i>Come take a look.</i>

971
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,270
<i>I'm really done this time.</i>

972
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,857
This hat totally ruined my hairstyle.

973
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,318
Would I still look beautiful?

974
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,156
I'll bring out the hair styler
from the car.

975
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,556
If he's lying again,

976
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,892
I don't think I'll let him live.

977
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,106
Should I bring this just in case?

978
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,817
Wouldn't this hurt?

979
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,374
What? What's that in your hand?

980
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,752
-I brought it just in case.
-I see.

981
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,214
All right. It's finally done.

982
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,050
Here we go. You can look forward to it.

983
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,971
One, two,

984
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,473
three. Ta-da.

985
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,378
It's

986
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,715
very noisy.

987
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,680
You hear noises?

988
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,309
Has technology advanced that much?

989
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,186
You're still too young to hide it.

990
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,189
Students tend to vividly reflect

991
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,775
their feelings or disposition
in their drawings.

992
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,615
You must have met many students.

993
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,367
That's just a theory.

994
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,833
This is just screaming, "I love you."

995
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,381
I love you, Ms. Seo.

996
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,723
You're right. That's what I felt
while working on this piece.

997
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,774
"Piece"?

998
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,318
Don't they usually say "work"?

999
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,237
I want to call this one a piece.

1000
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,949
But then again, it should be called so
only after I die.

1001
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,951
Until then, this is just a work of mine.

1002
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,915
I'd love to see your piece.

1003
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,753
You're not telling me to die, are you?

1004
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:18,007
You should live a long life.
You're too young to say such a thing.

1005
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,595
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

1006
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,557
How could I display this
at an art museum? It's embarrassing.

1007
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,355
I have no choice
but to keep it for myself.

1008
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,529
-I need to take this.
-Sure.

1009
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:40,822
Yes, Mr. Jeong.

1010
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,326
What?

1011
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,662
What did you say?

1012
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,048
Wait.

1013
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,885
Are you serious?

1014
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,895
Okay. I'm on my way.

1015
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,153
What's wrong?

1016
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,489
Did something happen at work?

1017
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,034
Or do you feel dizzy again?

1018
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,623
-Ms. Seo.
-Yes?

1019
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,419
Oh, it's related to work.

1020
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,255
I should go.

1021
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,277
Are you sure you can drive?

1022
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,113
Yes. I'm the only one here who can.

1023
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,782
Go back inside. It's cold.

1024
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,663
You'll call me,

1025
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,166
right?

1026
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,094
Not all children

1027
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,182
mourn the death of their parents.

1028
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,812
And not all parents

1029
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,981
love their children unconditionally.

1030
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:45,780
Yeong-hwa.

1031
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,407
Yes?

1032
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,119
You should live a long life.

1033
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,501
They say geniuses die early.
