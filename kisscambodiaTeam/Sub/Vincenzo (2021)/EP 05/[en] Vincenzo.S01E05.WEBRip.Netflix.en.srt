1
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,283
Who the hell would do that?

2
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,994
They are investigating now.
So we should wait.

3
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,330
It must have done some damage to Babel.

4
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:06,000
That's an understatement.
It's as bad as getting hit by a tsunami.

5
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,877
What are we going to do?

6
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,255
Okay. I got it. See you tomorrow.

7
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,425
What the hell is this?

8
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,647
Please give me one more chance
to get even.

9
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,648
I'll find them

10
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,608
and destroy them to pieces.

11
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,780
And just how will you find them?

12
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,116
Don't get ahead of yourself.

13
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,244
Just do what I tell you to do. Okay?

14
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,080
I know I can do something here!

15
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,040
Don't raise your voice.

16
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,084
You startled me.

17
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,252
I mean…

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,007
-Han-seo.
-Sir.

19
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,137
Have you lost your mind

20
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,598
now that people call you the chairman?

21
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,267
No, that's not it. Sir.

22
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,479
Sir…

23
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,024
You're nothing but a puppet of mine.

24
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,901
Yes.

25
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:17,030
So don't you dare think for yourself.

26
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,744
Yes, I got it. Yes, sir.

27
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,301
The cause today's fire will be
electrical overheating, not arson.

28
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,511
But it will still affect the stock prices,

29
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,681
so get the board members
for an emergency meeting.

30
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,226
Oh, right.

31
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,895
And tell Wusang what I told you earlier.

32
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,941
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,526
Han-seo, go home now.

34
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm glad I'm just a puppet.

35
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,690
I can just cut off the strings.

36
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,823
EPISODE 5

37
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,074
Cheers.

38
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,249
I'm glad that you're getting started.

39
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,627
They'll catch on to us if we keep blasting
fireworks like we did today.

40
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,629
That's why we need to change our approach.

41
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,590
We'll use the law and the court,
the two things we know best.

42
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,968
They'll be better at that than we are.

43
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,055
We need to beat them at their own game
to make victory taste sweeter.

44
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,436
But Mr. Cassano.

45
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,438
You can't practice law in Korea.

46
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,731
But I have you.

47
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,943
Are you trying to make me
take the heat in your place?

48
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,903
So that I go down alone?

49
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,156
I'll be the one putting the heat on them.

50
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,325
Let's focus on our next step for now.

51
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,126
Shall I guess what your next step is?

52
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,093
Since when could you read my mind?

53
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,804
I can't do that. I'm not a psychic.

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,349
I'm the person who knows
Babel's dirty little secrets

55
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,685
more than anyone else in Korea.

56
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,897
Well, then…

57
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,524
let's see what you've got.

58
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,616
Babel's most vulnerable subsidiary.

59
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,452
The subsidiary that rigs
the stock prices the most.

60
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,039
And the subsidiary whose ethics
will be damaged at the greatest degree.

61
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,625
Which subsidiary is it?

62
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,758
THE ALCHEMISTS OF FUTURE SCIENCE

63
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,801
BABEL CHEMICALS

64
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:42,819
BABEL CHEMICALS

65
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,701
-Hey.
-What?

66
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,954
Be honest.
You don't do all 108 bows, right?

67
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,874
I bet you skip a few.

68
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,668
I don't skip anything.

69
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,628
What do you take me for? Seriously.

70
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,798
I bet you eat sausages
behind his back. Right?

71
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,341
Pork belly and green onions too.

72
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,551
Shut your mouth, jerk.

73
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,597
Shut it, man. Help me, merciful Buddha.

74
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,432
Can't we eat out next time?

75
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,811
I come here once a month.
We always eat vegetables.

76
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,355
-Hey, your nose is bleeding.
-Darn it.

77
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,734
Hey, are you okay?

78
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,281
You've lost a lot of weight
and even have nosebleeds.

79
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,032
Hey, I'm good.

80
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,742
Seriously.

81
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,247
We used to run all over the place
15 years ago, right?

82
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,790
Right.

83
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,544
Back then, you were no match for me.

84
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,838
Look how far you've come.

85
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,132
Stop kidding me.

86
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,634
You couldn't even look me in the eye.

87
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,262
Look at you. I should teach you a lesson.

88
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,182
-You're bringing out the old me.
-You're ridiculous. Come on.

89
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,310
I ought to… Don't swear.

90
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,881
Watch it. It's heavy.

91
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,761
You should be careful.

92
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,014
Aren't you

93
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:35,973
Mr. Jang Han-seo?

94
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:37,934
Yes.

95
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,437
No, let me do that for you.

96
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,356
This is incredible. Amazing.

97
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,983
I'm a huge fan of yours.

98
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,653
Can I get a handshake?

99
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,530
-Sure.
-Thank you.

100
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,115
Here. Have this.

101
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,701
-Thanks.
-Sure.

102
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,953
You work out here.

103
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,039
In one of your interviews,

104
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,959
you said nothing is impossible for Babel.

105
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,212
I became a fan after reading how daring
your corporate philosophy is.

106
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,505
Sorry about that.

107
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,841
Innovation and business go hand in hand.

108
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,930
"Creative destruction. Innovation is
the driving force of economic growth."

109
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,890
Were you influenced by George Soros?

110
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,849
What?

111
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,523
Soros. I have so much respect for him.

112
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,652
I knew it. When I studied
your investments in your subsidiaries,

113
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,571
you seemed flexible dealing with them.

114
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,949
-You were influenced by Joseph Schumpeter?
-Right. Joseph…

115
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,910
That's right.
I read his books. You know a lot.

116
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,620
Gosh, you're so smart.

117
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh, right. Yesterday… Let me help you.

118
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,960
I saw the news about the fire
at Babel Pharmaceuticals yesterday.

119
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,420
How could that happen?

120
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,379
I'm so sorry.

121
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,048
It was just a minor accident.

122
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,011
By the way,

123
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,888
I'm not sure if I should say this.

124
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,517
I read in the tabloid
that it was actually arson.

125
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,563
Who said that?
Don't believe what you read in tabloids.

126
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,065
I guess you don't know
about these tabloids.

127
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,817
Sometimes, they are right.

128
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,569
-Hey.
-By the way,

129
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,114
-I own Babel Pharmaceuticals' shares.
-Leave.

130
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,243
Please. Please go if you're done.
I need to work out.

131
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,579
Right. Sorry I got in the way.

132
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,874
Then I will
go and sell my shares of Babel.

133
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,127
-They're worth nothing. Awful.
-Hey.

134
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,796
This is mine.

135
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,883
What was that?

136
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,511
Come on.
What are they writing in that tabloid?

137
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,474
You're not the boss.

138
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,936
The stock price of Babel Pharmaceuticals
took another sharp dive.

139
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,024
Amid speculations that the fire last night
at the storage room

140
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,361
was in fact an arson,
the stocks plummeted.

141
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,697
Aren't you happy that I'm gone?
No one is nagging you now.

142
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,034
I've missed you
since the day you left the firm.

143
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,869
I even miss your nagging.

144
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,043
Wait until you make partner.
You won't have time for this.

145
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,880
Did you watch the news
about the fire at Babel Pharmaceuticals?

146
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,008
Of course, I did. My goodness.

147
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,510
All the materials burnt down.

148
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,054
Maybe they had it coming.

149
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,390
They did all sorts of evil things.

150
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,433
I think so, too.

151
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,104
It's like retributive justice. Right?

152
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,063
That's right.

153
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,818
I'm having a muscle spasm.

154
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,654
My gosh. I'll call you back.

155
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,156
Cha-young. Bye.

156
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,254
So you were the one who punished me.

157
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,475
I told you where Chairman Jang would be,

158
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,977
so you're buying.

159
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,691
That's the perfect reward
for the quality of your intel.

160
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,695
Why did you go see him?

161
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,323
Facing the boss of the enemy
before starting a fight

162
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,992
puts me at ease.

163
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,953
That's a weird way
to find peace with yourself.

164
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,164
So what did you think?

165
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,416
Chairman Jang…

166
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,710
might not be the real boss.

167
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,881
I switched quotes from
George Soros and Joseph Schumpeter,

168
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,091
but he didn't catch it.

169
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,178
No wonder. He did look like an airhead.

170
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,765
If he isn't,
then who could be the real chairman?

171
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,894
Usually, when there's war
between the Mafia,

172
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,272
it's customary to let each other know
who the boss is.

173
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,525
That way, you can set up a meeting
between the bosses

174
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,195
to resolve things diplomatically.

175
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,201
And the surest way to draw out
the real boss behind the puppet is…

176
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,162
To destroy the puppet.

177
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,040
You know a lot about the Mafia.

178
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,543
I told you.
People here are just as bad as the Mafia.

179
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,297
Anyway, to find out
if Chairman Jang is a puppet or not,

180
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,591
I'll make him dry up

181
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,968
like a wet wipe out in the open.

182
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,973
Do you think I'll listen to you?

183
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,060
That's up to you.

184
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,063
But you should remember
that freedom comes with a price.

185
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,108
ATTORNEY CHOI MYUNG-HEE

186
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,653
He's clean. He's very clean.

187
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,407
You know the lawyer from Italy?
The one with Cha-young?

188
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,700
Vincenzo Cassano.

189
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,452
His name is Vincenzo Cassano?

190
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,790
Yes. I talked to someone
from the Italian Lawyer Association.

191
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,917
His record is perfectly clean.

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,418
Is this your first rodeo?

193
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,380
A spotless record means something is up.

194
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,965
I knew you'd say that.

195
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,927
So I already talked to my guy at the NIS
to take a look at his background.

196
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,933
No. Something is iffy about him.

197
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,352
No, I said he's clean.

198
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,772
Just because he's from Italy,
he's a member of the Mafia or something?

199
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,482
I bet he was just a regular lawyer.

200
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,442
Where are you going?

201
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,487
To see what this Vincenzo Cassano guy
looks like.

202
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,155
Goodness.

203
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,659
You can never be at ease
until you see them in person, do you?

204
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,415
Is anyone here?

205
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,340
Is Ms. Hong Cha-young here?

206
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,385
I'm sorry. She's not here right now.

207
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,599
Are you Mr. Vincenzo Cassano?

208
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,652
SANGCHEON OPTICIAN'S

209
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,406
Who am I speaking to?

210
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,366
Oh, right. I am…

211
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,203
My name is Choi Myung-hee
from Law Firm Wusang.

212
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,291
I heard a lot about you.

213
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,168
I'm Vincenzo

214
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,295
Cassano.

215
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,839
That's my name.

216
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,883
What is this? He sounds like a drunk.

217
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,427
What an ugly face.

218
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,848
Greasy hair and aimless eyes.

219
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,059
Gray skin…

220
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,978
and the awkwardly protruding mouth.

221
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,188
You're not Vincenzo.

222
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,023
Yes, I am.

223
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,149
Goodness!

224
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,568
How dare you lie to me?

225
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,445
Take it.

226
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,659
No. It's obvious
that I'm Vincenzo Cassano.

227
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,752
Do that again and I'll rip your mouth
in every direction, you asshole.

228
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,597
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

229
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,976
How creative of them, those assholes.

230
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,618
He must be Vincenzo.

231
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,954
Seriously.

232
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,292
When you threatened her,
did you alter your voice?

233
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,752
No.

234
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,047
It's been a while.

235
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,178
What brings you to this humble building?

236
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,513
I was in the neighborhood.

237
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,765
Is this…

238
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,643
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano?

239
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,856
This is Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

240
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,567
He can't speak today
because his tonsils are swollen.

241
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm Choi Myung-hee from Wusang.

242
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,329
This is our first time meeting, right?

243
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,966
Tell us why you're here.

244
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,509
Come on.

245
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,597
That's no way to treat your guest.
Offer me some tea, and we'll talk.

246
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,905
Did you think you could fool me?

247
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,157
Why would you impersonate him?

248
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,534
I actually enjoy cosplays.

249
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,538
Today, I dressed up as Vincenzo Cassano.

250
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,123
Never do that again.

251
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,876
Please spare me some time

252
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,172
Is he serious? What's your name?

253
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,049
Vincenzo.

254
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,137
Now that we served you some warm tea,

255
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,056
tell us why you're here.

256
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,102
This hits the spot.

257
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,440
You run your own law firm now.
I'm here to share a few words of blessing.

258
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,318
I got that plant over there.

259
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,904
That's called a "stuckyi."

260
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,573
I hear it survives well no matter what.

261
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,034
You don't have to water it often.
Won't that be easy?

262
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,665
Anyway, I wanted your law firm
to last long like that plant.

263
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,959
And what should you do to last long?

264
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,295
You shouldn't act recklessly or foolishly.

265
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,674
Just lie low
and be as silent as the grave.

266
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,554
Thank you for your tip on survival.

267
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,934
You, too, Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

268
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,394
Did you understand that?

269
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,896
I'm still older than you.

270
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,731
Shouldn't you at least answer me?

271
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,777
All right. Enough of that.

272
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,114
Let's have a brief conversation. Okay?

273
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,827
Okay.

274
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,454
I couldn't hear you. Say that again.

275
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,710
Okay.

276
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,799
All right, then. I won't see you off.

277
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,092
Goodbye.

278
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,183
Sure. I should leave
when I'm asked to leave.

279
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,728
I'm off.

280
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,900
Gosh, it's hot.

281
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,488
Mr. Nam.

282
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,699
I need some napkins.

283
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,326
It's hot.

284
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,332
This is confusing.

285
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,085
There's no way he's a bozo like that.

286
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,972
I will try to handle what you asked
as soon as possible.

287
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,475
Okay. Have a good day.

288
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,976
Thank you. Bye.

289
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,561
Farewell, Sir.

290
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
Joon-woo.

291
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,863
I told you to stop calling me that.

292
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,073
When did you…

293
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,993
Your boss needs to see you in his office.

294
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,962
This is so frustrating.

295
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,010
As of today, you are officially…

296
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,055
a partner at Wusang.

297
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,181
What?

298
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,684
Yes. You. That's right. You.

299
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,855
Gosh. But why you? Who the heck are you?

300
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,607
-Pardon?
-Never mind.

301
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,986
We should negotiate your annual salary.

302
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,239
Do that with the director.
Do you need your own office?

303
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,701
You should get one. You like Cha-young.
Take her office.

304
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,953
What? How could I…

305
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,915
You find it weird too, right?
I'm very unhappy right now.

306
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,334
But I've got no choice. He…

307
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,254
Just work hard.

308
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,089
-Okay.
-Back to work.

309
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,215
-Okay.
-Get out!

310
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,342
Okay. I'm leaving.

311
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,053
That fool.

312
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,890
Why does Chairman Jang want me
to promote a fool like him?

313
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,228
Is Joon-woo a relative of his?

314
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,451
BRING DESTRUCTION TO BABEL CHEMICALS

315
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,744
Let me begin.

316
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,580
There are 42 victims in total.

317
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,457
And nine of them are dead.

318
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,876
They all had blood-related diseases.

319
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,378
All the victims died from leukemia.

320
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,507
The report said it was caused by BLSD.
What is that?

321
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,176
Well, that's…

322
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,470
Damn it.

323
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,098
Why did you make it look so tacky?

324
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,558
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,727
I just like vivid colors.

326
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,902
It's a chemical expected to revolutionize
the next-gen display panels.

327
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,405
But its manufacture was banned in the US
because of its toxicity.

328
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,451
It's just like RDU-90.
It shouldn't be used on people.

329
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,787
That proves how heinous they are.

330
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,457
Next, it's the lawyer representing
the victims in the Babel lawsuit.

331
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,001
What the heck?

332
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,628
I thought he was a ghost.

333
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,545
Sorry.

334
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,715
I'm not particularly good at taking
screenshots of the interview.

335
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,053
This is So Hyeon-u,
who represents the victims.

336
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,181
Also known as "Stinking So."
He's one dirty lawyer.

337
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,307
Let me tell you this

338
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,560
as a lawyer who specializes
in industrial accident suits.

339
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,604
You must settle with the company.

340
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,733
When you file an industrial accident
lawsuit against a conglomerate,

341
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,652
the more time you waste,

342
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,362
you will receive less settlement…

343
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,697
They filed the lawsuit two months ago.

344
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,407
The first hearing is in five days,

345
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,244
but he keeps recommending them to settle.

346
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,996
Recommending to settle
isn't against the law.

347
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,082
Of course not.

348
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,960
But what if he is already in on it
with Wusang

349
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,921
in trying to persuade
the victims' families?

350
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,715
-Where's your proof?
-It came from my informant,

351
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,716
so I can't tell you.

352
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,135
I bet it's not that reliable.

353
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,262
You seem to occasionally look down on me.

354
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,930
That's your thing, right?

355
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,265
But you will

356
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,975
-tell me, right?
-No.

357
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,977
And the hospital?

358
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,647
It says here that
the hospital belongs to Babel.

359
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,941
That's right. Before Haemun became Babel,

360
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,318
Jang Han-seo's father,
Jang Guk-han, founded it.

361
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,238
Director Gil Jong-Moon
of Haemun Medical Center.

362
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,907
He's also the chief
of the Hemato-oncology Department.

363
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,035
Are you sure you have
nothing to do with Babel Chemicals?

364
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,121
We have nothing to do with them.

365
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,208
He fabricated the diagnosis
to quash the insurance lawsuit.

366
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,296
He's a quack who doesn't give a shit
about the oath he made.

367
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,213
And the press?

368
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,341
Make sure Babel stands out
in the articles.

369
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,468
Director Chun Il-su of Daechang Daily.

370
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,887
HOW BABEL CONTRIBUTED TO SOCIETY

371
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,224
He sucks up to Babel
to get more advertisers on his paper.

372
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,642
They're trashy reporters.

373
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,352
Make it look believable!

374
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,772
When researchers
cough up blood and collapse,

375
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,649
they publish articles like this.

376
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,527
They are quite the assholes, aren't they?

377
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,154
BABEL REWARDS RESEARCHERS
FOR WORK ON BLSD

378
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,490
Evil conglomerate, quack doctors,
trashy reporters,

379
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,783
and lowlife lawyers.

380
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,287
They're the whole package.
No one can beat them.

381
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,123
Of course, except for me.

382
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,875
We should represent the victims.

383
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,297
There are only five days left
until the trial.

384
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,715
Even if we represent them,

385
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,717
the trial will be tough.

386
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,968
He has a point.

387
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,222
If we go to trial unprepared like this,
we'll be crushed.

388
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,558
I bet whatever evidence
that crooked lawyer submitted

389
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,684
would be insufficient.

390
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,102
We'll think about that later.

391
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,272
Even if you try to persuade him,
I doubt he'll give in that easily.

392
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,983
-I don't need to do that.
-Then, what?

393
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,285
So, you're saying

394
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,830
that I should resign from
representing my clients?

395
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,332
Why would I?

396
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,835
I heard the only thing you're doing
is recommending them to settle.

397
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,755
That's because
the victims' families are in bad shape.

398
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:52,008
Beware of the first person
who recommends to settle.

399
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,677
-That person is…
-A traitor.

400
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,430
A traitor who offers to settle

401
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,057
is strangled to death in movies.

402
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,767
Attacked from behind.

403
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,894
Well…

404
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,313
I wanted to fight at first.

405
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,524
But I realized it'd be in vain.

406
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,235
You should have at least pretended
to throw a punch

407
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,154
before recommending them to settle.
You have no conscience.

408
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,366
Only a vulgar law broker would do
something like this, not a lawyer.

409
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,993
Or a piece of trash.

410
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,998
Let me explain. Okay?

411
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,833
I have to grasp the situation quickly,

412
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,502
so I can get a better deal
for the victims.

413
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,090
Didn't you make that decision
to help yourself, not to help the victims?

414
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,675
To help myself?

415
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,095
My goodness. What do you take me for?

416
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,098
Hey, here's a thing about me.

417
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,102
I always fight for my clients.
I fight on their behalf,

418
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,771
only thinking about how to do
what's best for them.

419
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,148
That's all I have in mind.

420
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,358
I haven't slept since I took this case.

421
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,652
Look at all the medicine I take.
How can you…

422
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,613
Do you know what
the only evil I can't condone is?

423
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,699
It's hypocrisy.

424
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,578
When a hypocrite repents,
even that is a lie.

425
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,621
I can't believe this!

426
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,914
Let me make this simple.

427
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:09,044
Send us a document that says you will
resign from this case by tomorrow.

428
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,253
Let's say I do that.

429
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,881
Do you think my clients will accept that?

430
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,633
You have no idea
how much the families trust me.

431
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,094
That's none of my business.
Just send the document.

432
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,555
And make sure you pay the courier.

433
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,267
What if I can't do that?

434
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,271
I plan to send you to a deserted place.

435
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,899
A place where people can't hear you

436
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,069
whatever you yap about.

437
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,446
Go ahead. Do it.

438
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,908
Don't you think
I can see right through you?

439
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,326
Look at these assholes.

440
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,622
You're threatening me to steal my case
to make some money.

441
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,834
Yes, we are threatening you,
but that's not why.

442
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,670
Our goal is to keep fighting.

443
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,464
And to win, of course.

444
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,968
You should clean your office.

445
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,932
LAWYER SO HYEON-U

446
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,078
Why aren't you eating?

447
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,294
If you don't want to eat it,
give me a plan.

448
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:38,716
The stocks are plummeting
and the tabloids are saying it was arson.

449
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,345
How come you people
still haven't come up with a plan?

450
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,888
Why is that?

451
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,724
Hey, give me water.

452
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,434
Not until he finishes the bowl.

453
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,602
Water, my ass.

454
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,610
HIM

455
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,701
Yes, sir.

456
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,162
Are you torturing them
with spicy food again?

457
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,875
No, I'm not.

458
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,254
Is a high tolerance for spicy food
something to brag about?

459
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,466
I wasn't bragging.
I was just teaching them a lesson.

460
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,508
All they do is talk.

461
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,470
Stop fooling around and listen carefully.

462
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,811
Go to Babel Chemicals with a reporter
from Daechang Daily today.

463
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,814
And make it sound as if BLSD
is ready to hit the market.

464
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,107
-Got it?
-What?

465
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,237
But it's not ready yet. Can we do that?

466
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,989
Chairman Jang.

467
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,785
These conglomerates in Korea

468
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,412
are just like bodybuilders on steroids.

469
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,414
Whether it's a lie or an exaggeration,

470
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,708
a good appearance is all they care about.

471
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,212
Yes, sir. I got it.

472
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,923
Okay. Bye.

473
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,275
Damn it. This is so humiliating.

474
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,408
I told her to hold the ketchup.

475
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,457
There's too much.

476
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,921
You know, persuading the families
into firing Mr. So would've been easier.

477
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,174
That would be harder.
That's why I didn't go for it.

478
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,343
I've persuaded hundreds
of clients like them.

479
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,011
I only need five minutes.

480
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,264
Asking them to fight is like

481
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,307
dragging them into the pits of hell.

482
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,561
I wouldn't ask them to fight
like some soldiers.

483
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,521
I have my ways.

484
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,358
I can do it.

485
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,735
You want to bet on it?

486
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,153
Sure. Let's do that.

487
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,447
What should we bet?

488
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,742
-Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
-Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

489
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,581
A finger flick.

490
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,584
A finger flick?

491
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,461
This?

492
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,340
Yes. That.
A single finger flick with all your might.

493
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,175
We're not kids.

494
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,262
I don't hit women even if it's a game.

495
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,100
This isn't like that. It's a simple
punishment for losing the bet.

496
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,644
If I lose, I'll let you hit me.

497
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,645
No.

498
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,064
I plan to live by my principles.

499
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,527
Anyway, watch and learn.

500
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,079
THE TRUTH ABOUT BABEL CHEMICALS
WILL BE UNCOVERED

501
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,170
Everyone here…

502
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,963
The victims…

503
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,801
I'm only saying this
because you are like my family.

504
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,554
I will be your family and fight with you.

505
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,514
You cannot give up.

506
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,683
I'm sorry.

507
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,519
But we will see this through with Mr. So.

508
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,313
Please, listen to me.

509
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,565
Sister.

510
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,234
My brothers.

511
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,445
Big sister.

512
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,656
Can't you see I'm genuine?

513
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,159
Why do you keep telling us to start
a fight that we can't win?

514
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,703
After the Babel Pharmaceuticals' lawsuit,

515
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,288
we made up our decision for good.

516
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,624
We will not fight them.

517
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,919
Babel could've lost
if the victims' families held out longer.

518
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,713
We heard their lawyer died

519
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,217
because he coerced witnesses
to perjure in exchange for money.

520
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,434
What did you just say?

521
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,144
It was on the news.

522
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,646
Didn't you see it?

523
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,943
You know firsthand
how the news is full of lies,

524
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,737
and you still believe the news?

525
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,031
Why are you taking it out on us?

526
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,492
The lawyer who died
fighting Babel Pharmaceuticals

527
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,369
is my father.

528
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,914
Lawyer Hong Yu-chan.

529
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,420
Since my father couldn't beat them,
I shouldn't fight them, right?

530
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,171
Because I'll lose anyway.

531
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,008
But do you know why I want to fight?

532
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,885
Because we might be able to beat them
with a few more punches.

533
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,887
I can see that. That's why.

534
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,307
Gosh, I'm sorry to say this,
but it doesn't look that way to us.

535
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,727
Please trust me.

536
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,645
We can beat them.

537
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,523
We're signing
the settlement papers tomorrow.

538
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,567
We already made our decision.

539
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,361
Please, stop confusing us and leave.

540
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,239
I'm not confusing you.
I'm giving you hope.

541
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,783
Why won't you trust me? I can win this.

542
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,960
Testing. It's working now.

543
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,965
Do you know why you can't win?

544
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,551
Because you didn't have

545
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,803
lawyers like us.

546
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,265
Lawyers like us are used to winning,

547
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,477
don't get tired,
and never have any doubts.

548
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,021
If you turn us down,

549
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:29,525
you're basically throwing away
the chance to win.

550
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,822
There he is.

551
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,046
BABEL CHEMICALS HAS SUCCEEDED
IN DEVELOPING BLSD

552
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,721
Babel's BLSD will finally

553
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,265
get to see the light of day. It's…

554
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,769
It's a dream come true.

555
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,772
Now, the display panel market in Korea

556
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,358
will undergo a rapid change
thanks to our BLSD.

557
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,444
I thank our dear researchers.

558
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,489
Thank you so much for your hard work.

559
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,915
BABEL CHEMICALS

560
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,430
-Hey.
-What's going on?

561
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,431
What happened?

562
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,225
What the hell?

563
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,229
-To the hospital, now!
-Call 911 now and move him!

564
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,273
No, not him.
I'm talking about me, asshole!

565
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,983
-Let's go.
-Blood!

566
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,569
-Take me to the hospital!
-What happened?

567
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,237
-He's bleeding.
-What's going on?

568
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,364
-Hey, call 911 now.
-Damn it.

569
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,907
Come on, we have to help him.

570
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,035
Sign the paper, or we won't
take you to the hospital. Okay?

571
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,497
-What happened? U-yeong!
-Come on.

572
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,627
-Gosh, come on.
-What?

573
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,255
-What's this?
-I mean,

574
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,675
why would thugs like them
have a meal at a place like this?

575
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,343
I know, right?

576
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,137
It's not like they're the Mafia.

577
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,316
What?

578
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,358
Why is that in there?

579
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,488
Unbelievable.

580
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,409
How did a nail get mixed up
in the spaghetti?

581
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,581
We should upload this
to all the social media pages.

582
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,252
I think it pierced my mouth.

583
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,379
And it's rusty, too.

584
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,631
This is bad.

585
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,341
-You never got the DPT vaccine.
-No.

586
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,968
What if you get tetanus?
Do you have any penicillin?

587
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,261
Come on!

588
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,974
I see that you've decided to play dirty.

589
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,101
Trying to drive us out, are you?

590
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,190
You're asking for a beating, aren't you?

591
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,359
-Why you…
-Hold it!

592
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,074
Just pay up and leave.

593
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,951
Oh, look. I'm done.

594
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,702
-How much is it?
-What about this?

595
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,287
What about this nail?

596
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,497
It was in my food!

597
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,250
What are you doing with that, Su-nam?
Don't do that.

598
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,672
Sit down. Stay calm and sit down.

599
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,965
-Let's go!
-Damn it.

600
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,093
You asshole.

601
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,646
I told you to stop.

602
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,899
How will you get through life
with no self-control?

603
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,652
Hey, stop that.

604
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,205
Disruptive customers may face
a maximum fine of 15 million won fine

605
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,958
or a five-year prison sentence
depending on the offense.

606
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,209
You'd better watch it.

607
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,342
Are you happy now? You idiot.

608
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,928
You're embarrassing, so just get up.

609
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,222
Keep your restaurant clean. Let's go.

610
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,349
Go. Hurry.

611
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,809
-Go.
-Did you pay?

612
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,687
I was going to do that next.

613
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,065
Here goes my hand to my back pocket

614
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,401
Goodness. What's the rush?

615
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,614
-Here you go.
-It's 95,000 won.

616
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,033
You need to pay more.

617
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,952
Here.

618
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,165
Sir.

619
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,877
I can't open my eyes.
I can't see anything.

620
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,379
Where are you? Sir.

621
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,797
-This way.
-Okay.

622
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,215
Make some sounds. Clap.

623
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,800
-Hurry.
-This way.

624
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,554
Be careful. One, two.

625
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,765
-Oh, my babies.
-One, two.

626
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,808
My plates. What do I do?

627
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,226
My goodness.

628
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,482
-I'm sorry. I'll pay for the plates.
-What?

629
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,987
That's a lot of money.

630
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,499
He's not even hiding it now.

631
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,584
He's just outright hot.

632
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,091
Jeez. I'm so sick of those thugs.

633
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,342
Excuse me.

634
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,512
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,680
I need to leave early today.

636
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,350
-Is something wrong?
-What should I do?

637
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,602
I have a blind date.
It's been three years.

638
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,979
You should go. Hurry. Good luck!

639
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,606
I can do it!

640
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,734
-Don't talk too much.
-Okay.

641
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,528
And one more thing.

642
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,823
And don't play any weird games.

643
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,494
Oh, right.

644
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,121
The finger flick.

645
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,332
Should we go for dinner?

646
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,878
What are you doing?

647
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,675
We made a bet earlier.

648
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,512
You said you didn't hit women
even if it was a game.

649
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,763
You said it was okay.

650
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,058
Yes, I did say that.

651
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,479
Do you need to warm up
just for a finger flick?

652
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,817
Shall we proceed?

653
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,778
"Proceed"? Am I being sentenced?

654
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,866
Okay.

655
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,411
What's all the fuss?

656
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,538
It's against your principles.

657
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,585
Fine. Do it!

658
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:29,987
Get it over with.

659
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,064
What was that? Do it right.

660
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,568
I tried,

661
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,903
but I missed.

662
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,324
Until next time, then.

663
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,579
Right, it's over there.

664
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,335
-Cha-young!
-Jeez!

665
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,379
Don't sneak up on me like that.

666
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,464
Hi.

667
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,510
Do you want to guess what happened today?

668
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,229
I…

669
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,940
became an official partner.

670
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,359
I'm no longer an intern.

671
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,654
I'm a partner at Wusang.

672
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,783
Right. Good for you.

673
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,661
Wait.

674
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,248
You don't seem happy.

675
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,749
I'm a partner now.

676
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,627
Yes. Good for you.

677
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,714
Congratulations.

678
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,093
You're so mean.

679
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,553
It was only natural.

680
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,346
Did you want to be an intern forever?

681
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,849
You didn't congratulate me properly.

682
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,396
To make up for that,
I'll buy you something delicious.

683
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,565
Let's go have jjamppong.
The spiciest there is.

684
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,693
-Can't we get something else?
-Forget it.

685
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,153
I'm buying, so it's up to me.

686
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,156
Okay. Fine. I'll eat it. Let's go.

687
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,950
I'm good. Enjoy your meal.

688
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,623
People from Italy can't eat spicy food.

689
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,709
-Let's go.
-I guess he can't handle it.

690
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,843
Italian people love spicy chilis.

691
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,929
They even carry pepperoncini with them.
And I do, too.

692
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,723
They're 20,000 on the Scoville scale.

693
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:07,895
I love bird's eye chilis from Thailand.
That's 100,000 Scoville.

694
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,357
I have Red Savina habaneros in Mexico.
They're 300,000 Scoville.

695
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,652
Do you know ghost peppers from India?
They are 800,000 Scoville.

696
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,071
-You can eat 800,000-Scoville chilis?
-Yes.

697
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,198
-I guess you can handle some spicy food.
-Yes.

698
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,866
-Shall we go for jjamppong?
-Sure.

699
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,784
Let's go.

700
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,788
There's no chilly that's 800,000 Scoville.

701
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,831
What's up with them?

702
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,129
Thank you.

703
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,173
Did you get any cases?

704
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,467
Yes. The elks filed a lawsuit.

705
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,468
The elks?

706
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,055
An environmental organization
filed a lawsuit on behalf of the elks

707
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,307
against TQ E&amp;C for building a tunnel.

708
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,226
How absurd.

709
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,020
That's common in the US and Europe.
I guess you didn't know.

710
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,065
I see. I guess I don't know much.

711
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,865
This hits the spot.

712
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,619
What kind of lawsuits
did you handle in Italy?

713
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,205
Company disputes and mediation.

714
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,249
That must've been a tough job.

715
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,459
And there's the Mafia in Italy.

716
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,174
Actually, the Mafia

717
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,262
don't meddle in the lives of
regular people and businesses.

718
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,599
They do businesses amongst themselves.
They don't cross the line.

719
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,601
-"The line."
-No more shoptalk.

720
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,062
This won't do. Want more chili oil?

721
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:32,980
What?

722
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,774
I'm actually good.

723
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,374
It's too spicy for you.

724
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,293
-Have something else.
-This is delicious.

725
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,919
Is that so?

726
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,259
Then, are you guys working together?

727
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,595
Well, for now.

728
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,306
Don't make Cha-young's life difficult.

729
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,269
You look a little hard-boiled.

730
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,062
Do I?

731
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,564
It's just a feeling I got.

732
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,151
You seem gentle on the outside,

733
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,154
but you might be cold and cruel
on the inside.

734
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,034
I'm not like that.

735
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,286
Just eat.

736
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,547
Enjoy your meal, Mr. C.

737
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,009
You sure can eat spicy food.

738
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,723
EMERGENCY WARD

739
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,518
Lee U-yeong…

740
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,897
Hey, what did they say?

741
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,149
Did I cough up too much blood?

742
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,692
This is embarrassing.

743
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,028
That's not the problem. Look at you.

744
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,030
Hey, if I die,

745
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,242
go to the mountain and pray for me.

746
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,701
So I can go peacefully.

747
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,621
Stop talking nonsense.

748
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:17,459
Damn it. When the others collapsed,
I never thought it would happen to me.

749
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,170
Anyway, I can't believe that chairman.

750
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,090
How can he make a fuss

751
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,344
because my blood got on him
when I was the one who collapsed?

752
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,471
Don't get too worked up.

753
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,140
-Yes.
-Focus on your breathing.

754
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,476
-Okay?
-Hey.

755
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,562
I'm okay.

756
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,106
I'm Lee U-yeong from Sapgyocheon.

757
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,649
Lee U-yeong.

758
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,457
Are you the guardian?

759
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,875
Yes.

760
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,753
My friend is an orphan.
He doesn't have anyone but me.

761
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,756
So I'm… But what does he have?

762
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,801
It's chronic myelogenous leukemia.

763
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,554
It's a hematologic malignancy
from a genetic mutation.

764
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:14,975
Did he smoke or work a lot?

765
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,476
Well, yes.

766
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,520
But he only smoked a little.

767
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,648
He did seem to be swamped with work.
Is that the cause?

768
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,109
The cause hasn't been identified yet,

769
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,194
but it could have been a factor.

770
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,032
My friend works at Babel Chemicals.
Does it have anything to do with his job?

771
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,826
Babel Chemicals takes
their protocol very seriously.

772
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,871
If there was a problem at work,

773
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,415
your friend probably
failed to follow the protocol.

774
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,969
Goodness.

775
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,556
You two look like hell
from trying to show off.

776
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,645
We should go for round two.

777
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,064
This isn't the time for that.

778
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,899
Go get ready for the trial.

779
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,276
I can do that tomorrow.

780
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,320
Right, Mr. Cassano?

781
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,738
Listen to her.

782
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,531
Come on.

783
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,788
Hong Cha-young speaking.

784
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,873
Hello, Monk Chaesin.

785
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,419
-Is she a Buddhist now?
-Don't talk to me.

786
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,630
Okay. See you soon.

787
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,007
You can't handle spicy food at all.

788
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,888
We should head back to the plaza now.

789
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,392
-What is it?
-Go home. Call me if you need help.

790
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,687
Let's go.

791
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,649
Heave ho.

792
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,734
You'll be okay. Heave ho.

793
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,530
Heave ho.

794
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,533
-Cha-young.
-One, two.

795
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,252
Was I being lied to then?

796
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,130
Yes. The director lied to you.

797
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,590
Haemun Medical Center is owned by Babel.

798
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,718
Anyone related to Babel is a scumbag.

799
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,178
How could this happen?

800
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,972
He used to be so healthy.

801
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,766
-His diagnosis was--
-Chronic myelogenous leukemia.

802
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,976
Yes, that's it.

803
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,521
He got it from working
with a toxic substance called BLSD.

804
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,607
Of course, the hospital said
it was his fault.

805
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,110
Then, isn't this an industrial accident?

806
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,738
Yes, it is. There are many victims.

807
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,989
Shouldn't he fight Babel?

808
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,407
No one wants to fight them.

809
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,825
Why the hell not?

810
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,202
I would've sued them already.

811
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,705
Is it because they offered
a lot of settlement money?

812
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,457
Not really.

813
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,461
They want to settle it quietly
because they know they'll lose.

814
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,755
But they didn't even try fighting them.

815
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,590
They ought to at least try something.

816
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,009
-Stop it.
-This is frustrating.

817
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,803
Poor thing. All he did was work.

818
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,513
Please help U-yeong.

819
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,849
He was such a decent man.

820
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:04,144
DRY CLEANING

821
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,355
Mr. Tak, the cause of the water leakage
was the trap gasket.

822
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,690
What's that?

823
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,942
It'll be done soon. I need ten minutes.

824
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,860
Okay.

825
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:15,530
-Goodness. Thank you for your help.
-Gosh.

826
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,492
-He helped fix our problems like his own.
-Thanks.

827
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,287
He was good-natured and polite.
He was so nice.

828
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,539
-Why are you guys fighting?
-We're not fighting.

829
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,957
-Look.
-It's working. Do it.

830
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,875
It's working?

831
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,337
-He was like family to us.
-It's working!

832
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,047
-Why did you call him then?
-Hey.

833
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,300
We'll do everything we can,
so he's not wronged.

834
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,525
Sir. Are you finally done?

835
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:57,113
I know this is sudden,
but I've completed my training.

836
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,449
I can help now.

837
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,076
Sir.

838
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:02,786
Gosh.

839
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,749
Help us, merciful Buddha.

840
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,251
Congratulations.

841
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,838
We should get started.

842
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,673
Okay.

843
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,811
I love this sound.

844
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,230
What's this?

845
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,191
"So Hyeon-u not allowed"?

846
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,068
What's this?

847
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,656
PRAYER FOR MR. CASSANO
AND MS. HONG'S VICTORY

848
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,579
What's going on?

849
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,332
Sir. Excuse me.

850
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,502
What are you doing here?

851
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,754
Didn't you see
that you're not allowed here?

852
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,006
You have no shame.

853
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,883
What's going on?

854
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,426
That evil man.

855
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,635
"Evil"?

856
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,722
You covered their eyes and ears
with your lies. You are evil!

857
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,807
-"Evil"?
-Get out of here, evil-doer!

858
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,100
-"Evil"?
-Evil man!

859
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,729
-Why are you here?
-Get out of here. Out!

860
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,732
BABEL CHEMICALS
VICTIMS' FAMILIES OFFICE

861
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,317
My gosh!

862
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,114
The notice of your dismissal
by the victims' families.

863
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,785
What did you do to them?

864
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,913
You're the one who started this.

865
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,082
Wusang bribed you to urge them to settle.

866
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,125
Do you have proof?

867
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,376
What if we do?

868
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,255
Don't you know where I used to work?

869
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,924
Wusang?

870
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,635
A junior of mine at Wusang

871
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,846
is in charge of buying off
small crooked law firms like yours.

872
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,726
-Hey, listen.
-Yes?

873
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,313
-I'm about to go broke.
-What?

874
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,441
I lost all of my money
on stock investment.

875
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,319
Damn it.

876
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,489
So I decided to throw in the white towel

877
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,993
and took an interview
for a job opening at a law firm.

878
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,705
Was it Sudan And Bangbeop?

879
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,457
Sudan And Bangbeop?

880
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,211
They work for us.

881
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,925
Besides, that guy, Mr. So,
is just a bottom feeder.

882
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,513
What is it?

883
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,682
Does he only care about money?

884
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,183
Don't even get me started.

885
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,937
He whines for more money
even when we give him enough.

886
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,897
He's so annoying.

887
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,233
-Unbelievable.
-Seriously?

888
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,651
They never gave me money.

889
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,777
They're lying.

890
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,074
Did you think we wouldn't be able to
track the money since it was cash?

891
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,369
When people hide money,
they keep it close to them.

892
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,747
At home or their frequent spot, because…

893
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,542
they need easy access.

894
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,427
You shouldn't have left a trace
if you hid it in the office.

895
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,178
Or you could have cleaned up better.

896
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,056
If you leave prints,

897
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,183
it makes it so obvious
that you hid something.

898
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,106
Just like that?

899
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,247
Of course, we told the families
what you were up to.

900
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:35,749
My money.

901
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,500
Oh, right.

902
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,960
What did we do with the money?

903
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:40,962
What did we do?

904
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,386
Please.

905
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,657
DONATION RECEIPT

906
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,410
CERTIFICATE OF DONATION
DONATED BY: SO HYEON-U

907
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,995
DONATION AMOUNT: 613,000,000 WON

908
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,549
Hi.

909
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,384
Why don't you say hi?

910
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,100
-Cha-young.
-Yes?

911
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,226
What brings you here?

912
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,645
You'll find out soon enough!

913
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,815
Hello.

914
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,789
The attorney representing
the victims' families

915
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,040
resigned from the case.

916
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,959
With the consent from victims' families,

917
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,420
Jipuragi Law Firm decided
to take on this case.

918
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,301
You brat!

919
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,261
Cha-young.

920
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,972
You can't throw a grenade
on my lap like this.

921
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,015
Leave that alone. It's expensive.

922
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,603
We need to make a bang
in order for people to notice us.

923
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,022
There's only one way humans are born,

924
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,817
but there are countless ways to die.

925
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,320
I take it that your tonsils are fine now.

926
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:30,780
Right.

927
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,657
Thanks to you.

928
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,705
I get that you don't know how it's done
in Korea, but you can't be this reckless.

929
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,998
You'll be in big trouble.

930
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,419
You can't be this reckless

931
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,671
just because you don't know me.

932
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,006
You'll be in big trouble.

933
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,757
You have some guts.

934
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,136
I'll ask out of courtesy.

935
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,847
Do you have any terms for settlement
or advice for us?

936
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,850
If Babel Chemicals admits
their wrongdoings,

937
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,811
apologizes sincerely,
and sufficiently compensates the victims,

938
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:02,937
we'll drop the lawsuit.

939
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:06,399
And cease the manufacture of BLSD

940
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,401
and correct the lies they've spread.

941
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,696
Goodness. Forget it.

942
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,949
You're practically asking me
to shut down my law firm.

943
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,493
I am very sorry

944
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,828
to hear that you think that way.

945
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,748
It's up to you whether to accept or not.
But…

946
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,003
you should remember
that freedom comes with a price.

947
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,800
-Let's go, Ms. Hong.
-Sure.

948
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,762
I won't see you off.

949
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,015
Please don't.

950
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,065
So that guy, Vincenzo,

951
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,609
stabbed Chairman Jang's pillow
with syringes,

952
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,695
killed your crystal balls,
threatened you on the phone,

953
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,282
and burnt down the Babel Pharmaceuticals
warehouse?

954
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,619
Why bring up my crystal balls?
You're breaking my heart.

955
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,541
But now that I've met him,

956
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,209
it all seems to make sense.

957
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,796
By the way, I kind of want him.

958
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,799
From this point on,

959
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,427
I'll take all the cases
related to the Babel Group.

960
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,930
Leave them all to me.

961
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,014
Exactly!

962
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,768
Myung-hee, that's what
I wanted all along! Goodness.

963
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,104
Tell everyone in Seocho-dong.

964
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,774
I'm done warming up,

965
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,069
and I'm about to get in the ring.

966
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,947
I'll post a photo.

967
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,242
"Hashtag, here we come."

968
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,663
Why the long faces? What's the problem?

969
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,709
Mr. Cassano.

970
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,837
You have to stop her. Babel is dangerous!

971
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,006
I'm sorry, but I don't plan to do that.

972
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,340
You both know that.

973
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,508
You saw what happened.

974
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,677
That's why we're doing this. We can win.

975
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,595
Cha-young.

976
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,221
Let's go, Ms. Hong.

977
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,269
Oh, right.

978
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,604
Good luck with the elks.

979
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,980
Good luck.

980
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,273
Bye, Joon-woo.

981
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,450
Cha-young.

982
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,369
I can't keep going easy on you.

983
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:35,048
I didn't expect Ms. Choi
to get involved herself.

984
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,426
It all worked out.
I had to take her down eventually.

985
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,096
Do you think you can win?

986
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,974
She's a rookie who just joined the firm,

987
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,267
but it won't be easy.

988
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,393
It's more than that.

989
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:50,063
There's a 90-percent chance you'll lose.

990
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,525
No. The chance is always 50-50.

991
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,030
Before you fight,

992
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,532
you must consider three things first.

993
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,077
Their skill, their greed,

994
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,204
and their cunning.

995
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,415
I'm not a pushover either.

996
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,000
I am skilled and I'm also greedy.

997
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:17,090
Your skill and your greed
don't allow you to harm others.

998
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,509
Don't work yourself up.

999
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,053
Winning the first hearing isn't our goal.

1000
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,430
But that'll make the second hearing
more difficult.

1001
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,973
If we can't win,

1002
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,518
we have to make sure
no one can win or lose.

1003
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,521
You have to follow my advice this time.

1004
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,235
I've been a lawyer for eight years.
I don't need any advice.

1005
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,487
I'm not trying to downplay
your experience.

1006
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,283
I'm going to give you advice
on how to become a real villain.

1007
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,623
Fine.

1008
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,917
I'll take your advice just this once.

1009
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,835
But…

1010
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:58,297
when it's my turn to give you advice,
you have to do as I say.

1011
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:00,967
Sure.

1012
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,263
Right. I remembered about Mr. So.

1013
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,142
I hope he's doing well.

1014
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,059
Of course.

1015
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,147
He should be up by now.

1016
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,918
Where am I? What?

1017
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,004
Where am I?

1018
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,424
What's this?

1019
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,311
What's all this?

1020
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,353
GREEN ONION, CARROT

1021
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,356
Carrot seeds and perilla seeds?

1022
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,691
Damn it. What's this?

1023
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,281
Gosh. It must be a dream.

1024
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,618
"Only for Mr. So"? What's this?

1025
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:13,372
What the hell? It's not a dream!
What's going on?

1026
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,000
Where am I?

1027
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,835
It's cold!

1028
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,675
That's my apartment!

1029
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,886
Honey!

1030
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,180
Honey!

1031
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,349
Honey!

1032
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,642
-Yes.
-Honey.

1033
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,268
-The name's So Hyeon-u.
-Honey!

1034
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,812
He's a lawyer.

1035
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:38,356
He hasn't come home in two days.

1036
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,483
Yes.

1037
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,360
What do I do?

1038
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:46,030
I'm right here!

1039
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,407
Honey!

1040
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,039
Once in a while, professional gamblers
attend Mafia-run gambling joints.

1041
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,750
Like Chow Yun-fat in God of Gamblers.

1042
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,585
Don't get worked up. Quiet.

1043
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,841
Right before he was about to
win an astronomical sum,

1044
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,801
do you know what they did?

1045
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,554
They take him outside,
break both of his hands,

1046
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,097
and tell him to never come back.

1047
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,809
The Mafia these days don't
intimidate people as the times are hard.

1048
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,060
-Gosh.
-I see.

1049
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,145
Then they would try to void the game

1050
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:19,981
one way or another.

1051
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,985
They nullify the game without
raising any suspicions to make him leave.

1052
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,779
I know what this is.

1053
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,990
When we play cards with our family
on holidays,

1054
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:33,244
the dads who lose would
turn over the table to void the game.

1055
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,955
So you want to invalidate the trial.

1056
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,250
We can't postpone the trial
or drop the case at the moment.

1057
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,669
That's not what I had in mind.

1058
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,797
-We'll do it during the trial.
-What?

1059
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:50,553
Ruining a game of cards is easy
because the Mafia owns the gambling joint,

1060
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,598
but we have no power
or the means to do that.

1061
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,225
We can make that happen…

1062
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,145
in our own way.

1063
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,861
I can't wait.

1064
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,780
I'm getting an adrenaline rush. Goodness.

1065
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,991
What do I do?

1066
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,622
This is driving me nuts. Where is it?

1067
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,688
Yes. Please do that, Mr. Cho. Okay.

1068
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,273
Bye.

1069
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,112
We're about ready.

1070
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,535
Once the lawsuit is over,

1071
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,413
what's your next plan?

1072
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,832
This is the last one.

1073
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,502
I'll leave after taking care of the plaza.

1074
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,214
Without watching Babel Group crumble down?

1075
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,639
I think this will be enough

1076
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,558
to pacify my anger.

1077
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:27,316
I was wondering
if you were planning to stay in Korea.

1078
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,542
I don't have much attachment
to this country.

1079
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,086
I want to leave soon.

1080
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:55,052
Sure. You should leave.

1081
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,847
You have your own life to live.

1082
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,283
Mr. Tak. What brings you here this early?

1083
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,830
Give me your clothes
you're wearing to the trial.

1084
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,124
-Our clothes?
-Yes.

1085
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:58,949
I'll do that.

1086
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:01,410
This way.

1087
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,872
Just this once. Come this way.

1088
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:21,430
Well…

1089
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,682
since you don't like my food,

1090
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,643
I prepared this for you instead.

1091
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:30,147
My mother cooked everything herself.

1092
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,194
I'm sure it tastes great. I promise.

1093
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,377
My mom's touch.

1094
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,381
You did it.

1095
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:57,716
I'm sorry.

1096
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,610
My car keys. I left them at home.

1097
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,362
I always do this on an important day.

1098
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,489
Let's take my car.

1099
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,910
-You have a car?
-Yes.

1100
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,370
It's parked on the way to the courthouse.

1101
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,417
That's a hassle. Let's call a cab.

1102
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,172
You need a sleek ride when you're headed
to the battlefield.

1103
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,474
They're here.

1104
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:36,065
-Hold on. Stop pushing!
-Stop pushing.

1105
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,775
-Why are you pushing me?
-Gosh.

1106
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:39,985
-Sir.
-Excuse me.

1107
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,737
How will you compensate them?

1108
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,906
What about the toxic substance?

1109
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,033
Please, move out of the way.

1110
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,868
-Sir.
-Just a comment, sir.

1111
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,955
-I'm not leading the trial.
-The plaintiffs said they'll demand

1112
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,916
-maximum compensation.
-She's leading it. Talk to her.

1113
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,877
They're claiming it's due to
a toxic chemical called BLSD.

1114
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,878
Is this true?

1115
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,505
There are 40 victims in total.

1116
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,757
Nine people have died from it.
Is this true?

1117
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,219
My dear reporters,
you cannot ask me such questions

1118
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,012
based on some online tabloids.

1119
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,306
Please ask me questions based on facts.

1120
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,642
Are you saying
the plaintiffs' claims are false?

1121
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,895
Just because they're weak,
you believe them without question.

1122
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,563
Why don't you check the facts?

1123
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,233
So you're saying
the plaintiffs' claims are lying.

1124
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,110
Not all weak people are just.

1125
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:24,863
The plaintiffs are using their position
as the weak

1126
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,993
to paint all the rich people as evil.

1127
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,453
Therefore, I urge you not to believe them

1128
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,082
when the plaintiffs claim they are weak
and that we are the ones who are lying.

1129
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:39,670
The same goes for the opportunistic
lawyers representing the plaintiffs.

1130
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,046
The claims are groundless?

1131
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,257
So they're only putting on an act.

1132
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,175
Hey, the plaintiffs' lawyers are here!

1133
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,552
-What? Where?
-Where?

1134
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,553
Move it!

1135
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,055
-Excuse me.
-Where are they?

1136
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,270
-A comment, please.
-Excuse me.

1137
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,688
-The windows are tinted.
-Hey.

1138
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:59,857
-I can't see anything.
-Say something.

1139
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,114
What?

1140
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,868
Why are you blocking the road?

1141
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,536
You're pissing me off.

1142
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,248
I'm pissed off as it is
because I lost the lawsuit.

1143
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,875
Get away from my car.

1144
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,128
Step back! Now!

1145
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,546
You assholes!

1146
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,673
Step back!

1147
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,925
-What was that?
-Why curse at us?

1148
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:29,803
Stop honking. Just go!

1149
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,389
-It wasn't them!
-Come on.

1150
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,391
-What was that?
-Goodness.

1151
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,231
Who are you?

1152
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,485
I'm representing the plaintiffs,
Hong Cha-young of Jipuragi Law Firm.

1153
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,698
-Don't push me.
-Step back.

1154
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,659
-Move aside.
-Stop pushing.

1155
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,203
Come on. Stop pushing me!

1156
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:39,206
What if you scratch it?
Your annual salary can't cover that!

1157
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:43,627
Excuse me, Babel Chemicals said
that your claims were all false.

1158
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,802
Hold on a second.
Come on. Stop pushing me!

1159
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,805
Are you also a lawyer?

1160
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,224
I'm an advisor of Jipuragi Law Firm.

1161
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:01,311
-What? Hey, it's dangerous on the steps.
-What's going on?

1162
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,148
-The public wants answers!
-Care to comment?

1163
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,233
-Say something for them.
-Don't push me.

1164
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:07,818
What do you think about the case?

1165
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,327
Only evil can punish…

1166
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:19,955
evil.

1167
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,040
-What? Is it English or French?
-What?

1168
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,876
-What did he say? "Diavolo"?
-"Diablo"?

1169
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,961
-He's talking about the game, right?
-A game?

1170
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,046
Is a game company involved in this case?

1171
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,256
A comment, please.

1172
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,680
The heinous Babel Chemicals

1173
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:38,390
must repent!

1174
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,435
-Repent!
-Repent!

1175
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:42,686
OUT WITH BABEL CHEMICALS

1176
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:45,772
BABEL CHEMICALS MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE

1177
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,900
I can't live my life coughing up blood.

1178
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,320
-What's that now?
-Babel Chemicals must repent!

1179
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,033
This performance shows

1180
01:14:56,116 --> 01:15:00,162
the painful struggle of the victims,
everyone!

1181
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,507
BRING DESTRUCTION TO BABEL CHEMICALS

1182
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,925
THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED

1183
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:16,595
We should take a video of this.

1184
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,430
Put more soul in it.

1185
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,848
Hold it up. Come on.

1186
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:23,685
-You, too.
-You should repent. You're killing us.

1187
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:54,007
What are those assholes doing?

1188
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,468
Let's go.

1189
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,345
Unbelievable.

1190
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,733
SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN SEUNG-HWAN
AND JUNG YOUNG-JU

1191
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,010
It's highly unlikely.

1192
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,511
There's nothing we can do
but stall for time.

1193
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:25,265
No matter what they do,
they can never outwit me.

1194
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,267
We must find out who their enemies are.

1195
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,935
Because the enemy of my enemy…

1196
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,854
is a friend.

1197
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,940
I guess it's time I make a move.

1198
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,777
They may provoke them in other ways.

1199
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,113
If you can't beat him,
just get rid of him.

1200
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:43,116
I'm going to win no matter what!

1201
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,202
The last witness we have is…

1202
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,704
-We need a witness…
-It's perfect.

1203
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,499
…who is infallible.

1204
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:59,007
