1
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,097
VINCENZO

2
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:46,711
<i>Ms. Hong.</i>

3
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:50,924
Do you even want to win?

4
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,800
Definitely. Desperately.

5
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,645
Let's come up with a new witness.

6
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:07,690
We're already struggling as it is.
Where will we find a new one?

7
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:09,609
Me. Bring me in as a witness.

8
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,611
You?

9
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:15,281
To be a witness,
you must have direct ties to the case.

10
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:18,952
Just get me in the ring first.

11
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:21,579
If you do, I'll do the rest.

12
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:36,427
A while ago,

13
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,389
you promised to take my advice

14
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,599
if a situation demands it, right?

15
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:44,143
I did?

16
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,187
Yes, you did.

17
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:50,775
Now is the time.
Just do exactly what I tell you.

18
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,216
This is Vincenzo Cassano,
my surprise witness.

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,011
Vincenzo Cassano?

20
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,349
To be more exact,

21
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:28,104
he's a witness as well as an assailant.

22
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,774
What? An assailant?
That came out of nowhere.

23
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:35,403
He's the assailant that assaulted
employees of Babel Chemicals,

24
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:38,406
and the assault case is
relevant to this case.

25
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:42,577
You and I are the only ones
who know about the illegal activities

26
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,580
between Babel Chemicals
and Haemun Medical Center.

27
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,834
So you can get into the ring
as a surprise witness.

28
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,920
It won't work if the defendant
rejects your request.

29
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:55,423
Right. So we do need another plan.

30
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,185
Then, I must be a witness
that they cannot reject.

31
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,687
An assailant who has his hands on

32
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,023
a vital piece of evidence.

33
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,278
I'm so sick of those victims' families.

34
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:20,990
Tell me about it.
They should've accepted the deal.

35
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,452
Those goddamn bastards are trying
to get more money out of this.

36
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:27,622
Hey!

37
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,504
You're the head of
the New Materials Development.

38
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:37,173
You're the team leader and
the associate team leader, right?

39
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:38,257
Who are you?

40
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,760
You blamed the researchers
for their illnesses,

41
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:44,430
but BLSD was leaked because of
the poor sewage disposal system.

42
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:46,099
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,018
Are you a reporter?

44
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,354
Do you know that guy?

45
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,398
-No.
-Me, neither.

46
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:56,442
-I'm going to beat you up.
-You bastard.

47
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,281
Hey! Damn it.

48
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:29,267
He's an advisor to the plaintiff
and assaulted the employees.

49
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,060
I refuse to let him testify.

50
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,563
Babel Chemicals did not equip their lab

51
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:37,525
with the proper sewage disposal system
for the toxic agent, BLSD, to cut costs.

52
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,903
As a result, the researchers
were exposed to BLSD.

53
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,072
-Your Honor.
-However, the company

54
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:47,076
distorted the truth, blaming
the researchers' past health problems.

55
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,370
The court has not allowed you to testify.

56
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,873
And you weren't even sworn in.
What are you doing?

57
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:52,874
Your Honor.

58
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,587
I present to you this critical evidence.

59
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,255
What's that?

60
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:04,051
This cell phone belongs to the head
of the research team I assaulted.

61
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,429
The text messages saved here

62
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,143
clearly show that the company

63
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,191
covered up the incident
and threatened the victims.

64
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,654
-Gosh. What's that?
-Please, stop.

65
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:25,698
-What's that?
-Wait.

66
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,826
What is this?

67
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:32,413
Put your heads up.

68
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,498
-Freeze!
-Stop right now.

69
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:35,917
Did you call the police?

70
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,753
-Did you assault them?
-I did.

71
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,182
BABEL CHEMICALS

72
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:54,852
Goodness.

73
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,232
That almost gave me a heart attack.

74
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,068
My goodness.

75
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:04,654
<i>After the commotion,</i>

76
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,241
an employee of Babel Chemicals
picked up this cell phone.

77
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,952
When he went through it
to see whose phone it was,

78
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:14,538
he accidentally read the text messages.

79
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:17,416
And the employee gave us the phone
for public interest.

80
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,377
DEFENDANT

81
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,087
It's possible that he plotted this

82
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,340
with an accomplice
to illegally read the text messages.

83
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:27,677
We can ask the witness to elaborate.

84
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,221
WITNESS

85
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:33,891
PLAINTIFF

86
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,269
I'd like to submit the evidence.

87
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,154
Yes, sir. Stop them.

88
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,158
Well…

89
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:53,995
Your Honor.

90
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,040
-Please call an ambulance.
-Pardon?

91
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,167
When the trial is over,

92
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:03,254
I plan to beat the witness,
Director Gil Jong-moon, to a pulp.

93
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:05,590
Me?

94
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:10,303
If you make another threat,

95
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:13,180
you will be escorted out of my court.

96
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,473
Director Gil Jong-moon

97
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,685
gave the victims false information
about the cause of their sickness

98
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:21,105
when he was aware of the correlation
between BLSD and blood cancer.

99
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:27,653
Your Honor. The witness,
Vincenzo Cassano, is speaking

100
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:29,322
without any medical knowledge.

101
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:33,909
As a result, he is tarnishing
Director Gil's reputation severely.

102
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,119
Sustained.

103
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:39,707
I will only take opinions from experts
into consideration.

104
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,709
-Exactly.
-There she goes again.

105
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:44,962
That's why I call forth a medical expert
as my new surprise witness.

106
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,631
Another one?

107
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,007
A new surprise witness?

108
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:52,762
Witness, please come in.

109
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,856
-Honey.
-Is that your wife?

110
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,867
-Why…
-Hey.

111
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:16,869
Hey, there.

112
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:30,257
This is our expert witness.

113
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:33,594
She's Professor Kim Yeo-won, the director
of the Pediatric Cancer Center

114
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,931
at Sungwon University Hospital
and an expert in the field of leukemia.

115
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:38,599
Your Honor.

116
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:41,602
I'd like to reject this person
from speaking as a witness!

117
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:45,147
Our expert witness has
a very important piece of evidence

118
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:47,525
that can prove Director Gil
has committed perjury.

119
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,406
I will…

120
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,786
allow it.

121
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,501
Honey!

122
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:07,878
You may stay out during her testimony!

123
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:10,756
Why are you doing this, honey?

124
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,884
Honey! Hey, let go of me.

125
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,761
-Honey!
-This way, please.

126
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,263
Honey.

127
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:20,224
Witness, you may take the oath.

128
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:24,520
I swear.

129
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,398
Befriend the enemy of my enemy.

130
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:32,987
Our enemy, who is also a key witness,
is Director Gil Jong-moon.

131
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:36,532
Who could be his enemy?

132
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:39,493
His subordinates
or other doctors at the hospital?

133
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:42,246
It'll be hard to persuade them
since their job is at stake.

134
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,166
But he wouldn't have enemies
outside the hospital.

135
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,960
There is someone. The most intimate enemy

136
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,171
that you share secrets with.

137
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:53,215
The enemy he fears the most.

138
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,470
Gosh, isn't it obvious who that is?

139
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:01,307
Once you lose their heart,
you become their worst enemy.

140
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,439
<i>Look into Gil Jong-moon's personal life.</i>

141
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:22,912
Someone once said

142
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:28,000
that one should look at art and war
from a distance.

143
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:35,508
You'll appreciate the painting more
if you take a few steps back.

144
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:57,988
The colors held by Liberty represent
freedom, equality, and fraternity.

145
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:01,033
Delacroix used these colors
in three different places.

146
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,577
One is in Liberty's hand.

147
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,872
The colors show up again
in that man's red belt,

148
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:09,500
white undershirt, and blue shirt.

149
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:11,877
And lastly,

150
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,005
it's also at the top
of Notre Dame Cathedral.

151
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:20,177
And the dress she's wearing doesn't
look like a regular French dress, either.

152
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:26,517
That's a Greek dress.

153
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,603
That's why she also symbolizes Libertas,

154
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,690
the goddess of freedom in mythology.

155
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:38,946
She reminds me of you

156
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:43,534
in how you've pushed forward with
the Pediatric Cancer Center

157
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,036
against the board of directors.

158
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,084
Do you know me?

159
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,504
It's an honor to meet you.

160
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:58,507
I'm Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

161
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:04,471
DIRECTOR GIL'S SLUSH FUND RECORDS

162
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:07,975
PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS

163
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,239
I knew that he was having an affair

164
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:24,867
and was secretly preparing to divorce me.

165
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:26,660
But…

166
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,623
I didn't know
he had hidden this much money.

167
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,208
More than anything,

168
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,003
I am furious that
he downplayed your intelligence.

169
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,756
What do you want from me?

170
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,765
I want you to be our expert witness
and refute Director Gil's claims.

171
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,019
When all you did was expose his secrets,

172
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,937
isn't this too much?

173
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,189
No, it's not.

174
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:59,109
Because our law firm will take care
of your divorce suit,

175
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:02,071
and Director Gil will lose
all of his assets to you.

176
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,336
-I have one more condition.
-Please.

177
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:20,339
Do you like opera?

178
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:27,596
Opera gives me
the biggest comfort in my life.

179
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:34,311
Then, take me to see an opera.

180
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:43,821
Cheers to your beautiful
and alluring eyes.

181
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:48,158
This contains Director Gil Jong-moon's
personal correspondence

182
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:53,497
with Dr. Ramos of the UCLA Medical Center
regarding how to treat BLSD.

183
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,418
Here, he admits that improper
sewage disposal was what caused the leak

184
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,295
and identifies BLSD as the direct cause
of the blood cancer.

185
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:04,299
The emails clearly show he was
discussing the leak with Dr. Ramos.

186
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:06,260
Reading your spouse's emails
without consent

187
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:07,970
is a violation
of the telecommunications act.

188
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,596
Hence, this evidence
cannot be used in court.

189
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,891
She didn't read Director Gil's emails.
Dr. Ramos sent them to her.

190
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,729
-What?
-That's right.

191
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:18,814
Dr. Ramos is an old friend of mine.

192
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:22,818
He asked me about
what my husband had asked him.

193
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:27,281
And during this inquiry,
Dr. Ramos shared these emails with me.

194
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:32,327
What? Then why didn't you
talk to your husband about this?

195
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,165
I didn't want to hurt
my poor husband's pride.

196
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:40,210
If he had known it came from me,
his fragile ego would have been hurt.

197
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:44,381
In order to verify the witness' testimony

198
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:46,675
and to compare their medical opinions,

199
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,720
I will call the defendant's witness…
What's his name?

200
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:52,765
-Gil Jong-moon.
-I will call Gil Jong-moon to the stand.

201
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:56,643
So we can go over this one more time.

202
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,354
Honey!

203
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,071
Go to the witness stand.

204
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:11,075
Darling, what's wrong with you?

205
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:22,419
Right.

206
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:24,546
I almost forgot.

207
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,092
Here's a bonus from your "darling."

208
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,097
I found this in the corner
of my husband's desk drawer.

209
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,058
I thought this was salt
that you have with <i>sundae.</i>

210
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,851
It turned out it was methamphetamine.

211
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:41,105
He's a doctor.
How could he be so reckless?

212
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:47,736
I suspect the defendant's witness
is a habitual drug user.

213
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,364
I find it difficult to accept
his expert opinion.

214
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,618
That's not mine! It's not!

215
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:55,911
Then is this mine?

216
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,996
-You junkie.
-What?

217
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,833
Let's roll up his sleeve.

218
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,627
It has been brought
to the court's attention

219
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,381
that Director Gil might have injected
Lee U-yeong with methamphetamines.

220
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:11,051
Lee U-yeong is hospitalized now,
but once his innocence is proven,

221
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:15,180
his testimony as a witness
must be also admissible.

222
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:16,473
That's right.

223
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:21,645
Components that make up a drug may differ
depending on who has manufactured it.

224
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,188
Your Honor!

225
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,274
I am sure that the components

226
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:29,319
that make up the drug found in
Lee U-yeong's blood will be identical

227
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,905
to that of Director Gil's.

228
00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:34,575
You in the gallery. Be quiet!

229
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:35,784
Okay.

230
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,705
How dare you do this to
your own husband? My goodness!

231
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,582
Fine. I get that you're smart.

232
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,917
But how dare you destroy
the head of a family

233
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,546
who is brilliant and levelheaded?

234
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:48,755
Witness!

235
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,759
You're not allowed to speak
unless it's relevant to the case.

236
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,887
Be quiet and go back to your seat.

237
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:01,518
What are you doing?

238
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:04,730
Go back to your hussy, you prick.

239
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:05,939
And you know what?

240
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:09,109
You're dirt poor now, you asshole.

241
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:13,238
Please, refrain from using profanity
in the sacred court of law.

242
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,574
I get that you are pissed at me,

243
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:20,454
but how dare you tarnish our family's
reputation in this sacred courtroom?

244
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,750
You're going down anyway.
Do you want some more?

245
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,918
What?

246
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,178
-Hey.
-Calm down.

247
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:38,055
Let go of me. You come here.

248
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:47,981
Stop fighting.

249
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:02,955
What was his name?

250
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,082
Vinsingzo.

251
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,960
I've seen him before.

252
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:10,420
I think it was about two weeks ago.

253
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:12,756
He came to me when I was working out.

254
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,425
He talked about some strange things
and left.

255
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:20,389
Then he probably figured out
how stupid you are.

256
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:21,473
What?

257
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:24,476
I didn't respond to him at all.

258
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,770
I sensed that something was off.

259
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:27,729
Forget it.

260
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,439
Hold a press conference tomorrow.

261
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:30,857
A press conference?

262
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:34,278
Admit to everything
and announce we'll get rid of BLSD.

263
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,655
Punish everyone who's involved,

264
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,657
and tell the victims
we'll compensate them.

265
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:41,118
And don't forget to bow respectfully.

266
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:43,954
Okay.

267
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,706
How is Babel Tower going?

268
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,042
I think the supervising department
is experiencing some hiccups.

269
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,130
Just shut up and demolish it.

270
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:56,550
We're not building it for our own good.

271
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,969
Don't you know
it's for the prosecutors, the judges,

272
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:00,804
politicians, and government officials?

273
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:04,474
I'll personally see to it
as soon as I get back to the company.

274
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:06,518
I get that you're a fake,

275
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:08,854
but you still must do your best.

276
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,856
Yes, sir.

277
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,275
Bye.

278
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,654
Damn it!

279
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:26,705
If Babel is smart, they'll want to settle.

280
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:30,709
I agree. They'll try to settle this,
so it doesn't turn into a criminal case.

281
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,128
What's your plan?

282
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,130
Of course, victims should be compensated.

283
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,882
I'll sue them in criminal court.

284
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:42,095
This could've taken 5 to 6 years,
but we finished it in 2 weeks.

285
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,305
Good work.

286
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:47,559
Gosh, there's no need for that between us.

287
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,772
Right. Do you need anything?

288
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:53,065
Do I need anything?

289
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:55,984
Yes. You played a huge role
in winning this case.

290
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,320
As the CEO, I want to reward you.

291
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,366
Anything I want?

292
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,117
Yes. You name it.

293
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:07,913
Okay.

294
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,624
I'll show you how it's done!

295
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,847
Do you know how much
Babel will lose today?

296
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:28,934
Seven hundred and sixty million dollars!

297
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,230
I'm already past 200km per hour.

298
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:35,107
Should we jump over there

299
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,150
-to see what happens?
-Please, don't.

300
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:48,245
Even if it's a Booralro suit,
you can't wear it all year round.

301
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,957
And more importantly,
it makes you look out of style.

302
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,753
So I've been making up for that
with my good looks.

303
00:21:58,797 --> 00:21:59,923
So annoying.

304
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,176
So how many suits do you want?

305
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,720
We'll start with ten suits.

306
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:10,809
That many?

307
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:13,103
Let's leave now if you're not up for it.

308
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,272
No. Go ahead.

309
00:22:16,523 --> 00:22:17,816
-Let's go.
-Get them.

310
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:30,287
By the way, you have such a great body.

311
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,165
I almost thought
I was measuring a mannequin.

312
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:37,627
Should I hold my breath for three seconds
like a real mannequin?

313
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:41,840
Then, can you hold your breath
for three seconds?

314
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:44,134
That would be an interesting experience.

315
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,936
I have some sample suits in your size.

316
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,646
-Would you like to try them on?
-Sure.

317
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,564
Okay.

318
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:48,281
Ms. Hong, what do you think?

319
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,505
Are you okay with a sample suit?

320
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,716
This is perfect for me. Thanks.

321
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:15,225
Here.

322
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,645
-What is it?
-Open it.

323
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:29,197
This is to celebrate our partnership.

324
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,287
I don't like the font,

325
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:38,164
-but I appreciate it.
-Such a smart-ass, aren't you?

326
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:40,750
You're so annoying. Just give it back.

327
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,253
Give it back. Give that to me.

328
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,171
Let's go.

329
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,674
We should get out of here.

330
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,233
-Wait.
-Stay in the car!

331
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,944
Stay here? Okay. I got it.

332
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:09,654
I…

333
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:17,537
Boss. Boss?

334
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:21,166
I will do my best, okay?

335
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,626
Calm down.

336
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:27,172
What's he doing? I mean, boss.

337
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,884
Hey. My gosh.

338
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,773
That crazy asshole.

339
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:50,278
Get out.

340
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:51,946
All right, I got it.

341
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,448
Okay. I got it.

342
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,371
Am I dreaming?

343
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:05,210
I never lost twice in a row
in my life. Never.

344
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,630
This isn't real.

345
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:10,590
What is this?

346
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:14,552
Well, I'm very sorry.

347
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:20,850
Never in a million years did I think
they'd go after

348
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,394
Director Gil's wife. Never.

349
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:25,355
I let my guard down
and failed to assess my enemy.

350
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,366
It's not that
you failed to assess your enemy.

351
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,910
It's that your method is old-fashioned.

352
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:41,871
You guys have no creativity.

353
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:43,498
-In Korean, it's--
-We know.

354
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,209
-Yes, you know.
-Yes.

355
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:49,337
We will start working creatively
from now on.

356
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:52,549
Are you kidding me?

357
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,385
Creativity is something you're born with,

358
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:57,095
just like Vincenzo Cassano!

359
00:26:58,012 --> 00:27:01,766
Sir, do you know anything about Vincenzo?

360
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,476
Isn't he the perfect lawyer?

361
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:06,438
He's spotless
to the point of being invisible.

362
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:10,984
First, go after Hong Cha-young.

363
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,069
Take her for everything she has.

364
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:16,739
Money, her license, everything.

365
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:19,909
I'll take care of Vincenzo.

366
00:27:20,952 --> 00:27:23,037
And I will also take care of

367
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:26,040
-buying the Namdongbu office.
-No, I'll do it.

368
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:28,585
-Are you serious?
-Give me a chance to redeem myself.

369
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:30,044
A chance

370
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:32,964
is reserved for only those who are worthy.

371
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:36,009
I will prove myself to be worthy
of that chance again.

372
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,552
You have three days.

373
00:27:38,803 --> 00:27:39,637
Three days.

374
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:52,567
You want me to win
with this useless intel?

375
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,571
Tell me the truth. You assholes are trying
to destroy me, aren't you?

376
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:58,239
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

377
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,283
You're sorry?

378
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:02,410
Will you say that at my funeral too?

379
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:04,496
I'm sorry.

380
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:11,753
All of you, stop whatever you are doing
and get me everything on Cha-young.

381
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:15,256
Including her call history,
everything she ate and drank,

382
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,050
whatever she printed,

383
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:20,637
and the snacks she ate at the lounge.
Get me everything. Got it?

384
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,846
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

385
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,932
Don't stand there. Get out!

386
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:47,330
Hello, sir.

387
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:49,207
It's me.

388
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,126
Thank you so much for your help.

389
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,003
Thank you.

390
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:57,841
Our wishes and wisdom from Buddha

391
00:28:57,924 --> 00:29:00,051
must have reached your hearts.

392
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:04,097
This is amazing.
There's no other way to describe this.

393
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,058
-You finished them in one blow.
-But I prepared all the files.

394
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:09,853
Okay. You love taking the credit.

395
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:15,692
<i>This man defeated Goliath.</i>

396
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,610
<i>Now, I can't even guess</i>

397
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:19,696
<i>the things he's able to accomplish.</i>

398
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,114
You should come have dinner.

399
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:24,033
I'd like to serve
the new dishes I developed to you two.

400
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:28,830
Maybe I'll offer you
a nice cup of coffee instead.

401
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:31,791
Let's have a meeting tomorrow.

402
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,669
What meeting, Mr. Cassano?

403
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:36,296
A meeting about the plaza.

404
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,257
I am sure you will be happy
to hear the news.

405
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:45,597
He said it's good news.

406
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,057
Why are you all so silent?

407
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:50,727
-That's great. Awesome.
-Yes. Nice.

408
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:54,856
-Tomorrow? Tomorrow is great.
-Yes.

409
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:56,024
-Good.
-Yes.

410
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:58,192
Let's meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

411
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,652
-At 11 a.m.
-I see.

412
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:02,447
-Around that time…
-Then…

413
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,699
Didn't we have an appointment?

414
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:06,618
-I think we did.
-Right.

415
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:10,538
-I'm sure we had plans at that time.
-Right.

416
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,918
TEAM LEADER NA OF BABEL E&C

417
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,419
I did everything I could,

418
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:18,630
but I cannot stall this project anymore.

419
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:21,507
Make it happen.

420
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:23,801
I really can't.

421
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:27,305
The order came directly from the chairman.

422
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:29,140
If I don't demolish it in a week,

423
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:31,935
he'll fire me and take over the project.

424
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:38,399
-A week?
-Yes. A week.

425
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,193
Seven days. One week.

426
00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:42,695
And, for your information,

427
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:47,200
I ended it with my mistress.
I'm devoted to my family now.

428
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:51,120
I've been going camping with an RV
with my wife every weekend.

429
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:54,749
And we make <i>gambas</i> by the bonfire.
We also play the guitar.

430
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:56,250
So what should I do?

431
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:59,253
Keep going camping with your wife.

432
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:03,049
If you cheat on her again,

433
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,593
you'll be dead for real.

434
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:08,638
-Gosh.
-Yes, Mr. Cho.

435
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:11,724
We went to Eurwangni last week.

436
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:14,936
Are you sure?

437
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:15,937
Yes.

438
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,400
He's a Korean-Japanese
architecture professor in Tokyo.

439
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:24,320
He said there might be a way to get into
the basement while minimizing the impact.

440
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,280
Does he know about the plaza's condition?

441
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:30,660
Of course. He's done it before
on buildings that are over 100 years old.

442
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,328
-And you can trust him?
<i>-Yes.</i>

443
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:34,706
<i>I can vouch for him.</i>

444
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:36,541
When will he be in Korea?

445
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:39,544
As this is urgent,
I asked him to come by tonight.

446
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:41,462
Great.

447
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,507
Good work. Bye.

448
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,594
What?

449
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,307
How dare you?

450
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,853
You think I'm a joke because
you have a few judges on your payroll?

451
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,647
That's a misunderstanding.

452
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:03,484
I know that I can't move you with money.

453
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:06,863
We are here because we would like to

454
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:08,990
help your future in politics.

455
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:10,199
What is it?

456
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,368
Will Babel help me become the president?

457
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:16,998
Gosh. As long as we have you,
anything is possible.

458
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,458
Shut your mouth.

459
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:22,462
Why would assholes like you
care about my future?

460
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:24,547
Babel is unbelievable.

461
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,090
Sir.

462
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:29,677
Our chairman truly respects you.

463
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,095
Hey!

464
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:32,764
I told you to shut up.

465
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,642
If you call me again
for something like this…

466
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:40,521
I don't care if it's Wusang or Babel.
I'll throw all of you in jail! Got it?

467
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:44,025
Don't forget that.

468
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:45,276
Sir.

469
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,405
Myung-hee, you should know your place.

470
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,157
You can't leave like this.

471
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:10,843
It was a bust, right?

472
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:15,556
Damn it.

473
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,205
BEAUTY SALON

474
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:45,044
FOR RENT OR SALE

475
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:12,488
Gosh, this is crazy.

476
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:27,920
No! Get away!

477
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:30,089
-Don't come near!
-I'm Yeong-ho!

478
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:31,591
It's me, Yeong-ho.

479
00:34:31,674 --> 00:34:33,050
-No, you're not!
-I'm Yeong-ho.

480
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:34,719
-You're not him!
-What's wrong?

481
00:34:34,802 --> 00:34:35,761
I'm Yeong-ho.

482
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,972
-My gosh.
-Yeong-ho?

483
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:38,931
Yes.

484
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:42,393
What's wrong with your face?

485
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,395
I started my own bizarre comedy channel.

486
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,438
What?

487
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:47,899
What are you talking about?

488
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,069
If you liked today's video, please

489
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:55,156
And I'll be back with a better video
next week. Bye.

490
00:34:57,366 --> 00:34:58,993
Why this, of all things?

491
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:02,622
I'm being productive. I even quit smoking.

492
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:04,832
Then you should focus on your studies!

493
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,668
I'm better suited for this than studying.

494
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,045
So let me be.

495
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:12,548
You get scared so easily.

496
00:35:15,092 --> 00:35:16,594
This is so cool.

497
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:21,599
This is so cool.

498
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:26,229
<i>Coach Giuseppe Rossi of BC Milano,
a world-renowned Italian football team,</i>

499
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:28,856
<i>has started his four-day visit in Korea.</i>

500
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:31,567
<i>Coach Rossi who landed in Korea
this morning</i>

501
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,987
<i>watched the matches
between youth soccer teams in person</i>

502
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:37,949
<i>and announced that he's looking
for the next Son Heung-min.</i>

503
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:42,161
<i>According to a source from BC Milano,
they plan to scout promising players,</i>

504
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,956
<i>put them through
a one-month tryout in Milan,</i>

505
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,000
<i>and train the selected players.</i>

506
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,671
This has grabbed the attention of
soccer fans worldwide

507
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:56,175
who are looking forward to
the discovery of the next Son Heung-min.

508
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,621
Yes, Mr. Cho.

509
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:28,708
<i>The architecture professor
has arrived at the airport now.</i>

510
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,084
<i>Should we meet tomorrow?</i>

511
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,753
No, let's meet now.

512
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:38,175
Mr. Cho.

513
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,845
Yes?

514
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:42,722
Why did you want to meet this late?

515
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:50,187
I wanted to see the moonlight
reflected on your heads.

516
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:51,689
Pardon?

517
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:54,567
I was joking.

518
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:57,778
I'm sorry.

519
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:02,366
Actually,
I wanted to ask you a few questions.

520
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,784
Come to our temple, then.

521
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,077
No!

522
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:11,083
I've become allergic
to basements recently,

523
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,252
so I can't even take the subway now.

524
00:37:13,336 --> 00:37:16,047
-Let us talk here, then.
-Yes.

525
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,840
So what are your questions?

526
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:21,886
What should people who want
to be vegetarian be careful with?

527
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,679
And…

528
00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:27,350
if you forget the words of the scriptures
while reciting them,

529
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,852
do you improvise?

530
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:33,272
Girls like guys who go to church,
but how come they don't fall for monks?

531
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,194
I wanted to ask these three questions.

532
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,083
What do you think?

533
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,002
My gosh. I didn't know it'd be this bad.

534
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:58,172
The workers did a shoddy job.
The beams and columns are the worst.

535
00:37:59,382 --> 00:38:01,634
Then, is it impossible
to get into the basement?

536
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:03,511
I'm afraid so.

537
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:07,223
Drilling 30cm will be enough
to bring down the whole building.

538
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,141
All right. More.

539
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:52,893
-Drink some more.
-Yes, sir.

540
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:55,521
Gosh.

541
00:38:55,604 --> 00:38:57,481
There's no need for that. We're brothers.

542
00:38:58,232 --> 00:38:59,275
Okay.

543
00:39:02,027 --> 00:39:03,028
Thank you.

544
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:12,037
Are you ready?

545
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:14,206
There will be a storm tomorrow.

546
00:39:15,124 --> 00:39:16,792
Yes. I'm ready.

547
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,295
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

548
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,213
It's just you and me now.

549
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:24,675
You got the company,
and I got the legal world, okay?

550
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:26,510
Yes.

551
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:29,972
I thought our old man was wrong,
but he was right.

552
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,851
Don't ever put your trust in anyone else

553
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:35,186
or give out compliments.

554
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:37,897
Yes, I don't trust anyone but you.

555
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:41,984
I won't listen to anyone but you.

556
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:44,820
Gosh, my little brother.

557
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:49,742
If you were just a tad bit smarter,
I would've adored you infinitely.

558
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:00,711
I have a question.

559
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,798
If I keep disappointing you,

560
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,886
will you do me in like you did with Dad?

561
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:11,096
What?

562
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:16,101
Like what you did to Dad that day.

563
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,286
This is what you told me
when I entered middle school.

564
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,749
"To become a successful businessman,

565
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:42,294
live a life that cannot end up
in a biography."

566
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:47,216
I'll do exactly that, Dad.

567
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,680
Die already.

568
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:38,809
Apologize to Mom when you…

569
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:43,230
You wouldn't be able to see Mom,

570
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,777
because you'll dive head-first into hell.

571
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:11,383
Come on in. He's gone.

572
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:26,148
<i>You knew?</i>

573
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:28,192
That I sent him away?

574
00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:32,738
Yes. Of course, I knew.

575
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,410
You aren't that stupid after all.

576
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,790
You're quite smart, actually.

577
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,919
I'm so proud of you, Han-seo.

578
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:51,215
Gosh, I was so wrong about my brother.

579
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:56,011
Thank you

580
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,097
for acknowledging that.

581
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,516
By the way, Han-seo.

582
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:03,435
I don't like your eyes these days.

583
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:05,979
They remind me of Dad.

584
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,611
No, actually…

585
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:15,823
It's because I didn't get
much sleep lately.

586
00:43:16,782 --> 00:43:18,992
It's just that my eyes are tired.

587
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,329
I was just joking, you fool.

588
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:28,168
You're his son.
Of course, you resemble him.

589
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:37,428
Here.

590
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:39,138
Eat it.

591
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:43,767
Eat it. Okay?

592
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:10,794
We've run out of options.

593
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:13,380
And the plaza will be demolished
in a week.

594
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:15,883
We don't have any other ways
to get into the basement.

595
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:20,053
But we can't keep throwing parties.

596
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:23,182
How about we demolish it at a random time?

597
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,645
Unless the police and the city office
are on our side, it's impossible.

598
00:44:30,981 --> 00:44:32,983
I guess the only thing we can do now

599
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:35,611
is to stall for time.

600
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:38,155
Do you have any other ideas?

601
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:42,826
There's a card I can't help but play.

602
00:44:45,037 --> 00:44:46,705
It's the most common method.

603
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:00,093
Gosh, it's burnt!.

604
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:33,085
TO NOT HAVE IS TO HAVE

605
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:45,764
4 DAYS AGO

606
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:49,518
By the way,

607
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:53,397
did you live abroad?
Why is your name Gilbert?

608
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,191
It's not actually a name. It's <i>gilbeot</i>,

609
00:45:57,025 --> 00:45:59,528
Korean for "a friend on the road."

610
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:02,906
-My goodness.
-I see.

611
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,409
So it means, "a friend on the street"?

612
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:07,536
I thought you were from the US.

613
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,329
We gave you food. Now tell us.

614
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:11,540
You said you'd tell us
something important.

615
00:46:11,623 --> 00:46:15,627
Right. There's gold inside this building.

616
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:17,921
A lot of it.

617
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,715
A lot of gold.

618
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:30,100
It's true.

619
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:33,353
-I saw it.
-What did you see?

620
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:36,189
What was left behind by the people
who moved the gold when they died.

621
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:38,400
What do you mean they died?

622
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:39,693
Was it three years ago?

623
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,946
I was hiding in a bar
to get some free food.

624
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:45,866
And the people
who moved gold into this plaza…

625
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:50,537
were drinking there.

626
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,665
And they said

627
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:57,336
that they moved
12 billion won's worth of gold bars

628
00:46:57,419 --> 00:46:59,004
to this plaza.

629
00:47:00,964 --> 00:47:03,216
-Good work.
-Good job.

630
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:11,058
Hello.

631
00:47:34,956 --> 00:47:37,376
<i>So, you're saying</i>

632
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:39,961
that someone killed the workers
who moved the gold?

633
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:45,717
Yes. It was to keep it secret.

634
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:48,762
The person who hid the gold bars--

635
00:47:48,845 --> 00:47:50,722
That's a load of crap.

636
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:53,850
What a load of bull.
Do you take us for fools?

637
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:55,686
I'm telling the truth.

638
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:58,105
Hey, do you think I'm a joke? Seriously.

639
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:00,565
-All right.
-My goodness.

640
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:01,942
Let me see.

641
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:08,990
This phone belonged to one of the workers
who died that night.

642
00:48:11,243 --> 00:48:14,579
Gosh. Isn't that real gold behind him?

643
00:48:14,663 --> 00:48:17,708
Right. What are they called?

644
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,252
They're gold bars, aren't they?

645
00:48:20,335 --> 00:48:22,546
The gold bars are inside this building.

646
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:25,215
Fine. Let's say they are.

647
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:27,300
Where did they hide them then?

648
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:31,054
I didn't hear where.
If I knew, I would've gotten it myself.

649
00:48:31,138 --> 00:48:32,973
Come on. Goodness.

650
00:48:33,056 --> 00:48:34,766
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

651
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,727
Why are you taking him so seriously?

652
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,480
I mean, he even has the photo
of the gold bars. Look.

653
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:44,067
There are a lot of studios
that take photos like that.

654
00:48:46,027 --> 00:48:47,529
Right. That makes no sense.

655
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:50,907
How can there be
12 billion won's worth of gold here?

656
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,579
I believe it's just a rumor.

657
00:48:56,913 --> 00:48:58,707
Probably, right?

658
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:01,585
What a funny rumor that is.

659
00:49:01,668 --> 00:49:03,795
You're quite a character, Gilbert.

660
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:10,886
I'm telling the truth. Damn it.

661
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:21,021
<i>Next on the news.</i>

662
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:24,775
<i>Chairman Jang Han-seo of Babel
issued an apology</i>

663
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:29,321
<i>to the victims of Babel Chemicals,
promised to compensate them</i>

664
00:49:29,404 --> 00:49:33,200
<i>and to immediately start working on
preventive measures starting today.</i>

665
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:38,538
<i>We were at the scene where he
issued his heart-felt apology.</i>

666
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:39,873
<i>This was what he said.</i>

667
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:43,835
<i>I would like to express
my deepest regret and apologies</i>

668
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,923
<i>to all those who are concerned.</i>

669
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:52,844
<i>The Babel Group</i>

670
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:57,307
<i>feels a great sense of responsibility
for the recent incidents.</i>

671
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:02,312
<i>-I would like to personally…</i>
-He's an awful actor.

672
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:04,815
I agree. He should have taken
acting lessons.

673
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:06,942
He doesn't sound sincere at all.

674
00:50:07,526 --> 00:50:09,778
That's not for the victims anyway.

675
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:13,490
It's to lighten the sentence
in case he's charged with anything.

676
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:17,619
My goodness. How embarrassing!

677
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:21,790
This post was just uploaded
to the anonymous forum for lawyers.

678
00:50:21,873 --> 00:50:23,208
It's about Choi Myung-hee.

679
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:26,253
She tried to bribe Chief Prosecutor
Hwang Jin-tae and failed.

680
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:31,049
How can such a secretive story
spread this fast?

681
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:33,343
If you make a fool of yourself
in our industry,

682
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:35,387
you get burnt twice with these rumors.

683
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:39,558
She must've offered him a hefty sum,
but he didn't bite.

684
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:42,936
He's been on the Josam Group's payroll
for the last 20 years.

685
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:45,730
He has a lot of money
and has no interest in bribes.

686
00:50:45,814 --> 00:50:49,317
He just wants to set up his own cartel
to move up the ladder.

687
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,321
It's 11 a.m. It's time
for our meeting with the tenants.

688
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:56,449
Right. Let's go.

689
00:50:58,827 --> 00:51:01,705
I'm sure you've heard already.
Mr. Cassano is trying

690
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:03,331
to make good on his promise.

691
00:51:03,415 --> 00:51:05,834
He'll purchase a building in Sangchi-dong

692
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:08,712
and will relocate you there.

693
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:11,131
That's right.

694
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:14,384
I will do my best to find a building
where you can

695
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:16,261
work as well as live.

696
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:18,430
That's great. Awesome.

697
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,764
Aren't you happy?

698
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:21,892
-Great.
-Sounds great.

699
00:51:21,975 --> 00:51:23,101
Good.

700
00:51:25,937 --> 00:51:29,107
Oh, my. I've never seen
such a peaceful crowd.

701
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,109
All you need are some doves flying around.

702
00:51:31,192 --> 00:51:33,737
Are you the delivery man?
You come here daily.

703
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,740
If he was delivering something,
we'd at least be excited.

704
00:51:36,823 --> 00:51:38,825
The same goes for your face!

705
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:41,077
Stop cutting me off and move. Come on.

706
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:43,580
I'm sorry.
The sight of him makes me lose my temper.

707
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:48,710
I heard that you are all moving
to a nice place. Where?

708
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:50,462
-Sangchi-dong.
-That's right.

709
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:51,630
How…

710
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:53,298
How did you know that?

711
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:55,717
Nothing gets past by me
in this neighborhood.

712
00:51:57,844 --> 00:52:01,139
Well, I wish you all the best.
But before you go,

713
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:03,183
don't forget to sign the agreement.

714
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:05,977
But we're not moving out.

715
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:08,021
My gosh.

716
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:09,689
Why not?

717
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:10,857
You're not?

718
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:15,070
How should I put it?
This building is our home

719
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:16,905
and a resting place for us.

720
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:18,490
We must protect it.

721
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:20,408
This place is stained

722
00:52:21,284 --> 00:52:23,036
with the sweat from our brows.

723
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,663
You know what?

724
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:28,208
This plaza is
like the heart of Geumga-dong.

725
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:29,626
It's a sacred place!

726
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:31,044
What's wrong with you?

727
00:52:31,127 --> 00:52:33,004
Sangchi-dong is a much better place.

728
00:52:33,088 --> 00:52:36,716
And that's not my turf,
so I promise I won't even go near there.

729
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,134
We're still not moving out!

730
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:40,720
We will fight to our deaths
to protect this place.

731
00:52:40,804 --> 00:52:42,806
-What? Why?
-We'll never leave!

732
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:45,183
-What do you think happened?
-Why all of a sudden?

733
00:52:45,266 --> 00:52:47,644
-We'll never leave here!
-You said you'd sign it!

734
00:52:47,727 --> 00:52:49,437
-Come on. Hong-sik.
-Never!

735
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:50,939
Everyone!

736
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:54,693
Guys.

737
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:57,028
Until now,

738
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:58,989
we have been too weak.

739
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:02,909
It's time for us to join hands

740
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:06,079
and fight.

741
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:08,164
We are Geumga Plaza!

742
00:53:08,248 --> 00:53:11,126
Geumga Plaza is what we are!

743
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:12,752
Let's fight!

744
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:16,423
Let's protect this place
with everything we've got!

745
00:53:16,506 --> 00:53:17,716
Fight!

746
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:20,010
-We will fight.
-Fight!

747
00:53:20,093 --> 00:53:21,678
-Fight!
-Fight!

748
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:23,763
-Fight!
-Fight!

749
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:27,017
-Fight!
-Fight!

750
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,227
-Fight!
-Fight!

751
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,147
-We will fight!
-Fight!

752
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,690
-Let's go!
-Fight!

753
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:36,067
-Fight!
-Geumga!

754
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:38,486
-Fight!
-Fight!

755
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,906
They've got to be kidding.

756
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,617
Why do they always end up chanting
and trying to fight us?

757
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,327
I really don't get it.

758
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:48,830
What else are they going to do? Sing?

759
00:53:49,372 --> 00:53:52,709
<i>Here comes the bird</i>

760
00:53:54,002 --> 00:53:55,462
Sing a song?

761
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:57,630
That was so lame.

762
00:53:58,214 --> 00:54:00,008
-My pride is hurt.
-I'll kill him.

763
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:02,594
-Stop him.
-Sir, please.

764
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:05,930
Let go of me. Come on. Stop it.
I'm getting a call.

765
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:11,394
Yes, sir.

766
00:54:14,272 --> 00:54:15,440
Really?

767
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:19,152
Then we can raid this place, right?

768
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:23,406
Why are they so fickle?
What's gotten into them?

769
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,575
They said they'd go!

770
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:29,662
Why are they doing this to me? Why?

771
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:32,415
-He's still handsome when he gets angry.
-Damn it!

772
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,422
Show me your angry face, Mr. Nam.

773
00:54:46,513 --> 00:54:48,306
You should stick to smiling.

774
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,933
Ms. Hong Cha-young.

775
00:54:50,016 --> 00:54:52,102
What is it now?

776
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:55,146
You're under arrest
for malpractice, embezzlement,

777
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,691
violating the attorney-at-law act,
making threats and forgery.

778
00:54:58,775 --> 00:54:59,818
-Let's go.
-What?

779
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:03,279
She's not some professional criminal.
Those charges are ridiculous.

780
00:55:03,363 --> 00:55:04,572
Step back.

781
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:06,491
Do you even have evidence?

782
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:09,786
She'll find out at the station.

783
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,204
Gosh, Choi Myung-hee.

784
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:13,748
She must've launched
one of her vendetta operations.

785
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,627
-You startled me.
-What was that?

786
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:21,923
You're very cooperative today.

787
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:24,008
Let's go. Come with us.

788
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:37,856
Aren't these colorful?
It's like the Olympic flag.

789
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:41,401
We have evidence
of your illegal activities

790
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:42,986
in these five flash drives.

791
00:55:44,946 --> 00:55:49,033
People at Wusang are so diligent.
They worked so hard to fabricate evidence.

792
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:52,495
We object to the validity of the evidence.

793
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:53,872
Hey!

794
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:56,749
Object all you want.

795
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,085
These are irrefutable.

796
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:01,671
Hey. It's this one.

797
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:03,339
-Is that right?
-Yes.

798
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:26,029
Just in case

799
00:56:26,988 --> 00:56:29,699
I end up taking the fall
for all of those charges…

800
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:31,451
Let me see.

801
00:56:33,203 --> 00:56:36,706
I'll be released from prison
after three Olympic Games.

802
00:56:38,166 --> 00:56:41,920
The flash drives in the Olympic
flag colors meant something.

803
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:46,925
This isn't the time for that.

804
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,011
This is way more serious than last time.

805
00:56:50,094 --> 00:56:53,056
I can laugh because I know
you'll get me out of here.

806
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:56,226
It won't be easy.

807
00:56:56,768 --> 00:56:59,020
Their evidence seems to be
impenetrable this time.

808
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:02,941
Then do something…

809
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:07,070
Mr. Mafia Lawyer.

810
00:57:11,115 --> 00:57:13,952
Handle this matter
like a member of the Mafia.

811
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:15,954
Do it.

812
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:20,667
I'm not in the Mafia.

813
00:57:22,919 --> 00:57:24,587
Enough with your act.

814
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,924
It's getting difficult playing dumb.

815
00:57:28,508 --> 00:57:30,426
I mean, what I meant was…

816
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:34,973
How did you know?

817
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:43,815
You stabbed Jang's pillow with syringes,
burnt down their warehouse,

818
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:46,943
fired guns, and found out
confidential information.

819
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:51,155
How can an ordinary lawyer do all that?

820
00:57:52,323 --> 00:57:54,117
Do you think I'm a fool?

821
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:57,996
You always brought up the Mafia
every chance you had.

822
00:57:58,496 --> 00:58:00,540
So how could I not know?

823
00:58:04,419 --> 00:58:05,712
Hurry.

824
00:58:05,795 --> 00:58:08,423
In 48 hours, I will be transferred
to a detention center

825
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:10,174
and be in a prison uniform.

826
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:12,969
Okay. I'll handle it.

827
00:58:13,052 --> 00:58:14,304
I'll do it my way.

828
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:20,101
Great. That's what I wanted to hear.

829
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:27,025
Don't come back
until you make this go away.

830
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:00,016
<i>It's about Choi Myung-hee.</i>

831
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:03,436
<i>She tried to bribe Chief Prosecutor
Hwang Jin-tae and failed.</i>

832
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:29,170
-I'm going all-in.
-Going all-in.

833
00:59:29,754 --> 00:59:31,089
No more bets, please.

834
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:34,634
Player. Banker. Player. Banker.

835
00:59:34,717 --> 00:59:35,968
Player's card

836
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:37,512
Banker's card.

837
00:59:46,187 --> 00:59:47,522
The banker stays at seven.

838
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,525
Player, six. Banker wins.

839
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:08,042
Bet on the player.

840
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:12,255
I don't want to.

841
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:15,842
I will keep betting on the banker.

842
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:21,597
You're not good at games of chance.

843
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:24,851
People who are good at games of chance

844
01:00:25,768 --> 01:00:26,686
are con artists.

845
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:32,608
No more bets, please.

846
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:37,238
Player. Banker. Player. Banker.

847
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:39,782
Player's card

848
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:41,909
Banker's card.

849
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:54,756
Banker, let's play.

850
01:00:55,548 --> 01:00:56,507
Player, open.

851
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:08,561
Player, a natural line.
The player wins.

852
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:10,521
Damn it.

853
01:01:27,663 --> 01:01:29,457
I wonder why you're here.

854
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,128
Right, Cha-young will be thrown in jail
in two days.

855
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:38,883
Don't you dare try to cut a deal with me
to get her out.

856
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,802
You've got nothing I want.

857
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:48,184
But I'm sure you do.

858
01:01:49,477 --> 01:01:51,938
How about Chief Prosecutor Hwang Jin-tae?

859
01:01:54,899 --> 01:01:57,485
I guess word travels fast.

860
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,531
I'll deal with him for you.

861
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:03,533
Release Ms. Hong.

862
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:14,043
This is a contract.

863
01:02:15,086 --> 01:02:17,213
It states that you will release Ms. Hong

864
01:02:17,296 --> 01:02:19,841
if I help you with Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

865
01:02:19,924 --> 01:02:21,926
CONTRACT

866
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,850
Do you want a fountain pen?

867
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:32,353
Are you pulling my leg?

868
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:39,151
I guess I haven't made
enough of an impression on you yet.

869
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:44,574
Should we go and do some laundry?

870
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:52,957
Why? Don't you believe me?

871
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,668
I guess

872
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:59,547
you have no problem
trusting someone who tried to kill you.

873
01:03:04,385 --> 01:03:07,388
Sometimes, trusting your enemy
can bring you luck.

874
01:03:08,222 --> 01:03:10,850
Of course,
it's not an easy decision to make.

875
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:23,321
-That's it.
-Over here.

876
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,245
-Be faster when you pass.
-Go.

877
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:33,289
Go.

878
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,709
There you go.

879
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:41,631
Great. Keep going.

880
01:03:41,714 --> 01:03:43,382
-Pass it.
-Pass.

881
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:46,636
-Goal!
-Good.That was great.

882
01:04:00,524 --> 01:04:02,652
Put some distance there.

883
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:04,528
-Good.
-Pass it over.

884
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:09,659
Did you know?

885
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:10,576
Pardon?

886
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:14,372
Coach Giuseppe Rossi
of BC Milano is in Korea now.

887
01:04:15,164 --> 01:04:17,208
Gosh. I know.

888
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:22,505
I also know that he visited
all the other youth teams except ours.

889
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:26,342
Goodness. This soccer club
can't do anything right.

890
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,012
Number 21 is your son, isn't he?

891
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:31,889
What? You know my son?

892
01:04:32,723 --> 01:04:33,808
He's good.

893
01:04:34,475 --> 01:04:35,851
He is, right?

894
01:04:35,935 --> 01:04:37,937
Are you a family too?

895
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:41,524
I'm here because I need to talk to you,

896
01:04:42,108 --> 01:04:43,150
Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

897
01:04:45,111 --> 01:04:45,945
Who are you?

898
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:48,406
I'm an acquaintance of Choi Myung-hee.

899
01:04:49,615 --> 01:04:52,451
You must be out of your mind.
How dare you come here?

900
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:53,703
Hey. Leave.

901
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,414
Just give me one minute.

902
01:04:56,497 --> 01:04:58,082
I can't even give you a second.

903
01:04:58,165 --> 01:05:00,584
If you accept Choi Myung-hee's offer,

904
01:05:00,668 --> 01:05:03,170
I'll give you the thing you want the most.

905
01:05:05,256 --> 01:05:06,966
What is it that I want the most?

906
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:12,388
Isn't it your dream

907
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:14,724
to send your son to the European league?

908
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,727
I can make that happen

909
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:20,312
within 24 hours.

910
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:23,482
What kind of crap is that?

911
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:25,401
Who the hell are you?

912
01:05:36,912 --> 01:05:37,955
Wait.

913
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:48,215
Isn't that…

914
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:51,177
Sir, I didn't know that
Coach Rossi of BC Milano

915
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,928
was going to visit our club.

916
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:58,684
Number 21.

917
01:05:58,768 --> 01:05:59,977
-Him?
-Me?

918
01:06:00,061 --> 01:06:01,062
That's my son.

919
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:02,063
Vincenzo!

920
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:03,147
Giuseppe!

921
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:05,816
-How are you?
-Very good. Thanks.

922
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:09,153
Is this the guy? Number 21?

923
01:06:09,737 --> 01:06:10,571
Yes.

924
01:06:12,573 --> 01:06:14,867
He's the worst player here.

925
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,703
Yes, it's him.

926
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:18,871
I'm sorry.

927
01:06:18,954 --> 01:06:20,164
Don't worry about it.

928
01:06:23,834 --> 01:06:25,753
-I'm so jealous.
-I'm so jealous.

929
01:06:26,754 --> 01:06:27,755
We're friends.

930
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:40,059
Yes!

931
01:06:46,482 --> 01:06:48,150
SNAKE HWANG

932
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:51,570
ATTORNEY CHOI MYUNG-HEE

933
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:57,660
Hello, Chief Hwang.

934
01:07:00,246 --> 01:07:03,582
About the discussion we had the other day…
Let's try that again.

935
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:06,544
Do you really mean it?

936
01:07:07,545 --> 01:07:08,462
Yes.

937
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,590
Okay. I got it.

938
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:14,343
Thank you, sir.

939
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:13,819
How on earth did you do it? How?

940
01:08:14,945 --> 01:08:16,071
Let's talk outside.

941
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,658
I hope we'll never see each other again.

942
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:22,077
I should be saying that to you.

943
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:30,961
Come on.

944
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:33,047
Let's go.

945
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:39,553
Come on. How did you do it?

946
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:42,723
I cut a deal with Choi Myung-hee.

947
01:08:45,017 --> 01:08:46,393
What deal?

948
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:58,197
I got her to release you in exchange
for convincing Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

949
01:09:03,244 --> 01:09:04,078
So…

950
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,998
you cut a deal with Choi Myung-hee
who I despise the most.

951
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:11,585
As if that wasn't enough, you gave
Chief Hwang to her on a silver platter?

952
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:13,671
Just to get me out?

953
01:09:14,797 --> 01:09:16,048
I'm sorry.

954
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,008
I had no choice.

955
01:09:24,556 --> 01:09:25,516
Good job.

956
01:09:25,599 --> 01:09:28,227
Well done. That's what I'm talking about!

957
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,645
That's so Mafia-like.

958
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:31,855
You made an offer
she couldn't resist, right?

959
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:35,859
You really are Mr. Mafia Lawyer.
I knew you could do it.

960
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:37,569
Well done.

961
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:40,364
Be quiet and let's go. Come on.

962
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:44,535
Police officers, he's in the Mafia.
Isn't that fascinating?

963
01:09:44,618 --> 01:09:45,786
It fascinates me, too.

964
01:09:45,869 --> 01:09:47,746
I'm taking her to the hospital.

965
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,665
How is this possible in Korea?

966
01:09:56,755 --> 01:09:58,340
-Honey, this is heavy.
-Okay.

967
01:09:58,424 --> 01:09:59,550
-Take this for me.
-Here.

968
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,177
What's all that?

969
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:06,015
Oh, this? The protesters
at the next building used these.

970
01:10:06,098 --> 01:10:07,975
We'll need these if we're going to fight.

971
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:10,602
It all comes down to
what you equip yourself with.

972
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:13,564
They make me want to fight even more.

973
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:17,609
My goodness. I see.

974
01:10:17,693 --> 01:10:19,903
Gosh. You look beautiful.

975
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:21,697
You look like a goddess.

976
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,324
Goodness.

977
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:27,411
It's my birthday today,
so I gave myself a present.

978
01:10:28,495 --> 01:10:30,539
I didn't know it was your birthday today.

979
01:10:30,622 --> 01:10:32,666
It's all right.

980
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,128
Everyone, close your businesses early
and let's drink until we drop

981
01:10:36,211 --> 01:10:38,047
at my snack bar.

982
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,299
-Are we having a party?
-I love it.

983
01:10:40,382 --> 01:10:42,217
You look pretty.

984
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:44,762
-Hello.
-Stop it. That's enough.

985
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:48,140
Okay. This order is
from the team leader at Babel.

986
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:50,726
Only an elite group of us will go
without any machinery.

987
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:52,394
-Are the guys ready?
-Yes, sir.

988
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:53,854
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, and

989
01:10:53,937 --> 01:10:56,190
the protesters will be
wearing red jackets.

990
01:10:56,273 --> 01:10:58,484
Only beat up the ones
wearing red jackets, okay?

991
01:10:58,567 --> 01:10:59,485
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

992
01:10:59,568 --> 01:11:02,821
All right. If you have your tools ready,
let's go!

993
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:03,947
Excuse me.

994
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:07,701
I have to report surtaxes today.
I need receipts from your meal.

995
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:10,913
Do we really have to do that right now?

996
01:11:10,996 --> 01:11:13,665
The deadline is tomorrow.
Give me the receipts.

997
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:15,626
Come on. She has to report surtaxes.

998
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:18,003
So just give her the receipts. Now.

999
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:20,297
Who has the receipt for <i>jjolmyeon</i>
from yesterday?

1000
01:11:20,381 --> 01:11:22,299
-That's it. Yes. That's it.
-This is it?

1001
01:11:23,967 --> 01:11:25,386
Who ordered extra rice?

1002
01:11:27,846 --> 01:11:31,517
WE OPPOSE DEMOLITION
FIGHT

1003
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:00,838
Slow down.

1004
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:02,840
We need to hurry. It's almost time.

1005
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:03,757
Time for what?

1006
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:06,427
-Park Seok-do will raid the plaza soon.
-What?

1007
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,721
We should come up with a plan
before we just rush there.

1008
01:12:09,805 --> 01:12:11,056
Don't worry.

1009
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,435
I'm the one who made Park Seok-do
raid the plaza.

1010
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:20,107
I'll make Park Seok-do and his men
assault the tenants

1011
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,192
and expose that to the public.

1012
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,071
It will cause quite a scandal
on social media.

1013
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:29,116
They'll have to postpone
once people start condemning them.

1014
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,034
But the business owners may get hurt.

1015
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:32,453
You're right.

1016
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:34,329
That's why we can't hurt them.

1017
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:36,206
Get me some sturdy men

1018
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,459
and make them look like protesters.

1019
01:12:39,501 --> 01:12:40,961
Let them get beaten up a little.

1020
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:44,590
They can retreat once we get the footage.

1021
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:50,304
How will I know
if they can take a few punches?

1022
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:54,016
Yeong-ho.

1023
01:12:56,852 --> 01:12:59,980
I want you to film something
and post it on social media right away.

1024
01:13:00,564 --> 01:13:02,733
No, I don't want to. I'm busy.

1025
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:17,247
What do I need to film?

1026
01:13:18,499 --> 01:13:20,876
Order Park Seok-do to raid Geumga Plaza.

1027
01:13:20,959 --> 01:13:23,754
He's really dangerous.

1028
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:26,757
What if someone gets hurt or dies?

1029
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:29,301
They won't.

1030
01:13:30,385 --> 01:13:33,555
Have him attack
people wearing red jackets.

1031
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:38,519
You are indeed in the Mafia.
Your plan is thorough and original.

1032
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,065
Can you stop mentioning
that I'm in the Mafia?

1033
01:13:43,148 --> 01:13:46,068
But that's what you are.
Should I call you a yakuza instead?

1034
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,072
<i>Mafia</i>

1035
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:03,919
Yes.

1036
01:14:05,003 --> 01:14:06,171
The health center?

1037
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:08,674
What?

1038
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:11,176
I was in contact with a carrier?

1039
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:19,893
Thank you.

1040
01:14:20,894 --> 01:14:24,815
<i>I want to bury my face</i>

1041
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:29,027

01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:06,940
Don't you work at the pasta place?

1047
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:08,025
Yes.

1048
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:11,862
-What is it?
-How dare you talk back?

1049
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:14,323
Hey, it's a red jacket!

1050
01:15:14,406 --> 01:15:16,241
-Hey, he's wearing red!
-Hello.

1051
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:19,411

01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:42,434
Mom!

1058
01:15:43,143 --> 01:15:44,645
Mom, come on!

1059
01:15:44,728 --> 01:15:48,148
You brat. How dare you interrupt
your mom when she's singing?

1060
01:15:48,231 --> 01:15:50,400
You know those thugs that come here?

1061
01:15:50,484 --> 01:15:52,194
They are beating up Mr. An.

1062
01:15:52,277 --> 01:15:53,362
-What?
-What?

1063
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:55,572
-Damn it.
-What?

1064
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:58,659
Those assholes have
really asked for it now.

1065
01:15:58,742 --> 01:16:00,077
There will be blood!

1066
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,120
They brought this upon themselves.

1067
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:03,580
I'll kill them all.

1068
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:06,583
-Let's go.
-Let's do this!

1069
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,959
-Wait.
-Let's go.

1070
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:10,796
-Let's go!
-Let's teach them a lesson!

1071
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,923
-Let's go get them.
-Let's go.

1072
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:15,342
-Are you wearing shoes?
-Go!

1073
01:16:15,425 --> 01:16:17,302
Are you wearing shoes?

1074
01:16:17,386 --> 01:16:19,346
-Let's go!
-We'll get them!

1075
01:16:23,892 --> 01:16:25,143
What's this?

1076
01:17:37,632 --> 01:17:38,633
Are they fighting?

1077
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:44,890
Mr. Cho.

1078
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:49,186
Yes. It's going very smoothly.

1079
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:50,145
What?

1080
01:17:50,771 --> 01:17:52,814
No. That can't be.

1081
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:57,277
One of the people I hired
came in contact with an infected person.

1082
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,490
They were afraid they might
end up infecting the others

1083
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:03,200
so they all went to get tested.

1084
01:18:05,368 --> 01:18:07,662
Then who are these people fighting here?

1085
01:18:12,959 --> 01:18:14,795
My goodness. Oh, my.

1086
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:24,596
I've seen this somewhere before.

1087
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:52,676
VINCENZO

1088
01:18:52,749 --> 01:18:54,835
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHA SOON-BAE
AND KIM BYUNG-JI

1089
01:19:19,693 --> 01:19:23,363
<i>We have to stop this investment
at all costs.</i>

1090
01:19:23,446 --> 01:19:26,616
You do know
that I still have your case, right?

1091
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,619
Don't waste your breath.

1092
01:19:29,703 --> 01:19:31,162
<i>Is there another way?</i>

1093
01:19:31,246 --> 01:19:35,000
There is a way to stop the investment
and bring down the president.

1094
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,460
<i>And villains don't deserve to love.</i>

1095
01:19:37,544 --> 01:19:39,170
<i>Not everyone deserves to love.</i>

1096
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:42,883
<i>I need someone who can be
the devil himself for me.</i>

1097
01:19:42,966 --> 01:19:46,136
This is it! This is exactly what I wanted!

1098
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:48,179
<i>Looks like I'll have to
break the promise I made</i>

1099
01:19:48,263 --> 01:19:50,098
<i>that I wouldn't hurt anyone.</i>
