1
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:08,529
Did Paolo send you?

2
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,032
Perhaps.

3
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:49,027
Paolo told me

4
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,446
to give you a painless death

5
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,200
if you show respect to Paolo.

6
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,627
Relay this message to Paolo.
I will not respect him

7
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,131
even after I die.

8
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,291
Inzaghi?

9
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:30,337
Inzaghi.

10
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,413
Did you get the rooftop ready?

11
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,623
-Well, yes.
-Good.

12
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:09,209
Wait. Why don't we drink in the office?

13
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,753
There's so much pigeon poop
on the rooftop.

14
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,130
Let me carry that.

15
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:16,883
I bet it was Inzaghi
and the other pigeons.

16
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:24,182
Inzaghi is not that kind of pigeon.

17
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,852
I bet it was other pigeons.
Don't badmouth Inzaghi.

18
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,937
It would hurt Inzaghi.

19
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,570
What happened here?

20
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:42,075
A nail must have torn it
when I was moving the table.

21
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,495
Why did you move that by yourself?
Let's drink standing up.

22
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,705
-Ms. Hong.
-What?

23
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,584
My knees are aching.

24
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,086
Can we drink sitting down?

25
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,672
Sure.

26
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,845
Did you send the file from the gallery
to Prosecutor Jung?

27
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,723
Yes. He should be
on his way to make the arrest.

28
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:05,849
That's great.

29
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:12,314
Why would you hold such a stupid event
and cause so much trouble?

30
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:14,357
The gallery is not your playground!

31
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:16,568
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,403
I'm so sorry, sir.

33
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:21,698
This won't end with you.

34
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:22,824
I…

35
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:25,118
Be quiet.

36
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,537
I'm thinking.

37
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,915
This is ridiculous.

38
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,043
It's like she doesn't think at all.

39
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,005
You should leave the country
before they bar you from going abroad.

40
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,381
Why? Go where?

41
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:40,383
I'll take the fall for him. Why bother?

42
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:43,970
All the evidence they have points to you.

43
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:47,849
They will be able to track the IP address
from the gallery to your home.

44
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,105
Han-seo.

45
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,858
Get me the earliest flight
leaving for New York now.

46
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:58,527
Yes, sir.

47
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,268
Before I leave,

48
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,437
I want to see Vincenzo's dead body.

49
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,029
Yes, sir. We took care of it.

50
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,991
But I found Choi Myung-hee's phone number

51
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,368
in the call history
on one of the cell phones.

52
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:55,208
Okay. Well done. Wrap it up.

53
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,678
-Yes. Mr. Consigliere.
-Hey, Luca.

54
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,920
RESTRICTED NUMBER

55
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,592
They failed again.

56
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,603
He's so hard to kill.

57
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,864
And they call themselves
the Mafia's hitmen?

58
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,867
They look like the thieves
from Home Alone. Look at the feather.

59
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,202
Ms. Choi Myung-hee!

60
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,578
What will you do about it?

61
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:24,089
I'm sorry, sir. Let's go
to the airport now. I'll escort you.

62
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,855
Stop them now.

63
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,025
Forget it.

64
00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:59,207
ARREST WARRANT

65
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,504
I came personally
to mark this historical day.

66
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:06,423
You seem very happy.

67
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,841
Why wouldn't I be?

68
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,467
Take him.

69
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:14,014
I'll come to you as soon as I'm ready.

70
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:14,699
Inzaghi.

71
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,455
Were you returning the favor?

72
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:22,916
Were you?

73
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:25,710
Is that it?

74
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,342
No way. It can't be.

75
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,720
How can a pigeon save a man?

76
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,955
There's a news embargo.

77
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,790
Jang Han-seok's been arrested.

78
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,377
Prosecutor Jung will announce it
at a press conference tomorrow morning.

79
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,297
Good job.

80
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,806
This is beautiful.

81
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:30,567
Goodness. Thank you, Ms. Oh.

82
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,031
You wrote a letter, too?

83
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,409
Hold on. Not now.

84
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,119
Please read it at home.

85
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

86
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,876
-Hi.
-You're here.

87
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:33,463
Ms. Hong, isn't it safe to say

88
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:37,509
that it was all thanks to us
that Babel's chairman was arrested?

89
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:41,054
Yes. Thanks to your help,
we were able to catch Chairman Jang!

90
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:44,807
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk will
now begin the press conference

91
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:48,102
-All right. It's starting.
-about the investigation against Babel.

92
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,903
-Hello.
-He's on.

93
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,948
I'm Prosecutor Jung In-kuk of
Seoul Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

94
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,157
There he is.

95
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:06,246
I have been investigating Babel Group on
six different charges for the past year.

96
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:08,665
They're all depraved
corporate corruption charges.

97
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:12,585
The charges violated the national economic
system and legal system.

98
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,504
That's it! There you go!

99
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,089
That hits the spot.

100
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:20,134
But I must tell the truth now.

101
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,264
When Jang Guk-hwan was the chairman,

102
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:26,558
I was eager to make a name for myself

103
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,351
and took my investigation too far.

104
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:29,769
As a result, I was demoted.

105
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,940
My personal feelings got the better of me.

106
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,942
I tried to indict Chairman Jang Han-seok

107
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:39,112
of Babel with unproven claims.

108
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:40,738
What's he saying? Has he gone mad?

109
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,616
And I crossed the line again
and caused damage

110
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,702
to the Babel Group
with yesterday's incident.

111
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,370
Is that really Mr. Jung?

112
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,749
It looks like he switched sides.

113
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,711
So he betrayed us?

114
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:00,758
I am holding this press conference
to come clean about my wrongdoings

115
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:04,053
and to recover the trust
the Namdongbu office has lost.

116
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:08,433
From now on, I will serve the people
of our country without

117
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:11,269
-letting my emotions get the better of me.
-I didn't see this coming.

118
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,271
If this happened in a drama,

119
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:15,398
people would say it's too unrealistic.

120
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,191
Moreover,

121
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,943
-They'd be up in arms about it.
-my ambition

122
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:22,488
has deeply mistreated
Chairman Jang Han-seok of Babel.

123
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,700
I would like to apologize for my actions.

124
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:26,993
That's okay.

125
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:31,497
I knew he was going to cave in
like that in the end.

126
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,291
That arrogant jerk.

127
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,419
NAMDONGBU OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE
ON THE BABEL INVESTIGATION

128
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,089
You should apologize to me, too!
That greedy bastard…

129
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,843
Look at him bowing down like that.

130
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,973
As of today, all the charges
against Babel will be dropped,

131
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,767
and the investigation will be closed.

132
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,270
I would like to apologize
for the confusion I've caused.

133
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,208
Ms. Hong.

134
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:20,880
Gosh.

135
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,174
Let's visit him later.

136
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,427
I should go and slap him.

137
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,597
He won't see us anyway.

138
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:31,599
We'll go later.

139
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,438
This is unbelievably cruel.

140
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,610
He despised Babel.
How could he switch sides overnight?

141
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,134
Why didn't we see this coming?

142
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,808
You can dodge a flying dagger,

143
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,311
but you can't dodge a hidden dagger.

144
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,150
Aren't you angry?

145
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,693
Angry?

146
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,573
I'm furious.

147
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,993
I'm just used to it.

148
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,004
I'll make him pay for this.

149
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,673
He'll pay no matter what.

150
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:48,634
If we react emotionally to betrayals,
it'll end up hurting us.

151
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,179
The bigger the betrayal is,

152
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,308
the more careful we must be.

153
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:07,445
If you were going to do this anyway,
you should've gone easy on them.

154
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:11,824
I'm sorry for my reckless behavior, sir.

155
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:18,706
I'll suspend you for two weeks
as a formality.

156
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,707
Take a breather.

157
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,835
When you return, you'll be promoted.

158
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,836
For your office…

159
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,255
Take Mr. Seo's office.
Make yourself at home.

160
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,758
Okay. Thank you.

161
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,468
Anything else you need?

162
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,971
Could you put some guards
around me and my family?

163
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:36,808
The Mafia might be gunning for me.

164
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,063
Let's go.

165
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:50,530
You know that I obtained
some hard evidence today, don't you?

166
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,992
There's no way out for you this time.

167
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,793
But what if I make this all go away?

168
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,797
How high can I go?

169
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,634
I'm serious right now.

170
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,597
Gosh. Is this some kind of prank?

171
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,226
Why all of a sudden?

172
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,395
Since it's finally time.

173
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,398
Then why have you been
harassing me all this time?

174
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:30,361
Because I needed Vincenzo to bring me
the best evidence, like today.

175
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:33,406
Let me ask you again.

176
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,409
How high can I go?

177
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:37,952
I can make you the Chief Prosecutor.

178
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,745
Make me the Prosecutor General…

179
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,664
or higher.

180
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:42,915
You're very greedy.

181
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,042
What if I have something

182
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:47,628
that allows me to be greedy?

183
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,591
The Guillotine file.

184
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,845
Do you know where the file is

185
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,890
and who has it?

186
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,459
How come there aren't any guards?

187
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,894
Honey.

188
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:45,895
Seung-min!

189
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,772
Honey. Seung-min.

190
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,023
Honey.

191
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:51,275
Seung-min. Honey!

192
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,404
-Dad!
-Yes.

193
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:00,910
Hello, my friend.

194
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:04,664
-Dad.
-Yes?

195
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:08,459
Your colleague from Italy is so handsome.

196
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,086
He's my type.

197
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,965
You should have told us
that he was coming today.

198
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,259
-He ended up cooking everything.
-Yes.

199
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:18,135
His spaghetti was so tasty.

200
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:20,346
-Is that so?
-Yes.

201
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,098
Seung-min.

202
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,351
Did you have dinner?

203
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:29,563
Seung-min,
I guess he hasn't had dinner yet.

204
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:33,109
Please sit.
We have a lot of catching up to do.

205
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,070
-Sit down, honey.
-Okay.

206
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,239
Seung-min.

207
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,616
Shall we make yummy spaghetti
for your dad, too?

208
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,951
Yes.

209
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,953
Can you help me cook?

210
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,086
I don't care if you kill me,

211
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,798
but leave my family out of this.

212
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,344
Don't worry. I'm not like you.

213
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:04,849
Is there any way I can save myself?

214
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,352
I'll do anything.

215
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,941
Do you know how you can tell
when someone's become evil?

216
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:18,654
It's when they stop feeling ashamed.

217
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,656
And you crossed that line.

218
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,492
Please…

219
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,749
Please don't kill me.

220
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,296
I don't plan on killing you yet.

221
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:39,759
Since killing a traitor early
is an act of great generosity.

222
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,562
Do whatever you want to.

223
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:54,315
When you have everything you wanted,

224
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,901
I will kill you, then.

225
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,286
And cook some pasta for Seung-min.

226
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:12,041
She said you always choose
your favorite meals when you eat out.

227
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:46,909
Han-seo.

228
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,412
Set up a meeting
with Mr. Oh Jeong-bae of Daechang Daily.

229
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:51,539
We're not that close.

230
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,086
May I ask what this is about?

231
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,796
I want to talk about an article

232
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,799
for our EVs and the production
of batteries by Babel Chemicals.

233
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,677
Can't Director Chun take care of that?

234
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:09,306
He won't be enough. I'm trying to get
Babel Chemicals' stocks to go up.

235
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,183
I have to talk to the CEO.

236
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:12,893
But…

237
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:17,148
we're still planning to develop them.
Our technology isn't ready yet.

238
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,276
I'm not saying
that we'll make cars for real.

239
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,695
We'll get the stocks up and pull out.

240
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:29,827
You are so smart. I'll never be able to
be on the same level as you.

241
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,872
Cut the crap. Who was it?

242
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,708
Just handle the gallery director.

243
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,419
I can't have her yap
about what happened. Okay?

244
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,755
Do a good job. Come on, do better.

245
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,853
My hair was perfect today.

246
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,740
I can't sleep
since that prosecutor betrayed us.

247
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,408
Why is that?

248
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,951
-Right?
-Yes.

249
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,287
We're not the ones who were betrayed,

250
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,081
but strangely, it upsets me so much.

251
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,251
-Do you know why?
-Why is that?

252
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:22,755
We've become interested
in what's happening around us.

253
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:27,509
We used to not care
because we were busy making a living.

254
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,553
Now it feels like it's our business.

255
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:32,181
You have a point.

256
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:35,851
We didn't care about rich people
or the law back then.

257
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,353
I'm not even well-educated,

258
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,647
but I can see what's wrong now.

259
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,025
Mr. Cassano told me this
when he was straightening me out.

260
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:47,071
"We become what we think.
If you think you're strong, you will be."

261
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,405
Isn't that awesome?

262
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:53,994
Anyway, I will follow Mr. Cassano
and continue to fight them.

263
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:55,663
-Yes.
-Good.

264
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,498
But don't get into any trouble.

265
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,333
Now we might have a baby…

266
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,545
What?

267
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:06,507
Did you guys have a change of heart?

268
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,304
We're going to try for a baby now.

269
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,265
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

270
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,517
-Great news. Have some meat.
-Oh, my.

271
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:20,187
That way, you'll fight less and get along.

272
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,523
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

273
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,109
-Come on. Eat up.
-Gosh.

274
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,777
That's great.

275
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,154
-I bet the baby will be handsome.
-Of course.

276
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,864
How was it?

277
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,748
This is beautiful.

278
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:47,881
Mr. Cassano.

279
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:49,758
What do you think?

280
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,137
It's nice.

281
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:56,807
But didn't you already buy enough
the other day?

282
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,227
It's not for me.

283
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,855
I'm picking out a gift for Ms. Oh.

284
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,614
Before her illness gets worse,
I want to take her out for some fresh air.

285
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:15,159
I see.

286
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,497
Won't that be too much for her?

287
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:24,126
Her doctor said she can go out
for an hour or two.

288
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,670
She hasn't gone out in ages.
She should dress up.

289
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,549
You should pick one, too.
I know you have good taste.

290
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:17,471
You bought it for her, so you should
give it to your mother yourself.

291
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,015
It's fine. You should…

292
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,645
Pardon?

293
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:28,107
Why are you so surprised?
You give it to your mother.

294
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,077
Did your father tell you?

295
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,454
No.

296
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,207
He never told me privileged information
about his clients.

297
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,292
Then how did you find out?

298
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,047
You paid for her medical bills.

299
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:55,259
You got back at Shinkwang Bank for her
even if you hated acting.

300
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,970
You said the same thing about
bungeoppang and ingeoppang.

301
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,723
Isn't it obvious that you are her son?

302
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:12,192
I really hate getting involved
in other people's family matters.

303
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,154
But let me be nosy just this once.

304
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,575
Why don't you tell her now?

305
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,327
That you know you're her son.

306
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,415
She doesn't have much time left.

307
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,794
So every single day she has left counts.

308
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,549
Remember what you told me?

309
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,344
"Regret is the most
painful thing in life."

310
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,848
Turns out it is true.

311
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:47,770
I hope you won't have to go through
such a painful thing.

312
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:10,667
This looks so refined.

313
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,087
I don't know if I deserve this.

314
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,884
Thank you, Mr. Cassano.

315
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,303
It's nothing.

316
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,265
It took him an hour
to pick this bag for you.

317
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,309
What?

318
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,062
Gosh. You didn't have to do that.

319
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,191
By the way,

320
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,653
I don't think I should go out.

321
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,823
I'm not well.

322
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,117
I'll only inconvenience you two.

323
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,078
Well, I'm not coming that day.

324
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,205
He will take you out.

325
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:49,873
Right?

326
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:55,963
Yes.

327
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:01,093
I know you're busy. I feel awful.

328
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:05,681
No. Think about all the places
you would like to visit.

329
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:07,808
Okay.

330
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:12,187
We should let her rest. Let's go.

331
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:17,901
Ms. Hong.

332
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,905
I have something to tell you.

333
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,369
I would like to…

334
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,999
file for a retrial.

335
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,378
Really?

336
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:38,714
Yes.

337
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,177
Why the sudden change of heart?

338
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,264
Actually…

339
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,769
there wasn't a day
I didn't want to file for a retrial.

340
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,772
I thought of doing it every day.

341
00:30:58,817 --> 00:30:59,943
But…

342
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,654
I was hesitant.

343
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,158
I didn't have enough courage.

344
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,036
But…

345
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,624
now that I'm nearing my death,

346
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,627
I finally have the courage to do it.

347
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,424
Can you help me with this?

348
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,428
Do you think you can do it for me?

349
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,518
What do you think, Mr. Cassano?

350
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,146
I'll follow your decision.

351
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,120
Okay.

352
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,249
Let's do it.

353
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,713
I'll get started right away.

354
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,049
Thank you.

355
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:07,636
Thank you so much.

356
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,947
Since your father passed away,

357
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,783
you've never come to see me, you brat.

358
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,995
I'm sorry. It's been hectic.

359
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:38,125
Why are things so crazy over at Babel?

360
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,586
Daechang has been working our butt off
to cover for you.

361
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,255
I'll return the favor.

362
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,300
-Han-seo already told you, right?
-Yes.

363
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:50,387
You want an editorial about
Babel Chemicals' battery production.

364
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,682
But Han-seok,

365
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,227
even elementary school kids
invest in stocks nowadays.

366
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,187
This is a sensitive and risky move.

367
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,733
But you did it for my dad.

368
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,027
Just do what you did for him.

369
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,869
Why does a beautiful woman like you

370
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:17,205
need to flee the country this urgently?

371
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,708
I have made…

372
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,962
a terrible mistake.

373
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,424
I can't make up for it even with my life.

374
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,053
That's awful.

375
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:33,680
Don't worry too much.

376
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,724
Actually, we have a spot,

377
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,101
so you can leave later today.

378
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,355
You're certain that
it's a direct flight to Taiwan, right?

379
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:46,860
Of course. The wind is strong today.
You could go to Cebu if you wanted.

380
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,821
Is it possible to end up
flying past the destination?

381
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:54,034
It is quite random, to tell you the truth.

382
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,285
If you don't want to…

383
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,079
-Hey--
-I'll take it!

384
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,248
Yes, that's the contract.
Read it carefully.

385
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,835
BYEBYE BALLOON
TRAVEL CONTRACT

386
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:07,547
We have a client here.
What is it this time?

387
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,759
I just got a stock investment tip.

388
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,886
Daechang is preparing
to publish an article

389
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,471
to promote Babel Chemicals.

390
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,474
It's about EVs and batteries.

391
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,686
-Excuse me. Read the contract.
-Okay.

392
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,397
I should buy Babel Chemicals' stocks.

393
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,448
These Babel assholes won't die.

394
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,076
They are getting richer instead.

395
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,744
How? Why is that?

396
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,790
Everyone, do you want some coffee?

397
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,959
I'm not in the mood to drink coffee now.

398
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,211
I'm not in the mood to make coffee now.

399
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:47,796
Okay.

400
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:58,223
Gosh. That traitor, Jung.

401
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,393
Babel will get more powerful
because of that bastard.

402
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,689
You met him last night. Why didn't you
make him pay for what he did?

403
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,649
He will do that in installments.

404
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,820
Do you think it's possible

405
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,114
he's just pretending to have switch sides?

406
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,699
Maybe he wants to expose

407
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,868
-all the secrets from within--
-Mr. Nam.

408
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:22,247
That's never happened
in the history of this country.

409
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,250
We don't need Prosecutor Jung.

410
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,086
What's that?

411
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:31,131
This?

412
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,342
The Guillotine file.

413
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:36,219
The Guillotine file.

414
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:40,640
You said you accidentally threw it
in the secret room and closed the door.

415
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,017
Who said that? Me?

416
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,686
-Yes.
-Did I say that?

417
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:14,633
My goodness. Vincenzo Cassano.

418
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,551
Let's reveal what's in the file.

419
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,930
Once it goes online,
it'll go international in an hour.

420
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,765
-That's not a good idea.
-Why not?

421
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:23,934
It'll last a few days. But…

422
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,979
no one that's in this file
will pay for what they did.

423
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,858
This file wasn't created
to expose the truth to the world

424
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,570
but for evil men to exploit the weakness
of other evil men.

425
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,657
Only an evil man can use it properly.

426
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,659
And we can use it just like they would.

427
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,370
We'll keep them on a leash
and order them around.

428
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:45,455
I see.

429
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,832
How frightening.

430
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:53,046
Did you read the file?

431
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,589
No. Not yet.

432
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,716
I wanted us to read it together.

433
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:58,426
Mr. Nam.

434
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,804
-The laptop!
-Right, the laptop!

435
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,903
Gosh. Something doesn't feel right.

436
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:22,492
I'm sure Prosecutor Jung and Mr. Jang
made a deal over something.

437
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:27,122
You know, the file.
The file they got from the gallery.

438
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,791
Do you think that's all?

439
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,626
That should be more than enough.

440
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:33,753
He has my brother

441
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:37,215
on tax evasion, illegally acquired stocks,
and everything on that file.

442
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,925
No. I get the feeling

443
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:41,678
that there's more.

444
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,472
What else? What else could there…

445
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,351
Is there really more?

446
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,774
-I don't know that.
-Me neither.

447
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:59,696
Anyway, Jung is
on your brother's side now.

448
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:02,824
And the deal with Daechang Daily
went smoothly.

449
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,746
Now your brother is going
to become powerful beyond control.

450
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,005
PROSECUTION

451
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:23,470
Gosh. The tabloids are nothing
compared to this.

452
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:24,846
It is unbelievable.

453
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:28,516
To get this kind of information,
they must've surveilled them illegally.

454
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,561
This time, we'll be targeting Babel

455
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,980
-and Daechang Daily.
-Daechang Daily.

456
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,775
I've been waiting
to crush this trashy agency.

457
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:39,486
Back in the day, newspapers could be
used as toilet paper.

458
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:41,905
But now, there's no use for them.

459
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:45,950
I mean, this so-called newspaper
makes ridiculous claims all year round.

460
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,660
They're absurd and make no sense.

461
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:51,081
If they keep doing it,
it is their attitude. It'll never change.

462
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:54,793
If Daechang Daily is gone,
it will cleanse our eyes and ears.

463
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:58,630
First, I'm planning to make them
fight and destroy each other.

464
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,300
Each other? How will you
make them go after each other?

465
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,636
Don't forget.

466
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,932
We have this Guillotine file.

467
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,851
Right, we'll pit one evil against another.

468
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,814
All right. Look over here.

469
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,252
Well, your office is…

470
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:41,131
It looks lame and awkward. It's nice.

471
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:44,634
Why are you here?

472
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:46,678
What? I can come if I want to.

473
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:57,856
It's nothing much. It's just
the most expensive coffee, Kopi Luwak.

474
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,315
I'm sure you know what it is.

475
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,360
It's a rare product
made from civets' poop.

476
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,653
What a load of crap.

477
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:07,782
Who is that guy?

478
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,245
I'm not sure if Vincenzo is just lucky

479
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,789
or he's really competent.
But he's impressive.

480
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:17,667
The Guillotine file and 15 tons of gold.

481
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,128
No one will even think that it's there.

482
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,796
If we can get the file,

483
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,550
all the powerful people in Korea
will kneel

484
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,052
before you.

485
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,601
It sounds like the One Ring
from The Lord of the Rings.

486
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,895
You watched it, so you must know.

487
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:40,440
If it falls into the wrong hands,
it'll cause problems.

488
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:42,567
Only people like us

489
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,070
will do justice to the Ring.

490
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:56,623
Let's demolish Geumga Plaza
as fast as we can.

491
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,250
That way, we can get the file out.

492
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,963
I'll give you some of the gold
in the secret room.

493
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:05,924
Sure.

494
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:08,051
I'll gladly accept it.

495
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:12,889
Thank you.

496
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,433
Thank you.

497
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,479
Hey, wait.

498
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,274
Why didn't you make the coffee
that I brought?

499
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,318
We don't have a coffee maker.

500
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,114
Gosh. Your working conditions here
are awful.

501
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,869
Damn it. It's so bitter. Hey, dude.
Why is this so bitter?

502
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:47,298
I heard that you asked Mr. Cassano
to get rid of your own brother.

503
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,759
It would have all worked out
if he did what I asked.

504
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:52,679
Things have gotten worse
because you declined.

505
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,222
Didn't I tell you?

506
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:56,558
I never exploit betrayals within a family.

507
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,853
I forgot to tell you this
because I was flustered.

508
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,358
I'm not trying to betray my own brother.

509
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:07,694
What I want…

510
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,363
How should I put it?
I don't want people to die anymore.

511
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:14,033
-Right.
-I'm trying to run Babel legally.

512
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:18,454
I guess you've been studying a lot.
Your vocabulary has gotten better.

513
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,583
Let me get this straight. You want to run

514
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,669
the company properly
after getting rid of your brother?

515
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,129
-That's it.
-Okay.

516
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,757
I really love Babel.

517
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:32,093
I want to run the company the right way.

518
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:35,096
I really don't want people to get killed.
I mean that.

519
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:37,932
Why don't you fix it then?
Why are you asking us for help?

520
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:39,684
That's because…

521
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:47,442
no matter how much I think about it,
you are the only people who can beat him.

522
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:50,028
I like your intention.

523
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,072
But do you deserve the seat?

524
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:56,951
I've been studying how to run a company.
I'm reading a lot of books.

525
00:42:57,035 --> 00:43:00,538
Humanities and economy. I read everything.
I want to read all the time.

526
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,375
Then here's a quiz.

527
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,252
A quiz all of a sudden?

528
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,302
Fine. Go ahead. Give me a question.

529
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,220
In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith says

530
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:18,765
this hand brings order
to a market economy? What is it?

531
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:21,017
-Polite hand.
-Wrong.

532
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,894
"The invisible hand."

533
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,438
As the economy grows,

534
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:28,900
government expenditures
in gross national product also increase.

535
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,068
Name this law.

536
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:32,070
-Law of the Jungle.
-Wrong.

537
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,321
"Wagner's law."

538
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:35,239
This is the easiest one.

539
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:37,200
To improve the company's competitiveness,

540
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:39,369
you learn something from another company.

541
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,455
What is this term
that originated from an iron rod?

542
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,290
Here's a hint. Bench…

543
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:47,835
Wrong.

544
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,171
-Get out.
-Wait.

545
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,589
Hold on.

546
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:52,882
Didn't I get one right?

547
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:55,635
How could you get everything wrong?

548
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:00,056
The polite hand was correct. No?

549
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:02,308
If you want our help, go study more.

550
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,520
If you want to join us, you must be smart.

551
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:07,939
Is this a symposium or what? Why?

552
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:08,940
Feel free to say no.

553
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:10,817
Get out.

554
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:12,902
This is ridiculous.

555
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:14,070
What…

556
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:15,530
Wait. Hold on.

557
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,533
If I pass your quiz
the next time I come here,

558
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:20,701
you'll really have to help me.

559
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:22,787
Get out.

560
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:28,376
Seriously. You're so petty.
Fine. I'll leave.

561
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,505
What will you quiz me on?

562
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:33,840
Out. Mr. Nam.

563
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,593
Did you know about the polite hand?

564
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:40,888
Here are my polite hands.

565
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,153
Will you really help Jang Han-seo?

566
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:09,250
You know,
I was trying to take Vincenzo's life.

567
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:13,713
But it turns out Vincenzo has been taking
what I cherish.

568
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:24,015
And that thing in the gallery.

569
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:33,566
What should I take from him

570
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:36,360
to make him suffer?

571
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:40,698
I must steal what's important to him.

572
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:44,076
Once he's dead, it's over.

573
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,495
So it's not his life.

574
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:48,664
If I were to go down that route…

575
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,461
Should I look into his family?

576
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:55,755
"Family"?

577
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:58,508
Is that important?

578
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:01,427
To regular people,

579
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:03,888
family is important.

580
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,140
I see.

581
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,352
Okay. I guess only I didn't know.

582
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,107
Then I'll go with that.

583
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:22,990
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

584
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:30,998
Why do you look so exhausted?

585
00:46:31,082 --> 00:46:32,375
It's so fun.

586
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:34,585
I haven't eaten or taken a dump

587
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,587
to read the file nonstop.

588
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:39,549
I'll go read some more after our briefing.

589
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:43,344
You should still go to the bathroom.
If you don't, toxins will build up.

590
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:51,310
I looked into some major problems
of Daechang Daily's owner, Oh Jeong-bae.

591
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:54,981
He's such a bastard.

592
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:56,399
What's the worst he did?

593
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:58,067
He murdered his older brother.

594
00:46:59,277 --> 00:47:01,112
Daechang is just as awful.

595
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:04,031
How come they all hate their siblings?

596
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:05,491
Why did he kill his brother?

597
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,118
They fought over the company.

598
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:10,204
But he was acquitted of the charge.

599
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:17,295
He went hiking with his older brother
and killed him by pushing him off a cliff.

600
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:28,931
I bet there were no witnesses.
Is there any evidence that it was murder?

601
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:33,394
The environmental monitoring camera
caught him in the act.

602
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,647
But the International Security
Intelligence Service

603
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:39,483
obtained the footage, not the cops.

604
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:40,985
The agency must have

605
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:44,488
used the footage
to cut a deal with Mr. Oh.

606
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:45,823
That's correct.

607
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:49,952
He's a total asshole.
How could he kill his own brother?

608
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,287
You heard everything.

609
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:57,168
I can hear better when people whisper.

610
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:01,547
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

611
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:11,223
Mr. Nam, did you find anything else?

612
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:14,352
There's a shaman
he trusts and follows blindly.

613
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:24,570
There's a child who has matured over
ten months and is about to make his mark.

614
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,990
When he makes decisions, big or small,
he does as the shaman says.

615
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,910
-Let me see.
-For both his family and company.

616
00:48:30,993 --> 00:48:33,788
But the shaman's a former cult leader
who has been convicted

617
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:36,082
four times
for fraud and sexual harassment.

618
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:38,793
And of course, Mr. Oh has no idea.

619
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:41,003
Gosh. This is crazy.

620
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,130
He takes advice from a fraud like that?

621
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:45,675
You know how people are.

622
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:49,470
The less you know about something,
the easier you believe it.

623
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:51,972
I should check if he's really

624
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,558
a fraud or gifted.

625
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,187
I'll go and finish reading it.

626
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:04,652
Gosh.

627
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:06,028
Don't move.

628
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:13,202
I'm telling you, Daechang Daily
burns the best.

629
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:17,164
When newspapers are full of lies,
you should use them to start a fire.

630
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:20,543
-Hey, who are you guys?
-Who do you think?

631
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:23,796
We brought you in,
so you could read our fortune.

632
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:24,714
What?

633
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:33,222
Hey, who are you?

634
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:35,433
I wonder

635
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:38,853
if you know that you'll burn
to death five minutes later.

636
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:41,939
He must know. He's a gifted shaman.

637
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,859
Does he also know he'll take a fall
after burning to death?

638
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:46,318
Of course. He's gifted.

639
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:48,988
Spare me.

640
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:51,824
But his fate can be changed, right?

641
00:49:51,907 --> 00:49:53,576
As long as he does what I tell him.

642
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,661
Why are you doing this to me, sirs?

643
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,456
By the way, do his customers know?

644
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:01,167
That he's a former cult leader
who was arrested four times

645
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,043
for fraud and sexual harassment?

646
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:04,003
I'm not sure.

647
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,880
They don't know that yet, sir.

648
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:07,047
Then…

649
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:09,800
shall we start talking now?

650
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:15,890
-Should I pour it?
-Yes?

651
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:17,600
-Gosh.
-Let's pay a silent tribute.

652
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:18,601
-Shall we?
-Okay.

653
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:19,977
This is for the deceased.

654
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:22,897
No, don't do that.

655
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,315
-Why…
-It's over. Let's do it.

656
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:25,983
-Can you lift your legs?
-No.

657
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,485
-The head first.
-The head?

658
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:28,819
-This is lamp oil.
-Wait.

659
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:30,029
I'll talk.

660
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:31,363
-No.
-Light it.

661
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:33,282
-Let's talk.
-Daechang Daily.

662
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:34,784
Let's use that newspaper.

663
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:35,910
Here we go.

664
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:38,204
-It's burning. No!
-Gosh.

665
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:39,371
All right.

666
00:50:39,455 --> 00:50:42,500
To screw over Babel and Daechang Daily,

667
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,920
we will hold a vote to pick a person
who will act as a shaman.

668
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:58,641
Please vote for the person
that suits the role of a shaman the best.

669
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,158
Put it in there.

670
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:21,247
All right.

671
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,957
We all have voted for the person

672
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,209
who will act as the shaman.

673
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,546
Now, I will count the votes.

674
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:33,050
VINCENZO

675
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,510
"Vincenzo."

676
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:36,470
Me?

677
00:51:38,055 --> 00:51:39,265
This isn't a joke.

678
00:51:41,058 --> 00:51:42,685
-Mr. Nam.
-You saw it?

679
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:44,395
"Mr. Cassano."

680
00:51:45,938 --> 00:51:48,065
"Vincenzo Casanova,
Corn Salad. I love you."

681
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:50,234
What…

682
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,152
Is this funny?

683
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:54,321
"Vincenzo."

684
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:56,073
-"Vitamin-cenzo."
-Why did you…

685
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:57,825
-"Mr. Vin."
-What are you guys doing?

686
00:51:58,409 --> 00:51:59,493
"Mr. Vin, Vincenzo."

687
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:00,828
-"Vincenzo."
-Everyone.

688
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,079
"Mr. Cassano."

689
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:06,125
"Vincenzo. Vincenzo Quassano."

690
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,043
"Quassano"?

691
00:52:08,127 --> 00:52:10,546
This is probably Vincenzo.
Yes, "Mr. Cassano."

692
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:12,381
All right.

693
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:17,720
This is the last vote.

694
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:19,972
Do we need to check the last vote?

695
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:22,182
Vincen… "Hong Cha-young."

696
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:25,895
Why me?

697
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:29,648
-It was you, wasn't it?
-All right.

698
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:34,528
Mr. Cassano has been voted
for the role of the shaman.

699
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:42,411
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

700
00:52:42,494 --> 00:52:46,165
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

701
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:49,043
HOW BABEL CHEMICALS BECAME
THE LEADER IN THE EV MARKET

702
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:02,556
CEO OH JEONG-BAE

703
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,352
Hello, sir.

704
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:10,189
I need to speak to you
about an urgent matter.

705
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:17,196
Pardon? What are you talking about?

706
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,198
Sir.

707
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:23,118
I can no longer communicate
with any spirits.

708
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,704
The mountains deity has left me.

709
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,624
No.

710
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:30,334
I need you.

711
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,961
You must pull through.

712
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:37,466
Sir, please.

713
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,094
Mr. Oh, listen carefully.

714
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:41,136
Okay.

715
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,596
I'm useless now.

716
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:46,642
But I know a really powerful shaman.

717
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:50,854
No, he's much better than me
at communicating with the spirits.

718
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:53,315
No. You must go see him instead.

719
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,442
That's the only way we'll survive.

720
00:53:58,946 --> 00:54:00,781
-I'm number five.
-I'm number six.

721
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:02,074
-I'm number seven.
-Why?

722
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:02,992
Gosh.

723
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:05,786
-It'll take five minutes per person.
-Right.

724
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:07,621
-I heard he's really good.
-Really?

725
00:54:07,705 --> 00:54:09,498
-Yes.
-I should've gotten more time.

726
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:12,876
-I can't wait to find out.
-Right. I've been waiting for an hour.

727
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,628
-What's your number?
-Number four.

728
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:15,838
-I'm number six.
-Okay.

729
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,089
PARK HYO SHRINE

730
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:18,340
I heard he's really good.

731
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:23,762
-Hey.
-You can't cut in line.

732
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:24,972
You just got here.

733
00:54:25,055 --> 00:54:26,140
-We're in line here.
-Right.

734
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:27,558
-Go grab a ticket.
-Yes.

735
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:29,852
We've been waiting here
before you got here.

736
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:32,021
-See?
-Right.

737
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:33,313
-Look.
-Look.

738
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:38,444
But I made a reservation.

739
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,281
-Is that so?
-I see.

740
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:44,825
I didn't know about that. Then, go inside.

741
00:54:45,534 --> 00:54:47,161
-I'm jealous.
-Gosh.

742
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:49,038
-Good for you.
-Awesome.

743
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:54,460
-Good for you.
-I'm so jealous.

744
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:55,711
Good luck.

745
00:55:03,302 --> 00:55:04,511
How may I help you?

746
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:06,555
Well…

747
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:10,434
shaman Biryu recommended me
to see the shaman here.

748
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,977
-I'm Daechang's--
-"Daechang."

749
00:55:12,853 --> 00:55:15,689
Welcome.
Young Master Yeorim is waiting for you.

750
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:17,441
I see.

751
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:03,946
OH, INZAGHI

752
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,995
You have an interesting name

753
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:13,997
for your shrine.

754
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:17,126
We named it after Park Hyo,
the Chief State Councilor of Joseon.

755
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,712
He was enlightened
after going into the mountains

756
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:22,923
and became a mountain deity.

757
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:25,843
That is why the deity we worship is

758
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:28,804
known as "Park Hyo Shin."
"Shin" meaning god.

759
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:37,104
I see. Okay.

760
00:56:38,397 --> 00:56:40,816
Following the long shadow

761
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:53,120
Well…

762
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:56,707
I'm here because I want some answers
to my questions.

763
00:56:58,417 --> 00:57:00,669
But I'm not sure if I should ask them.

764
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,631
Should I ask them?

765
00:57:05,257 --> 00:57:06,842
Or not?

766
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:08,677
Get out.

767
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:11,555
I have nothing to say to a dead man.

768
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:13,182
Look.

769
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:20,647
I won't have to send condolence money
since we just met.

770
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:23,150
Who do you think I am?

771
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:26,945
You con artists.

772
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:28,197
Jeong-bae.

773
00:57:31,283 --> 00:57:32,242
What?

774
00:57:32,868 --> 00:57:34,077
"Jeong-bae"?

775
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,914
How dare you call me by my first name?

776
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:41,251
-I'm your brother, Jeong-bae.
-What?

777
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:45,214
I'm so cold.

778
00:57:55,224 --> 00:57:56,475
I'm cold.

779
00:58:00,062 --> 00:58:01,605
My hands are freezing.

780
00:58:02,272 --> 00:58:03,273
I'm so cold.

781
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:11,406
How could you push me off
the cliff and leave me?

782
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,450
I'm still here.

783
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:21,458
How…

784
00:58:22,793 --> 00:58:25,546
-How could my brother…
-I'm cold.

785
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,467
Jeong-bae, help me up already.

786
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,679
It's freezing down here. Okay?

787
00:58:34,346 --> 00:58:36,682
-I'm so cold, Jeong-bae.
-Go away.

788
00:58:36,765 --> 00:58:39,184
-Get away from me.
-Jeong-bae.

789
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:41,979
-Get off me.
-Jeong-bae.

790
00:58:43,272 --> 00:58:45,732
Jeong-bae.

791
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:47,025
-Let go.
-Jeong-bae.

792
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:49,319
-No!
-Jeong-bae.

793
00:58:49,403 --> 00:58:50,946
-Go away.
-I'm cold, Jeong-bae.

794
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:54,199
Jeong-bae, I'm so cold.

795
00:58:54,283 --> 00:58:56,034
Get away from me!

796
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:58,078
Jeong-bae, I'm so cold.

797
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:04,126
Why are there

798
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:08,630
so many burdens in my life?

799
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:13,844
It's not that you have many burdens.
You are just weak.

800
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,472
The weaker you are,

801
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:21,101
the heavier your burdens become.

802
00:59:22,269 --> 00:59:23,478
I see.

803
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:28,066
Do you want to see
what will kill you eventually?

804
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,820
Yes. I do.

805
01:00:09,775 --> 01:00:11,610
BABEL

806
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,374
Unless you cut ties with Babel,
you will die a miserable death.

807
01:00:29,503 --> 01:00:30,921
Is that all I need to do?

808
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:37,803
It's more than cutting ties with them.

809
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:42,808
You must cut ties with them
as you completely trample on them.

810
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:44,101
What?

811
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:45,727
To get rid of bad luck altogether.

812
01:00:47,771 --> 01:00:48,772
That's…

813
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:52,109
It's not that easy.

814
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:10,460
I see.

815
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:15,841
That's the number of days you have left.

816
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:18,093
Five days.

817
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:29,187
Poor thing.

818
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:41,950
You know what?

819
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:46,329
I went too hard earlier.
My arms are hurting. They hurt so much.

820
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,501
Isn't it ironic?

821
01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:55,255
A newspaper company is supposed to
publish facts, but he's so superstitious.

822
01:01:56,423 --> 01:02:00,093
He's superstitious
because he has no interest in facts.

823
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:05,515
You startled me.

824
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,516
Oh, right.

825
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,854
I forgot to tell you
because we were so busy today.

826
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:14,274
I found something shocking about
Jang Han-seok in the Guillotine file.

827
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:16,818
-What is it?
-Chairman Jang

828
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:20,238
killed four of his classmates
in middle and high school.

829
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:26,578
He brought classmates he didn't like
to a rooftop and made them jump.

830
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:29,790
Or he hunted and killed them
in the mountains like they were prey.

831
01:02:30,874 --> 01:02:35,796
He killed the last one because he stole
a ball from him during a gym class.

832
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:39,549
Jang used the goal net to strangle him.

833
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:43,428
Here's what's scarier.

834
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:00,529
JANG HAN-SEOK

835
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:29,391
He took the deceased's watches

836
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,977
as some kind of a trophy.

837
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:36,606
And he even bragged about it
like he was proud of it.

838
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:39,943
He's a psychopath.

839
01:03:40,026 --> 01:03:42,946
He was diagnosed as a psychopath
at the age of 16.

840
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:46,408
That's why his father sent him
to the States

841
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:48,869
fearing that he might become
a serial killer.

842
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:51,955
Jang Han-seo was beaten
and tortured by him,

843
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:55,292
so he's been seeing a therapist
ever since he was little.

844
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,836
And that's how he ended up doing drugs.

845
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:00,171
Even so, he shouldn't be doing drugs.

846
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,756
That jerk.

847
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,592
Anyway, their father, Jang Guk-hwan,

848
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:06,177
covered everything up with money

849
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:07,971
and kept it a secret.

850
01:04:11,975 --> 01:04:14,352
That explains why he was so hard to beat.

851
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:17,272
Turns out he's

852
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:20,108
the biggest monster of them all.

853
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:31,453
BABEL SUSPECTED TO HAVE MADE
FALSE STATEMENTS TO RAISE STOCK VALUE

854
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:51,264
DAECHANG DAILY

855
01:04:53,558 --> 01:04:54,559
Hello?

856
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:56,019
What are you doing?

857
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:59,064
-What the hell is this?
-Mr. Jang.

858
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:04,069
There has been a change
in the guidelines at my company.

859
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:07,030
Did I do something to offend you?

860
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:09,032
No, you didn't.

861
01:05:09,115 --> 01:05:13,703
Now Daechang Daily is an honest newspaper
that only speaks the truth.

862
01:05:13,787 --> 01:05:14,746
The truth?

863
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,750
You're the most corrupt newspaper company
in Korea. But what? The truth?

864
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,585
Watch what you say.

865
01:05:20,669 --> 01:05:22,796
So, why didn't you
run your company properly?

866
01:05:23,296 --> 01:05:24,464
I'm hanging up.

867
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,216
Mr. Oh? Mr. Oh!

868
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,676
Hey!

869
01:05:43,024 --> 01:05:46,569
How come my days are still numbered?

870
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:49,823
I just cut all ties with Babel.

871
01:05:49,906 --> 01:05:52,617
That won't be enough to save your life.

872
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:53,910
Pardon?

873
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:59,416
Then what more do I need to do?

874
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:03,586
The owner of Babel.

875
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:04,713
The king of Babel.

876
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:11,344
Are you talking about

877
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:14,055
Chairman Jang Han-seok?

878
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:17,684
He's the one
who's holding onto your misfortune.

879
01:06:19,269 --> 01:06:22,272
If you expose his past evils,

880
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:25,734
and relieve the spirits that wander
the realm of the living because of him,

881
01:06:26,484 --> 01:06:29,487
those spirits will help you.

882
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:40,206
The wandering spirits?

883
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:49,883
Are you saying Han-seok killed someone?

884
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:15,366
Han-seok.

885
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:18,578
I'm sorry.

886
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:20,371
Don't hit me.

887
01:07:20,455 --> 01:07:24,042
Han-seok. I'm sorry.

888
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,293
It's all my fault.

889
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:26,961
-I'm not Han-seok.
-I'm sorry.

890
01:07:27,045 --> 01:07:28,505
-I'm not him.
-Don't strangle me.

891
01:07:28,588 --> 01:07:30,548
-I can't breathe.
-Jang Han-seok.

892
01:07:30,632 --> 01:07:31,674
Don't strangle me.

893
01:07:31,758 --> 01:07:33,510
-Jang Han-seok. Spare me.
-No.

894
01:07:33,593 --> 01:07:35,178
-It's my fault.
-Don't do it.

895
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:37,388
No. I'm not Han-seok!

896
01:07:37,472 --> 01:07:38,723
That's my watch.

897
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:41,392
That's my watch. It's mine.

898
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:43,937
-It's my watch.
-No.

899
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:50,151
The chairman of Babel,
one of the biggest companies in Korea,

900
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:51,611
was a bully?

901
01:07:51,694 --> 01:07:54,114
No. It was more of a massacre.

902
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:57,784
This has come
as shocking news to the public.

903
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:00,995
On top of that,
he was never punished for his crimes,

904
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:04,749
and was able to climb the ladder
to become the chairman.

905
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,919
I mean, seriously?
Where were the police and prosecutors

906
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:09,921
in all of this?

907
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,382
Right now, a lot of people

908
01:08:12,465 --> 01:08:15,468
are urging this killer chairman
to be punished

909
01:08:15,552 --> 01:08:18,429
on many of the online forums
and petitioning for it as well.

910
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,306
Gosh.

911
01:08:21,432 --> 01:08:23,351
How did they know?

912
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:27,564
Even Mr. Oh wouldn't
know about my childhood.

913
01:08:27,647 --> 01:08:30,191
…update you with a follow-up coverage.

914
01:08:30,275 --> 01:08:31,818
Right now, Babel Group

915
01:08:31,901 --> 01:08:33,736
-has dismissed the claims
-Hey.

916
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,405
-It wasn't you, right?
-as being false.

917
01:08:35,488 --> 01:08:38,700
-They will soon release
-What? Of course, it wasn't me.

918
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:42,328
The article even said I was crazy
and did drugs. You think I did that?

919
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,415
Well, you're right.

920
01:08:48,168 --> 01:08:52,672
It was reported that there hadn't been
an investigation on this in the past.

921
01:08:54,174 --> 01:08:56,676
Who else knows about this?

922
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:01,973
My dad, the detective who worked the case,

923
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:03,975
and the prosecutor in charge.

924
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:10,398
Then there's a source we're not aware of.

925
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:14,819
The problem is the intention.
Why is Mr. Oh attacking you now?

926
01:09:15,403 --> 01:09:17,822
It looks like
he's trying to bring me down.

927
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,301
LIFE

928
01:09:51,147 --> 01:09:52,815
It's all done.

929
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:55,026
You have been spared.

930
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:04,285
Fate has a weakness for brave souls,

931
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:07,121
but it can be a powerful foe
to those who are weak.

932
01:10:09,082 --> 01:10:11,834
You have been brave
and averted this crisis.

933
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,618
Thank you.

934
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:49,247
Thank you.

935
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:12,895
It's been a while, Mr. Cho.

936
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:14,480
Can we meet now?

937
01:11:14,564 --> 01:11:16,858
I'll meet you at the parking lot
of the plaza.

938
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:19,986
Okay. Sure.

939
01:11:20,987 --> 01:11:21,904
Okay.

940
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,741
Run!

941
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:57,250
Who are they?

942
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:00,837
I think Prosecutor Jung sent them.

943
01:13:02,672 --> 01:13:03,714
Prosecutor Jung?

944
01:13:07,468 --> 01:13:09,345
It's as expected.

945
01:13:09,429 --> 01:13:11,681
It was Vincenzo.

946
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:14,934
He exploited Mr. Oh's tendency
to have blind faith in shamans.

947
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,311
He's so detailed.

948
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:21,357
I really can't beat a Mafia member.

949
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,485
Anyway…

950
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:28,239
how did he find out
what happened when I was young?

951
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,242
That's still a mystery to me.

952
01:13:31,325 --> 01:13:34,996
But it's most likely that he got it
from the intelligence agency.

953
01:13:37,165 --> 01:13:39,792
How on earth did he find out?

954
01:13:40,376 --> 01:13:42,462
Given the current circumstances,

955
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:45,673
he's pitted Babel and Daechang
against each other.

956
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:49,510
Even so. Mr. Oh of all people
can't do that to me.

957
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:51,971
What should we do?

958
01:13:56,017 --> 01:13:59,979
Make Vincenzo end it himself.

959
01:14:00,062 --> 01:14:02,607
Oh, right. I must show you something.

960
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:07,153
What is it?

961
01:14:08,654 --> 01:14:11,157
Vincenzo's Korean name is Park Ju-hyeong.

962
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,368
He was adopted after being abandoned
by his mother when he was little.

963
01:14:14,452 --> 01:14:15,703
OH GYEONG-JA, PERSONAL DETAILS

964
01:14:15,786 --> 01:14:16,996
Is his mom alive?

965
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:19,999
She is. But she recently got out of prison

966
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:22,418
-because of pancreatic cancer.
-What was she in for?

967
01:14:22,502 --> 01:14:24,921
She was the housekeeper
who was involved in the death

968
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:27,465
of Shinkwang Finance's Chairman Hwang.

969
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:30,092
NAMDONGBU DISTRICT COURT
RULING

970
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:31,052
Wait.

971
01:14:31,552 --> 01:14:34,430
He ruined the signing ceremony
a while ago.

972
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:39,560
Is this why he did that?

973
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:40,686
Yes.

974
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:44,899
Hong Yu-chan was the public defender
who took her case.

975
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:49,529
And today, she filed for a retrial
regarding the death of Hwang Deok-bae.

976
01:14:49,612 --> 01:14:50,780
A retrial?

977
01:14:52,782 --> 01:14:54,909
-Who filed it?
-Cha-young did.

978
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:57,370
Of course, Vincenzo must be behind it.

979
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:06,379
That means Vincenzo
has been spending time with his mother.

980
01:15:06,462 --> 01:15:11,259
I'm trying to find out which hospital
his mother is being treated in.

981
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:21,561
I met Jung at the International Security
Intelligence Service five years ago.

982
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:25,565
He was dispatched for a case,
and I had a desk job there.

983
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:28,818
We found out the true nature
of the Guillotine file,

984
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:30,236
and Jung thought he could

985
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,364
root out all corruption in Korea
with the file.

986
01:15:33,948 --> 01:15:36,242
So he desperately tried
to get his hands on it,

987
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:38,369
and I joined hands with him.

988
01:15:39,662 --> 01:15:41,747
That was before he went dirty.

989
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:42,790
Yes.

990
01:15:43,749 --> 01:15:46,127
But soon,
the file was hacked and vanished,

991
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,504
and I volunteered to look for the file.

992
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,507
That's how I got here.

993
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:55,636
But Jung has betrayed you, right?

994
01:15:56,304 --> 01:16:00,433
Yes. In fact, I suspected him
these past few months.

995
01:16:01,017 --> 01:16:04,437
I felt he had an ulterior motive
for looking for the file.

996
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:10,526
Now that he is on Jang Han-seok's side,
he must know by now

997
01:16:11,319 --> 01:16:14,780
that the file and the gold are here.

998
01:16:14,864 --> 01:16:19,118
And he must know he has to demolish
the plaza to retrieve them.

999
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:28,711
GEUMGA PLAZA

1000
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:03,120
PETITION FOR A RETRIAL

1001
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:08,769
Damn it.

1002
01:19:41,904 --> 01:19:43,364
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

1003
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:46,325
You're under arrest
for the murder of Oh Jeong-bae.

1004
01:20:21,277 --> 01:20:23,028
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE HYE-JUNG
AND IM SUNG-JAE

1005
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:53,142
It was a setup, wasn't it?

1006
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:56,228
Then we'll have to use
the most effective method.

1007
01:20:56,312 --> 01:20:57,521
I'll make sure no one ever gets it.

1008
01:20:57,605 --> 01:20:59,356
I have to find the person who lured me.

1009
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,151
I'll make sure everyone who tried to
build it will be punished.

1010
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:05,988
He could stir up the entire nation.

1011
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:10,117
To cherish Geumga Plaza
as a historical building.

1012
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:12,870
Make him pay.

1013
01:21:14,121 --> 01:21:15,581
It's time for you to die.

1014
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:19,585
You will die a slow death,
experiencing it every step of the way.

1015
01:21:21,337 --> 01:21:26,342
