1
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:08,132
Did Paolo send you?

2
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,635
Perhaps.

3
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,630
Paolo told me

4
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:51,049
to give you a painless death

5
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:54,803
if you show respect to Paolo.

6
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,230
Relay this message to Paolo.
I will not respect him

7
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:08,734
even after I die.

8
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:25,894
Inzaghi?

9
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:29,940
Inzaghi.

10
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,016
Did you get the rooftop ready?

11
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:06,226
-Well, yes.
-Good.

12
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,812
Wait. Why don't we drink in the office?

13
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,356
There's so much pigeon poop
on the rooftop.

14
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,733
Let me carry that.

15
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,486
I bet it was Inzaghi
and the other pigeons.

16
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,785
Inzaghi is not that kind of pigeon.

17
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:26,455
I bet it was other pigeons.
Don't badmouth Inzaghi.

18
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,540
It would hurt Inzaghi.

19
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:36,173
What happened here?

20
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,678
A nail must have torn it
when I was moving the table.

21
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:45,098
Why did you move that by yourself?
Let's drink standing up.

22
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:46,308
-Ms. Hong.
-What?

23
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,187
My knees are aching.

24
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:52,689
Can we drink sitting down?

25
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:55,275
Sure.

26
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:01,448
Did you send the file from the gallery
to Prosecutor Jung?

27
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,326
Yes. He should be
on his way to make the arrest.

28
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:05,452
That's great.

29
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:11,917
Why would you hold such a stupid event
and cause so much trouble?

30
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,960
The gallery is not your playground!

31
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,171
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,006
I'm so sorry, sir.

33
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:21,301
This won't end with you.

34
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,427
I…

35
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,721
Be quiet.

36
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,140
I'm thinking.

37
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:29,518
This is ridiculous.

38
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,646
It's like she doesn't think at all.

39
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:36,608
You should leave the country
before they bar you from going abroad.

40
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:37,984
Why? Go where?

41
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,986
I'll take the fall for him. Why bother?

42
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,573
All the evidence they have points to you.

43
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:47,452
They will be able to track the IP address
from the gallery to your home.

44
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,708
Han-seo.

45
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:56,461
Get me the earliest flight
leaving for New York now.

46
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,130
Yes, sir.

47
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:30,871
Before I leave,

48
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:33,040
I want to see Vincenzo's dead body.

49
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,632
Yes, sir. We took care of it.

50
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,594
But I found Choi Myung-hee's phone number

51
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,971
in the call history
on one of the cell phones.

52
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,811
Okay. Well done. Wrap it up.

53
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:06,281
-Yes. Mr. Consigliere.
-Hey, Luca.

54
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:39,523
RESTRICTED NUMBER

55
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,195
They failed again.

56
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:56,206
He's so hard to kill.

57
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,467
And they call themselves
the Mafia's hitmen?

58
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,470
They look like the thieves
from Home Alone. Look at the feather.

59
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:11,805
Ms. Choi Myung-hee!

60
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,181
What will you do about it?

61
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:23,692
I'm sorry, sir. Let's go
to the airport now. I'll escort you.

62
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:40,458
Stop them now.

63
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:43,628
Forget it.

64
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,810
ARREST WARRANT

65
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,107
I came personally
to mark this historical day.

66
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:06,026
You seem very happy.

67
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,444
Why wouldn't I be?

68
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:09,070
Take him.

69
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,617
I'll come to you as soon as I'm ready.

70
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,302
Inzaghi.

71
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:20,058
Were you returning the favor?

72
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,519
Were you?

73
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:25,313
Is that it?

74
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,945
No way. It can't be.

75
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,323
How can a pigeon save a man?

76
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:01,558
There's a news embargo.

77
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,393
Jang Han-seok's been arrested.

78
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,980
Prosecutor Jung will announce it
at a press conference tomorrow morning.

79
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:10,900
Good job.

80
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,409
This is beautiful.

81
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,170
Goodness. Thank you, Ms. Oh.

82
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,634
You wrote a letter, too?

83
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,012
Hold on. Not now.

84
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,722
Please read it at home.

85
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,811
-Hello.
-Hello.

86
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,479
-Hi.
-You're here.

87
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:33,066
Ms. Hong, isn't it safe to say

88
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:37,112
that it was all thanks to us
that Babel's chairman was arrested?

89
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:40,657
Yes. Thanks to your help,
we were able to catch Chairman Jang!

90
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:44,410
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk will
now begin the press conference

91
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:47,705
-All right. It's starting.
-about the investigation against Babel.

92
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,506
-Hello.
-He's on.

93
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,551
I'm Prosecutor Jung In-kuk of
Seoul Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

94
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:00,760
There he is.

95
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:05,849
I have been investigating Babel Group on
six different charges for the past year.

96
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,268
They're all depraved
corporate corruption charges.

97
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:12,188
The charges violated the national economic
system and legal system.

98
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,107
That's it! There you go!

99
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,692
That hits the spot.

100
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:19,737
But I must tell the truth now.

101
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,867
When Jang Guk-hwan was the chairman,

102
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,161
I was eager to make a name for myself

103
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:27,954
and took my investigation too far.

104
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,372
As a result, I was demoted.

105
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,543
My personal feelings got the better of me.

106
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,545
I tried to indict Chairman Jang Han-seok

107
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,715
of Babel with unproven claims.

108
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,341
What's he saying? Has he gone mad?

109
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,219
And I crossed the line again
and caused damage

110
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:45,305
to the Babel Group
with yesterday's incident.

111
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:46,973
Is that really Mr. Jung?

112
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,352
It looks like he switched sides.

113
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:54,314
So he betrayed us?

114
00:13:56,524 --> 00:14:00,361
I am holding this press conference
to come clean about my wrongdoings

115
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:03,656
and to recover the trust
the Namdongbu office has lost.

116
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:08,036
From now on, I will serve the people
of our country without

117
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,872
-letting my emotions get the better of me.
-I didn't see this coming.

118
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:12,874
If this happened in a drama,

119
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,001
people would say it's too unrealistic.

120
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:16,794
Moreover,

121
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,546
-They'd be up in arms about it.
-my ambition

122
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,091
has deeply mistreated
Chairman Jang Han-seok of Babel.

123
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,303
I would like to apologize for my actions.

124
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,596
That's okay.

125
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:31,100
I knew he was going to cave in
like that in the end.

126
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,894
That arrogant jerk.

127
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:36,022
NAMDONGBU OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE
ON THE BABEL INVESTIGATION

128
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:39,692
You should apologize to me, too!
That greedy bastard…

129
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,446
Look at him bowing down like that.

130
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:48,576
As of today, all the charges
against Babel will be dropped,

131
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,370
and the investigation will be closed.

132
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,873
I would like to apologize
for the confusion I've caused.

133
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:14,811
Ms. Hong.

134
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:20,483
Gosh.

135
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,777
Let's visit him later.

136
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:26,030
I should go and slap him.

137
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,200
He won't see us anyway.

138
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,202
We'll go later.

139
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,041
This is unbelievably cruel.

140
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,213
He despised Babel.
How could he switch sides overnight?

141
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,737
Why didn't we see this coming?

142
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,411
You can dodge a flying dagger,

143
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,914
but you can't dodge a hidden dagger.

144
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,753
Aren't you angry?

145
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:23,296
Angry?

146
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:28,176
I'm furious.

147
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,596
I'm just used to it.

148
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,607
I'll make him pay for this.

149
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:45,276
He'll pay no matter what.

150
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,237
If we react emotionally to betrayals,
it'll end up hurting us.

151
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:50,782
The bigger the betrayal is,

152
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,911
the more careful we must be.

153
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:07,048
If you were going to do this anyway,
you should've gone easy on them.

154
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:11,427
I'm sorry for my reckless behavior, sir.

155
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:18,309
I'll suspend you for two weeks
as a formality.

156
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:19,310
Take a breather.

157
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:22,438
When you return, you'll be promoted.

158
00:17:22,522 --> 00:17:23,439
For your office…

159
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:25,858
Take Mr. Seo's office.
Make yourself at home.

160
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,361
Okay. Thank you.

161
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:30,071
Anything else you need?

162
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:33,574
Could you put some guards
around me and my family?

163
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,411
The Mafia might be gunning for me.

164
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:41,666
Let's go.

165
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:50,133
You know that I obtained
some hard evidence today, don't you?

166
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,595
There's no way out for you this time.

167
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:03,396
But what if I make this all go away?

168
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:07,400
How high can I go?

169
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,237
I'm serious right now.

170
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,200
Gosh. Is this some kind of prank?

171
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:19,829
Why all of a sudden?

172
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:21,998
Since it's finally time.

173
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:25,001
Then why have you been
harassing me all this time?

174
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:29,964
Because I needed Vincenzo to bring me
the best evidence, like today.

175
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:33,009
Let me ask you again.

176
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,012
How high can I go?

177
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,555
I can make you the Chief Prosecutor.

178
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,348
Make me the Prosecutor General…

179
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,267
or higher.

180
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,518
You're very greedy.

181
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:44,645
What if I have something

182
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,231
that allows me to be greedy?

183
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,194
The Guillotine file.

184
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,448
Do you know where the file is

185
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:58,493
and who has it?

186
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,062
How come there aren't any guards?

187
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:44,497
Honey.

188
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,498
Seung-min!

189
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,375
Honey. Seung-min.

190
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,626
Honey.

191
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:50,878
Seung-min. Honey!

192
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,007
-Dad!
-Yes.

193
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,513
Hello, my friend.

194
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,267
-Dad.
-Yes?

195
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,062
Your colleague from Italy is so handsome.

196
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,689
He's my type.

197
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,568
You should have told us
that he was coming today.

198
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,862
-He ended up cooking everything.
-Yes.

199
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,738
His spaghetti was so tasty.

200
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,949
-Is that so?
-Yes.

201
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:21,701
Seung-min.

202
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:24,954
Did you have dinner?

203
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:29,166
Seung-min,
I guess he hasn't had dinner yet.

204
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:32,712
Please sit.
We have a lot of catching up to do.

205
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,673
-Sit down, honey.
-Okay.

206
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:37,842
Seung-min.

207
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:40,219
Shall we make yummy spaghetti
for your dad, too?

208
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:41,554
Yes.

209
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,556
Can you help me cook?

210
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,689
I don't care if you kill me,

211
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,401
but leave my family out of this.

212
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:59,947
Don't worry. I'm not like you.

213
00:21:01,908 --> 00:21:04,452
Is there any way I can save myself?

214
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,955
I'll do anything.

215
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,544
Do you know how you can tell
when someone's become evil?

216
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,257
It's when they stop feeling ashamed.

217
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,259
And you crossed that line.

218
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,095
Please…

219
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:29,352
Please don't kill me.

220
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,899
I don't plan on killing you yet.

221
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:39,362
Since killing a traitor early
is an act of great generosity.

222
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:51,165
Do whatever you want to.

223
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,918
When you have everything you wanted,

224
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:56,504
I will kill you, then.

225
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:06,889
And cook some pasta for Seung-min.

226
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:11,644
She said you always choose
your favorite meals when you eat out.

227
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:46,512
Han-seo.

228
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:50,015
Set up a meeting
with Mr. Oh Jeong-bae of Daechang Daily.

229
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,142
We're not that close.

230
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,689
May I ask what this is about?

231
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:58,399
I want to talk about an article

232
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:01,402
for our EVs and the production
of batteries by Babel Chemicals.

233
00:23:01,485 --> 00:23:04,280
Can't Director Chun take care of that?

234
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:08,909
He won't be enough. I'm trying to get
Babel Chemicals' stocks to go up.

235
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:10,786
I have to talk to the CEO.

236
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,496
But…

237
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,751
we're still planning to develop them.
Our technology isn't ready yet.

238
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:19,879
I'm not saying
that we'll make cars for real.

239
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:22,298
We'll get the stocks up and pull out.

240
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:29,430
You are so smart. I'll never be able to
be on the same level as you.

241
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:32,475
Cut the crap. Who was it?

242
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:35,311
Just handle the gallery director.

243
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:38,022
I can't have her yap
about what happened. Okay?

244
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:41,358
Do a good job. Come on, do better.

245
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,456
My hair was perfect today.

246
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:07,343
I can't sleep
since that prosecutor betrayed us.

247
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,011
Why is that?

248
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,554
-Right?
-Yes.

249
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:12,890
We're not the ones who were betrayed,

250
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:15,684
but strangely, it upsets me so much.

251
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,854
-Do you know why?
-Why is that?

252
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,358
We've become interested
in what's happening around us.

253
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:27,112
We used to not care
because we were busy making a living.

254
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:29,156
Now it feels like it's our business.

255
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:31,784
You have a point.

256
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:35,454
We didn't care about rich people
or the law back then.

257
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:36,956
I'm not even well-educated,

258
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,250
but I can see what's wrong now.

259
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:42,628
Mr. Cassano told me this
when he was straightening me out.

260
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:46,674
"We become what we think.
If you think you're strong, you will be."

261
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:48,008
Isn't that awesome?

262
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:53,597
Anyway, I will follow Mr. Cassano
and continue to fight them.

263
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:55,266
-Yes.
-Good.

264
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:57,101
But don't get into any trouble.

265
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:58,936
Now we might have a baby…

266
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:03,148
What?

267
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,110
Did you guys have a change of heart?

268
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:11,907
We're going to try for a baby now.

269
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,868
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

270
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:16,120
-Great news. Have some meat.
-Oh, my.

271
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:19,790
That way, you'll fight less and get along.

272
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:22,126
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

273
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:24,712
-Come on. Eat up.
-Gosh.

274
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:26,380
That's great.

275
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:28,757
-I bet the baby will be handsome.
-Of course.

276
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:30,467
How was it?

277
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,351
This is beautiful.

278
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,484
Mr. Cassano.

279
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:49,361
What do you think?

280
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,740
It's nice.

281
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:56,410
But didn't you already buy enough
the other day?

282
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,830
It's not for me.

283
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:02,458
I'm picking out a gift for Ms. Oh.

284
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:12,217
Before her illness gets worse,
I want to take her out for some fresh air.

285
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:14,762
I see.

286
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:20,100
Won't that be too much for her?

287
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:23,729
Her doctor said she can go out
for an hour or two.

288
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:26,273
She hasn't gone out in ages.
She should dress up.

289
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:30,152
You should pick one, too.
I know you have good taste.

290
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:17,074
You bought it for her, so you should
give it to your mother yourself.

291
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,618
It's fine. You should…

292
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:24,248
Pardon?

293
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:27,710
Why are you so surprised?
You give it to your mother.

294
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:39,680
Did your father tell you?

295
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:42,057
No.

296
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:44,810
He never told me privileged information
about his clients.

297
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:46,895
Then how did you find out?

298
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:51,650
You paid for her medical bills.

299
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,862
You got back at Shinkwang Bank for her
even if you hated acting.

300
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:57,573
You said the same thing about
bungeoppang and ingeoppang.

301
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:00,326
Isn't it obvious that you are her son?

302
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:11,795
I really hate getting involved
in other people's family matters.

303
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:14,757
But let me be nosy just this once.

304
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,178
Why don't you tell her now?

305
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,930
That you know you're her son.

306
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,018
She doesn't have much time left.

307
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:30,397
So every single day she has left counts.

308
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,152
Remember what you told me?

309
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:38,947
"Regret is the most
painful thing in life."

310
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:42,451
Turns out it is true.

311
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,373
I hope you won't have to go through
such a painful thing.

312
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,270
This looks so refined.

313
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,690
I don't know if I deserve this.

314
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,487
Thank you, Mr. Cassano.

315
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:20,906
It's nothing.

316
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,868
It took him an hour
to pick this bag for you.

317
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:26,912
What?

318
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:29,665
Gosh. You didn't have to do that.

319
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:33,794
By the way,

320
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:37,256
I don't think I should go out.

321
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,426
I'm not well.

322
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:43,720
I'll only inconvenience you two.

323
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:45,681
Well, I'm not coming that day.

324
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,808
He will take you out.

325
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,476
Right?

326
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,566
Yes.

327
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,696
I know you're busy. I feel awful.

328
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:05,284
No. Think about all the places
you would like to visit.

329
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,411
Okay.

330
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,790
We should let her rest. Let's go.

331
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,504
Ms. Hong.

332
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,508
I have something to tell you.

333
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:26,972
I would like to…

334
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:31,602
file for a retrial.

335
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:35,981
Really?

336
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:38,317
Yes.

337
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,780
Why the sudden change of heart?

338
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:46,867
Actually…

339
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,372
there wasn't a day
I didn't want to file for a retrial.

340
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,375
I thought of doing it every day.

341
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,546
But…

342
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:02,257
I was hesitant.

343
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:05,761
I didn't have enough courage.

344
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:08,639
But…

345
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,227
now that I'm nearing my death,

346
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,230
I finally have the courage to do it.

347
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,027
Can you help me with this?

348
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,031
Do you think you can do it for me?

349
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,121
What do you think, Mr. Cassano?

350
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,749
I'll follow your decision.

351
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:51,723
Okay.

352
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:55,852
Let's do it.

353
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:01,316
I'll get started right away.

354
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,652
Thank you.

355
00:32:05,654 --> 00:32:07,239
Thank you so much.

356
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,150
Since your father passed away,

357
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,986
you've never come to see me, you brat.

358
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:34,198
I'm sorry. It's been hectic.

359
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:39,328
Why are things so crazy over at Babel?

360
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,789
Daechang has been working our butt off
to cover for you.

361
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:44,458
I'll return the favor.

362
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:48,503
-Han-seo already told you, right?
-Yes.

363
00:32:48,587 --> 00:32:51,590
You want an editorial about
Babel Chemicals' battery production.

364
00:32:53,258 --> 00:32:54,885
But Han-seok,

365
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:58,430
even elementary school kids
invest in stocks nowadays.

366
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,390
This is a sensitive and risky move.

367
00:33:02,184 --> 00:33:03,936
But you did it for my dad.

368
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,230
Just do what you did for him.

369
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:15,072
Why does a beautiful woman like you

370
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:18,408
need to flee the country this urgently?

371
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:20,911
I have made…

372
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:25,165
a terrible mistake.

373
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:28,627
I can't make up for it even with my life.

374
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:32,256
That's awful.

375
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:34,883
Don't worry too much.

376
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:36,927
Actually, we have a spot,

377
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,304
so you can leave later today.

378
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:43,558
You're certain that
it's a direct flight to Taiwan, right?

379
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:48,063
Of course. The wind is strong today.
You could go to Cebu if you wanted.

380
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:51,024
Is it possible to end up
flying past the destination?

381
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,237
It is quite random, to tell you the truth.

382
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,488
If you don't want to…

383
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:58,282
-Hey--
-I'll take it!

384
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:01,451
Yes, that's the contract.
Read it carefully.

385
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:05,038
BYEBYE BALLOON
TRAVEL CONTRACT

386
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:08,750
We have a client here.
What is it this time?

387
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,962
I just got a stock investment tip.

388
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:14,089
Daechang is preparing
to publish an article

389
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:15,674
to promote Babel Chemicals.

390
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,677
It's about EVs and batteries.

391
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,889
-Excuse me. Read the contract.
-Okay.

392
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:25,600
I should buy Babel Chemicals' stocks.

393
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,651
These Babel assholes won't die.

394
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:37,279
They are getting richer instead.

395
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:38,947
How? Why is that?

396
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,993
Everyone, do you want some coffee?

397
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:45,162
I'm not in the mood to drink coffee now.

398
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,414
I'm not in the mood to make coffee now.

399
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:48,999
Okay.

400
00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:59,426
Gosh. That traitor, Jung.

401
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:02,596
Babel will get more powerful
because of that bastard.

402
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:06,892
You met him last night. Why didn't you
make him pay for what he did?

403
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:08,852
He will do that in installments.

404
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,023
Do you think it's possible

405
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:15,317
he's just pretending to have switch sides?

406
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,902
Maybe he wants to expose

407
00:35:16,985 --> 00:35:19,071
-all the secrets from within--
-Mr. Nam.

408
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:23,450
That's never happened
in the history of this country.

409
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:26,453
We don't need Prosecutor Jung.

410
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:29,289
What's that?

411
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,334
This?

412
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:35,545
The Guillotine file.

413
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,422
The Guillotine file.

414
00:35:38,382 --> 00:35:41,843
You said you accidentally threw it
in the secret room and closed the door.

415
00:35:41,927 --> 00:35:43,220
Who said that? Me?

416
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:45,889
-Yes.
-Did I say that?

417
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,836
My goodness. Vincenzo Cassano.

418
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,754
Let's reveal what's in the file.

419
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,133
Once it goes online,
it'll go international in an hour.

420
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:22,968
-That's not a good idea.
-Why not?

421
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:25,137
It'll last a few days. But…

422
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:29,182
no one that's in this file
will pay for what they did.

423
00:36:30,434 --> 00:36:33,061
This file wasn't created
to expose the truth to the world

424
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:36,773
but for evil men to exploit the weakness
of other evil men.

425
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:39,860
Only an evil man can use it properly.

426
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:41,862
And we can use it just like they would.

427
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:44,573
We'll keep them on a leash
and order them around.

428
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,658
I see.

429
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,035
How frightening.

430
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:54,249
Did you read the file?

431
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,792
No. Not yet.

432
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:57,919
I wanted us to read it together.

433
00:36:58,712 --> 00:36:59,629
Mr. Nam.

434
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:02,007
-The laptop!
-Right, the laptop!

435
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:18,106
Gosh. Something doesn't feel right.

436
00:37:19,357 --> 00:37:23,695
I'm sure Prosecutor Jung and Mr. Jang
made a deal over something.

437
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:28,325
You know, the file.
The file they got from the gallery.

438
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:30,994
Do you think that's all?

439
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:32,829
That should be more than enough.

440
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:34,956
He has my brother

441
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,418
on tax evasion, illegally acquired stocks,
and everything on that file.

442
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:40,128
No. I get the feeling

443
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:42,881
that there's more.

444
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:45,675
What else? What else could there…

445
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,554
Is there really more?

446
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,977
-I don't know that.
-Me neither.

447
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:00,899
Anyway, Jung is
on your brother's side now.

448
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:04,027
And the deal with Daechang Daily
went smoothly.

449
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:08,949
Now your brother is going
to become powerful beyond control.

450
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,208
PROSECUTION

451
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:24,673
Gosh. The tabloids are nothing
compared to this.

452
00:38:24,756 --> 00:38:26,049
It is unbelievable.

453
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:29,719
To get this kind of information,
they must've surveilled them illegally.

454
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,764
This time, we'll be targeting Babel

455
00:38:33,348 --> 00:38:35,183
-and Daechang Daily.
-Daechang Daily.

456
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,978
I've been waiting
to crush this trashy agency.

457
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:40,689
Back in the day, newspapers could be
used as toilet paper.

458
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:43,108
But now, there's no use for them.

459
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:47,153
I mean, this so-called newspaper
makes ridiculous claims all year round.

460
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,863
They're absurd and make no sense.

461
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:52,284
If they keep doing it,
it is their attitude. It'll never change.

462
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:55,996
If Daechang Daily is gone,
it will cleanse our eyes and ears.

463
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,833
First, I'm planning to make them
fight and destroy each other.

464
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,503
Each other? How will you
make them go after each other?

465
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:05,839
Don't forget.

466
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:10,135
We have this Guillotine file.

467
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:13,054
Right, we'll pit one evil against another.

468
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:17,017
All right. Look over here.

469
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,455
Well, your office is…

470
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:42,334
It looks lame and awkward. It's nice.

471
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:45,837
Why are you here?

472
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,881
What? I can come if I want to.

473
00:39:55,388 --> 00:39:59,059
It's nothing much. It's just
the most expensive coffee, Kopi Luwak.

474
00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:00,518
I'm sure you know what it is.

475
00:40:00,602 --> 00:40:03,563
It's a rare product
made from civets' poop.

476
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:04,856
What a load of crap.

477
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:08,985
Who is that guy?

478
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:13,448
I'm not sure if Vincenzo is just lucky

479
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:15,992
or he's really competent.
But he's impressive.

480
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:18,870
The Guillotine file and 15 tons of gold.

481
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:21,331
No one will even think that it's there.

482
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:22,999
If we can get the file,

483
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:26,753
all the powerful people in Korea
will kneel

484
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:29,255
before you.

485
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,804
It sounds like the One Ring
from The Lord of the Rings.

486
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,098
You watched it, so you must know.

487
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,643
If it falls into the wrong hands,
it'll cause problems.

488
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,770
Only people like us

489
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:47,273
will do justice to the Ring.

490
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:57,826
Let's demolish Geumga Plaza
as fast as we can.

491
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:00,453
That way, we can get the file out.

492
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:05,166
I'll give you some of the gold
in the secret room.

493
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,127
Sure.

494
00:41:07,877 --> 00:41:09,254
I'll gladly accept it.

495
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:14,092
Thank you.

496
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:16,636
Thank you.

497
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:20,682
Hey, wait.

498
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:24,477
Why didn't you make the coffee
that I brought?

499
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,521
We don't have a coffee maker.

500
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:31,317
Gosh. Your working conditions here
are awful.

501
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:36,072
Damn it. It's so bitter. Hey, dude.
Why is this so bitter?

502
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:48,501
I heard that you asked Mr. Cassano
to get rid of your own brother.

503
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:50,962
It would have all worked out
if he did what I asked.

504
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,882
Things have gotten worse
because you declined.

505
00:41:54,466 --> 00:41:55,425
Didn't I tell you?

506
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:57,761
I never exploit betrayals within a family.

507
00:41:59,763 --> 00:42:02,056
I forgot to tell you this
because I was flustered.

508
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,561
I'm not trying to betray my own brother.

509
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:08,897
What I want…

510
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,566
How should I put it?
I don't want people to die anymore.

511
00:42:11,649 --> 00:42:15,236
-Right.
-I'm trying to run Babel legally.

512
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,657
I guess you've been studying a lot.
Your vocabulary has gotten better.

513
00:42:20,617 --> 00:42:22,786
Let me get this straight. You want to run

514
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:25,872
the company properly
after getting rid of your brother?

515
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:27,332
-That's it.
-Okay.

516
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,960
I really love Babel.

517
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:33,296
I want to run the company the right way.

518
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,299
I really don't want people to get killed.
I mean that.

519
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:39,135
Why don't you fix it then?
Why are you asking us for help?

520
00:42:39,844 --> 00:42:40,887
That's because…

521
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:48,645
no matter how much I think about it,
you are the only people who can beat him.

522
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:51,231
I like your intention.

523
00:42:52,524 --> 00:42:54,275
But do you deserve the seat?

524
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:58,154
I've been studying how to run a company.
I'm reading a lot of books.

525
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:01,741
Humanities and economy. I read everything.
I want to read all the time.

526
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,578
Then here's a quiz.

527
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:07,455
A quiz all of a sudden?

528
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:15,505
Fine. Go ahead. Give me a question.

529
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:17,423
In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith says

530
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:19,968
this hand brings order
to a market economy? What is it?

531
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:22,220
-Polite hand.
-Wrong.

532
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:24,097
"The invisible hand."

533
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:26,641
As the economy grows,

534
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:30,103
government expenditures
in gross national product also increase.

535
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:31,271
Name this law.

536
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:33,273
-Law of the Jungle.
-Wrong.

537
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:34,524
"Wagner's law."

538
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:36,442
This is the easiest one.

539
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:38,403
To improve the company's competitiveness,

540
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:40,572
you learn something from another company.

541
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,658
What is this term
that originated from an iron rod?

542
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:45,493
Here's a hint. Bench…

543
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,038
Wrong.

544
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:51,374
-Get out.
-Wait.

545
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:52,792
Hold on.

546
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:54,085
Didn't I get one right?

547
00:43:55,086 --> 00:43:56,838
How could you get everything wrong?

548
00:43:59,424 --> 00:44:01,259
The polite hand was correct. No?

549
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,511
If you want our help, go study more.

550
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,723
If you want to join us, you must be smart.

551
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:09,142
Is this a symposium or what? Why?

552
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:10,143
Feel free to say no.

553
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:12,020
Get out.

554
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,105
This is ridiculous.

555
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:15,273
What…

556
00:44:15,356 --> 00:44:16,733
Wait. Hold on.

557
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:19,736
If I pass your quiz
the next time I come here,

558
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,904
you'll really have to help me.

559
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:23,990
Get out.

560
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:29,579
Seriously. You're so petty.
Fine. I'll leave.

561
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:33,708
What will you quiz me on?

562
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:35,043
Out. Mr. Nam.

563
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,796
Did you know about the polite hand?

564
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,091
Here are my polite hands.

565
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:56,356
Will you really help Jang Han-seo?

566
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:10,453
You know,
I was trying to take Vincenzo's life.

567
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:14,916
But it turns out Vincenzo has been taking
what I cherish.

568
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:25,218
And that thing in the gallery.

569
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:34,769
What should I take from him

570
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:37,563
to make him suffer?

571
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:41,901
I must steal what's important to him.

572
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:45,279
Once he's dead, it's over.

573
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:46,698
So it's not his life.

574
00:45:47,824 --> 00:45:49,867
If I were to go down that route…

575
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,664
Should I look into his family?

576
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:56,958
"Family"?

577
00:45:58,292 --> 00:45:59,711
Is that important?

578
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:02,630
To regular people,

579
00:46:03,506 --> 00:46:05,091
family is important.

580
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:07,343
I see.

581
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:10,555
Okay. I guess only I didn't know.

582
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:16,310
Then I'll go with that.

583
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:24,193
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

584
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,201
Why do you look so exhausted?

585
00:46:32,285 --> 00:46:33,578
It's so fun.

586
00:46:34,245 --> 00:46:35,788
I haven't eaten or taken a dump

587
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,790
to read the file nonstop.

588
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:40,752
I'll go read some more after our briefing.

589
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:44,547
You should still go to the bathroom.
If you don't, toxins will build up.

590
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,513
I looked into some major problems
of Daechang Daily's owner, Oh Jeong-bae.

591
00:46:54,474 --> 00:46:56,184
He's such a bastard.

592
00:46:56,267 --> 00:46:57,602
What's the worst he did?

593
00:46:57,685 --> 00:46:59,270
He murdered his older brother.

594
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,315
Daechang is just as awful.

595
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:05,234
How come they all hate their siblings?

596
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:06,694
Why did he kill his brother?

597
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:08,321
They fought over the company.

598
00:47:08,404 --> 00:47:11,407
But he was acquitted of the charge.

599
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:18,498
He went hiking with his older brother
and killed him by pushing him off a cliff.

600
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:30,134
I bet there were no witnesses.
Is there any evidence that it was murder?

601
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:34,597
The environmental monitoring camera
caught him in the act.

602
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:37,850
But the International Security
Intelligence Service

603
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:40,686
obtained the footage, not the cops.

604
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,188
The agency must have

605
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:45,691
used the footage
to cut a deal with Mr. Oh.

606
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:47,026
That's correct.

607
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:51,155
He's a total asshole.
How could he kill his own brother?

608
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,490
You heard everything.

609
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:58,371
I can hear better when people whisper.

610
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:02,750
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

611
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:12,426
Mr. Nam, did you find anything else?

612
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:15,555
There's a shaman
he trusts and follows blindly.

613
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:25,773
There's a child who has matured over
ten months and is about to make his mark.

614
00:48:25,857 --> 00:48:29,193
When he makes decisions, big or small,
he does as the shaman says.

615
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:32,113
-Let me see.
-For both his family and company.

616
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:34,991
But the shaman's a former cult leader
who has been convicted

617
00:48:35,074 --> 00:48:37,285
four times
for fraud and sexual harassment.

618
00:48:37,368 --> 00:48:39,996
And of course, Mr. Oh has no idea.

619
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,206
Gosh. This is crazy.

620
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,333
He takes advice from a fraud like that?

621
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:46,878
You know how people are.

622
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:50,673
The less you know about something,
the easier you believe it.

623
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,175
I should check if he's really

624
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:55,761
a fraud or gifted.

625
00:48:57,763 --> 00:48:59,390
I'll go and finish reading it.

626
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:05,855
Gosh.

627
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:07,231
Don't move.

628
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:14,405
I'm telling you, Daechang Daily
burns the best.

629
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:18,367
When newspapers are full of lies,
you should use them to start a fire.

630
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,746
-Hey, who are you guys?
-Who do you think?

631
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,999
We brought you in,
so you could read our fortune.

632
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:25,917
What?

633
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:34,425
Hey, who are you?

634
00:49:35,217 --> 00:49:36,636
I wonder

635
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:40,056
if you know that you'll burn
to death five minutes later.

636
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:43,142
He must know. He's a gifted shaman.

637
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:46,062
Does he also know he'll take a fall
after burning to death?

638
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:47,521
Of course. He's gifted.

639
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:50,191
Spare me.

640
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:53,027
But his fate can be changed, right?

641
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,779
As long as he does what I tell him.

642
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:56,864
Why are you doing this to me, sirs?

643
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,659
By the way, do his customers know?

644
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:02,370
That he's a former cult leader
who was arrested four times

645
00:50:02,453 --> 00:50:04,246
for fraud and sexual harassment?

646
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,206
I'm not sure.

647
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:07,083
They don't know that yet, sir.

648
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:08,250
Then…

649
00:50:09,377 --> 00:50:11,003
shall we start talking now?

650
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,093
-Should I pour it?
-Yes?

651
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:18,803
-Gosh.
-Let's pay a silent tribute.

652
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:19,804
-Shall we?
-Okay.

653
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,180
This is for the deceased.

654
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:24,100
No, don't do that.

655
00:50:24,183 --> 00:50:25,518
-Why…
-It's over. Let's do it.

656
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,186
-Can you lift your legs?
-No.

657
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:28,688
-The head first.
-The head?

658
00:50:28,771 --> 00:50:30,022
-This is lamp oil.
-Wait.

659
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:31,232
I'll talk.

660
00:50:31,315 --> 00:50:32,566
-No.
-Light it.

661
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,485
-Let's talk.
-Daechang Daily.

662
00:50:34,568 --> 00:50:35,987
Let's use that newspaper.

663
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,113
Here we go.

664
00:50:37,196 --> 00:50:39,407
-It's burning. No!
-Gosh.

665
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,574
All right.

666
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:43,703
To screw over Babel and Daechang Daily,

667
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:47,123
we will hold a vote to pick a person
who will act as a shaman.

668
00:50:56,048 --> 00:50:59,844
Please vote for the person
that suits the role of a shaman the best.

669
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:17,361
Put it in there.

670
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:22,450
All right.

671
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:24,160
We all have voted for the person

672
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:26,412
who will act as the shaman.

673
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:29,749
Now, I will count the votes.

674
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:34,253
VINCENZO

675
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:35,713
"Vincenzo."

676
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:37,673
Me?

677
00:51:39,258 --> 00:51:40,468
This isn't a joke.

678
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:43,888
-Mr. Nam.
-You saw it?

679
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:45,598
"Mr. Cassano."

680
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:49,268
"Vincenzo Casanova,
Corn Salad. I love you."

681
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:51,437
What…

682
00:51:52,313 --> 00:51:53,355
Is this funny?

683
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,524
"Vincenzo."

684
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:57,276
-"Vitamin-cenzo."
-Why did you…

685
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,028
-"Mr. Vin."
-What are you guys doing?

686
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:00,696
"Mr. Vin, Vincenzo."

687
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,031
-"Vincenzo."
-Everyone.

688
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:03,282
"Mr. Cassano."

689
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:07,328
"Vincenzo. Vincenzo Quassano."

690
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,246
"Quassano"?

691
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,749
This is probably Vincenzo.
Yes, "Mr. Cassano."

692
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,584
All right.

693
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:18,923
This is the last vote.

694
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:21,175
Do we need to check the last vote?

695
00:52:22,176 --> 00:52:23,385
Vincen… "Hong Cha-young."

696
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,098
Why me?

697
00:52:28,974 --> 00:52:30,851
-It was you, wasn't it?
-All right.

698
00:52:31,435 --> 00:52:35,731
Mr. Cassano has been voted
for the role of the shaman.

699
00:52:39,151 --> 00:52:43,614
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

700
00:52:43,697 --> 00:52:47,368
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

701
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:50,246
HOW BABEL CHEMICALS BECAME
THE LEADER IN THE EV MARKET

702
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:03,759
CEO OH JEONG-BAE

703
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:07,555
Hello, sir.

704
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:11,392
I need to speak to you
about an urgent matter.

705
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:18,399
Pardon? What are you talking about?

706
00:53:19,483 --> 00:53:20,401
Sir.

707
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:24,321
I can no longer communicate
with any spirits.

708
00:53:24,864 --> 00:53:26,907
The mountains deity has left me.

709
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,827
No.

710
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,537
I need you.

711
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,164
You must pull through.

712
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:38,669
Sir, please.

713
00:53:39,628 --> 00:53:41,297
Mr. Oh, listen carefully.

714
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,339
Okay.

715
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:43,799
I'm useless now.

716
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:47,845
But I know a really powerful shaman.

717
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:52,057
No, he's much better than me
at communicating with the spirits.

718
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:54,518
No. You must go see him instead.

719
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:56,645
That's the only way we'll survive.

720
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:01,984
-I'm number five.
-I'm number six.

721
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:03,277
-I'm number seven.
-Why?

722
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,195
Gosh.

723
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:06,989
-It'll take five minutes per person.
-Right.

724
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:08,824
-I heard he's really good.
-Really?

725
00:54:08,908 --> 00:54:10,701
-Yes.
-I should've gotten more time.

726
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:14,079
-I can't wait to find out.
-Right. I've been waiting for an hour.

727
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,831
-What's your number?
-Number four.

728
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:17,041
-I'm number six.
-Okay.

729
00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:18,292
PARK HYO SHRINE

730
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,543
I heard he's really good.

731
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:24,965
-Hey.
-You can't cut in line.

732
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:26,175
You just got here.

733
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:27,343
-We're in line here.
-Right.

734
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:28,761
-Go grab a ticket.
-Yes.

735
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:31,055
We've been waiting here
before you got here.

736
00:54:31,138 --> 00:54:33,224
-See?
-Right.

737
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,516
-Look.
-Look.

738
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,647
But I made a reservation.

739
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:43,484
-Is that so?
-I see.

740
00:54:43,567 --> 00:54:46,028
I didn't know about that. Then, go inside.

741
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:48,364
-I'm jealous.
-Gosh.

742
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,241
-Good for you.
-Awesome.

743
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,663
-Good for you.
-I'm so jealous.

744
00:54:55,746 --> 00:54:56,914
Good luck.

745
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:05,714
How may I help you?

746
00:55:06,715 --> 00:55:07,758
Well…

747
00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:11,637
shaman Biryu recommended me
to see the shaman here.

748
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,180
-I'm Daechang's--
-"Daechang."

749
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:16,892
Welcome.
Young Master Yeorim is waiting for you.

750
00:55:17,601 --> 00:55:18,644
I see.

751
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,149
OH, INZAGHI

752
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:13,198
You have an interesting name

753
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:15,200
for your shrine.

754
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:18,329
We named it after Park Hyo,
the Chief State Councilor of Joseon.

755
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:21,915
He was enlightened
after going into the mountains

756
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:24,126
and became a mountain deity.

757
00:56:25,336 --> 00:56:27,046
That is why the deity we worship is

758
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:30,007
known as "Park Hyo Shin."
"Shin" meaning god.

759
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:38,307
I see. Okay.

760
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,019
Following the long shadow

761
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:54,323
Well…

762
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:57,910
I'm here because I want some answers
to my questions.

763
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,872
But I'm not sure if I should ask them.

764
00:57:03,374 --> 00:57:05,834
Should I ask them?

765
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,045
Or not?

766
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:09,880
Get out.

767
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:12,758
I have nothing to say to a dead man.

768
00:57:13,258 --> 00:57:14,385
Look.

769
00:57:19,598 --> 00:57:21,850
I won't have to send condolence money
since we just met.

770
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:24,353
Who do you think I am?

771
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:28,148
You con artists.

772
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:29,400
Jeong-bae.

773
00:57:32,486 --> 00:57:33,445
What?

774
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:35,280
"Jeong-bae"?

775
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:38,117
How dare you call me by my first name?

776
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:42,454
-I'm your brother, Jeong-bae.
-What?

777
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:46,417
I'm so cold.

778
00:57:56,427 --> 00:57:57,678
I'm cold.

779
00:58:01,265 --> 00:58:02,808
My hands are freezing.

780
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:04,476
I'm so cold.

781
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:12,609
How could you push me off
the cliff and leave me?

782
00:58:12,693 --> 00:58:14,653
I'm still here.

783
00:58:21,785 --> 00:58:22,661
How…

784
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:26,749
-How could my brother…
-I'm cold.

785
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:31,670
Jeong-bae, help me up already.

786
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:34,882
It's freezing down here. Okay?

787
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:37,885
-I'm so cold, Jeong-bae.
-Go away.

788
00:58:37,968 --> 00:58:40,387
-Get away from me.
-Jeong-bae.

789
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:43,182
-Get off me.
-Jeong-bae.

790
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:46,935
Jeong-bae.

791
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:48,228
-Let go.
-Jeong-bae.

792
00:58:48,312 --> 00:58:50,522
-No!
-Jeong-bae.

793
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:52,149
-Go away.
-I'm cold, Jeong-bae.

794
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:55,402
Jeong-bae, I'm so cold.

795
00:58:55,486 --> 00:58:57,237
Get away from me!

796
00:58:57,321 --> 00:58:59,281
Jeong-bae, I'm so cold.

797
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:05,329
Why are there

798
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:09,833
so many burdens in my life?

799
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:15,047
It's not that you have many burdens.
You are just weak.

800
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:18,675
The weaker you are,

801
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:22,304
the heavier your burdens become.

802
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:24,681
I see.

803
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:29,269
Do you want to see
what will kill you eventually?

804
00:59:30,854 --> 00:59:33,023
Yes. I do.

805
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:12,813
BABEL

806
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:26,577
Unless you cut ties with Babel,
you will die a miserable death.

807
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,124
Is that all I need to do?

808
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:39,006
It's more than cutting ties with them.

809
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:44,011
You must cut ties with them
as you completely trample on them.

810
01:00:44,094 --> 01:00:45,304
What?

811
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:46,930
To get rid of bad luck altogether.

812
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:49,975
That's…

813
01:00:50,642 --> 01:00:53,312
It's not that easy.

814
01:01:10,162 --> 01:01:11,663
I see.

815
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,044
That's the number of days you have left.

816
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:19,296
Five days.

817
01:01:28,555 --> 01:01:30,390
Poor thing.

818
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:43,153
You know what?

819
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:47,532
I went too hard earlier.
My arms are hurting. They hurt so much.

820
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:52,704
Isn't it ironic?

821
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:56,458
A newspaper company is supposed to
publish facts, but he's so superstitious.

822
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:01,296
He's superstitious
because he has no interest in facts.

823
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,718
You startled me.

824
01:02:06,802 --> 01:02:07,719
Oh, right.

825
01:02:07,803 --> 01:02:12,057
I forgot to tell you
because we were so busy today.

826
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,477
I found something shocking about
Jang Han-seok in the Guillotine file.

827
01:02:16,228 --> 01:02:18,021
-What is it?
-Chairman Jang

828
01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:21,441
killed four of his classmates
in middle and high school.

829
01:02:23,902 --> 01:02:27,781
He brought classmates he didn't like
to a rooftop and made them jump.

830
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:30,993
Or he hunted and killed them
in the mountains like they were prey.

831
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:36,999
He killed the last one because he stole
a ball from him during a gym class.

832
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:40,752
Jang used the goal net to strangle him.

833
01:02:43,046 --> 01:02:44,631
Here's what's scarier.

834
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:01,732
JANG HAN-SEOK

835
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:30,594
He took the deceased's watches

836
01:03:30,677 --> 01:03:33,180
as some kind of a trophy.

837
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:37,809
And he even bragged about it
like he was proud of it.

838
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,146
He's a psychopath.

839
01:03:41,229 --> 01:03:44,149
He was diagnosed as a psychopath
at the age of 16.

840
01:03:44,232 --> 01:03:47,611
That's why his father sent him
to the States

841
01:03:47,694 --> 01:03:50,072
fearing that he might become
a serial killer.

842
01:03:50,155 --> 01:03:53,158
Jang Han-seo was beaten
and tortured by him,

843
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:56,495
so he's been seeing a therapist
ever since he was little.

844
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:59,039
And that's how he ended up doing drugs.

845
01:03:59,122 --> 01:04:01,374
Even so, he shouldn't be doing drugs.

846
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:02,959
That jerk.

847
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:04,795
Anyway, their father, Jang Guk-hwan,

848
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:07,380
covered everything up with money

849
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,174
and kept it a secret.

850
01:04:13,178 --> 01:04:15,555
That explains why he was so hard to beat.

851
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:18,475
Turns out he's

852
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:21,311
the biggest monster of them all.

853
01:04:30,028 --> 01:04:32,656
BABEL SUSPECTED TO HAVE MADE
FALSE STATEMENTS TO RAISE STOCK VALUE

854
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:52,467
DAECHANG DAILY

855
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:55,762
Hello?

856
01:04:55,846 --> 01:04:57,222
What are you doing?

857
01:04:58,056 --> 01:05:00,267
-What the hell is this?
-Mr. Jang.

858
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:05,272
There has been a change
in the guidelines at my company.

859
01:05:06,148 --> 01:05:08,233
Did I do something to offend you?

860
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:10,235
No, you didn't.

861
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,906
Now Daechang Daily is an honest newspaper
that only speaks the truth.

862
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:15,949
The truth?

863
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:19,953
You're the most corrupt newspaper company
in Korea. But what? The truth?

864
01:05:20,036 --> 01:05:21,788
Watch what you say.

865
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:23,999
So, why didn't you
run your company properly?

866
01:05:24,499 --> 01:05:25,667
I'm hanging up.

867
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,419
Mr. Oh? Mr. Oh!

868
01:05:28,003 --> 01:05:28,879
Hey!

869
01:05:44,227 --> 01:05:47,772
How come my days are still numbered?

870
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:51,026
I just cut all ties with Babel.

871
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:53,820
That won't be enough to save your life.

872
01:05:53,904 --> 01:05:55,113
Pardon?

873
01:05:56,072 --> 01:06:00,619
Then what more do I need to do?

874
01:06:02,662 --> 01:06:04,789
The owner of Babel.

875
01:06:04,873 --> 01:06:05,916
The king of Babel.

876
01:06:11,254 --> 01:06:12,547
Are you talking about

877
01:06:12,631 --> 01:06:15,258
Chairman Jang Han-seok?

878
01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:18,887
He's the one
who's holding onto your misfortune.

879
01:06:20,472 --> 01:06:23,475
If you expose his past evils,

880
01:06:23,558 --> 01:06:26,937
and relieve the spirits that wander
the realm of the living because of him,

881
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:30,690
those spirits will help you.

882
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:41,409
The wandering spirits?

883
01:06:47,832 --> 01:06:51,086
Are you saying Han-seok killed someone?

884
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:16,569
Han-seok.

885
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:19,781
I'm sorry.

886
01:07:19,864 --> 01:07:21,574
Don't hit me.

887
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:25,245
Han-seok. I'm sorry.

888
01:07:25,328 --> 01:07:26,496
It's all my fault.

889
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,164
-I'm not Han-seok.
-I'm sorry.

890
01:07:28,248 --> 01:07:29,708
-I'm not him.
-Don't strangle me.

891
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,751
-I can't breathe.
-Jang Han-seok.

892
01:07:31,835 --> 01:07:32,877
Don't strangle me.

893
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:34,713
-Jang Han-seok. Spare me.
-No.

894
01:07:34,796 --> 01:07:36,381
-It's my fault.
-Don't do it.

895
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:38,591
No. I'm not Han-seok!

896
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:39,926
That's my watch.

897
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,595
That's my watch. It's mine.

898
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:45,140
-It's my watch.
-No.

899
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:51,354
The chairman of Babel,
one of the biggest companies in Korea,

900
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:52,814
was a bully?

901
01:07:52,897 --> 01:07:55,317
No. It was more of a massacre.

902
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,987
This has come
as shocking news to the public.

903
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:02,198
On top of that,
he was never punished for his crimes,

904
01:08:02,282 --> 01:08:05,952
and was able to climb the ladder
to become the chairman.

905
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:09,122
I mean, seriously?
Where were the police and prosecutors

906
01:08:09,205 --> 01:08:11,124
in all of this?

907
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,585
Right now, a lot of people

908
01:08:13,668 --> 01:08:16,671
are urging this killer chairman
to be punished

909
01:08:16,755 --> 01:08:19,632
on many of the online forums
and petitioning for it as well.

910
01:08:20,216 --> 01:08:21,509
Gosh.

911
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:24,554
How did they know?

912
01:08:24,637 --> 01:08:28,767
Even Mr. Oh wouldn't
know about my childhood.

913
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,394
…update you with a follow-up coverage.

914
01:08:31,478 --> 01:08:33,021
Right now, Babel Group

915
01:08:33,104 --> 01:08:34,939
-has dismissed the claims
-Hey.

916
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:36,608
-It wasn't you, right?
-as being false.

917
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:39,903
-They will soon release
-What? Of course, it wasn't me.

918
01:08:39,986 --> 01:08:43,531
The article even said I was crazy
and did drugs. You think I did that?

919
01:08:45,283 --> 01:08:46,618
Well, you're right.

920
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:53,875
It was reported that there hadn't been
an investigation on this in the past.

921
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,879
Who else knows about this?

922
01:08:59,756 --> 01:09:03,176
My dad, the detective who worked the case,

923
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,178
and the prosecutor in charge.

924
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,601
Then there's a source we're not aware of.

925
01:09:12,352 --> 01:09:16,022
The problem is the intention.
Why is Mr. Oh attacking you now?

926
01:09:16,606 --> 01:09:19,025
It looks like
he's trying to bring me down.

927
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:39,504
LIFE

928
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,018
It's all done.

929
01:09:54,769 --> 01:09:56,229
You have been spared.

930
01:10:02,777 --> 01:10:05,488
Fate has a weakness for brave souls,

931
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,324
but it can be a powerful foe
to those who are weak.

932
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:13,037
You have been brave
and averted this crisis.

933
01:10:44,402 --> 01:10:46,821
Thank you.

934
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:50,450
Thank you.

935
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,098
It's been a while, Mr. Cho.

936
01:11:14,182 --> 01:11:15,683
Can we meet now?

937
01:11:15,767 --> 01:11:18,061
I'll meet you at the parking lot
of the plaza.

938
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:21,189
Okay. Sure.

939
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,107
Okay.

940
01:12:48,943 --> 01:12:49,944
Run!

941
01:12:57,076 --> 01:12:58,453
Who are they?

942
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:02,040
I think Prosecutor Jung sent them.

943
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:04,917
Prosecutor Jung?

944
01:13:08,671 --> 01:13:10,548
It's as expected.

945
01:13:10,632 --> 01:13:12,884
It was Vincenzo.

946
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:16,137
He exploited Mr. Oh's tendency
to have blind faith in shamans.

947
01:13:16,804 --> 01:13:18,514
He's so detailed.

948
01:13:20,224 --> 01:13:22,560
I really can't beat a Mafia member.

949
01:13:24,354 --> 01:13:25,688
Anyway…

950
01:13:25,772 --> 01:13:29,442
how did he find out
what happened when I was young?

951
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:32,445
That's still a mystery to me.

952
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:36,199
But it's most likely that he got it
from the intelligence agency.

953
01:13:38,368 --> 01:13:40,995
How on earth did he find out?

954
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:43,665
Given the current circumstances,

955
01:13:43,748 --> 01:13:46,876
he's pitted Babel and Daechang
against each other.

956
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:50,713
Even so. Mr. Oh of all people
can't do that to me.

957
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:53,174
What should we do?

958
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:01,182
Make Vincenzo end it himself.

959
01:14:01,265 --> 01:14:03,810
Oh, right. I must show you something.

960
01:14:07,438 --> 01:14:08,356
What is it?

961
01:14:09,857 --> 01:14:12,360
Vincenzo's Korean name is Park Ju-hyeong.

962
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:15,571
He was adopted after being abandoned
by his mother when he was little.

963
01:14:15,655 --> 01:14:16,906
OH GYEONG-JA, PERSONAL DETAILS

964
01:14:16,989 --> 01:14:18,199
Is his mom alive?

965
01:14:18,282 --> 01:14:21,202
She is. But she recently got out of prison

966
01:14:21,285 --> 01:14:23,621
-because of pancreatic cancer.
-What was she in for?

967
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:26,124
She was the housekeeper
who was involved in the death

968
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:28,668
of Shinkwang Finance's Chairman Hwang.

969
01:14:30,128 --> 01:14:31,295
NAMDONGBU DISTRICT COURT
RULING

970
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:32,255
Wait.

971
01:14:32,755 --> 01:14:35,633
He ruined the signing ceremony
a while ago.

972
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:40,763
Is this why he did that?

973
01:14:40,847 --> 01:14:41,889
Yes.

974
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:46,102
Hong Yu-chan was the public defender
who took her case.

975
01:14:46,185 --> 01:14:50,732
And today, she filed for a retrial
regarding the death of Hwang Deok-bae.

976
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:51,983
A retrial?

977
01:14:53,985 --> 01:14:56,112
-Who filed it?
-Cha-young did.

978
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:58,573
Of course, Vincenzo must be behind it.

979
01:15:04,495 --> 01:15:07,582
That means Vincenzo
has been spending time with his mother.

980
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:12,462
I'm trying to find out which hospital
his mother is being treated in.

981
01:15:19,302 --> 01:15:22,764
I met Jung at the International Security
Intelligence Service five years ago.

982
01:15:23,514 --> 01:15:26,768
He was dispatched for a case,
and I had a desk job there.

983
01:15:27,518 --> 01:15:30,021
We found out the true nature
of the Guillotine file,

984
01:15:30,104 --> 01:15:31,439
and Jung thought he could

985
01:15:31,522 --> 01:15:34,567
root out all corruption in Korea
with the file.

986
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:37,445
So he desperately tried
to get his hands on it,

987
01:15:37,528 --> 01:15:39,572
and I joined hands with him.

988
01:15:40,865 --> 01:15:42,950
That was before he went dirty.

989
01:15:43,034 --> 01:15:43,993
Yes.

990
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:47,330
But soon,
the file was hacked and vanished,

991
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:49,707
and I volunteered to look for the file.

992
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,710
That's how I got here.

993
01:15:53,878 --> 01:15:56,839
But Jung has betrayed you, right?

994
01:15:57,507 --> 01:16:01,636
Yes. In fact, I suspected him
these past few months.

995
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,640
I felt he had an ulterior motive
for looking for the file.

996
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:11,729
Now that he is on Jang Han-seok's side,
he must know by now

997
01:16:12,522 --> 01:16:15,983
that the file and the gold are here.

998
01:16:16,067 --> 01:16:20,321
And he must know he has to demolish
the plaza to retrieve them.

999
01:16:28,371 --> 01:16:29,914
GEUMGA PLAZA

1000
01:17:01,904 --> 01:17:04,323
PETITION FOR A RETRIAL

1001
01:18:09,013 --> 01:18:09,972
Damn it.

1002
01:19:43,107 --> 01:19:44,567
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

1003
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:47,528
You're under arrest
for the murder of Oh Jeong-bae.

1004
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,231
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE HYE-JUNG
AND IM SUNG-JAE

1005
01:20:52,927 --> 01:20:54,345
It was a setup, wasn't it?

1006
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:57,431
Then we'll have to use
the most effective method.

1007
01:20:57,515 --> 01:20:58,724
I'll make sure no one ever gets it.

1008
01:20:58,808 --> 01:21:00,559
I have to find the person who lured me.

1009
01:21:00,643 --> 01:21:03,354
I'll make sure everyone who tried to
build it will be punished.

1010
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:07,191
He could stir up the entire nation.

1011
01:21:08,442 --> 01:21:11,320
To cherish Geumga Plaza
as a historical building.

1012
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:14,073
Make him pay.

1013
01:21:15,324 --> 01:21:16,784
It's time for you to die.

1014
01:21:16,867 --> 01:21:20,788
You will die a slow death,
experiencing it every step of the way.

1015
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:27,545
