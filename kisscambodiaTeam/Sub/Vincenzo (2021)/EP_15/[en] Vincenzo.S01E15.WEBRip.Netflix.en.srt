1
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,532
Did Paolo send you?

2
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,035
Perhaps.

3
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,030
Paolo told me

4
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,449
to give you a painless death

5
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,203
if you show respect to Paolo.

6
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,630
Relay this message to Paolo.
I will not respect him

7
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,134
even after I die.

8
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,294
Inzaghi?

9
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,340
Inzaghi.

10
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,416
Did you get the rooftop ready?

11
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,626
-Well, yes.
-Good.

12
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,212
Wait. Why don't we drink in the office?

13
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,756
There's so much pigeon poop
on the rooftop.

14
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,133
Let me carry that.

15
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,886
I bet it was Inzaghi
and the other pigeons.

16
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,185
Inzaghi is not that kind of pigeon.

17
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,855
I bet it was other pigeons.
Don't badmouth Inzaghi.

18
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,940
It would hurt Inzaghi.

19
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,573
What happened here?

20
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,078
A nail must have torn it
when I was moving the table.

21
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,498
Why did you move that by yourself?
Let's drink standing up.

22
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,708
-Ms. Hong.
-What?

23
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,587
My knees are aching.

24
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,089
Can we drink sitting down?

25
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,675
Sure.

26
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,848
Did you send the file from the gallery
to Prosecutor Jung?

27
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,726
Yes. He should be
on his way to make the arrest.

28
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,852
That's great.

29
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,317
Why would you hold such a stupid event
and cause so much trouble?

30
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
The gallery is not your playground!

31
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,571
I'm sorry.

32
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,406
I'm so sorry, sir.

33
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,701
This won't end with you.

34
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,827
I…

35
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,121
Be quiet.

36
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,540
I'm thinking.

37
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,918
This is ridiculous.

38
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,046
It's like she doesn't think at all.

39
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,008
You should leave the country
before they bar you from going abroad.

40
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,384
Why? Go where?

41
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,386
I'll take the fall for him. Why bother?

42
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,973
All the evidence they have points to you.

43
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,852
They will be able to track the IP address
from the gallery to your home.

44
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,108
Han-seo.

45
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,861
Get me the earliest flight
leaving for New York now.

46
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,530
Yes, sir.

47
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,271
Before I leave,

48
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,440
I want to see Vincenzo's dead body.

49
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,032
Yes, sir. We took care of it.

50
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,994
But I found Choi Myung-hee's phone number

51
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,371
in the call history
on one of the cell phones.

52
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,211
Okay. Well done. Wrap it up.

53
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,681
-Yes. Mr. Consigliere.
-Hey, Luca.

54
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,923
RESTRICTED NUMBER

55
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,595
They failed again.

56
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,606
He's so hard to kill.

57
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,867
And they call themselves
the Mafia's hitmen?

58
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,870
They look like the thieves
from Home Alone. Look at the feather.

59
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,205
Ms. Choi Myung-hee!

60
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,581
What will you do about it?

61
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,092
I'm sorry, sir. Let's go
to the airport now. I'll escort you.

62
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,858
Stop them now.

63
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,028
Forget it.

64
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,210
ARREST WARRANT

65
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,507
I came personally
to mark this historical day.

66
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,426
You seem very happy.

67
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,844
Why wouldn't I be?

68
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,470
Take him.

69
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,017
I'll come to you as soon as I'm ready.

70
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,702
Inzaghi.

71
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,458
Were you returning the favor?

72
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,919
Were you?

73
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,713
Is that it?

74
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,345
No way. It can't be.

75
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,723
How can a pigeon save a man?

76
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,958
There's a news embargo.

77
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,793
Jang Han-seok's been arrested.

78
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,380
Prosecutor Jung will announce it
at a press conference tomorrow morning.

79
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,300
Good job.

80
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,809
This is beautiful.

81
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,570
Goodness. Thank you, Ms. Oh.

82
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,034
You wrote a letter, too?

83
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,412
Hold on. Not now.

84
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,122
Please read it at home.

85
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,211
-Hello.
-Hello.

86
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,879
-Hi.
-You're here.

87
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,466
Ms. Hong, isn't it safe to say

88
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,512
that it was all thanks to us
that Babel's chairman was arrested?

89
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,057
Yes. Thanks to your help,
we were able to catch Chairman Jang!

90
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,810
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk will
now begin the press conference

91
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,105
-All right. It's starting.
-about the investigation against Babel.

92
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,906
-Hello.
-He's on.

93
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,951
I'm Prosecutor Jung In-kuk of
Seoul Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

94
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,160
There he is.

95
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,249
I have been investigating Babel Group on
six different charges for the past year.

96
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,668
They're all depraved
corporate corruption charges.

97
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,588
The charges violated the national economic
system and legal system.

98
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,507
That's it! There you go!

99
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,092
That hits the spot.

100
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,137
But I must tell the truth now.

101
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,267
When Jang Guk-hwan was the chairman,

102
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,561
I was eager to make a name for myself

103
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,354
and took my investigation too far.

104
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,772
As a result, I was demoted.

105
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,943
My personal feelings got the better of me.

106
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,945
I tried to indict Chairman Jang Han-seok

107
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,115
of Babel with unproven claims.

108
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,741
What's he saying? Has he gone mad?

109
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,619
And I crossed the line again
and caused damage

110
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,705
to the Babel Group
with yesterday's incident.

111
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,373
Is that really Mr. Jung?

112
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,752
It looks like he switched sides.

113
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,714
So he betrayed us?

114
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,761
I am holding this press conference
to come clean about my wrongdoings

115
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,056
and to recover the trust
the Namdongbu office has lost.

116
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,436
From now on, I will serve the people
of our country without

117
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,272
-letting my emotions get the better of me.
-I didn't see this coming.

118
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,274
If this happened in a drama,

119
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,401
people would say it's too unrealistic.

120
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,194
Moreover,

121
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,946
-They'd be up in arms about it.
-my ambition

122
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,491
has deeply mistreated
Chairman Jang Han-seok of Babel.

123
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,703
I would like to apologize for my actions.

124
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,996
That's okay.

125
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,500
I knew he was going to cave in
like that in the end.

126
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,294
That arrogant jerk.

127
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,422
NAMDONGBU OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE
ON THE BABEL INVESTIGATION

128
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,092
You should apologize to me, too!
That greedy bastard…

129
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,846
Look at him bowing down like that.

130
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,976
As of today, all the charges
against Babel will be dropped,

131
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,770
and the investigation will be closed.

132
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,273
I would like to apologize
for the confusion I've caused.

133
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,211
Ms. Hong.

134
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,883
Gosh.

135
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,177
Let's visit him later.

136
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
I should go and slap him.

137
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,600
He won't see us anyway.

138
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,602
We'll go later.

139
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,441
This is unbelievably cruel.

140
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,613
He despised Babel.
How could he switch sides overnight?

141
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,137
Why didn't we see this coming?

142
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,811
You can dodge a flying dagger,

143
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,314
but you can't dodge a hidden dagger.

144
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,153
Aren't you angry?

145
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,696
Angry?

146
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,576
I'm furious.

147
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,996
I'm just used to it.

148
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,007
I'll make him pay for this.

149
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,676
He'll pay no matter what.

150
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,637
If we react emotionally to betrayals,
it'll end up hurting us.

151
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,182
The bigger the betrayal is,

152
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,311
the more careful we must be.

153
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,448
If you were going to do this anyway,
you should've gone easy on them.

154
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,827
I'm sorry for my reckless behavior, sir.

155
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,709
I'll suspend you for two weeks
as a formality.

156
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,710
Take a breather.

157
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,838
When you return, you'll be promoted.

158
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,839
For your office…

159
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,258
Take Mr. Seo's office.
Make yourself at home.

160
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,761
Okay. Thank you.

161
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,471
Anything else you need?

162
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,974
Could you put some guards
around me and my family?

163
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,811
The Mafia might be gunning for me.

164
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,066
Let's go.

165
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,533
You know that I obtained
some hard evidence today, don't you?

166
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,995
There's no way out for you this time.

167
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,796
But what if I make this all go away?

168
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,800
How high can I go?

169
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,637
I'm serious right now.

170
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,600
Gosh. Is this some kind of prank?

171
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,229
Why all of a sudden?

172
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,398
Since it's finally time.

173
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,401
Then why have you been
harassing me all this time?

174
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:17,364
Because I needed Vincenzo to bring me
the best evidence, like today.

175
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,409
Let me ask you again.

176
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,412
How high can I go?

177
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,955
I can make you the Chief Prosecutor.

178
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,748
Make me the Prosecutor General…

179
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,667
or higher.

180
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,918
You're very greedy.

181
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,045
What if I have something

182
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,631
that allows me to be greedy?

183
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,594
The Guillotine file.

184
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,848
Do you know where the file is

185
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,893
and who has it?

186
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,462
How come there aren't any guards?

187
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,897
Honey.

188
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,898
Seung-min!

189
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,775
Honey. Seung-min.

190
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,026
Honey.

191
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,278
Seung-min. Honey!

192
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,407
-Dad!
-Yes.

193
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,913
Hello, my friend.

194
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,667
-Dad.
-Yes?

195
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,462
Your colleague from Italy is so handsome.

196
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,089
He's my type.

197
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,968
You should have told us
that he was coming today.

198
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,262
-He ended up cooking everything.
-Yes.

199
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,138
His spaghetti was so tasty.

200
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,349
-Is that so?
-Yes.

201
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,101
Seung-min.

202
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,354
Did you have dinner?

203
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,566
Seung-min,
I guess he hasn't had dinner yet.

204
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,112
Please sit.
We have a lot of catching up to do.

205
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,073
-Sit down, honey.
-Okay.

206
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,242
Seung-min.

207
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,619
Shall we make yummy spaghetti
for your dad, too?

208
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,954
Yes.

209
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,956
Can you help me cook?

210
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,089
I don't care if you kill me,

211
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,801
but leave my family out of this.

212
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,347
Don't worry. I'm not like you.

213
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,852
Is there any way I can save myself?

214
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,355
I'll do anything.

215
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,944
Do you know how you can tell
when someone's become evil?

216
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,657
It's when they stop feeling ashamed.

217
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,659
And you crossed that line.

218
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,495
Please…

219
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,752
Please don't kill me.

220
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,299
I don't plan on killing you yet.

221
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,762
Since killing a traitor early
is an act of great generosity.

222
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,565
Do whatever you want to.

223
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,318
When you have everything you wanted,

224
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,904
I will kill you, then.

225
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,289
And cook some pasta for Seung-min.

226
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,044
She said you always choose
your favorite meals when you eat out.

227
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,912
Han-seo.

228
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,415
Set up a meeting
with Mr. Oh Jeong-bae of Daechang Daily.

229
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,542
We're not that close.

230
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,089
May I ask what this is about?

231
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,799
I want to talk about an article

232
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,802
for our EVs and the production
of batteries by Babel Chemicals.

233
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,680
Can't Director Chun take care of that?

234
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,309
He won't be enough. I'm trying to get
Babel Chemicals' stocks to go up.

235
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,186
I have to talk to the CEO.

236
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,896
But…

237
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,151
we're still planning to develop them.
Our technology isn't ready yet.

238
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,279
I'm not saying
that we'll make cars for real.

239
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,698
We'll get the stocks up and pull out.

240
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,830
You are so smart. I'll never be able to
be on the same level as you.

241
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,875
Cut the crap. Who was it?

242
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,711
Just handle the gallery director.

243
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,422
I can't have her yap
about what happened. Okay?

244
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,758
Do a good job. Come on, do better.

245
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,856
My hair was perfect today.

246
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,743
I can't sleep
since that prosecutor betrayed us.

247
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,411
Why is that?

248
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,954
-Right?
-Yes.

249
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,290
We're not the ones who were betrayed,

250
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,084
but strangely, it upsets me so much.

251
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,254
-Do you know why?
-Why is that?

252
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,758
We've become interested
in what's happening around us.

253
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:14,512
We used to not care
because we were busy making a living.

254
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,556
Now it feels like it's our business.

255
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,184
You have a point.

256
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,854
We didn't care about rich people
or the law back then.

257
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,356
I'm not even well-educated,

258
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,650
but I can see what's wrong now.

259
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,028
Mr. Cassano told me this
when he was straightening me out.

260
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,074
"We become what we think.
If you think you're strong, you will be."

261
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,408
Isn't that awesome?

262
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:40,997
Anyway, I will follow Mr. Cassano
and continue to fight them.

263
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,666
-Yes.
-Good.

264
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,501
But don't get into any trouble.

265
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,336
Now we might have a baby…

266
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,548
What?

267
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,510
Did you guys have a change of heart?

268
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,307
We're going to try for a baby now.

269
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,268
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

270
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,520
-Great news. Have some meat.
-Oh, my.

271
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,190
That way, you'll fight less and get along.

272
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,526
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

273
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,112
-Come on. Eat up.
-Gosh.

274
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,780
That's great.

275
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,157
-I bet the baby will be handsome.
-Of course.

276
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,867
How was it?

277
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,751
This is beautiful.

278
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,884
Mr. Cassano.

279
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,761
What do you think?

280
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,140
It's nice.

281
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,810
But didn't you already buy enough
the other day?

282
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,230
It's not for me.

283
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,858
I'm picking out a gift for Ms. Oh.

284
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,617
Before her illness gets worse,
I want to take her out for some fresh air.

285
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,162
I see.

286
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,500
Won't that be too much for her?

287
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,129
Her doctor said she can go out
for an hour or two.

288
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,673
She hasn't gone out in ages.
She should dress up.

289
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,552
You should pick one, too.
I know you have good taste.

290
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,474
You bought it for her, so you should
give it to your mother yourself.

291
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,018
It's fine. You should…

292
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
Pardon?

293
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,110
Why are you so surprised?
You give it to your mother.

294
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,080
Did your father tell you?

295
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,457
No.

296
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,210
He never told me privileged information
about his clients.

297
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,295
Then how did you find out?

298
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,050
You paid for her medical bills.

299
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,262
You got back at Shinkwang Bank for her
even if you hated acting.

300
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,973
You said the same thing about
bungeoppang and ingeoppang.

301
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,726
Isn't it obvious that you are her son?

302
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:59,195
I really hate getting involved
in other people's family matters.

303
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,157
But let me be nosy just this once.

304
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,578
Why don't you tell her now?

305
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,330
That you know you're her son.

306
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,418
She doesn't have much time left.

307
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,797
So every single day she has left counts.

308
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,552
Remember what you told me?

309
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,347
"Regret is the most
painful thing in life."

310
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,851
Turns out it is true.

311
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,773
I hope you won't have to go through
such a painful thing.

312
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,670
This looks so refined.

313
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,090
I don't know if I deserve this.

314
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,887
Thank you, Mr. Cassano.

315
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,306
It's nothing.

316
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,268
It took him an hour
to pick this bag for you.

317
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,312
What?

318
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,065
Gosh. You didn't have to do that.

319
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,194
By the way,

320
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,656
I don't think I should go out.

321
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,826
I'm not well.

322
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,120
I'll only inconvenience you two.

323
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,081
Well, I'm not coming that day.

324
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,208
He will take you out.

325
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,876
Right?

326
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,966
Yes.

327
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,096
I know you're busy. I feel awful.

328
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,684
No. Think about all the places
you would like to visit.

329
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,811
Okay.

330
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,190
We should let her rest. Let's go.

331
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,904
Ms. Hong.

332
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,908
I have something to tell you.

333
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,372
I would like to…

334
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,002
file for a retrial.

335
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,381
Really?

336
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,717
Yes.

337
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,180
Why the sudden change of heart?

338
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,267
Actually…

339
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,772
there wasn't a day
I didn't want to file for a retrial.

340
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,775
I thought of doing it every day.

341
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,946
But…

342
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,657
I was hesitant.

343
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,161
I didn't have enough courage.

344
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,039
But…

345
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,627
now that I'm nearing my death,

346
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,630
I finally have the courage to do it.

347
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,427
Can you help me with this?

348
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,431
Do you think you can do it for me?

349
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,521
What do you think, Mr. Cassano?

350
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,149
I'll follow your decision.

351
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,123
Okay.

352
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,252
Let's do it.

353
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,716
I'll get started right away.

354
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,052
Thank you.

355
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,639
Thank you so much.

356
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,950
Since your father passed away,

357
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,786
you've never come to see me, you brat.

358
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,998
I'm sorry. It's been hectic.

359
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,128
Why are things so crazy over at Babel?

360
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,589
Daechang has been working our butt off
to cover for you.

361
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,258
I'll return the favor.

362
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,303
-Han-seo already told you, right?
-Yes.

363
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,390
You want an editorial about
Babel Chemicals' battery production.

364
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,685
But Han-seok,

365
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,230
even elementary school kids
invest in stocks nowadays.

366
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,190
This is a sensitive and risky move.

367
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,736
But you did it for my dad.

368
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,030
Just do what you did for him.

369
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,872
Why does a beautiful woman like you

370
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,208
need to flee the country this urgently?

371
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,711
I have made…

372
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,965
a terrible mistake.

373
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,427
I can't make up for it even with my life.

374
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,056
That's awful.

375
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,683
Don't worry too much.

376
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,727
Actually, we have a spot,

377
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,104
so you can leave later today.

378
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,358
You're certain that
it's a direct flight to Taiwan, right?

379
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:33,863
Of course. The wind is strong today.
You could go to Cebu if you wanted.

380
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,824
Is it possible to end up
flying past the destination?

381
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,037
It is quite random, to tell you the truth.

382
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,288
If you don't want to…

383
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,082
-Hey--
-I'll take it!

384
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,251
Yes, that's the contract.
Read it carefully.

385
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
BYEBYE BALLOON
TRAVEL CONTRACT

386
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,550
We have a client here.
What is it this time?

387
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,762
I just got a stock investment tip.

388
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,889
Daechang is preparing
to publish an article

389
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,474
to promote Babel Chemicals.

390
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,477
It's about EVs and batteries.

391
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,689
-Excuse me. Read the contract.
-Okay.

392
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,400
I should buy Babel Chemicals' stocks.

393
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,451
These Babel assholes won't die.

394
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,079
They are getting richer instead.

395
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,747
How? Why is that?

396
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,793
Everyone, do you want some coffee?

397
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,962
I'm not in the mood to drink coffee now.

398
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,214
I'm not in the mood to make coffee now.

399
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,799
Okay.

400
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,226
Gosh. That traitor, Jung.

401
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,396
Babel will get more powerful
because of that bastard.

402
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,692
You met him last night. Why didn't you
make him pay for what he did?

403
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,652
He will do that in installments.

404
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,823
Do you think it's possible

405
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,117
he's just pretending to have switch sides?

406
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,702
Maybe he wants to expose

407
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,871
-all the secrets from within--
-Mr. Nam.

408
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,250
That's never happened
in the history of this country.

409
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,253
We don't need Prosecutor Jung.

410
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,089
What's that?

411
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,134
This?

412
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,345
The Guillotine file.

413
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,222
The Guillotine file.

414
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,643
You said you accidentally threw it
in the secret room and closed the door.

415
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,020
Who said that? Me?

416
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,689
-Yes.
-Did I say that?

417
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,636
My goodness. Vincenzo Cassano.

418
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,554
Let's reveal what's in the file.

419
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,933
Once it goes online,
it'll go international in an hour.

420
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,768
-That's not a good idea.
-Why not?

421
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,937
It'll last a few days. But…

422
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,982
no one that's in this file
will pay for what they did.

423
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,861
This file wasn't created
to expose the truth to the world

424
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,573
but for evil men to exploit the weakness
of other evil men.

425
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,660
Only an evil man can use it properly.

426
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,662
And we can use it just like they would.

427
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,373
We'll keep them on a leash
and order them around.

428
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,458
I see.

429
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,835
How frightening.

430
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,049
Did you read the file?

431
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,592
No. Not yet.

432
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,719
I wanted us to read it together.

433
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,429
Mr. Nam.

434
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,807
-The laptop!
-Right, the laptop!

435
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,906
Gosh. Something doesn't feel right.

436
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:09,495
I'm sure Prosecutor Jung and Mr. Jang
made a deal over something.

437
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,125
You know, the file.
The file they got from the gallery.

438
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,794
Do you think that's all?

439
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,629
That should be more than enough.

440
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,756
He has my brother

441
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,218
on tax evasion, illegally acquired stocks,
and everything on that file.

442
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,928
No. I get the feeling

443
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,681
that there's more.

444
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,475
What else? What else could there…

445
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,354
Is there really more?

446
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,777
-I don't know that.
-Me neither.

447
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,699
Anyway, Jung is
on your brother's side now.

448
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,827
And the deal with Daechang Daily
went smoothly.

449
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,749
Now your brother is going
to become powerful beyond control.

450
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,008
PROSECUTION

451
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,473
Gosh. The tabloids are nothing
compared to this.

452
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,849
It is unbelievable.

453
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,519
To get this kind of information,
they must've surveilled them illegally.

454
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,564
This time, we'll be targeting Babel

455
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,983
-and Daechang Daily.
-Daechang Daily.

456
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,778
I've been waiting
to crush this trashy agency.

457
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,489
Back in the day, newspapers could be
used as toilet paper.

458
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,908
But now, there's no use for them.

459
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,953
I mean, this so-called newspaper
makes ridiculous claims all year round.

460
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,663
They're absurd and make no sense.

461
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,084
If they keep doing it,
it is their attitude. It'll never change.

462
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,796
If Daechang Daily is gone,
it will cleanse our eyes and ears.

463
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,633
First, I'm planning to make them
fight and destroy each other.

464
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,303
Each other? How will you
make them go after each other?

465
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,639
Don't forget.

466
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,935
We have this Guillotine file.

467
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,854
Right, we'll pit one evil against another.

468
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,817
All right. Look over here.

469
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,255
Well, your office is…

470
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,134
It looks lame and awkward. It's nice.

471
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,637
Why are you here?

472
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,681
What? I can come if I want to.

473
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,859
It's nothing much. It's just
the most expensive coffee, Kopi Luwak.

474
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,318
I'm sure you know what it is.

475
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,363
It's a rare product
made from civets' poop.

476
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,656
What a load of crap.

477
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,785
Who is that guy?

478
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,248
I'm not sure if Vincenzo is just lucky

479
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,792
or he's really competent.
But he's impressive.

480
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,670
The Guillotine file and 15 tons of gold.

481
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,131
No one will even think that it's there.

482
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,799
If we can get the file,

483
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,553
all the powerful people in Korea
will kneel

484
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,055
before you.

485
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,604
It sounds like the One Ring
from The Lord of the Rings.

486
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,898
You watched it, so you must know.

487
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,443
If it falls into the wrong hands,
it'll cause problems.

488
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,570
Only people like us

489
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,073
will do justice to the Ring.

490
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,626
Let's demolish Geumga Plaza
as fast as we can.

491
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,253
That way, we can get the file out.

492
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,966
I'll give you some of the gold
in the secret room.

493
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,927
Sure.

494
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,054
I'll gladly accept it.

495
00:41:59,058 --> 00:41:59,892
Thank you.

496
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,436
Thank you.

497
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,482
Hey, wait.

498
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,277
Why didn't you make the coffee
that I brought?

499
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,321
We don't have a coffee maker.

500
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,117
Gosh. Your working conditions here
are awful.

501
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,872
Damn it. It's so bitter. Hey, dude.
Why is this so bitter?

502
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,301
I heard that you asked Mr. Cassano
to get rid of your own brother.

503
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,762
It would have all worked out
if he did what I asked.

504
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,682
Things have gotten worse
because you declined.

505
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,225
Didn't I tell you?

506
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,561
I never exploit betrayals within a family.

507
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,856
I forgot to tell you this
because I was flustered.

508
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,361
I'm not trying to betray my own brother.

509
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,697
What I want…

510
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,366
How should I put it?
I don't want people to die anymore.

511
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,036
-Right.
-I'm trying to run Babel legally.

512
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,457
I guess you've been studying a lot.
Your vocabulary has gotten better.

513
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,586
Let me get this straight. You want to run

514
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,672
the company properly
after getting rid of your brother?

515
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,132
-That's it.
-Okay.

516
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,760
I really love Babel.

517
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,096
I want to run the company the right way.

518
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,099
I really don't want people to get killed.
I mean that.

519
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,935
Why don't you fix it then?
Why are you asking us for help?

520
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,687
That's because…

521
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:34,445
no matter how much I think about it,
you are the only people who can beat him.

522
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,031
I like your intention.

523
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,075
But do you deserve the seat?

524
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,954
I've been studying how to run a company.
I'm reading a lot of books.

525
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,541
Humanities and economy. I read everything.
I want to read all the time.

526
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,378
Then here's a quiz.

527
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,255
A quiz all of a sudden?

528
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,305
Fine. Go ahead. Give me a question.

529
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,223
In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith says

530
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,768
this hand brings order
to a market economy? What is it?

531
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,020
-Polite hand.
-Wrong.

532
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,897
"The invisible hand."

533
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,441
As the economy grows,

534
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,903
government expenditures
in gross national product also increase.

535
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,071
Name this law.

536
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,073
-Law of the Jungle.
-Wrong.

537
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,324
"Wagner's law."

538
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,242
This is the easiest one.

539
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,203
To improve the company's competitiveness,

540
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,372
you learn something from another company.

541
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,458
What is this term
that originated from an iron rod?

542
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,293
Here's a hint. Bench…

543
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,838
Wrong.

544
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,174
-Get out.
-Wait.

545
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,592
Hold on.

546
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,885
Didn't I get one right?

547
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,638
How could you get everything wrong?

548
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,059
The polite hand was correct. No?

549
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,311
If you want our help, go study more.

550
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,523
If you want to join us, you must be smart.

551
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,942
Is this a symposium or what? Why?

552
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,943
Feel free to say no.

553
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,820
Get out.

554
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,905
This is ridiculous.

555
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,073
What…

556
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,533
Wait. Hold on.

557
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,536
If I pass your quiz
the next time I come here,

558
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,704
you'll really have to help me.

559
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,790
Get out.

560
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,379
Seriously. You're so petty.
Fine. I'll leave.

561
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,508
What will you quiz me on?

562
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,843
Out. Mr. Nam.

563
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,596
Did you know about the polite hand?

564
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,891
Here are my polite hands.

565
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,156
Will you really help Jang Han-seo?

566
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,253
You know,
I was trying to take Vincenzo's life.

567
00:45:56,336 --> 00:46:00,716
But it turns out Vincenzo has been taking
what I cherish.

568
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,018
And that thing in the gallery.

569
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,569
What should I take from him

570
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,363
to make him suffer?

571
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,701
I must steal what's important to him.

572
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,079
Once he's dead, it's over.

573
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,498
So it's not his life.

574
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,667
If I were to go down that route…

575
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,464
Should I look into his family?

576
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,758
"Family"?

577
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,511
Is that important?

578
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,430
To regular people,

579
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,891
family is important.

580
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,143
I see.

581
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,355
Okay. I guess only I didn't know.

582
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,110
Then I'll go with that.

583
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,993
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

584
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,001
Why do you look so exhausted?

585
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,378
It's so fun.

586
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,588
I haven't eaten or taken a dump

587
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,590
to read the file nonstop.

588
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,552
I'll go read some more after our briefing.

589
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:30,347
You should still go to the bathroom.
If you don't, toxins will build up.

590
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:38,313
I looked into some major problems
of Daechang Daily's owner, Oh Jeong-bae.

591
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,984
He's such a bastard.

592
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,402
What's the worst he did?

593
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,070
He murdered his older brother.

594
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,115
Daechang is just as awful.

595
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,034
How come they all hate their siblings?

596
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,494
Why did he kill his brother?

597
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,121
They fought over the company.

598
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,207
But he was acquitted of the charge.

599
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:04,298
He went hiking with his older brother
and killed him by pushing him off a cliff.

600
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,934
I bet there were no witnesses.
Is there any evidence that it was murder?

601
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,397
The environmental monitoring camera
caught him in the act.

602
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,650
But the International Security
Intelligence Service

603
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,486
obtained the footage, not the cops.

604
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,988
The agency must have

605
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,491
used the footage
to cut a deal with Mr. Oh.

606
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,826
That's correct.

607
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:36,955
He's a total asshole.
How could he kill his own brother?

608
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,290
You heard everything.

609
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,171
I can hear better when people whisper.

610
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,550
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.

611
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,226
Mr. Nam, did you find anything else?

612
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,355
There's a shaman
he trusts and follows blindly.

613
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:11,573
There's a child who has matured over
ten months and is about to make his mark.

614
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,993
When he makes decisions, big or small,
he does as the shaman says.

615
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,913
-Let me see.
-For both his family and company.

616
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,791
But the shaman's a former cult leader
who has been convicted

617
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,085
four times
for fraud and sexual harassment.

618
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,796
And of course, Mr. Oh has no idea.

619
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,006
Gosh. This is crazy.

620
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,133
He takes advice from a fraud like that?

621
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,678
You know how people are.

622
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:36,473
The less you know about something,
the easier you believe it.

623
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,975
I should check if he's really

624
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,561
a fraud or gifted.

625
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,190
I'll go and finish reading it.

626
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,655
Gosh.

627
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,031
Don't move.

628
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,205
I'm telling you, Daechang Daily
burns the best.

629
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:04,167
When newspapers are full of lies,
you should use them to start a fire.

630
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,546
-Hey, who are you guys?
-Who do you think?

631
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,799
We brought you in,
so you could read our fortune.

632
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,717
What?

633
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,225
Hey, who are you?

634
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,436
I wonder

635
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,856
if you know that you'll burn
to death five minutes later.

636
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,942
He must know. He's a gifted shaman.

637
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,862
Does he also know he'll take a fall
after burning to death?

638
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,321
Of course. He's gifted.

639
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,991
Spare me.

640
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,827
But his fate can be changed, right?

641
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,579
As long as he does what I tell him.

642
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,664
Why are you doing this to me, sirs?

643
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,459
By the way, do his customers know?

644
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,170
That he's a former cult leader
who was arrested four times

645
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,046
for fraud and sexual harassment?

646
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,006
I'm not sure.

647
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,883
They don't know that yet, sir.

648
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,050
Then…

649
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,803
shall we start talking now?

650
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,893
-Should I pour it?
-Yes?

651
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,603
-Gosh.
-Let's pay a silent tribute.

652
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,604
-Shall we?
-Okay.

653
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,980
This is for the deceased.

654
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:09,900
No, don't do that.

655
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,318
-Why…
-It's over. Let's do it.

656
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,986
-Can you lift your legs?
-No.

657
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,488
-The head first.
-The head?

658
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,822
-This is lamp oil.
-Wait.

659
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,032
I'll talk.

660
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,366
-No.
-Light it.

661
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,285
-Let's talk.
-Daechang Daily.

662
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,787
Let's use that newspaper.

663
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,913
Here we go.

664
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,207
-It's burning. No!
-Gosh.

665
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,374
All right.

666
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,503
To screw over Babel and Daechang Daily,

667
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,923
we will hold a vote to pick a person
who will act as a shaman.

668
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,644
Please vote for the person
that suits the role of a shaman the best.

669
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,161
Put it in there.

670
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,250
All right.

671
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,960
We all have voted for the person

672
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,212
who will act as the shaman.

673
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,549
Now, I will count the votes.

674
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,053
VINCENZO

675
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,513
"Vincenzo."

676
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,473
Me?

677
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,268
This isn't a joke.

678
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,688
-Mr. Nam.
-You saw it?

679
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,398
"Mr. Cassano."

680
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,068
"Vincenzo Casanova,
Corn Salad. I love you."

681
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,237
What…

682
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,155
Is this funny?

683
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,324
"Vincenzo."

684
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,076
-"Vitamin-cenzo."
-Why did you…

685
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,828
-"Mr. Vin."
-What are you guys doing?

686
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,496
"Mr. Vin, Vincenzo."

687
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,831
-"Vincenzo."
-Everyone.

688
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,082
"Mr. Cassano."

689
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,128
"Vincenzo. Vincenzo Quassano."

690
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,046
"Quassano"?

691
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,549
This is probably Vincenzo.
Yes, "Mr. Cassano."

692
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,384
All right.

693
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,723
This is the last vote.

694
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,975
Do we need to check the last vote?

695
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,185
Vincen… "Hong Cha-young."

696
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,898
Why me?

697
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,651
-It was you, wasn't it?
-All right.

698
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:21,531
Mr. Cassano has been voted
for the role of the shaman.

699
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:29,414
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

700
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:33,168
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

701
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,046
HOW BABEL CHEMICALS BECAME
THE LEADER IN THE EV MARKET

702
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:49,559
CEO OH JEONG-BAE

703
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,355
Hello, sir.

704
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:57,192
I need to speak to you
about an urgent matter.

705
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,199
Pardon? What are you talking about?

706
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,201
Sir.

707
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,121
I can no longer communicate
with any spirits.

708
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,707
The mountains deity has left me.

709
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,627
No.

710
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,337
I need you.

711
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,964
You must pull through.

712
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,469
Sir, please.

713
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,097
Mr. Oh, listen carefully.

714
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,139
Okay.

715
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,599
I'm useless now.

716
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,645
But I know a really powerful shaman.

717
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,857
No, he's much better than me
at communicating with the spirits.

718
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,318
No. You must go see him instead.

719
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,445
That's the only way we'll survive.

720
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,784
-I'm number five.
-I'm number six.

721
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,077
-I'm number seven.
-Why?

722
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,995
Gosh.

723
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,789
-It'll take five minutes per person.
-Right.

724
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,624
-I heard he's really good.
-Really?

725
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,501
-Yes.
-I should've gotten more time.

726
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,879
-I can't wait to find out.
-Right. I've been waiting for an hour.

727
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,631
-What's your number?
-Number four.

728
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,841
-I'm number six.
-Okay.

729
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,092
PARK HYO SHRINE

730
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:05,343
I heard he's really good.

731
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,765
-Hey.
-You can't cut in line.

732
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,975
You just got here.

733
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,143
-We're in line here.
-Right.

734
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,561
-Go grab a ticket.
-Yes.

735
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,855
We've been waiting here
before you got here.

736
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,024
-See?
-Right.

737
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,316
-Look.
-Look.

738
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,447
But I made a reservation.

739
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,284
-Is that so?
-I see.

740
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,828
I didn't know about that. Then, go inside.

741
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,164
-I'm jealous.
-Gosh.

742
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,041
-Good for you.
-Awesome.

743
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,463
-Good for you.
-I'm so jealous.

744
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,714
Good luck.

745
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,514
How may I help you?

746
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,558
Well…

747
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,437
shaman Biryu recommended me
to see the shaman here.

748
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,980
-I'm Daechang's--
-"Daechang."

749
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,692
Welcome.
Young Master Yeorim is waiting for you.

750
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,444
I see.

751
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,949
OH, INZAGHI

752
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,998
You have an interesting name

753
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,000
for your shrine.

754
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,129
We named it after Park Hyo,
the Chief State Councilor of Joseon.

755
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,715
He was enlightened
after going into the mountains

756
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,926
and became a mountain deity.

757
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,846
That is why the deity we worship is

758
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,807
known as "Park Hyo Shin."
"Shin" meaning god.

759
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:24,107
I see. Okay.

760
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,819
Following the long shadow

761
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,123
Well…

762
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,710
I'm here because I want some answers
to my questions.

763
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,672
But I'm not sure if I should ask them.

764
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,634
Should I ask them?

765
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,845
Or not?

766
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,680
Get out.

767
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,558
I have nothing to say to a dead man.

768
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,185
Look.

769
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,650
I won't have to send condolence money
since we just met.

770
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,153
Who do you think I am?

771
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,948
You con artists.

772
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,200
Jeong-bae.

773
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,245
What?

774
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,080
"Jeong-bae"?

775
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,917
How dare you call me by my first name?

776
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,254
-I'm your brother, Jeong-bae.
-What?

777
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,217
I'm so cold.

778
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,478
I'm cold.

779
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,608
My hands are freezing.

780
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,276
I'm so cold.

781
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,409
How could you push me off
the cliff and leave me?

782
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,453
I'm still here.

783
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,461
How…

784
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,549
-How could my brother…
-I'm cold.

785
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,470
Jeong-bae, help me up already.

786
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,682
It's freezing down here. Okay?

787
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,685
-I'm so cold, Jeong-bae.
-Go away.

788
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,187
-Get away from me.
-Jeong-bae.

789
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,982
-Get off me.
-Jeong-bae.

790
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,735
Jeong-bae.

791
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,028
-Let go.
-Jeong-bae.

792
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,322
-No!
-Jeong-bae.

793
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,949
-Go away.
-I'm cold, Jeong-bae.

794
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,202
Jeong-bae, I'm so cold.

795
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,037
Get away from me!

796
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,081
Jeong-bae, I'm so cold.

797
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,129
Why are there

798
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,633
so many burdens in my life?

799
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:00,847
It's not that you have many burdens.
You are just weak.

800
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,475
The weaker you are,

801
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,104
the heavier your burdens become.

802
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,481
I see.

803
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:15,069
Do you want to see
what will kill you eventually?

804
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,823
Yes. I do.

805
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,613
BABEL

806
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:12,377
Unless you cut ties with Babel,
you will die a miserable death.

807
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,924
Is that all I need to do?

808
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,806
It's more than cutting ties with them.

809
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,811
You must cut ties with them
as you completely trample on them.

810
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,104
What?

811
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,730
To get rid of bad luck altogether.

812
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,775
That's…

813
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,112
It's not that easy.

814
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,463
I see.

815
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,844
That's the number of days you have left.

816
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,096
Five days.

817
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,190
Poor thing.

818
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:28,953
You know what?

819
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:33,332
I went too hard earlier.
My arms are hurting. They hurt so much.

820
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,504
Isn't it ironic?

821
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,258
A newspaper company is supposed to
publish facts, but he's so superstitious.

822
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,096
He's superstitious
because he has no interest in facts.

823
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,518
You startled me.

824
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,519
Oh, right.

825
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:57,857
I forgot to tell you
because we were so busy today.

826
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,277
I found something shocking about
Jang Han-seok in the Guillotine file.

827
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,821
-What is it?
-Chairman Jang

828
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,241
killed four of his classmates
in middle and high school.

829
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,581
He brought classmates he didn't like
to a rooftop and made them jump.

830
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:16,793
Or he hunted and killed them
in the mountains like they were prey.

831
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:22,799
He killed the last one because he stole
a ball from him during a gym class.

832
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:26,552
Jang used the goal net to strangle him.

833
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,431
Here's what's scarier.

834
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,532
JANG HAN-SEOK

835
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,394
He took the deceased's watches

836
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,980
as some kind of a trophy.

837
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:23,609
And he even bragged about it
like he was proud of it.

838
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,946
He's a psychopath.

839
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,949
He was diagnosed as a psychopath
at the age of 16.

840
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,411
That's why his father sent him
to the States

841
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,872
fearing that he might become
a serial killer.

842
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,958
Jang Han-seo was beaten
and tortured by him,

843
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,295
so he's been seeing a therapist
ever since he was little.

844
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,839
And that's how he ended up doing drugs.

845
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,174
Even so, he shouldn't be doing drugs.

846
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,759
That jerk.

847
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,595
Anyway, their father, Jang Guk-hwan,

848
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,180
covered everything up with money

849
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,974
and kept it a secret.

850
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,355
That explains why he was so hard to beat.

851
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,275
Turns out he's

852
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,111
the biggest monster of them all.

853
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,456
BABEL SUSPECTED TO HAVE MADE
FALSE STATEMENTS TO RAISE STOCK VALUE

854
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,267
DAECHANG DAILY

855
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:41,562
Hello?

856
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,022
What are you doing?

857
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,067
-What the hell is this?
-Mr. Jang.

858
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:51,072
There has been a change
in the guidelines at my company.

859
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,033
Did I do something to offend you?

860
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,035
No, you didn't.

861
01:05:56,118 --> 01:06:00,706
Now Daechang Daily is an honest newspaper
that only speaks the truth.

862
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,749
The truth?

863
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,753
You're the most corrupt newspaper company
in Korea. But what? The truth?

864
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,588
Watch what you say.

865
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,799
So, why didn't you
run your company properly?

866
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,467
I'm hanging up.

867
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,219
Mr. Oh? Mr. Oh!

868
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:14,679
Hey!

869
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:33,572
How come my days are still numbered?

870
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,826
I just cut all ties with Babel.

871
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,620
That won't be enough to save your life.

872
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:40,913
Pardon?

873
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:46,419
Then what more do I need to do?

874
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,589
The owner of Babel.

875
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,716
The king of Babel.

876
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,347
Are you talking about

877
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,058
Chairman Jang Han-seok?

878
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,687
He's the one
who's holding onto your misfortune.

879
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,275
If you expose his past evils,

880
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,737
and relieve the spirits that wander
the realm of the living because of him,

881
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:16,490
those spirits will help you.

882
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,209
The wandering spirits?

883
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,886
Are you saying Han-seok killed someone?

884
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,369
Han-seok.

885
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,581
I'm sorry.

886
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,374
Don't hit me.

887
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:11,045
Han-seok. I'm sorry.

888
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,296
It's all my fault.

889
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:13,964
-I'm not Han-seok.
-I'm sorry.

890
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,508
-I'm not him.
-Don't strangle me.

891
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,551
-I can't breathe.
-Jang Han-seok.

892
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,677
Don't strangle me.

893
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,513
-Jang Han-seok. Spare me.
-No.

894
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,181
-It's my fault.
-Don't do it.

895
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,391
No. I'm not Han-seok!

896
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,726
That's my watch.

897
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,395
That's my watch. It's mine.

898
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,940
-It's my watch.
-No.

899
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:37,154
The chairman of Babel,
one of the biggest companies in Korea,

900
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,614
was a bully?

901
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,117
No. It was more of a massacre.

902
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,787
This has come
as shocking news to the public.

903
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,998
On top of that,
he was never punished for his crimes,

904
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,752
and was able to climb the ladder
to become the chairman.

905
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,922
I mean, seriously?
Where were the police and prosecutors

906
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,924
in all of this?

907
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,385
Right now, a lot of people

908
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,471
are urging this killer chairman
to be punished

909
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,432
on many of the online forums
and petitioning for it as well.

910
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,309
Gosh.

911
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:10,354
How did they know?

912
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:14,567
Even Mr. Oh wouldn't
know about my childhood.

913
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,194
…update you with a follow-up coverage.

914
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,821
Right now, Babel Group

915
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,739
-has dismissed the claims
-Hey.

916
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,408
-It wasn't you, right?
-as being false.

917
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,703
-They will soon release
-What? Of course, it wasn't me.

918
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:29,331
The article even said I was crazy
and did drugs. You think I did that?

919
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,418
Well, you're right.

920
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,675
It was reported that there hadn't been
an investigation on this in the past.

921
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,679
Who else knows about this?

922
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,976
My dad, the detective who worked the case,

923
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,978
and the prosecutor in charge.

924
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,401
Then there's a source we're not aware of.

925
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:01,822
The problem is the intention.
Why is Mr. Oh attacking you now?

926
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:04,825
It looks like
he's trying to bring me down.

927
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:25,304
LIFE

928
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,818
It's all done.

929
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,029
You have been spared.

930
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,288
Fate has a weakness for brave souls,

931
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,124
but it can be a powerful foe
to those who are weak.

932
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,837
You have been brave
and averted this crisis.

933
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,621
Thank you.

934
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,250
Thank you.

935
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,898
It's been a while, Mr. Cho.

936
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,483
Can we meet now?

937
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,861
I'll meet you at the parking lot
of the plaza.

938
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,989
Okay. Sure.

939
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,907
Okay.

940
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,744
Run!

941
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,253
Who are they?

942
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,840
I think Prosecutor Jung sent them.

943
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,717
Prosecutor Jung?

944
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,348
It's as expected.

945
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,684
It was Vincenzo.

946
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,937
He exploited Mr. Oh's tendency
to have blind faith in shamans.

947
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,314
He's so detailed.

948
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,360
I really can't beat a Mafia member.

949
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,488
Anyway…

950
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:15,242
how did he find out
what happened when I was young?

951
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,245
That's still a mystery to me.

952
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:21,999
But it's most likely that he got it
from the intelligence agency.

953
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,795
How on earth did he find out?

954
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,465
Given the current circumstances,

955
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,676
he's pitted Babel and Daechang
against each other.

956
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:36,513
Even so. Mr. Oh of all people
can't do that to me.

957
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,974
What should we do?

958
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,982
Make Vincenzo end it himself.

959
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:49,610
Oh, right. I must show you something.

960
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,156
What is it?

961
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,160
Vincenzo's Korean name is Park Ju-hyeong.

962
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,371
He was adopted after being abandoned
by his mother when he was little.

963
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:02,706
OH GYEONG-JA, PERSONAL DETAILS

964
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:03,999
Is his mom alive?

965
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:07,002
She is. But she recently got out of prison

966
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:09,421
-because of pancreatic cancer.
-What was she in for?

967
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,924
She was the housekeeper
who was involved in the death

968
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,468
of Shinkwang Finance's Chairman Hwang.

969
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,095
NAMDONGBU DISTRICT COURT
RULING

970
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,055
Wait.

971
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:21,433
He ruined the signing ceremony
a while ago.

972
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,563
Is this why he did that?

973
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,689
Yes.

974
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,902
Hong Yu-chan was the public defender
who took her case.

975
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:36,532
And today, she filed for a retrial
regarding the death of Hwang Deok-bae.

976
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,783
A retrial?

977
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,912
-Who filed it?
-Cha-young did.

978
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,373
Of course, Vincenzo must be behind it.

979
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,382
That means Vincenzo
has been spending time with his mother.

980
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:58,262
I'm trying to find out which hospital
his mother is being treated in.

981
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,564
I met Jung at the International Security
Intelligence Service five years ago.

982
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,568
He was dispatched for a case,
and I had a desk job there.

983
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,821
We found out the true nature
of the Guillotine file,

984
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,239
and Jung thought he could

985
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,367
root out all corruption in Korea
with the file.

986
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,245
So he desperately tried
to get his hands on it,

987
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,372
and I joined hands with him.

988
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,750
That was before he went dirty.

989
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:29,793
Yes.

990
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,130
But soon,
the file was hacked and vanished,

991
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,507
and I volunteered to look for the file.

992
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,510
That's how I got here.

993
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,639
But Jung has betrayed you, right?

994
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:47,436
Yes. In fact, I suspected him
these past few months.

995
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,440
I felt he had an ulterior motive
for looking for the file.

996
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:57,529
Now that he is on Jang Han-seok's side,
he must know by now

997
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,783
that the file and the gold are here.

998
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:06,121
And he must know he has to demolish
the plaza to retrieve them.

999
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,714
GEUMGA PLAZA

1000
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:50,123
PETITION FOR A RETRIAL

1001
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:55,772
Damn it.

1002
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,367
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

1003
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:33,328
You're under arrest
for the murder of Oh Jeong-bae.

1004
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,031
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE HYE-JUNG
AND IM SUNG-JAE

1005
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,145
It was a setup, wasn't it?

1006
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:43,231
Then we'll have to use
the most effective method.

1007
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,524
I'll make sure no one ever gets it.

1008
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,359
I have to find the person who lured me.

1009
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,154
I'll make sure everyone who tried to
build it will be punished.

1010
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,991
He could stir up the entire nation.

1011
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,120
To cherish Geumga Plaza
as a historical building.

1012
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,873
Make him pay.

1013
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:02,584
It's time for you to die.

1014
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:06,588
You will die a slow death,
experiencing it every step of the way.

1015
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:13,345
