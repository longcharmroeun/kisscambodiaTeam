1
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,237
Today…

2
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,991
We finally made it.

3
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:35,246
I still can't believe
that this is all gold.

4
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:53,640
There are cultural assets as well.

5
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,260
Thank you for everything, Mr. Cassano.

6
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,347
What a bitter price for a friendship.

7
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:36,808
If you don't move until I get out,

8
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:39,894
I won't harm you.

9
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:42,897
Why are you doing this?

10
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,566
I cannot tell you.

11
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,444
I just need to take one gold bar with me.

12
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,802
You're doing this for just one gold bar?

13
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,222
Step back.

14
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:21,978
When I'm completely out of here,

15
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,772
you can come up then.

16
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:37,452
And you're not going
to close the door on me?

17
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,079
I told you I will not harm you.

18
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:45,126
Can I take one as a souvenir?

19
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:25,124
I didn't know gold is this heavy.

20
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:27,961
Don't move until I get out.

21
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,088
If you follow me, I'll shoot you.

22
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,214
Okay.

23
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:33,967
By the way,

24
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,386
why are you taking only one?

25
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,012
This is enough for me.

26
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,933
It must be heavy.

27
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:45,645
Why didn't you just take
the Guillotine file?

28
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,566
How did you know that?

29
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:57,490
I know you've been helping me
all this time because of it.

30
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,868
-Don't come any closer.
-Anyway…

31
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:04,289
do you really think the file is in there?

32
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,167
Do you?

33
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,017
All right.

34
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,643
The best floors at Babel Tower.

35
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:11,147
I'll start with
the 120th and 121st floors.

36
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,525
Not one but two floors will
belong to one person.

37
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:18,237
Go ahead and move me.

38
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:20,698
I'd like to try.

39
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,868
-Go ahead.
-As you all know,

40
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:28,081
many lawsuits are about to be filed
against Babel.

41
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,417
And I must take care of them all.

42
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:32,835
Why?

43
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:36,839
To ensure the power of Babel
remains undiminished!

44
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,972
I'll make sure Babel E&amp;C wins the contract

45
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:47,683
to build new cities in Taesan and Jungsan.

46
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,770
I can get both political parties
and the Ministry of Land on board.

47
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,774
I'm getting excited.

48
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:57,443
Okay.

49
00:05:58,027 --> 00:05:59,612
As you are already aware,

50
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:03,282
Daechang Daily are the leaders
of public opinion in Korea.

51
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:06,702
I'll make sure Babel is never criticized
by the press again.

52
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:11,124
I'll give you more than
just Babel Tower.

53
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,626
I'll sponsor Daechang Daily
for some ads too.

54
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:19,132
What is it?

55
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:24,679
Who are you?

56
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:27,765
I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,934
I had an urgent meeting.

58
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:33,479
I'm Director Tae Jong-gu of
the International Organized Crime Bureau

59
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,648
at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

60
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,780
Welcome.

61
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:50,246
EPISODE 13

62
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,717
You should have loaded the gun
with at least one bullet.

63
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:13,060
I'll assume that
you still consider me your friend

64
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:15,438
and ask you this as your friend.

65
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:18,608
Who do you really work for?

66
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:24,030
I'm an agent at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

67
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,032
I see.

68
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:32,914
So you pretended to resign
to find the Guillotine file.

69
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:38,544
You pretended to be a corporate spy
and approached Mr. Wang, too. Right?

70
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,046
Yes.

71
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,593
What about me?

72
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:51,265
Meeting you was truly a coincidence.

73
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,435
When I almost died in Italy,

74
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,854
you saved me.

75
00:07:58,856 --> 00:07:59,815
Right.

76
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:05,571
Mr. Wang's death wasn't natural, was it?

77
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:26,717
Thank you.

78
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,222
You bastard…

79
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:33,182
I've underestimated you.

80
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,108
Hurry!

81
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:44,068
Call an ambulance. Now!

82
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,368
I guess I was wrong about you.

83
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,954
You really are quite scary.

84
00:08:56,914 --> 00:09:00,167
Right. I'm not really a good guy.

85
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,548
I knew from the start
that you were lying to me.

86
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:07,466
You said that Wang's museum

87
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,844
in Hangzhou had data on his iris.

88
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:13,639
But it turned out
that no such thing existed.

89
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:20,271
You went to your office in China
a while ago.

90
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,732
Why didn't you take it out then?

91
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,569
That was before I obtained
the data on Wang's iris.

92
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:30,114
I was still planning the operation then.

93
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:32,408
Then you shouldn't have rented it out.

94
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,826
Why did you let the monks move in?

95
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:36,329
I thought leaving it empty
would be riskier.

96
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:39,165
There could be someone
who knew about this place.

97
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,713
Did anyone see Mr. Vincenzo

98
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,716
and the previous building owner meeting
before we left?

99
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,302
-I saw them.
-Me too.

100
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,679
They came together from over there.

101
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,309
Is it just me or is anyone else wondering

102
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,978
why the two of them met
after sending us away?

103
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:04,815
I heard they had a meeting today.

104
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,361
I really don't want to accuse anyone,

105
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,071
but it really is rather suspicious.

106
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,948
Are you saying that they sent us away
to look for the gold?

107
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:21,123
Gosh, don't be like that.
I was just throwing it out there.

108
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,084
Let's not start suspecting each other.

109
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,336
We trust Mr. Vincenzo, don't we?

110
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:29,757
Maybe they're looking for the gold
so that Babel can't get to it first.

111
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,093
You're being quite unreasonable.

112
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,303
Right. Let's just enjoy the trip.

113
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,139
How about a singing contest
to lighten the mood?

114
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,516
-It's good, isn't it?
-Right.

115
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,809
One, two

116
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,311
-one, two, three
-But then again,

117
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:45,106
twenty million won for a photo
does sound pretty suspicious.

118
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,152
What is it now?

119
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,948
I can't say anything, can I?

120
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:57,493
The Guillotine file…

121
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,497
You weren't going to hand it over
to your agency, right?

122
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,374
You haven't even reported it in yet.

123
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,839
If you did, they would've forcibly opened
the basement and taken it.

124
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,383
Why didn't you report it?

125
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:14,802
To make another deal?

126
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,097
Well, I get it.

127
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:20,766
That will be more profitable, right?

128
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,354
Who were you going to sell it to?

129
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,191
I haven't decided yet.

130
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,402
But how did you know about this file?

131
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:37,324
You're not the only informant I have.

132
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,960
Where to first?

133
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:51,255
-I'm going first!
-Come on.

134
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:53,340
Goodness. Don't run!

135
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:55,759
Hey!

136
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:57,845
I told you not to run!

137
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,765
-Gosh. Keep going!
-Honey. Wait up.

138
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,934
Where are you going?

139
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:10,232
It seems everyone is in agony
because of the gold.

140
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:11,484
I agree.

141
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,945
They do not know
that greed brings about pain.

142
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,239
How could they be so frivolous?

143
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:22,119
My gosh. If we get help from
Keum Gwang-jin, we'll find it right away.

144
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,582
You go upstairs.
And I'll check downstairs.

145
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:28,334
-Gosh, that's a lot of work.
-Wait.

146
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:33,005
Honey, hurry!

147
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,757
Don't run. You'll hurt yourself.

148
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,259
HONG CHA-YOUNG

149
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:43,182
-Yes?
-What didn't you pick up?

150
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:45,643
What is it?

151
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:49,563
The tenants are back at the plaza now
and on their way to the basement.

152
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,027
What's wrong?

153
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,988
The tenants are back.

154
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,327
-Close the hatch.
-We should clean this up.

155
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:08,624
No. Not my jacket.

156
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,042
Why put that in your pants?

157
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:24,515
Hold on.

158
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:26,934
-The gold!
-What gold?

159
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:28,811
The gold we took out. The gold!

160
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:31,230
Over there.

161
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:33,649
Hold it tight. Don't let go.

162
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:53,752
What?

163
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:55,629
Wait.

164
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,590
-Sir.
-Go that way.

165
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:15,399
I doubt there's anything down here.

166
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:18,777
Come to think of it,
we never searched this area.

167
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,988
Places like this is
where they probably hid it.

168
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,782
Slowly. There we go.

169
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:25,951
Now, over here.

170
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,666
-Mr. Tak!
-Mr. Tak!

171
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:37,880
What? Why did you two follow me here?

172
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:41,383
There's an important matter
I must discuss with you.

173
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,010
What important matter?

174
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,682
I think my father may have told me
a long time ago…

175
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,479
where the gold is.

176
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:56,190
-Really?
-Where is it?

177
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,567
Tell us.

178
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,154
It was…

179
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:11,789
We need one more.

180
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,626
Where could that be?

181
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,712
Gosh. Just tell me already.

182
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,673
It's in our hearts.

183
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,716
I also heard him say that.

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,595
He said that the most precious treasure
is right here. A heart of gold.

185
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,681
That's a load of nonsense.

186
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,265
Are you distracting us?

187
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,434
No. No way.

188
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,647
Put your hands on your chest and feel it.

189
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:42,236
Over there. Hold on.

190
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:45,739
What was that sound?

191
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:48,617
-No.
-Someone is in the temple.

192
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:49,827
-It's--
-I heard a sound.

193
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,745
No. It was from me. I made that sound.

194
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:54,373
-I made the sound with my shoes like this.
-Yes.

195
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:58,377
With your hands on your chest,
close your eyes and feel your heart.

196
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,587
No. I'm sure the sound
came from the temple.

197
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,047
No. Go like this.

198
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:05,592
Where are you going?
You have to feel the gold in your heart!

199
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,022
Why did you guys come back?

200
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,234
What are you two doing here?

201
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,157
We're doing 108 bows.

202
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:29,992
All of a sudden?

203
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,494
You're doing the 108 bows? Why?

204
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:38,542
It's to rid our hearts
of greed and selfishness.

205
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,714
Help us, merciful Buddha.

206
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:45,424
Help us, merciful Buddha.

207
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,804
We must finish all the bows today.

208
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,931
Please give us some privacy.

209
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:01,440
All right. Let us all go now.

210
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:06,070
Let's look for the gold in our hearts.

211
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,246
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

212
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:19,625
I believe we are in deep trouble.

213
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,169
What do you mean?

214
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:26,090
I think we left…

215
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:32,221
the recognition device for Wang's iris
in the basement earlier.

216
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,352
What are you talking about?

217
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,607
You threw my jacket
in the secret basement.

218
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:46,443
Yes, I did. What about it?

219
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:49,655
The device is in that jacket.

220
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,591
Hey!

221
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,051
Why you…

222
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,470
-Please, don't.
-Damn…

223
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:16,431
"Damn"? It was you
who threw my jacket in there.

224
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:18,433
Why would you put that in your jacket?

225
00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:21,228
Then, where else?
Should I carry that around?

226
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,479
But you must have

227
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:25,357
more than one of them right?

228
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:30,445
There's only one.
The one and only in the entire universe!

229
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,447
-You!
-You're yelling again.

230
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:39,538
Now we must demolish this building
if we want to get the gold.

231
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:44,001
It feels like my heart is crumbling now.

232
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:51,592
What happened?

233
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,596
Doing 108 bows allowed us

234
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,807
to feel the presence
of the merciful Buddha in our hearts.

235
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,649
I've never seen anyone cry
while being enlightened.

236
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,277
If they achieve enlightenment
one more time,

237
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,029
our ears will not last.

238
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:19,453
How could you think I'd do that?

239
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:21,705
You know,

240
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:26,376
I considered you my family.

241
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,004
We've been through a lot together

242
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,339
and will stay together.

243
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:32,883
Isn't that right?

244
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,176
-Yes.
-Yes.

245
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,886
Then, should you…

246
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,182
Should you suspect me like that or not?

247
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:42,017
-We shouldn't.
-We shouldn't.

248
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:47,231
I believed that you all trusted me.

249
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:58,450
Mr. Nam.

250
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,077
You guys are so heartless.

251
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,038
We care so much about you all.

252
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:09,419
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,172
We were so thoughtless.

254
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:15,884
What really did it for me was
the prize money of 20 million won.

255
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:18,637
It was such an unbelievable offer.

256
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:26,853
Twenty million won is a lot of money.

257
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:31,316
But I made that money
from investing in the stock market,

258
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,193
so I wanted to share it with you!

259
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,404
Which company did you invest in?

260
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,823
-Hey.
-Gosh. What's wrong with you?

261
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,158
I'm deeply disappointed in you guys.

262
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,662
I think it will take some time

263
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,957
for my wound to heal.

264
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,334
Same here. It will take a long time

265
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,712
for my heart to heal.

266
00:20:55,841 --> 00:21:00,137
Let me apologize to you
on behalf of the tenants.

267
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,888
Forget it.

268
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:03,974
I'll get going now.

269
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:06,935
We're sorry.

270
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:16,403
All right.

271
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,489
Now that we hashed it out,
let's go to the hot spring.

272
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,701
Forget about the hot spring.
Mr. Cassano is mad at us now.

273
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:25,579
All right. Everyone.

274
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:29,333
Let us look for the gold in our hearts.

275
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,043
I guess we're not going.

276
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:46,767
So? Is there really gold in there?

277
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:54,107
Gold bars and the Guillotine file as well?

278
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:55,776
Yes.

279
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,197
Including a huge gold statue of Buddha.

280
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:03,492
-Oh, my!
-That hurts so much.

281
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:05,285
It hurts so much, but I'm so happy!

282
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:06,244
Mr. Nam!

283
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:11,124
Well done. Great job. Nicely done.

284
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,835
Good job!

285
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,671
All right. Let's see.

286
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,883
We'll send them to see
cherry blossoms this time.

287
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,218
We can open it again then.

288
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,969
Let's open it again.

289
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:24,346
Open it again.

290
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:25,931
We can't open it again.

291
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,641
We can't open it.

292
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:28,975
Great.

293
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,393
That's much better…

294
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:40,529
We can't open it now.

295
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:45,408
Mr. Nam!

296
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:56,253
I expected this,
but everyone is so brazen.

297
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,504
They have no shame.

298
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,091
They don't find it shameful
as long as it stays hidden.

299
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,385
Forget about feeling ashamed.

300
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:06,721
They probably think
that they got a fair deal.

301
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:09,307
It should be enough to cover
the legal world, the press,

302
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:12,644
the National Assembly,
and an intelligence agency,

303
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:14,813
right?

304
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,816
Yes. It will be more than enough.

305
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:25,907
Are you disappointed?

306
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:30,662
No. You should definitely
take over the company.

307
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:34,749
I will do my best to assist you
from now on.

308
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,001
No.

309
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:37,878
Just stay put if you want to help me.

310
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,673
Okay. I got it.

311
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,927
Since we're all here today,

312
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,598
there's something I'd like to
bring your attention to.

313
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:52,809
I'm not sure if you heard of this.

314
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,146
It's called the Guillotine file.

315
00:23:56,229 --> 00:24:00,108
-Mr. Han.
-We can't hide it forever, Ms. Choi.

316
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:06,531
What's that?

317
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:10,243
Well, it's a long story.

318
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:11,661
So it is…

319
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:15,457
We must go back a few years.

320
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:30,138
Then, we can't take anything out now.

321
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:33,934
The gold, the Guillotine file,

322
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,061
and the gold Buddha statue.

323
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:37,771
I even picked out a house,

324
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:40,315
a car,

325
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:45,153
and stocks to buy.

326
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:47,822
On top of that, the partner
you fully trusted turned out

327
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:50,951
to be an agent of the International
Security Intelligence Service.

328
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,370
He even betrayed you on top of that.

329
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,460
This is just the worst!

330
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,383
Tell me there's another way.

331
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,761
You're the consigliere.
You're smart and strategic.

332
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,012
There's none.

333
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:14,140
None.

334
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:20,021
Except for demolishing this building,
there's no other way.

335
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:23,566
Cheetah.

336
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,237
Should we tear it down and die with
the gold to see them even for a moment?

337
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,863
I'll just forget about it.

338
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:31,283
That gold wasn't mine to begin with.

339
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,369
People ought to know their places.

340
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,751
My gold!

341
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:44,170
My gold!

342
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,089
-Stop it.
-My gold!

343
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:53,847
Mr. Nam. Wait.

344
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,394
Ms. Hong.

345
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,272
Tell me.

346
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,858
How much damage will that file do to us?

347
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,651
I don't know the details,

348
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:09,487
but it could damage the entire group.

349
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:11,906
Just how serious is it?

350
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,658
From what I've heard,

351
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:16,786
it even has information
on the late chairman's private life.

352
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:22,125
The auction went well today.

353
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,544
Can't they handle this?

354
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:26,129
My guess is,

355
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,674
more than half of the people there
are probably in the file.

356
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:37,015
Then, there's no point bribing them
with my tower.

357
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,601
That's not true. Please give me some time.

358
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:44,564
Is there any way we can find that file
right now?

359
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,234
Why are you so incompetent?

360
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:49,402
I'm sorry.

361
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,821
For now, it's impossible to find it.

362
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:53,239
Find it even if it costs

363
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:54,616
as much as ten billion won.

364
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,578
Yes, sir.
I'll put our experts to work on this.

365
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:06,127
Goodness.

366
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:14,219
I told you not to tell him
until we had a solution.

367
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:18,348
I told him because we wouldn't
be able to find any solutions.

368
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:22,602
Besides, if we keep something like this
from him, it will be worse.

369
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:26,981
Hey, Han Seung-hyuk.

370
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,818
Yes, Myung-hee.

371
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:34,614
Did you tell Chairman Jang Han-seok
about the file to prove your loyalty?

372
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:37,158
What are you talking about?

373
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:39,869
Or are you two-timing or something?

374
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:43,248
Because he'd kill you if he found out
you've sided with his brother?

375
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,999
My gosh.

376
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:48,711
Why are you making up stories about me?

377
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:51,172
-Seung-hyuk.
-Yes?

378
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,843
You know that if this two-timing stunt
goes wrong, it'll cost you.

379
00:27:55,552 --> 00:28:00,473
And if it does,
it could end up costing you your life.

380
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:01,558
Okay?

381
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:03,935
Gosh. Come on.

382
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:05,937
Myung-hee.

383
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:07,814
Don't forget who I am.

384
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,776
I wouldn't have made it this far
if I were that ballsy.

385
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,529
You did just fine,
but now you're going to have problems.

386
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:16,197
Gosh.

387
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:19,325
Silly Myung-hee.

388
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,997
Don't you know that I'm loyal?
You know that.

389
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:27,751
Why are you scowling at me like that?
You're scaring me.

390
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:31,504
I'll be loyal and protect you always.

391
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:34,215
Gosh. I'm busy. I should go now.

392
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:35,842
Hello? Wait, no.

393
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,927
I'm not getting a call. Hey, open it.

394
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:40,638
Gosh.

395
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:44,642
If he keeps being reckless,
he really is going to end up dead.

396
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:48,396
WARD 16

397
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,565
-Wait.
-What is this?

398
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:51,733
-What?
-What are you doing?

399
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:52,859
What?

400
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:59,657
Nam Sin-bae, you traitor!
Are you even human?

401
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:00,825
Sir!

402
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,368
-You can't leave us!
-No!

403
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:04,746
-Sir!
-Honey!

404
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,040
-Move back.
-That's my son!

405
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,167
I can't go! My son is right here!

406
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,378
My gosh. What am I going to do?

407
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:18,593
BODY OF DECEASED UNION LEADER
TAKEN TO PREVENT UNION FUNERAL

408
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:21,638
FOOTAGE PROVIDED
BY THE FAMILY OF THE DECEASED

409
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:24,766
What are those men doing?

410
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:29,646
The company's union members are taking
the body of the late union leader,

411
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,773
so they won't be able to
hold a union funeral.

412
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,993
They came to Geumga Plaza once.

413
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,038
The Gurkha knife tattoos.

414
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,958
Right. I heard about them.

415
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,961
Apparently, they are brutal.

416
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:55,296
But are they now in the company union?

417
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,966
Half of their members are thugs like them.

418
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,553
But what is this union funeral
that you mentioned earlier?

419
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:04,097
Like its name,

420
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,809
it is a huge funeral where every member
of the Babel Chemicals' union attends.

421
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:11,437
It will be covered by the press,
boosting the morale of the union.

422
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:14,274
They're not letting them hold a funeral

423
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:17,110
to keep the union's morale down.

424
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:21,155
Wusang must assume that I will postpone
summoning Chairman Jang Han-seok

425
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:24,784
because my key witness,
the union leader, died.

426
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:27,620
Then let's catch them off guard.
You should summon him.

427
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:29,622
But I don't have any hard evidence.

428
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:33,835
They hindered the investigation
in ways I can't even imagine.

429
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:37,755
So I really needed
the union leader's testimony.

430
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,675
Did you question Choi Myung-hee?

431
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:41,885
Of course.

432
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:43,344
You haven't changed!

433
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:45,221
Did you have to get him killed?

434
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:46,848
You'd better watch your tongue.

435
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,142
How dare you accuse me without evidence?

436
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:51,603
Because you're not the type
to leave behind evidence.

437
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,229
But isn't this so obvious?

438
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:56,065
How could he die right after
having a meal with you?

439
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:59,193
I didn't get him killed!
It was the drunk driver!

440
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:03,197
I guess a coincidence is enough
to indict someone these days.

441
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:04,657
"A coincidence"?

442
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:07,869
Why do these "coincidences"
keep happening in your favor?

443
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:09,787
You can't even prove your claim.

444
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:12,165
Talking crap doesn't make you
a prosecutor.

445
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:16,252
If you want to follow your hunches,
go and become a shaman!

446
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,173
I don't have to see it.
I can picture her so vividly.

447
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,550
Gosh. I hate her.

448
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:24,260
Given the cards we're dealt,

449
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:26,638
summoning Chairman Jang will be pointless.

450
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,056
I think so too.

451
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,266
If the first case against them
gets crushed,

452
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,727
the remaining five indictments
will crumble, too.

453
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:37,231
You know what they say.

454
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,735
It's all about the first punch, right?

455
00:31:41,945 --> 00:31:44,155
We'll try to collect the evidence
in our own way.

456
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,036
I am embarrassed as a prosecutor,

457
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,496
but I need your help.

458
00:31:53,206 --> 00:31:56,709
JANG HAN-SEOK DIRECTLY SUPERVISES
THE VISION TEAM

459
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,630
All the union-related matters
with Babel's subsidiaries

460
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:04,008
are handled by the Vision Team,
who directly answers to the chairman.

461
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,559
It won't be easy.

462
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:15,561
They are highly loyal to their boss.

463
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:19,524
Right. People like them
aren't afraid of going to prison.

464
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,611
Then we must find something
that is scarier than prison to them.

465
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:27,907
It's probably better to go after
the company union than the Vision Team.

466
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,242
I did some research

467
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:31,703
and found that these punks
are just the worst.

468
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:34,622
And they take orders from the Vision Team.

469
00:32:34,706 --> 00:32:37,417
Let's find out
who the company union leader is first.

470
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:45,216
All right.

471
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,803
Let's go and find out
who the king of the lackies is.

472
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,096
Gosh.

473
00:32:51,097 --> 00:32:54,225
Why did you want to have a meeting here
instead of our office?

474
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,477
Exactly, my point. Can you help me?

475
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:57,645
Let me help you.

476
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:03,359
All I wanted was a breath of fresh air.

477
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,835
Don't point a gun at me ever again.

478
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:24,714
I'm letting it slide this time

479
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:26,549
because I've thought of you
as a true friend.

480
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,426
I'm sorry for what happened,

481
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:32,138
but I considered you
more than just a business partner.

482
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,891
You saved my life.

483
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:37,977
I believe you.

484
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:41,230
Please keep helping me
like you've been doing,

485
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,608
so we can figure this out.

486
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,293
You're here.

487
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:18,559
I'm sorry.

488
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:22,063
It's been a long time since I last drove,
so I got lost.

489
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:25,942
I did…

490
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:29,570
everything you told me to do.

491
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,118
But look what happened!

492
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:37,537
Nothing worked out in my favor!

493
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,748
Had you shot him accurately that day,
we wouldn't have been--

494
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:43,543
You said I didn't need to aim
because it was a shotgun!

495
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:44,460
Didn't you?

496
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:46,045
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:48,798
My brother is going to kill me.
It's only a matter of time.

498
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,552
He'll just keep me around for a while
then kill me out of nowhere.

499
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:56,305
I doubt that he will do that to you.

500
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:59,851
You are his family.

501
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:02,603
-Have you forgotten?
-What?

502
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:06,482
My brother even killed
his own father himself.

503
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,734
-Oh, right.
-"Oh, right"?

504
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:14,031
That makes you the only family he has now.

505
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,493
Let's just think that way.
We should be positive.

506
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,539
Fine.

507
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,250
Let's say that I get lucky
and somehow stay alive.

508
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,211
Even if I'm alive,

509
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:28,588
there is

510
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:33,301
nothing I can do now. None whatsoever.

511
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:36,679
Are you sure? There's nothing? I'm sure
there has to be something. Think.

512
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,556
Yes!

513
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:42,268
This is a chance for you to take a break.

514
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,897
Then you can become a bigger idiot.

515
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,149
-What are you talking about?
-Listen.

516
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,484
You have to make him lower his guard.

517
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:54,655
You must show him
that you have no ulterior motive.

518
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:56,866
Remember Korean history.

519
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,910
To avoid
the Andong Kim clan's persecution,

520
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:02,288
Prince Heungseon pretended to be
an idiot and ruled the world in the end!

521
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:05,082
He was King Gojong's father.

522
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,543
-I know that.
-Exactly. Just like that prince,

523
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:10,755
you should turn into a total idiot.
Just do it.

524
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,843
You assholes.
It's my taxes that pays your salary.

525
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:17,929
Can't you do anything right?

526
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,555
-Hey, you.
-What?

527
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,807
Didn't I tell you
to get me a cheeseburger?

528
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:23,017
You're here.

529
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,518
What's going on?

530
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:27,355
He assaulted an employee at a bar.
He's been making a scene.

531
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:29,148
We stopped the reporters for now.

532
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:30,399
You should take him now.

533
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:35,279
Let go of me. Let go!

534
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,492
Hey, I'll give you guys some pocket money.

535
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:42,620
I'll pay whoever locks those bastards up.

536
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,121
All right. Take it.

537
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:46,082
Take it, you bums.

538
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:49,752
Mr. Jang.

539
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:53,756
Ms. Choi.

540
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,300
Ms. Choi. I'm glad that you're here.

541
00:36:57,593 --> 00:37:02,056
Sue everyone in here. I don't care
if they are cops. Lock all of them up!

542
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,727
CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEOK
TO BE INAUGURATED TOMORROW

543
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,399
FORMERLY EMPLOYED AT WUSANG

544
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:14,735
He must think he's a K-pop idol.
This is so ridiculous.

545
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:15,903
CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEOK'S
LAID-BACK LIFESTYLE

546
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:17,905
People abroad call him the "Handsome CEO."

547
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,241
Reporters are having a field day.

548
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:23,661
This isn't an article but an entry
to the annual spring literary contest.

549
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,580
Anyway, this is what we wanted.

550
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:29,250
He'll reveal himself tomorrow.

551
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:33,212
Did Mr. Jung set a date
for the invitation?

552
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:34,171
What?

553
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:37,008
They'll summon and question him
for anti-union activities?

554
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,634
Chairman Jang Han-seok?

555
00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:42,680
To stick it to us, they'll question him
the day after his inauguration ceremony.

556
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,811
We expected them to give up.

557
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:52,356
The union leader is dead.
I doubt he has any evidence.

558
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,692
Well, it's one or the other.

559
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:58,029
He's too embarrassed to give up,

560
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,531
or he actually has evidence.

561
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:04,035
You should have planned something
before you had the leader killed.

562
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,619
Are you blaming me?

563
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:08,748
I'm not blaming you. Gosh, no way.

564
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:12,460
I'm just worried
that things might go wrong.

565
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,546
I don't care…

566
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,758
as long as the Vision Team
doesn't get raided.

567
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:22,636
They can't get a warrant
unless they have something substantial.

568
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,430
And Mr. Hwang won't let them.

569
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:27,475
Well, I'll let them take a few photos
since they're summoning him.

570
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,686
Maybe I'll go to a salon in the morning.

571
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:38,444
You caused trouble when you knew
it's my inauguration ceremony today?

572
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,407
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,662
I was just so happy.
I drank a bit too much.

574
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:51,290
Please forgive me.

575
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,752
There's nothing to forgive.

576
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,590
It's nice to see the old you again.

577
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,134
Keep that up, okay?

578
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:08,849
I think I was born to live recklessly
like this.

579
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,477
-I feel at ease, too.
-Here.

580
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,567
It symbolizes
the union of our brotherhood.

581
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,038
Let's never betray each other

582
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,624
and work together to put Babel at the top.

583
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,591
We have to make people think

584
00:39:42,675 --> 00:39:45,177
that this country will be in ruins
if Babel goes down.

585
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:48,222
Yes, sir.

586
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:58,232
Did I tell you…

587
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:01,652
why I let the shooting incident slide?

588
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:06,991
That…

589
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,661
That really was an accident.

590
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,622
How could I do such a thing to you?

591
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,043
I need you alive.

592
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:22,882
If you die, who will take the rap for me?

593
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:29,805
If I'm ever on the verge of going to jail
after the takeover,

594
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,475
you'll take the fall in my place.

595
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:34,477
Don't you agree?

596
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:37,646
Yes.

597
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:40,900
Right.

598
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:42,985
That's right.

599
00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:45,696
I will go to jail for you.

600
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,364
Right. Sir.

601
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:50,784
I can assure you
that I'll do well in prison.

602
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,704
Yes. That's right. Please don't worry.

603
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:56,332
I will do anything for you.

604
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,714
I knew I could count on you.

605
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,218
Let's go to the ceremony.

606
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,695
This way, sir.

607
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:14,159
Hold on. Wait. Let me fix that.

608
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,370
Square your shoulders, sir.

609
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:19,081
-Babel will be born again starting today,
-Smile.

610
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,458
-You look better with a smile.
-with the leadership

611
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,793
of Chairman Jang Han-seok!

612
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,296
This is quite nervous.

613
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:28,382
Time for photos.

614
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:41,645
The ceremony will start soon.
Please go upstairs.

615
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:49,278
You will become the true head of Babel
starting today.

616
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:53,782
Congratulations, sir.

617
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:01,957
It's all thanks to my brother who did
a fine job running the company until now.

618
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,419
We should head upstairs.

619
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:23,854
Yes. Let's do this.

620
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,939
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

621
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,631
ILMIRI GOLD JJIMDAK

622
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:54,385
Look at all the cheese.

623
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:05,521
Their food always tastes great.

624
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:12,277
Babel's Vision Team
has never faced a search and seizure.

625
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,654
They never got a warrant

626
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,989
due to insufficient grounds.

627
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:19,660
That's why Mr. Jung is so upset,
since it's them he has to go after.

628
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,829
If he could search their office,

629
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:24,790
he'd find the evidence they were involved
in illegal activities.

630
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,919
We'll just set a trap for
the company union as we planned.

631
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,046
Did you look into
the company union leader?

632
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:35,134
Yes. He used to be the right-hand man
of the deceased union leader.

633
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:38,846
But one day, he betrayed the union
and joined the company's side.

634
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,099
He's the epitome of a traitor.

635
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,060
Well, I'm sure they bought him off.

636
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:47,312
But he did more than switch sides.

637
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,356
He and the leader
used to be close friends,

638
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,733
but he made false accusations
against the leader.

639
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:53,777
Gosh, he's quite the traitor.

640
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,572
What is the team leader
of the Vision Team like?

641
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,699
Mr. Park. Ms. Yoon.

642
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,827
You can't be sloppy like this.

643
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:05,914
He's known as a perfectionist
who works meticulously.

644
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,375
He'd come to Wusang
and rip their lawyers apart

645
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:10,711
saying they did a sloppy job.

646
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,715
Any good restaurants?
Let's just have something cheap.

647
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,216
Hello, sir.

648
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,261
I see. Hi, Mr. Park.

649
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:21,346
-Order the food now.
-Okay.

650
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:26,143
And more importantly,
he's as loyal as a Golden Retriever.

651
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:30,105
Traitors and loyal subordinates
have the best chemistry.

652
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:33,442
How can they have good chemistry?

653
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:36,612
Loyal subordinates' biggest fear
is losing the trust of their boss.

654
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:39,740
And bosses fear betrayal the most.

655
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:43,744
Preventing betrayal is
the loyal subordinates' biggest mission.

656
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:48,874
And when there's a betrayal,
the loyal subordinates show a weakness.

657
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:51,210
And we can take advantage of that.

658
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:54,338
They don't teach you this stuff
in schools, do they?

659
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,798
I'll give you a crash course
for 300,000 won a month.

660
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,551
-No. I need at least 400,000 won.
-Forget I asked.

661
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,094
I'll take up Pilates instead.

662
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,973
-Jang will be summoned tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

663
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:07,476
But let's take care of the traitor today.

664
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,036
Gosh.

665
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,259
What? What's this?

666
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,052
Stop it!

667
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,804
Who are you? Let go of me.

668
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,347
Help me!

669
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:53,480
The Twin Swords Gang?

670
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:57,442
You really scared me. Goodness.

671
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,404
The Twin Swords Gang. You're on our side.

672
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,532
By the way, what brings you here?

673
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:09,162
If you want to beatbox, repeat after me.

674
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,122
What?

675
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,331
Boots, cats

676
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,209
Boots, cats

677
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:15,377
Boots, cats

678
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,837
Boots, cats

679
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,089
-Boots, cats
-Boots, cats

680
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,133
-Boots, cats
-Boots, cats

681
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:22,843
-Boots, cats
-Boots, cats

682
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:24,678
Boots, cats

683
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,515
…cats.

684
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:53,415
What?

685
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:00,672
Are you sure this cement will harden fast?

686
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,174
What's taking so long?

687
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:04,217
-Hey.
-Did you get the wrong kind?

688
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:05,427
Hey.

689
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,471
It takes three hours. It's not chocolate.

690
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,598
-Hey.
-If we're throwing him with the cement,

691
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:10,974
won't the ocean be better?

692
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,976
Right. Besides, sharks will eat him up.

693
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,354
-It's nice and neat that way.
-Hey.

694
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,230
Why are you doing this to me?

695
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:20,192
Why? I thought the Twin Swords Gang
was like family.

696
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,240
Family, my foot.

697
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:28,909
How are we your family?

698
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,786
How come there's a woman in the gang?

699
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,829
Aren't women allowed to join gangs?

700
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,456
This jerk is a sexist.

701
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:35,582
I'm sorry.

702
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,711
By the way,
there must be a misunderstanding.

703
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,713
I didn't do anything wrong.

704
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:45,467
You betrayed and hassled
the union members.

705
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:49,680
You falsely accused union executives
of embezzlement and sexual harassment.

706
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:52,891
You even drove one of them
to commit suicide.

707
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,227
You're lucky
that I'm a true martial artist.

708
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,729
Otherwise, I would have crushed you.

709
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,981
So, you're an artist?

710
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,026
No, a "martial" artist.

711
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,404
If you lived
during the Japanese colonial era,

712
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,155
you would've sold your country.

713
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,033
Is it obvious?
My grandfather was pro-Japan.

714
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,911
So even your ancestors were traitors.

715
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,372
The cement's hardened.

716
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:17,958
What is?

717
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,376
-No way.
-At last.

718
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,712
-Is it ready?
-Yes, it's hard.

719
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:22,713
Wait.

720
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,298
It's nothing personal.
We're just following orders.

721
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:26,717
Wait. Hold on.

722
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,428
But who told you to do this to me?

723
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:32,806
Isn't it obvious?
I guess they don't need you anymore.

724
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:34,891
Those bastards at Babel…

725
00:49:36,017 --> 00:49:37,728
Should we put them together now?

726
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,979
What?

727
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:40,147
Let's do it.

728
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:41,523
-Wait. Hold on.
-What?

729
00:49:41,606 --> 00:49:43,942
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

730
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,110
-Wait.
-Do it.

731
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:47,112
-Take him.
-Hold on. Wait.

732
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:50,198
Please spare me.
I'll do anything you want me to do.

733
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,950
Please. I'll do anything you want.

734
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,618
You're not even that rich.

735
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:54,953
No. I can make it!

736
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:57,956
I'll use all my brainpower
to get whatever you want.

737
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:00,459
Like that's going to be any good.
Tie him to the can.

738
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,835
-What? No.
-Tie him.

739
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:03,837
-That's real cement.
-Put him in.

740
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,089
-Why are you doing this to me?
-One, two, three.

741
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,466
-No!
-One, two.

742
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:08,884
-One, two, three.
-Let go!

743
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,260
-Tie him.
-Help me!

744
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:11,386
-Somebody help me!
-Hey.

745
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,637
-Do it.
-Lord!

746
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:15,015
Hey, I'm going to die!

747
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:17,225
-Tie him.
-Oh, Lord

748
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:18,894
-One, two, three.
-Your words

749
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:20,187
-comfort me
-Lift him.

750
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,521
Wait!

751
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,405
Did you get any orders
from the headquarters?

752
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,532
Like what you must do
to destroy the union?

753
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:35,994
Of course. They email me
what I need to do every morning.

754
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,412
-Is that true?
-Yes.

755
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,748
-Are you telling me the truth?
-Yes.

756
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,585
Everyone, huddle up.

757
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:45,086
-One, two. Yes!
-One, two. Yes!

758
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:55,847
Those lunatics.

759
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:03,146
Help me. Somebody help me!

760
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,943
You said you'd do anything
we tell you to, right?

761
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:09,277
Of course.

762
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,989
Deal!

763
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:24,084
VISION TEAM
TEAM LEADER PARK CHAN-KI

764
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:25,752
What? Two billion won?

765
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:27,921
Yes. Two billion won.

766
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:29,881
Without the taxes.

767
00:51:31,883 --> 00:51:34,219
Who do you think you're talking to?

768
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,722
Do I what? Are you hearing yourself?

769
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:39,224
That was such a cliché line.

770
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:44,312
Hey, you ordered your men
to kill me, didn't you?

771
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,857
-What are you talking about?
-Whatever.

772
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,152
Bring me two billion won in cash
by tomorrow.

773
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,153
If you don't,

774
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:55,657
I'm going to disclose every order
I received from the Vision Team

775
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,036
and all of your illegal activities,
starting with you.

776
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,204
All of it!

777
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,875
Mr. Nam, calm down. Let's talk about this.

778
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,460
No. There's no need for that.

779
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:10,422
Call me when you have the money. Bye.

780
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:16,636
-Eat this.
-Nice. Great job.

781
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,221
-Great job!
-You did good!

782
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:20,390
-You did it!
-You did it!

783
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,311
That bastard…

784
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:27,981
Didn't I tell you

785
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:30,525
that you have a lot more to gain
by releasing me?

786
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:34,279
My client has kept his end of the bargain.

787
00:52:40,952 --> 00:52:41,912
What's this?

788
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:43,538
The Vision Team emailed this

789
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:47,292
to the company union leader
to oppress the union members.

790
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,380
BABEL GROUP
ANTI-UNION STRATEGIES

791
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:55,342
-How did you get this?
-This will be more than enough

792
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,345
to get a search and seizure
warrant for the Vision Team, right?

793
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:06,186
Yes.

794
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:08,271
With this document, it should be.

795
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,151
I have one more thing to ask you
before the raid.

796
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:33,713
Cheers.

797
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:42,097
I think being a gangster suits me better
than being a lawyer.

798
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,935
Same here.
I'm getting a rush of adrenaline.

799
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:48,561
Should I follow you to Italy

800
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,313
-and become a consigliere?
-Just eat.

801
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:51,982
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

802
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,985
-Should I go, too?
-Great. We should all go. I'm in.

803
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:57,529
I would make a great Mafia member, right?

804
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:58,488
Please eat.

805
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,616
Talent-wise,
I think I'm the best one here.

806
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,076
I mean, given my career…

807
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:05,412
You do have a point.

808
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:11,251
When you all go to Italy one day,
do you want to try splashing pigs' blood?

809
00:54:12,919 --> 00:54:14,295
Pigs' blood?

810
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:15,922
What's that about?

811
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:19,926
There's this tradition our family followed
until the 1960s.

812
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,388
On the day our rival family
holds a party to greet their new boss,

813
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,181
we used to splash pig's blood

814
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:28,184
on their new boss
to show them what we're capable of.

815
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,228
To intimidate them.

816
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:35,442
That's a bit cruel.
It must have smelled bad.

817
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:39,112
I don't like it either. It's too barbaric.

818
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:42,323
But I'd love to see it once.
It'd look grotesque.

819
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,533
I don't like it either.

820
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,119
Why waste something so delicious?

821
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:49,622
Here.

822
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:56,504
Eat this and go to sleep.

823
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:59,257
I need to get some quality sleep. Okay?

824
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:06,639
Do you understand what I'm saying?

825
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:08,600
Do you?

826
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:16,608
If you do understand what I'm saying,

827
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:21,237
make sure to return the favor someday.

828
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:22,947
I'm feeding you.

829
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,407
Okay?

830
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:31,081
Eat it.

831
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:39,923
That's right.

832
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,076
Please tell us how you feel.

833
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,498
I will fully cooperate
to the best of my abilities.

834
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:18,837
And Babel will come back
as a company that the public can trust.

835
00:56:26,511 --> 00:56:28,680
You're being summoned
upon your inauguration.

836
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:30,140
How do you feel about it?

837
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:31,641
Do you deny the charges?

838
00:56:31,724 --> 00:56:34,352
-Anti-union activities…
-Breaking news.

839
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:37,355
Chairman Jang Han-seok of Babel Group

840
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,774
has appeared at the prosecutors' office

841
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:43,194
wearing a luxurious custom-tailored suit
made by the designer, Booralro.

842
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:45,989
What's your take
on the prosecution's summon?

843
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:49,451
It looks like a certon prosecutor
is trying to assert dominance

844
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:51,369
over a fine and competent businessman.

845
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,830
-This is such an outdated tactic.
-That's right.

846
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:55,748
Just look at him.

847
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:58,543
Have you ever seen a businessman
as intelligent and charismatic as him?

848
00:56:58,626 --> 00:57:01,588
That's right. On top of that,
he's very handsome.

849
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:05,842
An intelligent, charismatic,
and handsome businessman.

850
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:07,302
In addition to that,

851
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:11,973
he's athletic, a good shot,
and an excellent artist.

852
00:57:12,056 --> 00:57:13,850
-In other words, he's…
-Goodness.

853
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:17,729
Look at them kissing up to him.
Isn't that too much?

854
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:21,357
They're all saying the same thing.
Everything is fake. They are all lies.

855
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,277
There's no correlation
between the development of media

856
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,820
and disclosure of the truth.

857
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:28,114
Not long ago,
I used the media to my advantage.

858
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,158
You're right.

859
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:33,953
The Internet makes it very easy
to deceive people nowadays.

860
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:36,915
That's why I only believe
two things on the Internet.

861
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,292
The weather and the time.

862
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:06,819
I have one more thing to ask you
before the raid.

863
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:08,863
What is it?

864
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:13,326
Let Babel and Wusang know
that there's going to be a raid.

865
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,745
-Pardon?
-We want the Vision Team

866
00:58:15,828 --> 00:58:18,039
to send their files somewhere else.

867
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:20,124
Then we won't be able to get anything.

868
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:23,294
Our goal

869
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,673
isn't to get evidence
of anti-union activities.

870
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:31,052
It's to prove that Chairman Jang
was the one who gave the orders

871
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:32,637
for their anti-union activities.

872
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:37,809
I'll guarantee this.

873
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:41,145
Tonight at 7 p.m.,

874
00:58:41,229 --> 00:58:46,985
Mr. Jang will give a lecture
to the young leaders of this country.

875
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:50,029
I'll bet 10,000 won
that he will walk out of here

876
00:58:50,738 --> 00:58:52,490
before the lecture.

877
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,044
Mr. Jung.

878
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,964
You've got a sense of humor now.

879
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:16,180
You brought us here. Why are you so quiet?

880
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,058
You gave the orders

881
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:21,102
for the anti-union activities, right?

882
00:59:21,185 --> 00:59:22,854
Even when you were at Wusang.

883
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:26,566
He did no such thing.

884
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,109
I see.

885
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,488
Do you want some food?

886
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,076
We can eat. They have good food here.

887
00:59:37,952 --> 00:59:38,870
Sure.

888
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,047
IN A MEETING
VISION TEAM LEADER PARK CHAN-KI

889
00:59:57,597 --> 00:59:58,806
Yes, Mr. Park.

890
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:00,266
Yes.

891
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:02,226
What?

892
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,311
VISION TEAM 4

893
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:04,562
Hey. Hurry up!

894
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:06,522
Hurry up.

895
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:08,107
Get a move on!

896
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:09,817
We have no time to shred them.

897
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:12,278
Get all the files
and put them in Mr. Lee's car.

898
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,696
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

899
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,864
Faster!

900
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:17,158
BUSINESS PROPOSAL
BABEL

901
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:18,451
What do I do with this?

902
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:24,874
EXPENSE JOURNAL
REVENUE AND EXPENSES

903
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:48,648
He's on the Elevator Two.
I repeat, Elevator Two.

904
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:58,074
Wait!

905
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:04,414
I haven't seen you before. Who are you?

906
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:11,713
If you don't identify yourselves,
I'm calling the cops.

907
01:01:12,296 --> 01:01:14,465
My name is Nam Ju-sung.

908
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:15,967
I'm from Wangsimni.

909
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,720
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

910
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:27,019
The higher-ups told us to be here

911
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:29,647
to protect the Vision Team.

912
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:37,238
Isn't this fake?

913
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:39,282
Then why don't you call them and ask?

914
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:43,035
If I'm telling the truth,
this is obstruction of justice!

915
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:49,333
We're from the Wangsimni Branch!

916
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:50,960
Way to go, rookie.

917
01:01:54,922 --> 01:01:57,091
I'll scold you
if you set foot in Wangsimni.

918
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:13,691
Can you press B1 for me?

919
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:21,741
You're going to Basement Three.

920
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:02,156
Do you need to take a dump?
What's the rush?

921
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,616
Are you busy?

922
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:05,368
-No.
-What are you hiding?

923
01:03:05,451 --> 01:03:06,828
Show it to us.

924
01:03:06,911 --> 01:03:09,121
-Show it to us.
-It's nothing.

925
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:10,790
-Gosh, this is a lot.
-Gosh.

926
01:03:10,873 --> 01:03:12,959
-What's this?
-It's so heavy.

927
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:13,960
Let me help you.

928
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:15,670
It's not heavy at all. I got this.

929
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:17,797
Gosh, this is heavy.

930
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,800
How did you run carrying this
all by yourself?

931
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:23,469
It's all right. You can leave it to us.

932
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:27,640
The Booralro suit Chairman Jang Han-seok
wore today

933
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:29,392
has been the talk of the town today.

934
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:30,476
It's even become

935
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,229
-a trending search word online.
-Have some.

936
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:35,147
Mr. Jung, come on. Get to work.

937
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,775
Or just let us go.

938
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:44,907
Thank you for the food.

939
01:03:53,374 --> 01:03:55,543
A search warrant
for the Vision Team was issued,

940
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:57,461
but we handled it thanks to a tip-off.

941
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:06,596
So that's why you kept us here.

942
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:09,098
So that you could raid
the Vision Team's office.

943
01:04:10,224 --> 01:04:12,393
Show us what you've got.

944
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:14,270
I'm not sure if you'll get anything.

945
01:04:16,063 --> 01:04:17,607
Let me ask you one question.

946
01:04:19,108 --> 01:04:21,444
You've been a no-nonsense prosecutor
all this time.

947
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:23,988
Why did you team up with a former-Mafia?

948
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:30,286
I didn't team up with him.

949
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:32,038
I'm just following the trend.

950
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:33,331
What did you say?

951
01:04:33,414 --> 01:04:36,918
The trend these days
isn't forgiveness or harmony.

952
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:38,794
It's eradication and isolation.

953
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:46,761
Oh, right. You have a lecture, right?

954
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:49,180
Go ahead and spread your filthy lies.

955
01:04:54,101 --> 01:04:56,687
You should eat. You won't have time later.

956
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:58,898
-You should finish it.
-Sure.

957
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:03,402
I'll take the oxtail soup.

958
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,988
-Oxtail soup?
-Yes.

959
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:07,657
Why didn't you order earlier?

960
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:10,326
Can you ask for more kkakdugi?

961
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:12,078
Breaking news.

962
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:14,413
Chairman Jang Han-seok demanded

963
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:16,999
-seolleongtang for dinner.
-I want it extra-large.

964
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:19,085
And he asked for more kkakdugi.

965
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:21,921
That is quite unprecedented.

966
01:05:22,004 --> 01:05:24,507
Chairman Jang asked for more kkakdugi.

967
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,258
What could this mean?

968
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:29,887
I think this is a subtle way
of letting the public know

969
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:32,682
that he is doing just fine.

970
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:36,185
Hey. Stop that.

971
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,065
You should have prepared
the money when you had the chance.

972
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:42,942
That file can never get out.

973
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:45,903
If it gets out,
it will be the end of you and me!

974
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,866
Bring two billion won
to the place I told you.

975
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,911
Bring it yourself.
If you don't follow my instructions,

976
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:56,497
I'll send these documents
to the prosecutor right away.

977
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:57,999
Bye.

978
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:05,214
Yes. You did it. That was good.

979
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,008
I did good, right?

980
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:11,220
So could you give me a drumstick?

981
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:12,763
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

982
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:15,599
There are no drumsticks. This is boneless.

983
01:06:16,976 --> 01:06:19,270
I see. Then just give me any piece.

984
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:21,772
This is good. Sure.

985
01:06:27,486 --> 01:06:29,238
Too bad. I finished everything.

986
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:32,116
Please. Come on. Just one piece.

987
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:34,118
Gosh, you guys are too harsh.

988
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:36,746
Come on. It fell!

989
01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:39,540
Come on. Don't be so childish.

990
01:06:39,623 --> 01:06:43,002
Come on. Don't tease me with food.
Seriously.

991
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:48,090
-Check the brightness of the monitor.
-Okay.

992
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:51,010
And make sure that the lights
are all working.

993
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:58,434
Can I ask you for a favor?

994
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:00,227
Pardon?

995
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:04,106
I want to throw a surprise event
for a woman.

996
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:07,568
I'll pay handsomely for it.

997
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:11,530
It's the chairman.

998
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:23,709
Thank you.

999
01:07:26,378 --> 01:07:27,296
Sorry.

1000
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,049
THE CORPORATE SPIRIT
OF CERTAINTY AND AUDACITY

1001
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,726
All right.

1002
01:07:41,393 --> 01:07:42,895
Here's the man of the hour.

1003
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:47,942
He's my mentor, older brother,

1004
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:50,694
and the leader of Babel Group.

1005
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:52,780
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

1006
01:08:26,605 --> 01:08:29,108
Nice to meet you,
future leaders of our country.

1007
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:30,484
I'm Jang Han-seok.

1008
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:45,541
The future belongs to no one.

1009
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:48,836
No one owns it yet.

1010
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:52,590
So, the one who seizes it first
will come to own it.

1011
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,551
But if you pick the wrong future,

1012
01:08:55,634 --> 01:08:57,011
you'll be doomed.

1013
01:09:00,055 --> 01:09:01,390
Who wrote the script?

1014
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:05,019
To make a great future for yourselves,

1015
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:08,397
you must be sure of yourselves
in the present moment.

1016
01:09:08,981 --> 01:09:10,983
And you must be audacious.

1017
01:09:13,068 --> 01:09:17,448
And Babel will once again
take an audacious step.

1018
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:22,411
Babel Chemicals is developing
revolutionary batteries.

1019
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:25,581
And once the development is complete
in two years,

1020
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:28,584
we will jump
into the electric vehicle market.

1021
01:09:30,878 --> 01:09:34,006
This is the vision of Babel Motors,
the leader of our future.

1022
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,424
Let's take a look.

1023
01:09:45,476 --> 01:09:47,228
BABEL MOTORS,
THE NEW PARADIGM FOR THE FUTURE

1024
01:09:47,311 --> 01:09:50,022
What's this? How come
you only brought 300 million won?

1025
01:09:51,273 --> 01:09:54,193
This is all I could come up with for now.

1026
01:09:54,276 --> 01:09:57,988
Seriously. You're the mighty leader
of Babel Group's Vision Team.

1027
01:09:58,072 --> 01:09:59,573
-Looks like there's been a mistake.
-Why are you…

1028
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:01,742
Then I can't give you the evidence I have.

1029
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:03,869
-What?
-Give it to me now.

1030
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:05,704
May I have your attention please.

1031
01:10:05,788 --> 01:10:07,164
This is bad.

1032
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:10,084
-Where are the staff?
-We're checking.

1033
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:11,460
-Hurry and check.
-Where's the supervisor?

1034
01:10:12,753 --> 01:10:15,923
I heard the documents about
anti-union activities are pretty serious.

1035
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:18,717
Your life will be over
if you try anything funny with that.

1036
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:21,679
Me? No. It won't be me.

1037
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:24,723
I'm just a union member
from Babel Chemicals.

1038
01:10:24,807 --> 01:10:26,016
My life won't be over.

1039
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,811
You are the leader of the Vision Team.
You pull the strings.

1040
01:10:28,894 --> 01:10:32,439
Your life will be over
because you set everything up.

1041
01:10:32,523 --> 01:10:34,191
This didn't come from me.

1042
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:36,902
I just do what
the chairman tells me to do.

1043
01:10:36,986 --> 01:10:38,612
That's not my concern.

1044
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:40,322
The chairman ordered him?

1045
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:41,615
Listen.

1046
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,951
-You…
-What are you doing?

1047
01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:45,411
Turn it off!

1048
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:48,789
You'd better keep your fingers
away from that button.

1049
01:10:48,872 --> 01:10:50,165
I'm just his puppet!

1050
01:10:50,249 --> 01:10:52,751
They mentioned his name.
Make this stop now.

1051
01:10:53,627 --> 01:10:55,587
-Tell me.
-I don't know that.

1052
01:10:55,671 --> 01:10:56,880
What are you going to do?

1053
01:10:59,383 --> 01:11:02,344
Wait. I don't know why you're doing this.

1054
01:11:03,595 --> 01:11:05,889
Come on. We can talk this out.

1055
01:11:05,973 --> 01:11:07,516
I wanted caramel popcorn.

1056
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:10,185
Gosh. Regular popcorns are the best.

1057
01:11:10,269 --> 01:11:12,271
Or you can go ask him for money.

1058
01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:14,523
Why did you even ask me what I wanted?

1059
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:15,733
Both of us will be dead.

1060
01:11:15,816 --> 01:11:17,234
-Ms. Hong.
-Fine. Let's all die.

1061
01:11:17,318 --> 01:11:19,737
I'll show you something fun
to make up for it.

1062
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,115
It will be as vivid as an 8K TV.

1063
01:11:23,907 --> 01:11:26,618
This already hit the spot for me.
There's more?

1064
01:11:26,702 --> 01:11:28,203
You said you wanted to see it.

1065
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:29,872
-You go first!
-You first.

1066
01:11:29,955 --> 01:11:32,583
No, you go first, you bastard!

1067
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:35,919
Han-seo, hurry.

1068
01:11:36,003 --> 01:11:36,920
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1069
01:11:37,004 --> 01:11:38,422
Get over here, you punk.

1070
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:40,382
Hey, I told you to shut this down now!

1071
01:11:40,466 --> 01:11:42,217
-What are you doing?
-How old are you?

1072
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:45,554
-Let go of me.
-Stop it. No photos.

1073
01:11:45,637 --> 01:11:46,680
I said no photos.

1074
01:12:02,905 --> 01:12:03,739
Five.

1075
01:12:04,782 --> 01:12:05,824
Four.

1076
01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:07,910
Three.

1077
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:09,787
Two.

1078
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:12,081
One.

1079
01:12:43,362 --> 01:12:44,196
That was awesome.

1080
01:12:48,325 --> 01:12:50,577
I feel like I'm a Mafia from the '60s.

1081
01:12:54,957 --> 01:12:56,542
Enjoy it.

1082
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:58,377
See how it feels to be a real villain.

1083
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:01,463
Stop taking photos!

1084
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:05,175
-Stop it.
-No photos.

1085
01:14:07,654 --> 01:14:08,697
SPECIAL THANKS TO YOON KYUNG-HO

1086
01:14:37,518 --> 01:14:41,480
This is really important.
We need good teamwork for this.

1087
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:43,065
Wait.

1088
01:14:43,148 --> 01:14:45,859
Why is everyone here so talented?

1089
01:14:45,943 --> 01:14:47,611
Chairman Jang Han-seok's paper company.

1090
01:14:47,694 --> 01:14:50,197
-I've inserted the thumbstick.
-With this,

1091
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,366
Jang Han-seok will be penniless.

1092
01:14:52,449 --> 01:14:56,119
That's when you can really prove
how loyal you are to me.

1093
01:14:56,203 --> 01:14:58,330
Arrange a meeting with Vincenzo.

1094
01:14:58,413 --> 01:15:00,332
Kill him. Hurry!

1095
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:03,669
This is such a magical night

1096
01:15:04,294 --> 01:15:05,420
I will never forget.
