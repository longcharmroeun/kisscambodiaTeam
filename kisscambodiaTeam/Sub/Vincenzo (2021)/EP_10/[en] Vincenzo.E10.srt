1
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,028
VINCENZO

2
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,260
<i>All right, my brother. Speak.</i>

3
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,013
Remember how our storage room
caught on fire?

4
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,765
-Yes.
-I found four other culprits

5
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,894
apart from Vincenzo and Hong Cha-young.

6
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,061
And how?

7
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,901
I had people go through the history
of calls, social media accounts, and texts

8
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,987
of the 3,700 people
who have a legal suit against the Babel.

9
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,071
And then…

10
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,917
SEO JU-YEON
LEE DONG-JAE

11
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,418
This is so like you.

12
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,795
Always the hard way.

13
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,593
<i>-Great work, everyone.
-I hope nobody is hurt.</i>

14
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,138
<i>It felt so liberating
to see that thing burning down.</i>

15
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,933
<i>I'm sure my son is looking down with joy.</i>

16
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,311
The victims' families?

17
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,526
My brother.

18
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,239
It's time to vent our anger.

19
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,325
Why don't we include
Director Gil Jong-moon too?

20
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,452
Sure.

21
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,733
Mr. Cassano.

22
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,111
She texted you her suicide note.
How can you say that it's a murder?

23
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,573
It wasn't a handwritten note.
Someone else could have sent it. And…

24
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,077
They sent me this photo
before they went on that trip yesterday.

25
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,871
Do they look suicidal to you?

26
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,415
People who commit suicide are
very impulsive.

27
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,708
They'd laugh and have fun,

28
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,460
then take their life the next day.

29
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,295
Four of them at once?

30
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,089
You're saying four people
committed suicide on impulse?

31
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,050
They were mentally unstable.

32
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,093
They lost their family, lost the trial,

33
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,387
and all kinds of people criticized them.

34
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
I see enough reasons for suicide.

35
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,392
I don't need your opinion.

36
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,395
Do an autopsy and investigate the matter.

37
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,813
I demand an autopsy warrant.

38
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,107
There are no traces of murder,

39
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:02,361
and the initial forensic report
shows no possibility of a homicide.

40
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,739
I want to know
the exact cause of their death.

41
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,908
Make a request for a warrant now!

42
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,034
What's wrong with you?

43
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,787
This will be considered
an obstruction of justice.

44
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,873
If you don't like it,
file a suit or do whatever you want.

45
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,167
Detective.

46
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,712
We can do whatever we want?

47
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,047
Be my guest.

48
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,968
Let's go.

49
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,156
MORTUARY

50
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,684
This will be the last time I cry.

51
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,022
Put your guilt aside for now.

52
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,484
Think of something
productive and practical.

53
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,572
Yes. I should do that.

54
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,453
Except,
it won't be as easy to put my guilt aside.

55
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,538
At the very least,

56
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,084
let's not regret that we made them
help us burn down Babel's warehouse.

57
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,087
They wanted to do it,
and it comforted them.

58
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,966
I'm 100 percent sure
we won't get a warrant.

59
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,595
The case will be wiped away for good.

60
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,266
It doesn't matter.

61
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,019
Because I'm doing the ruling.

62
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,192
I've only fought against villains
to this day.

63
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,236
It was kill-or-be-killed,
but only within our world.

64
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,446
But these four…

65
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,410
weren't villains at all.
They weren't even close to being one.

66
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
They've taken the lives of the innocent.

67
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,418
I'll make them pay no matter what.

68
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,589
This isn't about justice.

69
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,926
This is about the principle
that I've lived by.

70
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,600
What I do know for sure
is that what they need right now

71
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,936
isn't a lawyer.

72
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,238
Keep your heart cold.

73
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,700
Revenge will go more smoothly that way.

74
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,386
Sir.

75
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,933
Did you get rid of the forensic report?

76
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,393
Yes, I left out everything.

77
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,522
Call Wusang. Tell them we took
care of it and to make the delivery.

78
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,482
Salute.

79
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,826
BEST LAUNDROMAT

80
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,744
I can't believe this.

81
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,205
How could humans do something like that?

82
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,086
-I'm sorry, sir.
-It's all right.

83
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,547
You took the words out of my mouth.

84
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,215
Are you sure they were killed?

85
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,136
Yes. There's no hard evidence,
but circumstances are blatantly obvious.

86
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,763
So they killed seven people overnight?

87
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,850
I can't believe this.

88
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,352
They're like a serial killer.

89
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,479
And what?

90
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,733
They're going to close the case
without proper investigation?

91
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,942
That's the law.

92
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,737
They can't do a thing
without warrants from the prosecution.

93
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,490
This makes absolutely no sense.
We must make them pay for what they did.

94
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,035
Has this ever crossed your minds?

95
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,874
This could happen to us too.

96
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,834
Why us?

97
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,920
Because we're the ones stopping Babel

98
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,547
from building their tower here.

99
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,840
You're right.

100
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,718
We're their biggest headache right now.

101
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,386
Top of the hit list.

102
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,391
I'm not trying to scare you,

103
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,436
but I must say Mr. Tak has a point.

104
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,939
Hey, wait. What if we get kidnapped
on our way home

105
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,025
after grabbing a drink?

106
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,655
Wait, what if some killers are waiting
for us at our homes?

107
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,073
Stop that. You're scaring me.

108
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,783
Help us, merciful Buddha.

109
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,577
Shouldn't we come up with a plan?

110
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,954
For now, forget the gold or whatever--

111
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,127
The gold?

112
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,506
The gold…

113
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,134
The golden time starts today.
We must work together

114
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,388
and help out Mr. Cassano
to overcome this crisis.

115
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,725
All in all, Mr. Cassano is
the only one who can keep us safe.

116
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,813
I heard the bodies of the families
of the victims are kept frozen

117
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,357
and the funeral is off until the autopsy.

118
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,609
It's just Cha-young's
another futile attempt.

119
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,406
Myung-hee. Don't you think

120
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,951
Chairman Jang Joon-woo is
way over the line?

121
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,412
What? Do you think
he might end up killing us too?

122
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,454
Yes.

123
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,959
I've been having panic attacks
since I saw Prosecutor Seo die.

124
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,460
My heart is throbbing.

125
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,588
We need some kind of contingency plan.

126
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,258
I'd really rather live than die.

127
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,552
Contingency plan, my foot. Seriously?

128
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,932
Do you want to die?

129
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,602
-Stop that. You're scaring me.
-Just the fact

130
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,773
that we know who Jang Joon-woo really is

131
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:18,404
means our heads
are already in a guillotine.

132
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,364
Don't you forget that.

133
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,199
Yes, okay.

134
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,703
Here comes the panic attack.

135
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,372
I seriously need a prescription.

136
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,291
-Breathe.
-Why can't I untie this?

137
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,729
Now that their bodies are safe,
let's hurry up and find the real boss.

138
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,693
We'll make him pay hard.

139
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,737
I won't make him pay.

140
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,865
-Then what?
-As soon as we find him,

141
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,993
I'll kill him.

142
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,206
There's no use in stopping me.

143
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,834
I'm not looking to stop you.

144
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,134
Thank you.

145
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,844
But…

146
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,015
it looks like I'll have to
break the promise I made

147
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,643
that I wouldn't hurt anyone.

148
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,396
I'll let you break that promise.

149
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,608
Promises can be broken out of necessity.

150
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,413
GEUMGA PLAZA

151
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,292
Attorney Seo of Wusang
will pay the detectives in person.

152
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,087
He must be in charge of the delivery.

153
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,463
He's an incompetent lawyer,

154
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,091
but they're keeping him
because he does good impressions.

155
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,969
Then we'll put tails on
both Seo and the detectives.

156
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,637
Also, I have a favor to ask.

157
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,765
Whoever it is you catch,
let me have the last blow.

158
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,518
Sure.

159
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,194
I could really use a cider right now.

160
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,865
Should I go get some?

161
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,784
-I'll get some.
-That's not what I meant.

162
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,570
-Let's split it and go.
-Yes, sir.

163
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,242
-How much is this?
-Hurry up.

164
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,292
You on the right blinked.

165
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,835
Should I take another one?

166
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,629
What are you doing here?

167
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,134
I'm not good at smelling legitimate money,

168
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,929
but I'm awfully good at smelling…

169
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,432
filthy money.

170
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,185
Mind your business and go, okay?

171
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,188
What's with you?

172
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,733
Darn it.

173
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,321
It looks like
Wusang is pretty trustworthy.

174
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,200
They pay you right away
as soon as the job's done.

175
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,120
Go pick it up.

176
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,041
You little…

177
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,504
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

178
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,134
You bastard.

179
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,885
Damn it.

180
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,041
-Look, sir.
-What is this?

181
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,128
Darn it, we're tied up.

182
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,338
What do we do?

183
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,304
We're the police.

184
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,389
You can't do this to us!

185
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,433
You told me to do as I like.

186
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,063
Hey, wait!

187
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,735
I'll make it so that you drop
after three pushes.

188
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,278
Never mind.

189
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,323
If I push a bit too hard,
you might fall after the second push.

190
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,491
One second.

191
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,376
-That took a while.
-Why are you doing this to us?

192
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,840
I need the case report for their murder.

193
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,801
Their whereabouts, video footage,

194
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,928
the forensic and autopsy reports.
Everything.

195
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,766
It was a suicide,
so all we have are simple reports.

196
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,518
Then flesh them out.

197
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,936
We can't do that.

198
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,688
We need the captain's approval
to investigate--

199
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,357
No, don't do this!

200
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,566
-Please stop!
-No!

201
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,776
We will investigate!

202
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,903
-Yes, we'll do that.
-Yes.

203
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,740
Make sure to resign after you hand over
the case file if you want to live.

204
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,368
We can't do that.
We need to make a living!

205
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,661
There's one push left.

206
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,329
No, stop! Stop!

207
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,288
Oh, right.

208
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,958
The last one isn't for me.

209
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,137
It's her again.

210
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,020
Your shoes don't look good on you,
but they leave quite an impression.

211
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,523
I got limited-edition shoes
for this occasion.

212
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,110
-Shall we switch?
-Sounds great!

213
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,821
-Oh, no.
-No.

214
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,156
-Wait, don't do it.
-Stop.

215
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,032
-Please stop. One second!
-Don't. No!

216
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,663
We'll do it! We'll resign!

217
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,000
You're to turn in the case file
by 7 a.m. tomorrow.

218
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,459
If you try anything funny,

219
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:36,133
you two will become the most sought after
detectives with the Internal Audit team.

220
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,136
Then what about our money?

221
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,596
I promise

222
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,933
that the money you donated
will be put to good use.

223
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,602
Donated?

224
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,770
Donated?

225
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,898
-Gosh.
-Donated?

226
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,289
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

227
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,378
I wanted to share
the impressions I had on you over the time

228
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,757
I've worked for you.

229
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,553
I must say you've been
making amazing progress.

230
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,019
Gosh, stop flattering me like that.

231
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,897
I'm nowhere near as good as my brother.

232
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,235
Everyone in the world thinks
you are the real chairman,

233
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,572
whereas Chairman Jang Joon-woo is
unknown to the world.

234
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,955
What are you trying to say?

235
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:55,712
I'm saying I'm confident
that you could have Babel all to yourself.

236
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,547
What are you on about?

237
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,134
Are you telling me to betray him?

238
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:08,100
Do you even know what you're saying?

239
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,768
And, as for me…

240
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:14,439
I'm not cut out to be a chairman!

241
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,732
What is this nonsense?

242
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,778
I am the CEO of Wusang!

243
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,322
I have hundreds of clients
who are hotshot businessmen!

244
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:27,119
Do you think I, the CEO,
can't tell who's fit to be a chairman?

245
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,666
You could've told me nicely.
Why are you getting so worked up?

246
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,668
Because it's really frustrating!

247
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:42,759
At this moment, Babel is…
Babel is in need of a leader…

248
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,390
who's sharp, ambitious,
and does not kill--

249
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,060
My goodness, feel free to reprimand me
if I stepped over the line.

250
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:57,566
But that isn't going to change
how I truly feel about this.

251
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,027
So please…

252
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,406
Goodness, I'm being so silly.

253
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,243
I'm sorry.

254
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,623
Stop making things so awkward.

255
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,168
Grab a drink for now.

256
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,961
-Yes, sir.
-My gosh.

257
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,882
You're the chairman of my heart.

258
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,053
What do you mean, your heart? Come on.

259
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,639
You keep crying.

260
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,767
Stop crying.

261
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,977
-Hush.
-Hush.

262
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,020
-Hush.
-Okay.

263
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,458
I'll kill him.

264
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,464
Is he really going to kill him?

265
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,759
You seem tired.

266
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,804
It's because I'm looking for
Babel's real boss.

267
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,144
I hate to say this,
but retrieving the gold is more urgent.

268
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,108
-Of course.
-Nanyak Temple has to go.

269
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,568
Once they leave,
we can get the gold out right away.

270
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,407
Is there a reason
you can't get rid of them?

271
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:34,079
All of the tenants want to fight
against Babel against my wish.

272
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,251
They're really impossible.

273
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,380
Mr. Cassano.

274
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,799
-But right now--
-Mr. Cho.

275
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,388
I'll take care of this.

276
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,683
Give it more time.

277
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,754
<i>I want to report a corrupt temple.</i>

278
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,339
NANYAK TEMPLE IN GEUMGA-DONG

279
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,348
Hello?

280
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,143
<i>-Mr. Consigliere.</i>
-Luca.

281
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,145
<i>How have you been?</i>

282
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,647
Good, good. What about you?

283
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,945
I'm good too.

284
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,658
I called to tell you something urgently.

285
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,910
What is it?

286
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,371
<i>Apparently, someone's been
asking around about you.</i>

287
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,042
Who?

288
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,502
I don't know who he is, but he's Korean.

289
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,798
Be careful, Mr. Consigliere.

290
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,970
You be careful too.

291
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,746
Hey.

292
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,628
I thought you went home.

293
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,383
I did, but the windows weren't ready yet.

294
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,760
I don't know why they're so slow.

295
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,720
I see.

296
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,140
By the way, how did you get in?

297
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,147
You gave me your spare key last time.

298
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,441
You told me to be here
if something happens.

299
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,111
Right, I did.

300
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,365
Anyway, you can sleep in the room tonight.

301
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,575
-I don't think I can.
-Why not?

302
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,250
Again?

303
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:30,130
I left the windows open for a bit
to do a little cleaning.

304
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,381
They came in then.

305
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,677
Inzaghi, you break in
whenever I open the window!

306
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,387
I brought a lot of <i>makgeolli</i>.

307
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,931
Do you want some?

308
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,393
Yes.

309
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,064
Cheers.

310
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,578
Mr. Hong also loved <i>makgeolli</i>, didn't he?

311
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,872
He was the biggest <i>makgeolli</i> lover.

312
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,336
You know,

313
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,672
I hadn't been able to sleep well
for months.

314
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,343
But the day I had some <i>makgeolli</i> with him,

315
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,928
I finally had a deep, good sleep.

316
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,473
I had a huge hangover though.

317
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,560
It's all worth it though.

318
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,312
You're right.

319
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,860
That day…

320
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:40,367
he asked me to tell you something
if I ever got the chance.

321
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,996
He said that the world has changed,

322
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,250
and that he couldn't win against
the corrupt people.

323
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:55,382
He said that only those who are bold,
persistent and tough can fight them.

324
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,927
And he said that you are…

325
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,430
the perfect person for that.

326
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,812
He could've just told me himself.

327
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,118
But I guess I didn't have to tell you.

328
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,289
It seems things are going as he wished.

329
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,337
Cut it out. You're embarrassing me.

330
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,966
I'm not a righteous lawyer.
I just get angry very easily.

331
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,345
I don't expect you to be righteous either.

332
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,932
I expect anger and action.

333
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,486
After we find Babo and get rid of him,

334
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,449
you'll leave, right?

335
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,467
We met unexpectedly,
so I guess we'll part ways like that.

336
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,718
Right?

337
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,262
Cheers.

338
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,849
Cheers.

339
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,361
I learned this from your father.

340
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,658
Here.

341
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,296
All right.

342
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,840
Let's get ready to demolish Geumga Plaza.

343
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:28,219
Well, sir. It may not be such a good idea.

344
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,056
We still have the attention
of the media and the social groups.

345
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,018
And Seoul City has made many demands--

346
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,185
Just do it.

347
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,688
Let the Namdongbu Office deal with it.

348
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,648
The law's on our side.

349
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,066
You're right. Of course.

350
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,068
Also…

351
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,697
we'll use a reliable labor service team
this time around.

352
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,785
They were my father's favorite.

353
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,624
Are you talking about the team
from the Yonghu-dong redevelopment?

354
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,001
Bingo.

355
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,881
Back then, 12 people died.
I wonder how many will die this time.

356
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,800
About a dozen or so?

357
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,971
Smuggling by boat
is way too old-fashioned.

358
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,849
The most recent trend
in the smuggling industry is

359
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,517
using a hot-air balloon.

360
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,481
Now, once a week…
Let's take a look at the map.

361
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,400
One for China departs from Incheon,
one for Japan, from Busan.

362
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,652
We'll use the deserted islands.

363
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,488
What does this mean?
It means it's totally confidential.

364
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,992
After you take a long nap
curled up in there,

365
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,452
where do you think you'll be?

366
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,454
You'll be at the Great Wall in no time.

367
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,664
Is it safe?

368
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,542
Don't be so anxious. It depends.

369
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,378
Why? When the wind is strong,

370
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,838
you might end up in Guam.

371
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:50,718
Once you go that way,
you'll be in Guam forever.

372
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,473
But that rarely happens.

373
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,268
There may be fighter jets, but you'll be
fine if you don't run into them.

374
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,523
Then how much will it cost?

375
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,566
Don't worry. We're honest people.

376
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,153
The cost will be split among the people
riding in the balloon, and that's it.

377
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,074
What is this?

378
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,368
Hello, Vincenzo.

379
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,498
When did you set up shop here?

380
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,752
I was going to pass around rice cake
to celebrate our grand opening,

381
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,130
but the shop on the second floor
was closed.

382
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,674
-What is this place?
-A travel agency.

383
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,883
Come if you need us.

384
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,888
Don't cause any trouble.

385
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,017
You better keep things quiet here, okay?

386
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,935
Here.

387
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,025
You're pretty cute now.
Look at your shirt.

388
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,904
That annoying jerk.

389
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,449
Who is he?

390
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:59,037
I didn't know
such a hottie was in this building.

391
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:00,997
It's this one.

392
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:07,670
I can't believe them.
They did investigate the case after all.

393
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,672
-Let's connect it to a computer.
-Yes.

394
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,389
That car keeps following them.

395
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,725
Take a good look at the next one.

396
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,105
They're going in.

397
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,025
And here's the next footage.

398
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,657
That's the last we see them on camera.

399
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,744
-How far is the crime scene?
-About 300m.

400
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,954
There's a bit of delay.

401
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,750
If you take a close look,
they come out after a minute.

402
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,002
This place is called
the Yangdong Underpass.

403
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,673
It's a short underpass that takes
five seconds to pass even if you go slow.

404
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,301
And the black car came out ahead of them
when they left.

405
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,555
Mr. Nam, could you rewind it a bit?

406
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,599
-Rewind this?
-Yes, a little more.

407
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,476
More. Yes, that's it.

408
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,436
There's a dent on the side of that car.

409
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,397
-It wasn't there when they went in.
-Hey, you're right.

410
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,399
Right here.

411
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,153
What if they rammed into them on purpose
to kidnap them?

412
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,948
How did they kidnap them?

413
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,242
What about the forensic report?

414
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,202
Yes. I printed it out.

415
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,622
-Here.
-Thank you.

416
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,129
Two of the four people had small,
red dots on their necks.

417
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,213
Could it be…

418
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,924
Yes. They must've used a taser.

419
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,396
<i>I'm sure there were
more than two culprits.</i>

420
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,923
They knocked them out
and burned the charcoal in the car.

421
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,592
Those bastards…

422
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,428
They were clearly murdered.

423
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,056
The prosecution won't take it
with this much evidence?

424
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,101
They're experts
in turning clear evidence into garbage

425
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,769
and nothing into hard evidence.

426
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,855
Don't expect anything from them.

427
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,157
But, wait. What's this smell?

428
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,620
What are you doing?

429
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,747
Just a second.

430
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,124
It's done now.

431
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,085
Excuse me.

432
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,087
What brings you here?

433
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,925
The chef wanted to treat you
to some pasta for your hard work.

434
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,010
Thank you.

435
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,762
We'll eat it after our meeting.

436
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,139
-You can leave it there.
-Sure.

437
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,475
Don't bring mine next time.

438
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,810
Okay.

439
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,564
I can see the license plate number
of the suspect's car,

440
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,567
but I bet it's under a fake name.

441
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,778
Don't you think
we can still track it down?

442
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:24,075
Cars with fake titles used by these people
are probably covered up by many layers,

443
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,869
so it's nearly impossible
to track it down.

444
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,502
I love to watch crime drama shows
like <i>Quiz Of God</i>.

445
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,425
It'll be impossible to track it down
unless we use the entire police network.

446
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,054
But I'm glad we found clear evidence
that they were murdered.

447
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,890
How can we hunt down these hitmen?

448
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,815
What are you doing?

449
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,403
I'm learning wushu these days.

450
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,868
Please carry on.

451
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,670
-Let's take another look.
-Sure.

452
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,925
Is the demolition coming?

453
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,054
Yes, and I'm also working to nullify
the ruling for the Babel Chemicals' case.

454
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,851
The Namdongbu Prosecution has our back,
so we can just revoke it.

455
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,728
I like this about you.

456
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,316
You don't mind breaking promises
so brazenly.

457
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,610
There's nothing
as meaningless as a promise.

458
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,903
By the way,

459
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,700
I wonder why a competent woman like you
chose to work with me.

460
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,662
You could make a good living
if you started your own firm.

461
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,374
That's like taking a stroll
on a tiny hill in a village.

462
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,337
I like to live dangerously,
like I'm climbing an ice wall.

463
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,258
The kind of work where you risk
your life with every 50cm you climb.

464
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,890
I'll make sure to compensate you
handsomely for your ice climbing.

465
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,059
Thank you.

466
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,895
May I ask a question too?

467
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,813
Go ahead.

468
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:23,235
Why do you hide yourself
and run your business from the shadows?

469
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,324
One,

470
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,244
it's very exciting,
as if I'm playing a game.

471
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,663
Two,

472
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,792
to avoid jail when things go wrong.

473
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,836
Three,

474
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,463
it makes me feel like a god.

475
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,924
A god?

476
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,219
God enjoys making people suffer

477
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,847
while remaining hidden someplace.

478
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:57,478
Then he gives a couple of happy moments
to delude them into thinking

479
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,563
that life is worth living.

480
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,440
That's why this is so fun.

481
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,694
I personally like…

482
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,367
your third reason the most.

483
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,665
I wish to live that life too.

484
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,712
Cheers.

485
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,233
And after this…

486
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,443
One second.

487
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,071
-Coffee. Thanks.
-Thank you.

488
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,747
This is good.

489
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,749
I feel recharged.

490
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,712
Anyway, we're stuck
on the car with the false registry.

491
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,964
How do we find the killer?

492
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,969
By the way, do you think we can reach Babo
by finding the killer?

493
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,890
You know, bosses usually
give orders through many people.

494
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,393
My guess is, the explosion
at Jang Han-seo's vacation home,

495
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,020
<i>the murder of Prosecutor Seo,</i>

496
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,565
<i>Director Gil Jong-moon,
and the four people…</i>

497
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,110
-were all done by the same person.
-I agree.

498
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,946
Everything was covered up perfectly
as accidents or suicide.

499
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,948
It was the same for all of them.

500
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,994
Such orders
never go through too many people.

501
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,662
There will be one at the most.

502
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,875
I'm sure Babo is very close to the killer.

503
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,627
It's just that he's hard to find.

504
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,214
If we can't find them,
we'll make them come to us.

505
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,174
I don't think that's…

506
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,430
You mean, come to kill us?

507
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,350
They won't come to make friends with us.

508
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,523
It's a great idea,
but it does make me very nervous.

509
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,735
No matter how nervous you are,
that's the only way.

510
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,279
Public mockery
and an adequate amount of threat

511
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,324
will be the best way to provoke them
to come after us.

512
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,035
I'm the expert at that.

513
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,454
I'm sure I can make
the entire mankind angry.

514
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,211
Leave it. I bought the wrong ones.
They're all rotten.

515
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,921
Oops.

516
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,214
Mr. Cassano.

517
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,219
We have something to tell you.

518
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,558
Gi-seok told us

519
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,643
that Jipuragi is

520
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,063
putting up a tough fight
for the death of those four people.

521
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,906
We'll help you as a team.

522
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,950
If you need to fight, we'll fight.

523
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,577
We'll run errands if necessary.

524
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,870
-Yes.
-We can do just about everything.

525
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,998
The power of collective intelligence.

526
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,504
You can use us to resolve the case
and help us win.

527
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,341
The police and the prosecution
aren't on our side.

528
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,261
Then we should stick together.

529
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,512
-Yes.
-Right.

530
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,140
I can do everything.
I even played a zombie.

531
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,559
I'm up for anything if it's physical.

532
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:25,978
Mr. Cassano.

533
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:31,191
I'm good with computers and machines,
not just the piano.

534
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,819
Let me know if you need me.

535
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,865
We also don't just pray all day.

536
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,952
Buddhists in action.
That's the spirit of a true Buddhist monk.

537
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,040
-And I have a really loud voice.
-You do.

538
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,666
-I'm good at swearing.
-You are.

539
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,918
-And I'm strong too!
-Yes, you are.

540
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,005
I think we must resolve this situation
no matter what.

541
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,425
This is our Geumga Plaza
and also our gold.

542
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:04,642
What I meant was that
Geumga Plaza is as precious as gold.

543
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:09,063
Mr. Cassano!
Please be our leader and guide us!

544
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,189
Yes.

545
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,815
Don't be like this.

546
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,276
You should move to another building
as I suggested--

547
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,195
-No!
-Come on, this is our place!

548
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,238
-Don't say that.
-We aren't moving out.

549
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,239
Attention!

550
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,535
I can see how much they want to help us.

551
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,665
We need to handle that thing right away,
so why don't we work with them?

552
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,916
-What is it?
-What?

553
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,292
What needs to be handled?

554
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,169
-Tell us.
-What is it?

555
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,380
-Speak away.
-What do you need?

556
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,297
First of all,

557
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,592
let's make a mockery of them publicly.

558
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,593
-Mockery?
-Mockery?

559
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,095
-I'm good at that.
-Me too.

560
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,388
-It's what I do.
-Me too.

561
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,931
-I'm good at that.
-Yes.

562
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,933
-That's very annoying.
-Mocking people.

563
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,186
-Hey, go over there.
-Sir, please.

564
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,563
-Shouldn't we put this here?
-What about this?

565
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,232
KKABALRIEO TV

566
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,119
Come this way. I'm sorry.

567
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,454
-That way?
-What are they doing?

568
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,749
I don't know what it is, but it looks fun.

569
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,252
What are they doing?

570
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,390
Wait.

571
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,977
Is this really necessary?

572
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,313
It'll make them angrier.

573
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,983
Trust me.

574
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,902
You can do it, Vincenzo Cassano.

575
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:58,422
Hello, we are here to expose
the dirt on the corrupt authority figures.

576
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,008
I am the whistleblower, Opener.

577
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,554
WOW

<i>There are many irrational
and unfair things in this world.</i>

582
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,532
<i>It's all because of the law.</i>

583
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,162
<i>Actually, the law is not to blame.</i>

584
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:34,708
<i>It's all because of those bastards
who deal with the law.</i>

585
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:41,298
<i>The two organizations
we're about to blow the whistle on are</i>

586
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,719
the Babel Group and Law Firm Wusang.

587
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,600
These two are responsible
for many people's deaths,

588
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,478
<i>but they have not taken
any responsibility.</i>

589
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,439
And why? Because they have
the most powerful connection.

590
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,984
<i>The Seoul Namdongbu Prosecution Service
is looking after them.</i>

591
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,404
Starting today, we will expose

592
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,617
<i>the truth behind the cases
these two organizations have covered up.</i>

593
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,078
<i>We'll start
with the headquarters of corruption,</i>

594
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,456
<i>Babel Pharmaceuticals and Babel Chemicals,</i>

595
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,126
<i>including Babel's minion in law,</i>

596
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,129
<i>Law Firm Wusang.</i>

597
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,009
<i>There is this wicked lawyer at Wusang
who used to be a prosecutor,</i>

598
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,805
<i>and she works with thugs
instead of the law.</i>

599
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,140
<i>She doesn't study the book of law,</i>

600
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,227
<i>but she studies the numbers
of the thugs she knows.</i>

601
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,563
<i>And do you know what she always does?</i>

602
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,939
<i>What do you think?</i>

603
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,317
<i>She dances wherever
and whenever she likes!</i>

604
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,154
Awesome!

605
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,865
-What is that?
-It's just like her.

606
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:55,497
<i>And the CEO of that law firm?
He's busy sucking up to everyone.</i>

607

00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,092
I'll rip that mask in half. That…

611
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,510
<i>Chairman Jang Han-seo</i>

612
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,889
<i>can't distinguish between quotes from
Joseph Schumpeter and George Soros.</i>

613
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,933
<i>How can I put this?</i>

614
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,102
<i>He's a dimwit.</i>

615
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:22,024
<i>This dimwit's brain just sits there
as a buffer for his skull.</i>

616
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,615
<i>Babel is an organization
that buys everything with money.</i>

617
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:34,036
<i>Think of how incompetent he is
for him to buy everything with money.</i>

618
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,412
<i>Plans and negotiations?</i>

619
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,455
PLANS, NEGOTIATIONS

620
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,414
<i>Nonexistent.</i>

621
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:41,835
<i>It means he has

00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,504
<i>I think I might be smarter than he is!</i>

623
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,179
Okay.

624
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,890
Those assholes.

625
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,434
-Jeez.
-Unbelievable.

626
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,604
Don't let this get to you.

627
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,606
That's what they want from you.

628
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,982
What do you mean?

629
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,233
Vincenzo found out

630
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:09,529
you weren't the real chairman
when you two met at the gym.

631
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,615
-Then it means--
-Then is he

632
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,826
provoking us on purpose to lure you out?

633
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,037
No worries.

634
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,248
As long as there are no traitors among us…

635
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,048
he'll never be able to find me.

636
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,008
Never.

637
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,178
Hey! When did I ever dance like that?

638
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,847
-Stop pulling such crap!
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

639
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,557
That wasn't us.

640
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,936
Stop denying it.
Anyone could tell that it was you!

641
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,771
That ugly pigeon was Vincenzo!

642
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,193
<i>See that?</i>

643
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,863
See what?
I don't know what you're talking about.

644
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,534
You're unbelievably rude.
I'm hanging up on the count of three.

645
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,535
One, two!

646
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,539
How dare you hang up at two?
I'll get you, brat!

647
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,666
Come in!

648
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,335
Ms. Choi.

649
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:09,506
I just asked A-ing Tube
to take down their video.

650
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,175
But they can't take it down immediately.

651
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,387
I took down all the articles
and trending searches, though.

652
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,055
This is driving me insane.

653
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,644
Make sure you keep your eyes on it.

654
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:26,231
And do not respond in any way
no matter what they do.

655
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,066
-Be rational.
-I'll be rational.

656
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,693
-You may go.
-Sure.

657
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,574
That pigeon jerk!
I'll pluck out all of your feathers!

658
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,667
Anyway…

659
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,170
isn't this awful?

660
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,174
We exposed so much
while streaming for over two hours,

661
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,426
but no newspapers or tabloids
are talking about it.

662
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,970
That's how the truth turns into fake news.

663
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,016
Then they spread their fake news
and turn it into the truth.

664
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,519
Our goal isn't to move
the police or the media.

665
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,897
We want to find the killer or Babo.

666
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,733
I am certain that this will work,

667
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:13,695
because villains can deal with contempt,
but not mockery.

668
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,157
Let's move on to making that threat then.

669
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,594
-Hello.
-Hello, thanks for your hard work.

670
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,988
Hey! You! Hey!

671
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,015
What's going on? What is it?

672
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,895
What is it this time? You bastard!

673
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,939
What is that?

674
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,193
"C"?

675
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,238
Those assholes!

676
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,673
What's that?

677
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,260
It's a bomb.

678
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,137
I see. A bomb.

679
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,350
Why is it here?

680
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,478
Get rid of it.

681
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,189
You said it's a bomb!

682
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,358
-Get rid of it!
-Come over here!

683
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,152
Wait, why are you… Hey, wait!

684
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,029
This is cheating!

685
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,530
Why isn't anyone coming?

686
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,698
Hey, help me!

687
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,450
Wait!

688
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,827
Stop following me!

689
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,457
No, stop. Stop coming! Stop!

690
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,709
Please, stop! Stop right there!

691
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,544
Stop! Stop right there!

692
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,213
Oh, no. Oh, no!

693
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,255
No!

694
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,485
Damn it!

695
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,556
Did you arrive?

696
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,891
<i>Yes, I'm at Incheon Airport.</i>

697
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,060
<i>I'll see you in two hours.</i>

698
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,854
Okay.

699
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,533
Are you saying
they know your true identity?

700
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,035
Not yet.

701
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,412
If they knew, they would've made a move.

702
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,497
Still, it'll be a matter of time.

703
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,084
I'm sure it is.

704
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,881
Is that why you left the alphabet C
to make them feel more threatened?

705
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,799
If they found out about me,

706
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,093
then they'd know what that C means.

707
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,304
-What does the C mean?
-You c***!

708
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,140
That C.

709
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,018
I…

710
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,562
I knew that.

711
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,775
Mr. Cassano, you are unbelievably bold.
Even if you worked for the Ma--

712
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,869
Anyway, now we don't know
when they'll try to kill us.

713
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,039
So you need to hide somewhere else
other than Geumga Plaza.

714
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,499
What do you mean, hide?

715
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,959
-If we die, we die together.
-That's a bit…

716
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,633
Things may become really dangerous
if they send those killers here.

717
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,302
You can't pull that on me.
I'm staying no matter what.

718
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,519
We have this rock.

719
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,604
That's also a bit…

720
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,439
-Excuse me.
-My gosh.

721
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,608
-Who's he?
-Mr. Jung, the prosecutor.

722
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,318
-What?
-Prosecutor Jung!

723
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,611
Excuse me.

724
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,447
Mr. Nam, the whiteboard. Flip it over.

725
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,199
JANG HAN-SEO'S ACQUAINTANCES

726
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,125
Judge Heo's such a bastard!

727
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,921
He gave out warrants like parking tickets
when he played politics.

728
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,090
But he won't issue any
at a time like this!

729
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,680
So Director Gil's case was
also concluded as suicide.

730
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,765
This makes no sense.

731
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,102
He supposedly killed two investigators
and stabbed himself.

732
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,646
This doesn't even happen in movies.

733
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,691
We also think it makes no sense.

734
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,526
Anyway, what brings you here?

735
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,116
I want the four people's murder case,
which was covered up as suicides.

736
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,452
I'll share everything I know.

737
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,912
So I'd like you two to cooperate.

738
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,083
Thank you for your kind offer,

739
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,712
but we'll manage on our own, Mr. Jung.

740
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,339
You can trust me.

741
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,592
I'm different from those scumbags
back at the office.

742
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:54,596
We're well aware of that.
However, we're doing this our way.

743
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,598
Why can't you trust me?

744
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,641
It's not that we don't trust you.

745
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,145
We don't trust your organization.

746
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,315
I completely know
where you're coming from.

747
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,402
But there are many righteous judges
and prosecutors in our organization.

748
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,696
Please don't condemn everyone.

749
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,203
We have an apple here.

750
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,330
This side is…

751
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,585
This side is rotten.

752
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,505
And…

753
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,217
this side isn't.

754
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,969
It's half-rotten, half-edible.

755
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,471
Then is this apple

756
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,140
rotten or not?

757
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,769
-Sorry?
-We don't call this

758
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:46,689
a half-edible apple, but a rotten apple.

759
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,985
Although there are prosecutors like you
who aren't rotten,

760
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:54,322
in the end,
that organization is a rotten apple.

761
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,698
That's a huge leap of logic.

762
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,993
It's even worse than a rotten apple.

763
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,914
You can eat the apple
after cutting out the rotten part,

764
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,624
but you can't do that in your case.

765
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,212
You say most of the judges and prosecutors
are diligent and don't play politics.

766
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,589
You're correct. However…

767
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,218
defending them

768
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,846
won't make the rotten apple
fresh again, Mr. Jung.

769
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,473
The worst thing is

770
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,811
that the fresh part ends up
rotting in the end.

771
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,983
There's this famous quote
from <i>Les Misérables</i>.

772
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:36,281
"Justice is right
only when it's impeccable."

773
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,462
So he's one of the best consiglieres
in Italy?

774
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,340
Yes, he's a consigliere
both acknowledged and dreaded

775
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,801
by all of the Mafia families there.

776
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:01,139
And Vincenzo really did everything
I see in these photos?

777
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,515
It's the tip of the iceberg.

778
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,935
He's much more brutal than you think.

779
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,940
I knew something was wrong.

780
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,943
Hey, look.

781
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,903
Look at this.

782
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,785
That's what he did to a rival boss
when their family dealt drugs

783
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,162
and broke their agreement.

784
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,455
What happened to this guy?

785
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,998
You'll see in the next photo.

786
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,296
Hey, look.

787
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,136
This almost happened to you too.

788
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,555
Vincenzo totally let you off easy.

789
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:48,019
Hey, wait a second.
Then what does this alphabet C mean?

790
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:51,814
His initial, which he leaves as a warning
before he kills someone.

791
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,776
The C stands for "Cassano Family."

792
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:01,658
Does this mean that
Mr. Han, Ms. Choi and I will all…

793
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,872
Come to think about it, he's attacked us
a way the Mafia would all this time.

794
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,500
Terrorism, threats,
negotiation, mockery, and murder!

795
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,670
I was completely wrong.

796
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,756
Vincenzo wasn't just a sparring partner.

797
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,633
He's like Mayweather.

798
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,225
Will you let him go on
as a sparring partner?

799
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,268
Are you crazy?

800
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,813
I'll have to kill him.

801
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,898
Or he'll kill us.

802
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:18,443
Do you think it's okay to be wearing shoes
indoors?

803
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,570
I'm sorry. Just for today.

804
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,827
Could you please go home?
How many days has it been?

805
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,206
-My window isn't fixed yet.
-It is.

806
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:38,129
The guy who worked on it told me that day.
Did you forget that I ordered it?

807
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,297
Oh, right.

808
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,760
-Why did you act like you didn't know?
-It's not that.

809
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,263
Why do you keep coming to my place?

810
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,852
-Because I'm worried.
-Why?

811
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,771
How can I be at peace when you said

812
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,064
-you'd kill someone?
-You agreed to my decision.

813
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,733
I did, but still!

814
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,402
-One second.
-I…

815
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,990
-Hey, Joon-woo.
-Don't leave your feet there.

816
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,328
-I'm at Vincenzo's house.
-Why are you there?

817
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,454
Do you live together?

818
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,164
Stop talking nonsense. What?

819
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,042
<i>I'm at the cafe near the plaza.
Let's meet up.</i>

820
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,168
Right now?

821
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,379
Now's not a good time.

822
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,424
I have some information on Wusang.

823
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,425
Like what?

824
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,552
I'll tell you when you get here. Hurry.

825
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,387
Okay.

826
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,892
He has information on Wusang.

827
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,602
Really?

828
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,522
You should go then.

829
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,233
I'll call you if anything happens.

830
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,694
-Will you be okay alone?
-Yes.

831
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,656
I'll leave you alone for a bit.

832
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,493
Run, now. Run.

833
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,829
Go!

834
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,291
Mr. Nam, keep an eye on him
until I get back.

835
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,629
Ms. Hong, it's freezing.
May I please go home?

836
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,506
That's just in your head.

837
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,768
-Mr. Nam.
-Goodness.

838
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,395
One second, please.

839
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,400
Yes, sure. Thank you.
It's really cold. Very freezing.

840
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,570
We can't protect ourselves with <i>par terre</i>.

841
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,114
Tell me about it. You're an embarrassment.

842
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,992
I'm telling you,
<i>par terre</i> can be used for self-protection.

843
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:35,162
First off, hold down your opponent.
Get very close.

844
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:39,417
Then use your body weight
to turn him over.

845
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,587
He'll flip over like this.

846
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,089
And then keep flipping him over.

847
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,632
Until when?

848
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,259
Until he's out of his mind.

849
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:51,220
If you don't have enough space,
turn around.

850
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,139
What if I go out of my mind?

851
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,433
I'm not going out of my mind.

852
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,144
My tummy really hurts.

853
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,272
Mr. Tak, you aren't as athletic
as I thought you were.

854
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,815
You're stiff like a log.

855
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,484
He looks like
he has never moved a muscle before.

856
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,320
What do you mean? When I was younger--

857
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,115
My finger! No!

858
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,617
It looks painful for both parties.

859
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,747
It hurts so much without a mattress.

860
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,499
My tummy hurts. It really hurts.

861
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,390
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,149
Excuse me, wait.

864
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,569
Who are you people?

865
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,785
-Sir!
-Goodness!

866
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,120
-I'm bleeding!
-My master's enemy!

867
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,881
What's that?

868
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,553
Isn't that Toto?

869
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:19,100
It is him. What's going on?

870
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,186
-My gosh.
-Hey, Yeong-ho!

871
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,939
And this is

872
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:30,653
where the four innocent victims were
thought to be kidnapped.

873
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,531
The top whistleblower of our channel,

874
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,784
Inzaghi is headed
to this underpass right now.

875
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,413
Inzaghi will arrive there shortly

876
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:44,750
and expose a shocking truth
through the live stream.

877
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,338
We're counting on you, Inzaghi.

878
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,343
That's good.

879
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,723
Call the police
if I don't call in an hour.

880
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,059
Will you really not tell Ms. Hong?

881
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,020
No. I made her leave to keep it secret.

882
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,272
What if something bad happens to you?

883
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,150
I'll be fine.
You can upload that right now.

884
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:10,609
-Please hurry. Hurry.
-I…

885
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:32,006
-You can't do this.
-Please calm down.

886
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,132
WARNING FOR ALL TENANTS

887
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,468
-You need to stop!
-You can't do this!

888
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,928
-Are you thugs?
-Goodness.

889
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,806
-Look at him.
-My goodness. What happened?

890
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,016
Are you all right?

891
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,187
How dare you draw a baton?

892
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,189
-Don't do it.
-I'll kill you all.

893
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:50,441
Don't forget
about the promise you made to me.

894
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:52,943
Darn it.

895
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,030
You startled us.

896
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,741
Why did you break that window?

897
01:07:58,824 --> 01:07:59,867
My goodness.

898
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,244
This time, something doesn't feel right.

899
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,747
These people look different.

900
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,958
Yes, they look much tougher
than Park Seok-do and his men.

901
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,126
Hey!

902
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,257
-Who are these jerks?
-Come.

903
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,176
What are you doing here?

904
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,345
Right.

905
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,848
Are you the new men who took over our job?

906
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,683
Look at them.

907
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,269
Are you an idol group?

908
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,730
Why are you wearing matching clothes?

909
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,191
Look at this guy's eyes.

910
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,568
I'm done with that life.

911
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,529
I'm a tenant here now, so go.

912
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,696
Go away. Go.

913
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,700
You jerks!

914
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,290
-Let me go!
-You jerks!

915
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,000
-Darn it.
-Don't.

916
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,631
-Su-nam.
-Yes?

917
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,174
They're the Twin Swords Gang.

918
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,593
What? The Twin Swords Gang?

919
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,351
Go away. They're the Twin Swords Gang.

920
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,228
-What?
-The Twin what?

921
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,187
-What?
-No idea.

922
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,189
My gosh, where is he going?

923
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:13,983
What's the time?

924
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,237
-Hey, run! Run!
-Why?

925
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,573
-Run for your life!
-Just run!

926
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,241
I knew they'd do that.

927
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,160
Move out in two days, by the morning.

928
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,286
If you don't--

929
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,246
Stop talking nonsense.

930
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,414
It's legally--

931
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,501
If you don't,

932
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,461
we'll go ahead and kick you out.

933
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:38,215
We won't care whether it's legal or not.
We won't go easy on you.

934
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,134
The police won't help you.

935
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,677
We'll kill you all!

936
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,471
Why do you have to use violence?

937
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,892
-No, stop that!
-Oh, no!

938
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,603
-Move aside!
-No!

939
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,146
-No.
-What are you doing?

940
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,315
-You bitch!
-Oh, no!

941
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,376
What? Did that hurt?

942
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,629
Don't be such a baby.

943
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,131
It only went in this far.

944
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,425
You'd be gone if I pushed it in.

945
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:22,635
Mr. Tak.

946
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,540
Man, this isn't right.

947
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,919
I swore to use these only to cut fabric.

948
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:04,218
Leave now, or I'll slit your necks.

949
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,972
Mr. Tak, you're so cool.

950
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,224
Let's go.

951
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:16,897
Mi-ri, are you okay?

952
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:19,483
Yes.

953
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,753
<i>Inzaghi will arrive there shortly</i>

954
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:43,215
<i>and expose a shocking truth
through the live stream.</i>

955
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:55,978
Hey.

956
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,482
Don't come to the plaza. Go to
the underpass where you abducted them.

957
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:09,533
I wanted to watch him in action,
but he went somewhere else.

958
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,371
Cha-young, over here!

959
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,792
What is it?

960
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,753
Discussing work already? Take a breath.

961
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:21,795
Hurry up and say it.

962
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:24,965
Let's eat first,

963
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,009
then we'll talk about it later--

964
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,303
Do you want to die? Tell me now.

965
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,430
What's the information?

966
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,024
I don't have any.

967
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,194
I haven't seen you for long, so I lied.

968
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:46,653
-Hey!
-My gosh.

969
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,322
How could you lie about that?

970
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:51,075
This isn't a good time
for me to humor you.

971
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,035
Yes, Mr. Nam.

972
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,747
Mr. Cassano went out to lure the killers.

973
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,499
-What?
<i>-That's why</i>

974
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,085
I'm going to follow Mr. Cassano.

975
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,669
Why are you telling me this now?

976
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:06,173
Wait a minute.
I forgot he told me not to tell you.

977
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,218
My mouth isn't usually this big,
but it just slipped out.

978
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,970
Whatever.
I'll meet you in front of the plaza.

979
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,056
What's wrong? What is it?

980
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:17,059
Something bad might happen to Mr. Cassano.

981
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,521
I'll come with you! Cha-young, your bag!

982
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:21,522
What?

983
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,775
-My car key.
-I'll drive you. I drove here.

984
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:26,151
You can't drive like this.

985
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,194
Let's go.

986
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,951
-Hello, Mr. Jang.
-Hey.

987
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,327
You're taking his car?

988
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,246
He can get us there in half an hour.

989
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,123
-Hop in.
-Yes, okay.

990
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,874
Get in.

991
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,045
Why is Mr. Lee here?

992
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:48,132
He's a master of breaking people's necks.

993
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,551
-Your first love?
-An Seong-eun.

994
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,344
-Your treasure?
-My bike, Cheetah.

995
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,888
I thought he could be helpful.

996
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:59,309
I'll take care of the killers
as soon as we arrive.

997
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,857
-Let's go, Joon-woo.
-Let's take off.

998
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,154
There were more than two of you
as expected.

999
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,241
Thanks for coming together.

1000
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,039
Bugs are easier to kill

1001
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,083

1002
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:48,604
<i>The person you have called
cannot come to the phone right now.</i>

1003
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,772
<i>Please, try again later.</i>

1004
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,402
<i>The person you have called…</i>

1005
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,538
<i>The person you have called

1006
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,418

01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,802
Who is this chairman?

1009
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:03,512
I don't know.

1010
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,108
I'm not asking you the third time.
Tell me.

1011
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,016
I was scared to death.

1012
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,061
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1013
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,230
That's what technology is for.

1014
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:22,025
I didn't want to put you in danger. Sorry.

1015
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,237
And what if I am?

1016
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,115
We're partners,
so we should share the danger.

1017
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,828
-You really piss me off.
-Ms. Hong.

1018
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,081
The real boss behind Babel.

1019
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:38,917
I know who it is.

1020
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:41,837
