1
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,167
No.

2
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:21,586
No.

3
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,961
Ms. Hong.

4
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,132
Ms. Hong.

5
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,680
Please stop.

6
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:15,557
Let go.

7
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,686
You really…

8
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,064
shouldn't have been born.

9
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,066
Never.

10
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,236
You scum.

11
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:03,021
Han-seo…

12
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,732
Damn it!

13
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:59,494
The address is
49-8, Yeonseo-dong, Sangun-gu.

14
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,415
Two people got shot. Please hurry.

15
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,209
-Ms. Hong.
-Mr. Cassano.

16
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:09,713
Vincenzo.

17
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:22,684
Are you okay?

18
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:25,270
I…

19
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,108
did well, didn't I?

20
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,276
You did.

21
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,862
You deserve to be my brother.

22
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:41,703
For the first time…

23
00:04:42,871 --> 00:04:43,997
in my life…

24
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,876
I've helped someone.

25
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,551
Hey.

26
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,431
You know what to do.

27
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:09,773
Thank you…

28
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,445
for everything.

29
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,528
EPISODE 20

30
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,306
I paid for this private room.

31
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:53,561
I paid for your room for ten days.

32
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,113
Does it hurt a lot?

33
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:08,576
Now I know what it feels like…

34
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,580
to get shot.

35
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,256
Your muscles are damaged,

36
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,426
so you can't move your shoulder
for the time being.

37
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:31,516
Excuse me.

38
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,726
Sorry.

39
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,986
You blamed yourself all night, didn't you?

40
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:47,198
For what happened.

41
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,585
We were fighting in a war together,
and I happened to get shot.

42
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,337
It's not your fault.

43
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,426
Now that I've woken up,

44
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,637
don't worry about me,

45
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:12,265
and go finish the job.

46
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:15,351
Okay.

47
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:19,063
I'll be done within 24 hours.

48
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:24,944
After that…

49
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,617
You'll be leaving.

50
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:42,920
Then…

51
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,302
I guess this is our last night together.

52
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:58,436
I'll keep my promise.

53
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,316
Once you're done,

54
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,862
leave immediately without calling me.

55
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,491
Do you understand?

56
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:56,369
BABEL'S CHAIRMAN JANG MURDERS BROTHER
AND ATTEMPTS TO MURDER A LAWYER

57
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,679
Vincenzo.

58
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,684
I'm relieved that Ms. Hong is recovering.

59
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:22,478
What is this, the Wild West?
Why shoot a gun?

60
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,148
Mr. Park, should I get a gun, too?

61
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:28,401
I was an excellent marksman
in the military.

62
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,280
I bet you were the biggest clown
in your barracks at best.

63
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:35,158
Hey. Fighting is
all about mental strength.

64
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:39,370
At least he's now
officially a wanted criminal.

65
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:41,289
He has nowhere to run now.

66
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:44,292
That dirty little bastard.

67
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:48,546
We all fought against him
without giving up,

68
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:50,089
and it finally paid off.

69
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,258
We're not who we used to be.

70
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:57,221
Whoever messes with us
will have their hair pulled out.

71
00:11:58,848 --> 00:11:59,807
Sorry.

72
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,435
Let them come.

73
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,813
I'll make sure no one leaves here
in one piece.

74
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:09,650
We should stay strong
and help the lawyers until the end.

75
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,986
I'll put my practice on hold for now

76
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,572
and fight alongside you.

77
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:18,701
I'll fight with all my might
for Mr. Cassano.

78
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,994
Bring it on.

79
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,543
How long will it take to unlock it?

80
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:31,631
It depends on the model,
but three to four hours at most.

81
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,758
I'll have an expert
work on it immediately.

82
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,676
Thank you.

83
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,388
And take this.

84
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:43,142
It's the Guillotine file.

85
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:46,604
Consigliere.

86
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:50,691
Discuss how best to use it
with Director Tae.

87
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,235
I have a copy too.

88
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:56,822
Thank you so much.

89
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,786
I will use it
for the justice of this country.

90
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,208
Rather than that,
use it to trample on your enemy.

91
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,543
Pardon?

92
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:11,170
Here's how a villain thinks.

93
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:13,422
Enemies I'm the least afraid of are…

94
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:18,177
politicians and government officials
who only talk about justice.

95
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:22,974
Talking about justice
doesn't bring about justice.

96
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,477
These are the people
that I'm most afraid of.

97
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,355
Pizzeria owners standing outside my house

98
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:32,900
with baseball bats
because I raised the protection money.

99
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:38,406
Keep that in mind.

100
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,456
I will make sure…

101
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,835
to follow your teaching, Consigliere.

102

105
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,895
and taken into detention.

106
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:12,023
It seems like everything's finally ready.

107
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:14,901
Should I sign here?

108
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,571
Embarrassment is only momentary.

109
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,449
Staying alive is more important.

110
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,201
I'm going to the detention center.

111
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:25,912

VINCENZO

113
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:30,333
Gosh, that startled me. Goodness.

114
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,423
Darn it. It's so noisy.

115
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:39,634
What is it?

116
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:42,678
Let me tell you how you can survive.

117
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:47,183
Hold on.

118
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,852
-Excuse me for one second.
-Sure.

119
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:55,816

I won't tell you again.

124
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:09,747
Get Choi Myung-hee out
within three hours at all costs,

00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,377
Hey! How can I trust you?

127
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,756
You're going to kill me, too, aren't you?

128
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:21,550
You'd already be dead
if I wanted to kill you.

129
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,096
When you left the restaurant two days ago

130
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,140
or when you were at the driving range
yesterday.

131
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:29,475
How did you…

132
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:30,977
Hurry if you want to live.

133
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,981
Hold on.
Do you promise you'll spare my life?

134
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,191
-Yes.
-Thank you.

135
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:38,275
I'll…

136
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:32,455
Just do what I told you to do.

137
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:33,748

The Namdongbu Office
cleared you of all charges.

under the threat of death
from Chairman Jang.

How did they find the evidence?

Yes.

170
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:33,659
Congratulations on your release.

171
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,830
Today is your last day.

172
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:39,373
CHOI MYUNG-HEE

173
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,964
Han Seung-hyuk, that scumbag.

174
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:20,456
It seems like she's heading to Wusang.

175
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,208
Watch her from a distance.

176
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,668
Call me if she heads somewhere remote.

177
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:26,962
She might be meeting up
with Jang Han-seok.

178
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,172
Yes, sir.

179
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,741
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

180
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,077
Call this number when you're released.

181
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,628
How did you get out so soon?

182
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:11,048
Han Seung-hyuk sold me out to Vincenzo

183
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:12,383
to save his own ass.

184
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,386
I'm not surprised.

185
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:19,431
You and I shouldn't meet.

186
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,351
There might be a trap.

187
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:26,230
You're right.

188
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:30,109
First, go to my place
and sort out my property.

189
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,904
I'll text you where my laptop is
and bank passwords.

190
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,741
And wire five billion to your account.

191
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:40,369
Thank you.

192
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,872
What's your plan?

193
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,208
I'm going to stow away after midnight.

194
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,168
I'm going to Mexico.

195
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:50,462
You should also

196
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:53,382
hide somewhere far away.

197
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,843
Okay. Be careful.

198
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,865
We've unlocked it. Check the phone.

199
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,705
It seems like he's heading to Seocho-dong.

200
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:27,374
-You can see this too, right?
-Yes.

201
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,793
I can see it on my laptop as well.

202
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:31,211
Then keep me posted.

203
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:32,963
Okay.

204
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,961
Time to get going.

205
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:40,531
My, look at all the reporters.

206
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:44,034
-Hello.
-Hello. Nice to see you all.

207
00:22:44,118 --> 00:22:45,619
Can we talk?

208
00:22:45,702 --> 00:22:47,579
What do you want to know this time?

209
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,581
Hold on. Step aside for a moment.

210
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:51,875
There are rumors going around

211
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,711
about you and Jang Han-seok‚
who is on the run.

212
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,508
Turn off your recorders and cameras

213
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:01,510
so I can talk comfortably.

214
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:03,554
All right.

215
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:06,056
Listen up.

216
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,852
He was my client,
and I was his attorney. That's all.

217
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,396
A long time ago, at that.

218
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:16,900
But isn't it true that Wusang helped
Babel with their illegal activities?

219
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:18,902
Not Wusang.

220
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:22,447
It was Ms. Choi's personal decision.

221
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,033
To think how much trouble
that caused for Wusang.

222
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:28,704
Excuse me a second.

223
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:31,456
Han Seung-hyuk speaking.

224
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,417
Looks like you're having fun.

225
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:37,087
-What's going on?
-Who is it?

226
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,632
Mr. Han, this is not acceptable.

227
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:43,010
What do you mean?

228
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:45,846
You should've remained respectful to me.

229
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:50,934
I don't think you're in the position
to say that.

230
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,021
Go keep my brother company.

231
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,063
What?

232
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,779
Get him. Get that bastard!

233
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:05,574
Let's go.

234
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,242
Step back!

235
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:51,203
The Chief Prosecutor is dead.

236
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:53,789
-What?
-Two guys suddenly stabbed him.

237
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:57,417
-Were they holding a grudge?
-I'm not sure what just happened.

238
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,795
-Step back!
-Move!

239
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:11,306
-Take him inside.
-Step back.

240
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,535
Around 3:30 p.m. today,

241
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:34,496
Chief Prosecutor Han Seung-hyuk
was attacked by two men and died

242
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:37,040
in front of the Namdongbu
Prosecutor's Office.

243
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:40,544
The police are tracking down the van
that the two men disappeared in.

244
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:44,423
Based on the CCTV camera footage
and the witness statements,

245
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:46,091
the police are…

246
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:48,635
Jang Han-seok must've hired some men

247
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:50,721
as his mercenaries.

248
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:54,182
I hope Mr. Cassano

249
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,227
stays safe.

250
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:01,398
Mr. Nam.

251
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:07,195
No one can kill Vincenzo Cassano.

252
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:08,739
You know that.

253
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:46,193
Hello, Mr. Cho.

254
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:47,986
Are you after Chairman Jang?

255
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:49,404
Yes.

256
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,199
But he's disappeared from the GPS.

257
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:55,494
He must've gone underground
where there's no reception.

258
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,331
I think I know
where Choi Myung-hee is heading.

259
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:01,083
Where?

260
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:11,051
You finished off Han Seung-hyuk
like a scene from a movie.

261
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:15,680
I wanted to give him
the dramatic end he deserved.

262
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:18,183
I've switched the main bank account.

263
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:21,645
I've also wired some money
to the borrowed-name account for you.

264
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,064
Thank you. You should leave immediately.

265
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:02,519
Security!

266
00:28:02,602 --> 00:28:04,062
Security!

267
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,323
Don't be a fool.

268
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,051
Are you looking for this?

269
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:44,060
How could they be so useless
when I paid a fortune?

270
00:28:44,144 --> 00:28:47,355
When you're facing a predator,
it's better to hide than run.

271
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,607
Why are you so reckless?

272
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,485
I didn't know that.

273
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,488
I've always been a predator myself.

274
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:01,828
The money you wired to Jang Han-seok
will be used for a good cause.

275
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:10,003
It's been intercepted and sent
to a place that needs it.

276
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:29,773
You've made a fool of me
on so many levels.

277
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:34,486
That's my number-one specialty,

278
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:36,446
next to killing.

279
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:39,741
Let me just finish this.

280
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,409
Then you can kill me.

281
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,460
Aren't you…

282
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:55,173
more of a Zumba person than a beer person?

283
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,425
Right?

284
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:04,558
I will…

285
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,019
let you dance all you want.

286
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,361
So Ms. Choi, the CEO of Wusang,
was abducted in that car?

287
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:19,906
Yes. Her guards who were on standby
in the parking lot reported it.

288
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,116
Who are the abductors?

289
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,118
One of them hasn't been identified,

290
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,453
but the other is Vincenzo Cassano,

291
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:27,747
a member of the Italian Mafia.

292
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:30,333
-Why would a Mafia member…
-I'm not sure.

293
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,960
Anyway, Ms. Choi is the attorney

294
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:35,088
for Jang Han-seok
who is currently on the run.

295
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,509
And the late Han Seung-hyuk
was the former CEO of Wusang.

296
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:44,097
There's something fishy about it.
They must be related in some way.

297
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,601
Put out an APB on the Mafia member
and track him down along with Jang.

298
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:50,687
Also, secure footage from Namdongbu
and Ms. Choi's apartment.

299
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,938
Yes, sir.

300
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,891
Don't even try to stand up.
It'll only add to the pain.

301
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,064
Kill me already.

302
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:36,358
Stop messing around.

303
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,867
What are you going to do with me next?

304
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:49,621
I told you.
I won't let you die comfortably.

305
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,959
What difference does it make
if you kill me?

306
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:57,587
Think about it.
Will it bring peace to the world?

307
00:31:58,338 --> 00:32:01,341
Or will it leave a meaningful message?

308
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:03,468
No way.

309
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,763
It makes no difference whatsoever.

310
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:12,560
Like you said, I'm just a scumbag
who was killed by another scumbag.

311
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,235
No matter how cleverly you kill me,

312
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:25,532
you're a scumbag like me all the same.

313
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:27,659
Not at all.

314
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:29,953
How so?

315
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,580
I'd love to hear how.

316
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,710
I am Vaisravana

317
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,170
who leads yakshas and rakshasas.

318
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:40,922
What are you talking about?

319
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:45,969
Are you joking?

320
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:50,724
It seems like our conversation is
making you less afraid of death.

321
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:28,928
Don't tell me this is…

322
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:41,816
You'll feel an intense pain
from beginning to end.

323
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,942
No.

324
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:46,905
You're going way too far.
Don't you think so, Vincenzo?

325
00:33:46,988 --> 00:33:51,117
This isn't right. Didn't you say
you never harm women and children?

326
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:53,244
To me, you're not a woman.

327
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:55,538
You're just a monster…

328
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,250
driven by desires.

329
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:02,670
No.

330
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,924
This isn't right. There are other ways.

331
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:07,133
Use a gun.

332
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:09,886
Shoot me. Just shoot me!

333
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,054
Shoot me!

334
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,309
No, no. I'm sorry.

335
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:18,770
Get back here!

336
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:21,356
Vincenzo!

337
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,076
Mr. An, do we have a signal on Jang?

338
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,245
Yes, we have him again.

339
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:20,123
He's heading towards the Seobu Expressway.

340
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:22,167
It's far from where you are,

341
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,752
so I've sent a team to follow him.

342
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,087
I'll catch up soon.

343
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:28,673
Tell them to be careful
because Jang Han-seok has a gun.

344
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:30,925
And the police have put out an APB on you.

345
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,720
So you should move quickly.

346
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:35,805
I understand.

347
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,358
He's getting farther and farther away.
Step on it!

348
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:49,569
I'm going as fast as I can.

349
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,404
There's too many people. That's why.

350
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:53,823
That's ridiculous.
This isn't a cultivator.

351
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:56,576
We were in second gear. Sorry.

352
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,578
-Gosh!
-Seriously!

353
00:35:58,661 --> 00:35:59,954
Damn it.

354
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:01,414
Let me switch to third gear.

355
00:36:01,497 --> 00:36:03,082
We're going to lose him!

356
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,293
-Third. Good now?
-Good.

357
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,753
Good. Here we go. Third gear.

358
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:08,963
Switching to fourth gear.

359
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:34,280
Look at you guys. Why are you so down?

360
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:36,866
This isn't right for a chairman
of a conglomerate.

361
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,785
-How embarrassing.
-All right.

362
00:36:38,868 --> 00:36:41,496
Let's get it on by the sea!

363
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:19,701
Don't resist.
You'll only be choked even harder.

364
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:32,672
Stop it, you bastard! That's enough!

365
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:33,756
Put down the knife!

366
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:37,969
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

367
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,418
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

368
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,754
Mr. Lee! What should we do?

369
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:14,213
-Call 911 right now.
-Okay.

370
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:15,673
Hang in there.

371
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:17,467
Help will arrive soon.

372
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,635
Hello? Is this 911?

373
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,388
I'm calling from Geumjo Port.

374
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:26,726
Someone has been stabbed. Please hurry.

375
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,144
That son of a bitch.

376
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:37,820
Mr. Lee.

377
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:40,907
We caught him…

378
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:42,867
right?

379
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:45,787
Yes, we did.

380
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,624
Don't hand him over to the police.

381
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:54,170
Make sure to punish him yourself.

382
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:59,050
Okay. Don't talk anymore.

383
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:02,512
Once Dal-rae…

384
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:05,390
is born,

385
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,226
I wanted…

386
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:15,024
to ask you to be her godfather.

387
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:18,569
Okay.

388
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:22,407
I'll do that. I'll be her godfather.

389
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:24,617
You…

390
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:29,622
You promised. Keep your promise.

391
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,668
Okay?

392
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,424
Of course.

393
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:41,634
I will.

394
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,803
Thank…

395
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,431
Thank you.

396
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:50,560
Mr. Lee.

397
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:52,228
Mr. Lee.

398
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,022
Mr. Lee.

399
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:56,899
Hurry!

400
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:58,568
Let me help him.

401
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:00,820
Mr. Lee, raise your right leg.

402
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,157
-I'll raise it, okay?
-Mr. Lee, don't close your eyes.

403
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,450
Hang in there.

404
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,285
What should we do?

405
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:08,202
No!

406
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:09,787
Don't touch it.

407
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,998
-Never.
-Do you even know what you're doing?

408
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:15,084
I used to be a surgical nurse.
The White Angel of Geumga-dong!

409
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:18,379
Hang in there. Don't talk to me.

410
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:29,182
Almost done. Hang in there.

411
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:39,609
That's not 911. It's the police.

412
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:05,801
See you again, Consigliere.

413
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,054
Thank you for everything.

414
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:10,056
Be safe.

415
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:16,562
Go on, now.

416
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,023
Go.

417
00:41:46,384 --> 00:41:49,470
Stop the SUV. We'll fire if you don't.

418
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:53,099
Stop the SUV. We'll fire if you don't.

419
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:02,942
-What are you doing?
-We have a patient.

420
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:04,777
-Move your car!
-What are you doing?

421
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,029
-Move it.
-We have a patient here!

422
00:42:07,113 --> 00:42:08,531
Move your car!

423
00:42:08,614 --> 00:42:10,366
-Move it!
-Someone's hurt.

424
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:26,173
Okay.

425
00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:34,890
He escaped safely.

426
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:41,689
And he has Chairman Jang with him.

427
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:45,901
Things will finally come to an end.

428
00:42:51,532 --> 00:42:52,658
Ms. Hong.

429
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,373
Mr. Lee is…

430
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:08,716
What about him?

431
00:44:04,313 --> 00:44:05,981
How did you find me?

432
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:09,568
Your brother told me.

433
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,737
What?

434
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:18,327
Hey, do you want to hear
something interesting?

435
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:22,331
On the morning of the inauguration,

436
00:44:22,415 --> 00:44:25,376
Han-seok suddenly gave me a watch
as a gift.

437
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:26,377
Okay.

438
00:44:27,086 --> 00:44:28,921
And matching watches at that.

439
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:31,048
He's not the type to do that.

440
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:39,890
So I found it suspicious
and disassembled it.

441
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,270
Guess what I found.

442
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:47,898
An expert said that it was a tracker.

443
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:51,068
A tracker? So what did you do?

444
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,737
I put it in his watch without his knowing.

445
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:56,866
And I didn't wear mine.

446
00:44:57,616 --> 00:45:02,997
Also, I downloaded an app
that can track him whenever I want.

447
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,583
It was quite expensive. Was I ripped off?

448
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:09,211
But why are you tracking him?

449
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:13,132
I'm certain that
he'll do something horrible again soon.

450
00:45:13,716 --> 00:45:15,593
Then he'll run away like always.

451
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:18,721
Even when he killed his friends
in middle school,

452
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:21,348
my father sent him away
so no one could find him.

453
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:25,519
Had he been punished then,

454
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,606
he may not have turned out this way.

455
00:45:33,694 --> 00:45:36,822
But doesn't he change watches every day?
What's the use?

456
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,949
That's why I put trackers in all of them.

457
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:42,661
-What?
-I tend to be foolish like that.

458
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:52,588
In the end, he was right.

459
00:45:56,634 --> 00:46:00,137
He's damn useless until the very end.

460
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:09,522
By the way,

461
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:13,192
what is this toy?

462
00:46:19,031 --> 00:46:22,660
I learned it from the Russian Mafia
when I visited Russia.

463
00:46:24,286 --> 00:46:26,080
It's called kop'yo iskuplen'ya.

464
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:33,295
"The spear of atonement."

465
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:46,308
Do you really think
I'll atone for my sins?

466
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:48,811
I couldn't care less.

467
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:51,981
As long as you're in pain, I'm happy.

468
00:46:52,064 --> 00:46:54,233
You should've just killed me
back at the port.

469
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,860
I always keep my word.

470
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:02,449
Do you remember everything
I've told you until now?

471
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:12,710
Wait.

472
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,297
I'm glad you seem to remember.

473
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:24,597
What is this?

474
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:38,360
The spear of atonement
will pierce by 5mm every 5 minutes.

475
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:41,071
You'll feel lightheaded
from all the blood loss,

476
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:42,781
and feel excruciating pain.

477
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:46,160
Around tomorrow noon,

478
00:47:47,453 --> 00:47:50,164
it'll pierce your lung,
and you'll die instantly.

479
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:53,417
Vincenzo.

480
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:57,171
Aren't we both businessmen?

481
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,840
I have many great offers to make.

482
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:03,594
You don't need to resort
to such barbaric acts!

483
00:48:03,677 --> 00:48:05,971
-Please.
-Barbaric acts?

484
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:07,890
Yes.

485
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:14,355
This world has always been barbaric.

486
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,778
I'll give you all the money I have.

487
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:21,945
So, please…

488
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:24,448
If that's not enough,

489
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:27,034
you can cut off one of my limbs.

490
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:30,120
Sparing me isn't that difficult, right?

491
00:48:30,913 --> 00:48:32,206
It's not.

492
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,751
But I don't want to.

493
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,014
It hasn't been five minutes yet!

494
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:53,143
I've controlled it manually for now.

495
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:55,646
I'll switch it back to auto.

496
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:00,025
Vincenzo. Please.

497
00:49:01,026 --> 00:49:03,153
Vincenzo, this isn't you.

498
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:07,449
Just shoot me in the head, okay?

499
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,619
Just shoot me! Shoot!

500
00:49:11,286 --> 00:49:13,706
Please… Vincenzo.

501
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:15,416
Go apologize to your brother.

502
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:23,757
Please…

503
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:25,718
I'll keep this as a trophy.

504
00:49:28,053 --> 00:49:28,929
Vincenzo…

505
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:30,764
Vincenzo.

506
00:49:32,266 --> 00:49:33,475
Hey!

507
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,271
Just shoot me! Kill me now!

508
00:49:54,955 --> 00:49:58,125
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

509
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:05,424
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

510
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:23,358
POWER OFF

511
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:06,735
I'm sorry I'm late.

512
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:08,904
I've lured the investigation team
to Busan.

513
00:51:09,404 --> 00:51:10,948
Here. It's a Korean passport.

514
00:51:12,366 --> 00:51:14,451
You must board within the next 30 minutes.

515
00:51:14,535 --> 00:51:17,287
Until then, your background check
and face recognition

516
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:19,289
will be linked to that photo.

517
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:22,793
After 30 minutes,
the data will be linked to you, so hurry.

518
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:25,128
Thank you.

519
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:28,507
You should thank Director Tae, not us.

520
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,093
I see. Please tell him I said thank you.

521
00:51:31,677 --> 00:51:32,845
If you can't come back…

522
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:38,517
do give us a call someday.

523
00:51:41,895 --> 00:51:43,021
Thank you,

524
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:44,189
Let's go.

525
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:12,426
Mr. Cassano.

526
00:52:16,388 --> 00:52:17,681
You shouldn't move around.

527
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:18,974
I'm okay.

528
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:22,019
I'm glad I got to see you.

529
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,146
You should go now.

530
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:27,316
There will be a lot of headaches for you
after I leave.

531
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:29,735
I can handle that.

532
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:53,842
Goodbye.

533
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,934
Be safe.

534
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,896
I'll get going.

535
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:08,649
Hurry.

536
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:16,156
Thank you for everything.

537
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,618
Goodbye, Mr. Nam.

538
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,496
Sir, we have no time.

539
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:23,325
It's been a month since Lawyer C,
a former Italian Mafia member

540
00:55:23,408 --> 00:55:25,160
charged with kidnapping Lawyer Choi

541
00:55:25,243 --> 00:55:27,204
and Babel's Chairman Jang,
has been at large.

542
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:30,791
The police inspected all domestic ports
in case he'd try to stow away,

543
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:33,460
but they have failed to find
any trace of him.

544
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:37,047
Believing the suspect to be
hiding in the country,

545
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,092
the police have decided to reinforce…

546
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,474
In our vineyard,
you can buy or lease a single row

547
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:50,143
and tend to it on the weekends.

548
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:55,482
The rows with name tags on them
are already taken.

549
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,526
To top it all off,

550
00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:01,446
you'll be able to make wine
with grapes you grow yourself.

551
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:06,785
Our vineyard has a winery
that you can use as well.

552
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:09,955
Would you like to take a look?

553
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:11,414
-Okay.
-Okay.

554
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:13,500
Let's go over there, sweetie.

555
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,044
It's the fertilizing season.

556
00:56:16,128 --> 00:56:18,755
We've weeded out the soil,
so it's quite mushy.

557
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:20,340
-Be careful.
-Okay.

558
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:23,176
LEE JIN-A

559
00:56:44,406 --> 00:56:46,908
I'll try my best to make wine
out of these cheap grapes.

560
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,210
1 YEAR LATER

561
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,464
-Wasn't his kick amazing?
-I agree.

562
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:03,341
-It was a 360-degree spin.
-He's totally into it these days.

563
00:57:03,425 --> 00:57:05,594
That's exactly why
you don't get good grades.

564
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:07,345
You should study more like I do.

565
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,222
-I'm smarter than you.
-That's not true.

566
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:10,974
-You're wrong.
-I'm smarter than you.

567
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,684
I got a higher score last time.

568
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,811
-That was once.
-Still…

569
00:57:16,688 --> 00:57:18,565
But I do usually get better grades.

570
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:20,150
That's true.

571
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:22,527
But not that much.

572
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:25,447
BABEL AND ALL ITS SUBSIDIARIES
TO GO INTO RECEIVERSHIP

573
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,449
Gosh, they're all so boring.

574
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,577
-Let's go watch a movie.
-Which one?

575
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,995
Let's think on our way there.

576
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:33,872
Let's check out the posters there.

577
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:39,419
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

578
00:57:59,898 --> 00:58:02,108
Currently, Sangcheon-gu

579
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:06,947
is the poorest borough in the city.

580
00:58:07,572 --> 00:58:12,452
Stopping the redevelopment
around Geumga Plaza

581
00:58:12,536 --> 00:58:15,956
is a flagrant decision made
by the government

582
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:20,418
that blocks your ownership rights.

583
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:23,380
I, candidate three Kim Seok-u,

584
00:58:24,339 --> 00:58:26,383
will restart the redevelopment plans

585
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:31,346
and make Sangcheon-gu a wealthy borough!

586
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:33,265
Everyone!

587
00:58:33,348 --> 00:58:35,016
SANGCHEON-GU'S FUTURE
KIM SEOK-U

588
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,309
Kim Seok-u!

589
00:58:36,393 --> 00:58:39,354
-Kim Seok-u!
-Kim Seok-u!

590
00:58:39,437 --> 00:58:42,399
-Kim Seok-u!
-Kim Seok-u!

591
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:45,360
Are you sure it's the borough
that'll become rich?

592
00:58:59,624 --> 00:59:00,458
Or…

593
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:04,004
is it you who'll become rich?

594
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,215
Who are you?

595
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:12,095
We're the Cassano Geumga Family.

596
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:25,900
Come on, now.

597
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:30,530
Interrupting a campaign is illegal.

598
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:31,448
Shut up.

599
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:34,326
What's illegal is
resuming the redevelopment.

600
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:37,996
We won't allow you to raze this area
to the ground.

601
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:42,709
We won't stand
for scumbags like you either.

602
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:46,463
Get rid of them, will you?

603
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,134
Let's go.

604
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:54,638
I don't think that's a wise decision.

605
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,973
No one can touch us.

606
00:59:57,057 --> 00:59:58,433
Hey!

607
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:02,604
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

608
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:05,815
Be my guest.

609
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,234
We're not scared of the police at all.

610
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,737
I'm dying to bite him.

611
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,238
My teeth are itching.

612
01:00:12,864 --> 01:00:13,823
Ms. Hong.

613
01:00:14,616 --> 01:00:16,493
We'll take care of this.

614
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:18,328
You have a trial to attend.

615
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:20,372
Don't worry. We got this.

616
01:00:20,455 --> 01:00:21,790
Thank you.

617
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:27,337
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

618
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,214
See you later.

619
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:31,299
Look at you.

620
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:33,551
Do you not know the strongman,
Baek Yong-gu?

621
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:35,303
Check this out.

622
01:00:35,929 --> 01:00:37,222
You little…

623
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:39,933
The results of the retrial
for the murder of Hwang Deok-bae

624
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:41,559
from six years ago has come out.

625
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:43,895
He was found guilty
of attempted sexual assault,

626
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:45,897
and Oh, the accused, was found guilty

627
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,525
of manslaughter, not murder.

628
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:52,404
Chairwoman Seo Yeong-sun,
the former wife of Chairman Hwang,

629
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:56,366
was found guilty of negligence
despite witnessing the incident.

630
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:59,536
She has been arrested on the spot
following the trial.

631
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:02,622
This fact came to light
after Hwang Min-seong, her son,

632
01:01:02,706 --> 01:01:04,874
submitted a written confession
from prison.

633
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:10,130
Look at you,

634
01:01:10,213 --> 01:01:12,632
a nameless lawyer acting mighty.

635
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:16,261
Look at you, a rich, old fogey acting out.

636
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:17,637
You sly snake.

637
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:19,764
What the hell have you done to my son?

638
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:21,099
Nothing.

639
01:01:22,642 --> 01:01:26,604
I just sent him some photos
of Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

640
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:29,774
You won't get away with this!

641
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:31,776
-You little witch.
-Move aside.

642
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,945
She always spews the same nonsense.

643
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:37,365
I won't see you out.

644
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,075
Excuse me.

645
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:40,744
Please share a few words.

646
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:43,037
-Please move aside.
-Hold on.

647
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:45,874
We have a few questions.

648
01:01:45,957 --> 01:01:48,042
Please say a few words.

649
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:50,086
Be quiet!

650
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,465
-How do you feel?
-Are you sorry?

651
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:55,884
Please say something!

652
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,010
Wait!

653
01:02:01,514 --> 01:02:03,600
-Please say a few words.
-Please say something!

654
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:05,977
-Are you happy with the result?
-How do you feel?

655
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,771
I truly am.

656
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:09,898
It's not a surprise that we won.

657
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:10,940
Is it?

658
01:02:13,151 --> 01:02:15,320
-Pass.
-Go.

659
01:02:15,403 --> 01:02:16,696
Good job.

660
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,783
Tae-ho…

661
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:28,750
DIRECTOR AN GI-SEOK

662
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,294
Where in the world are you, Consigliere?

663
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:36,174
I've been searching for a whole year.

664
01:02:42,764 --> 01:02:44,766
What are you doing,
looking all sentimental?

665
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:46,267
Sir.

666
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:56,569
Have you yet to find Vincenzo?

667
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,697
No, sir. He vanished into thin air.

668
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:03,159
I'm sure he'll come back
when the time's right.

669
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:07,288
About the Guillotine file…

670
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:11,334
The prosecution wanted to do
a joint investigation,

671
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:12,669
but I turned it down.

672
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:15,088
I told them we'd do it alone.

673
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:17,048
That was a wise decision.

674
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:20,009
We must find every single one of them
and root them out.

675
01:03:20,093 --> 01:03:21,344
We must.

676
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:23,304
Come in.

677
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:30,395
Right.

678
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:33,439
-Say hello.
-We already know each other.

679
01:03:33,523 --> 01:03:35,066
Hi, old-looking man.

680
01:03:35,984 --> 01:03:38,236
Hello, young-looking,sir.

681
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:39,821
Gosh.

682
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:41,906
What do you say

683
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:45,994
we bring him back to
the International Organized Crime Bureau?

684
01:03:46,077 --> 01:03:47,704
I'd be more than happy.

685
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:50,915
Let's look for the consigliere first.

686
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:52,333
Let's do that.

687
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:56,337
Hey, can you please work?

688
01:03:57,088 --> 01:03:59,716
You and your corn salad.

689
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,428
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

690
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:08,808
-Look into it immediately.
-Yes, sir.

691
01:04:12,312 --> 01:04:13,479
-Right now?
-Yes.

692
01:04:15,231 --> 01:04:18,318
Hello,
I'd like to pawn this tablet computer.

693
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:19,444
Goodness.

694
01:04:20,153 --> 01:04:24,073
The specifications are below average.
I see many cracks as well.

695
01:04:24,157 --> 01:04:26,117
I'm in need of urgent money.

696
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,243
Is that so?

697
01:04:27,952 --> 01:04:30,204
-Dal-rae, what should I do?
-God, it's busted.

698
01:04:30,288 --> 01:04:31,372
But it works just fine.

699
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:33,374
-Are you a student?
-Yes.

700
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:35,168
He's a student.

701
01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:38,671
Let's take it.

702
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:40,423
Give him 180,000 won.

703
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,468
I'm sorry, Dal-rae.

704
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:44,636
Are you hungry?

705
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:46,346
I'll give you 200,000 won instead.

706
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:48,139
Have you gone insane?

707
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:49,682
-Here.
-I'm sorry.

708
01:04:49,766 --> 01:04:52,602
-I'm sorry. Goodness.
-Here. Thank you.

709
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:54,604
-Thank you so much.
-Goodbye.

710
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:55,939
-Study hard.
-I will.

711
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:57,774
-Come back to get it.
-Okay. Thank you.

712
01:04:57,857 --> 01:04:58,775
Dal-rae.

713
01:04:58,858 --> 01:05:02,362
Seok-do, can you wipe the shelves?

714
01:05:03,071 --> 01:05:04,489
I already did it.

715
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:06,824
Do it again. Once isn't enough.

716
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:07,992
You're so pretty.

717
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:12,163
Think of Dal-rae.

718
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,332
Right, Dal-rae?

719
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:15,792
You're adorable.

720
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:17,919
You are indeed.

721
01:05:22,882 --> 01:05:26,552
Did you miss daddy?

722
01:05:27,804 --> 01:05:30,974
-Honey, she needs to eat.
-Okay.

723
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:33,768
Did you miss me?

724
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:37,730
Let's lie down.

725
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:40,274
-Goodness.
-You're so cute.

726
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:42,944
-How nice.
-What a good girl.

727
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:45,238
Gosh, I'm so tired.

728
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:47,782
It's spotless.
Why did you tell me to wipe this?

729
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:49,534
Just be nice and wipe it.

730
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,995
I am. Gosh.

731
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:53,746
You're doing great.

732
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:56,833
By the way, had I fully recovered,

733
01:05:56,916 --> 01:06:00,044
I would've flipped that truck over.

734
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:03,214
You should be grateful
that you're even alive.

735
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:06,300
Thanks to his first aid,
the surgery was a success.

736
01:06:06,384 --> 01:06:07,427
It was dangerous.

737
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:10,304
Nutria of Geumga-dong.

738
01:06:21,399 --> 01:06:24,527
Ma'am, this piano isn't working.

739
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:28,072
Oh, don't use that one. It's broken.

740
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:30,783
Don't play on this one.
Use the one behind you.

741
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:31,993
-Okay.
-Good.

742
01:07:04,484 --> 01:07:06,778
Will you marry me?

743
01:07:08,446 --> 01:07:09,280
Yes.

744
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:17,246
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL TEMPLE
NANYAK TEMPLE

745
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:30,676
-From black hair to white hair
-From black hair to white hair

746
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:38,726
Congratulations.

747
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:45,733
From black hair to white hair

748
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,988
We are all bound to meet again by fate.

749
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:53,491
I will look forward to that day.

750
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,915
I have a question to ask you
before I leave.

751
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,375
Sure.

752
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,882
I don't think I can give up
doing what I do.

753
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:13,594
I can't do what's right either.

754
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:20,518
Eventually, I'll end up returning
to my place.

755
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:24,397
I will feel regret and anguish

756
01:08:26,524 --> 01:08:27,775
for the rest of my life.

757
01:08:33,823 --> 01:08:38,119
Among the Four Heavenly Kings,
there's a king named Vaisravana.

758
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:43,499
It's the scary face you see
when you enter a temple.

759
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:50,798
Vaisravana keeps yakshas
and rakshasas in check

760
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:55,011
and protects Buddha's ways and all humans.

761
01:08:57,388 --> 01:08:59,473
Since you have committed many sins,

762
01:08:59,557 --> 01:09:02,894
you won't be able to become like Buddha
no matter how hard you try.

763
01:09:03,895 --> 01:09:06,939
However, you can fight for the people

764
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,567
alongside the yakshas and the rakshasas.

765
01:09:10,985 --> 01:09:12,737
You may not become like Buddha,

766
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:17,742
but you will get compliments from him
from time to time.

767
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:24,058
What if

768
01:10:26,519 --> 01:10:29,605
you can never return to Korea?

769
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:36,320
I can visit you instead.

770
01:10:39,073 --> 01:10:40,700
-The bridge of birds.
-What?

771
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:42,410
You know, on July 7.

772
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,413
Magpies and crows form a bridge

773
01:10:46,122 --> 01:10:48,124
so that Gyeon-u and Ung-nyeo can meet.

774
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:53,254
It's Jik-nyeo, not Ung-nyeo.

775
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:54,964
I see.

776
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:56,924
But Mr. Nam said…

777
01:10:58,134 --> 01:10:59,385
Then…

778
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:04,724
in our case, Inzaghi and its friends
could form a bridge for us.

779
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:07,476
You're right. Inzaghi.

780
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,687
Those pigeons are quite strong.

781
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,481
Then it'll be a bridge of pigeons.

782
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:15,359
I'm not joking.

783
01:11:16,777 --> 01:11:18,988
I'll return like Gyeon-u did.

784
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:22,867
Okay.

785
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,203
I'm serious.

786
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:29,999
-Ms. Hong.
-What?

787
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:31,375
Who was Ung-nyeo then?

788
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:48,934
Great job.

789
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,856
I feel great.

790
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:05,242
It's Ms. Oh's death anniversary tomorrow.

791
01:12:05,326 --> 01:12:07,119
I'm glad I could give her a gift.

792
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,332
I'm sure she's elated.

793
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:16,295
By the way,
there's something on your desk.

794
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:29,350
FRIENDS ARE LIKE ONE SOUL IN TWO BODIES

795
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:02,299
Right. This too.

796
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:04,677
What is this?

797
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,895
CELEBRATION OF KOREA AND ITALY'S
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

798
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:16,355
Do you want to go with me tomorrow?

799
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:21,444
But I'll be attending
a paper airplane competition tomorrow.

800
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:22,778
See?

801
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:28,451
You can do it, Edward.

802
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:30,661
Good.

803
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:35,374
I see.

804
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:52,766
CELEBRATION OF KOREA AND ITALY'S
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

805
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:07,364
It's been a while, Ambassador Sponza.

806
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,428
War and art are best observed
from a distance.

807
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:57,498
Good evening, miss.

808
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:07,466
Have you been well?

809
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:16,141
How did you get here?

810
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:20,062
I sneaked in with the Italian delegation.

811
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,648
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

812
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,905
Are you only able to come
during an event like this?

813
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:33,576
Yes. Just for a day.

814
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:36,328
But…

815
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:41,292
I'll invite you to my island.

816
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:46,088
Your island?

817
01:15:50,009 --> 01:15:51,802
You mean the island in the postcard?

818
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:08,277
I bought a deserted island near Malta.

819
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:11,780
I named it myself as well. Pagliuzza.

820
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,575
In Korean, it means "straws."

821
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:20,247
You must've spent all your money on that.

822
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:22,082
I have a bit left.

823
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,087
Thanks for letting me hide the gold.

824
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,258
I was truly relieved
that you had that spot in your house.

825
01:18:21,577 --> 01:18:23,245
Is that where you're living?

826
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:24,955
Yes.

827
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:27,499
The Cassano family settled there.

828
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,792
In secret, of course.

829
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:30,794
Are you their boss now?

830
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:37,509
You're a boss now, not a consigliere?

831
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:43,515
The island has many purposes.

832
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,977
It's a refuge for exhausted fighters,

833
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:51,857
a hideout for your loved ones,
and a place of healing.

834
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:54,568
Can I go there as well?

835
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,403
Yes.

836
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,656
I've set aside a room for you.

837
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:02,993
No way.

838
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:04,912
I can't wait to go there.

839
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,968
I've missed you a lot.

840
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:25,516
Me too.

841
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:31,063
You've always been on my mind
ever since I left.

842
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:35,108
That's hard to believe.

843
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:18,694
Do you believe me now?

844
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:25,033
Villains never break up
because they're tenacious…

845
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:28,662
even when they love.

846
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:27,823
Two days ago, I used three Luciano
family members as manure for the vineyard

847
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:30,909
and took over the olive plantations
in Malta.

848
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,998
I'm still a villain
and couldn't care less about justice.

849
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:38,709
Justice is weak and empty.

850
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:43,922
One cannot win against any villains
with justice alone.

851
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,676
If merciless justice exists,

852
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,220
I am willing to yield to it.

853
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:55,142
Even villains long to live
in a peaceful world.

854
01:22:56,685 --> 01:23:00,188
However, since that's impossible,
I've taken up a new hobby.

855
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,649
Getting rid of garbage.

856
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:06,945
If I don't do that, people will die
buried underneath the garbage.

857
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:15,120
There's one last thing I'd like to say
from a villain's perspective.

858
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:20,292
Evil is…

859
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:23,128
prevalen and vehement.

860
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:43,356
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHA SOON-BAE,
KIM SUNG-CHEOL, AND JEON GUK-HYANG

861
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:19,948
THE END

862
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:25,203
