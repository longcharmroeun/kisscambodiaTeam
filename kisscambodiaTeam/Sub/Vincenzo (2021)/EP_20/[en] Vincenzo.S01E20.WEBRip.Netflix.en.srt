1
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,167
No.

2
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,586
No.

3
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,961
Ms. Hong.

4
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,132
Ms. Hong.

5
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,680
Please stop.

6
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,557
Let go.

7
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,686
You really…

8
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,064
shouldn't have been born.

9
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,066
Never.

10
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,236
You scum.

11
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,021
Han-seo…

12
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,732
Damn it!

13
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,494
The address is
49-8, Yeonseo-dong, Sangun-gu.

14
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,415
Two people got shot. Please hurry.

15
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,209
-Ms. Hong.
-Mr. Cassano.

16
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,713
Vincenzo.

17
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,684
Are you okay?

18
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,270
I…

19
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,108
did well, didn't I?

20
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,276
You did.

21
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,862
You deserve to be my brother.

22
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,703
For the first time…

23
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,997
in my life…

24
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,876
I've helped someone.

25
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,551
Hey.

26
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,431
You know what to do.

27
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,773
Thank you…

28
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,445
for everything.

29
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,528
EPISODE 20

30
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,306
I paid for this private room.

31
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,561
I paid for your room for ten days.

32
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,113
Does it hurt a lot?

33
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,576
Now I know what it feels like…

34
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,580
to get shot.

35
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,256
Your muscles are damaged,

36
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,426
so you can't move your shoulder
for the time being.

37
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,516
Excuse me.

38
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,726
Sorry.

39
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,986
You blamed yourself all night, didn't you?

40
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,198
For what happened.

41
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,585
We were fighting in a war together,
and I happened to get shot.

42
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,337
It's not your fault.

43
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,426
Now that I've woken up,

44
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,637
don't worry about me,

45
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,265
and go finish the job.

46
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,351
Okay.

47
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,063
I'll be done within 24 hours.

48
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,944
After that…

49
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,617
You'll be leaving.

50
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,920
Then…

51
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,302
I guess this is our last night together.

52
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,436
I'll keep my promise.

53
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,316
Once you're done,

54
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,862
leave immediately without calling me.

55
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,491
Do you understand?

56
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,369
BABEL'S CHAIRMAN JANG MURDERS BROTHER
AND ATTEMPTS TO MURDER A LAWYER

57
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,679
Vincenzo.

58
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,684
I'm relieved that Ms. Hong is recovering.

59
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,478
What is this, the Wild West?
Why shoot a gun?

60
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,148
Mr. Park, should I get a gun, too?

61
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,401
I was an excellent marksman
in the military.

62
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,280
I bet you were the biggest clown
in your barracks at best.

63
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,158
Hey. Fighting is
all about mental strength.

64
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,370
At least he's now
officially a wanted criminal.

65
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,289
He has nowhere to run now.

66
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,292
That dirty little bastard.

67
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,546
We all fought against him
without giving up,

68
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,089
and it finally paid off.

69
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,258
We're not who we used to be.

70
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,221
Whoever messes with us
will have their hair pulled out.

71
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,807
Sorry.

72
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,435
Let them come.

73
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,813
I'll make sure no one leaves here
in one piece.

74
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,650
We should stay strong
and help the lawyers until the end.

75
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,986
I'll put my practice on hold for now

76
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,572
and fight alongside you.

77
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,701
I'll fight with all my might
for Mr. Cassano.

78
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,994
Bring it on.

79
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,543
How long will it take to unlock it?

80
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,631
It depends on the model,
but three to four hours at most.

81
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,758
I'll have an expert
work on it immediately.

82
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,676
Thank you.

83
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,388
And take this.

84
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,142
It's the Guillotine file.

85
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,604
Consigliere.

86
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,691
Discuss how best to use it
with Director Tae.

87
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,235
I have a copy too.

88
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,822
Thank you so much.

89
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,786
I will use it
for the justice of this country.

90
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,208
Rather than that,
use it to trample on your enemy.

91
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,543
Pardon?

92
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,170
Here's how a villain thinks.

93
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,422
Enemies I'm the least afraid of are…

94
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,177
politicians and government officials
who only talk about justice.

95
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,974
Talking about justice
doesn't bring about justice.

96
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,477
These are the people
that I'm most afraid of.

97
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,355
Pizzeria owners standing outside my house

98
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,900
with baseball bats
because I raised the protection money.

99
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,406
Keep that in mind.

100
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,456
I will make sure…

101
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,835
to follow your teaching, Consigliere.

102

you'll be arrested, charged,

105
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,895
and taken into detention.

106
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,023
It seems like everything's finally ready.

107
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,901
Should I sign here?

108
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,571
Embarrassment is only momentary.

109
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,449
Staying alive is more important.

110
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,201
I'm going to the detention center.

111
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:12,912
Let me see.

VINCENZO

113
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,333
Gosh, that startled me. Goodness.

114
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,423
Darn it. It's so noisy.

115
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,634
What is it?

116
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,678
Let me tell you how you can survive.

117
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,183
Hold on.

118
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,852
-Excuse me for one second.
-Sure.

119
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,816

I won't tell you again.

124
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,747
Get Choi Myung-hee out
within three hours at all costs,

and you'll live.

126
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,377
Hey! How can I trust you?

127
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,756
You're going to kill me, too, aren't you?

128
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,550
You'd already be dead
if I wanted to kill you.

129
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,096
When you left the restaurant two days ago

130
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,140
or when you were at the driving range
yesterday.

131
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,475
How did you…

132
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,977
Hurry if you want to live.

133
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,981
Hold on.
Do you promise you'll spare my life?

134
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,191
-Yes.
-Thank you.

135
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,275
I'll…

136
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,455
Just do what I told you to do.

137
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,748
Don't make a mistake.

Why?

The Namdongbu Office
cleared you of all charges.

under the threat of death
from Chairman Jang.

How did they find the evidence?

They conducted a search and seizure
this morning.

Yes.

170
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,659
Congratulations on your release.

171
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,830
Today is your last day.

172
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,373
CHOI MYUNG-HEE

173
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,964
Han Seung-hyuk, that scumbag.

174
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,456
It seems like she's heading to Wusang.

175
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,208
Watch her from a distance.

176
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,668
Call me if she heads somewhere remote.

177
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,962
She might be meeting up
with Jang Han-seok.

178
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,172
Yes, sir.

179
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,741
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

180
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,077
Call this number when you're released.

181
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,628
How did you get out so soon?

182
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,048
Han Seung-hyuk sold me out to Vincenzo

183
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,383
to save his own ass.

184
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,386
I'm not surprised.

185
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,431
You and I shouldn't meet.

186
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,351
There might be a trap.

187
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,230
You're right.

188
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,109
First, go to my place
and sort out my property.

189
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,904
I'll text you where my laptop is
and bank passwords.

190
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,741
And wire five billion to your account.

191
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,369
Thank you.

192
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,872
What's your plan?

193
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,208
I'm going to stow away after midnight.

194
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,168
I'm going to Mexico.

195
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,462
You should also

196
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,382
hide somewhere far away.

197
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,843
Okay. Be careful.

198
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,865
We've unlocked it. Check the phone.

199
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,705
It seems like he's heading to Seocho-dong.

200
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,374
-You can see this too, right?
-Yes.

201
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,793
I can see it on my laptop as well.

202
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,211
Then keep me posted.

203
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,963
Okay.

204
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,961
Time to get going.

205
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,531
My, look at all the reporters.

206
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,034
-Hello.
-Hello. Nice to see you all.

207
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,619
Can we talk?

208
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,579
What do you want to know this time?

209
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,581
Hold on. Step aside for a moment.

210
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,875
There are rumors going around

211
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,711
about you and Jang Han-seok‚
who is on the run.

212
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,508
Turn off your recorders and cameras

213
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,510
so I can talk comfortably.

214
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,554
All right.

215
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,056
Listen up.

216
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
He was my client,
and I was his attorney. That's all.

217
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,396
A long time ago, at that.

218
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,900
But isn't it true that Wusang helped
Babel with their illegal activities?

219
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,902
Not Wusang.

220
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,447
It was Ms. Choi's personal decision.

221
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,033
To think how much trouble
that caused for Wusang.

222
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,704
Excuse me a second.

223
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,456
Han Seung-hyuk speaking.

224
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,417
Looks like you're having fun.

225
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,087
-What's going on?
-Who is it?

226
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,632
Mr. Han, this is not acceptable.

227
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,010
What do you mean?

228
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,846
You should've remained respectful to me.

229
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,934
I don't think you're in the position
to say that.

230
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,021
Go keep my brother company.

231
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,063
What?

232
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,779
Get him. Get that bastard!

233
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,574
Let's go.

234
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,242
Step back!

235
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,203
The Chief Prosecutor is dead.

236
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,789
-What?
-Two guys suddenly stabbed him.

237
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,417
-Were they holding a grudge?
-I'm not sure what just happened.

238
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,795
-Step back!
-Move!

239
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,306
-Take him inside.
-Step back.

240
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,535
Around 3:30 p.m. today,

241
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,496
Chief Prosecutor Han Seung-hyuk
was attacked by two men and died

242
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,040
in front of the Namdongbu
Prosecutor's Office.

243
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,544
The police are tracking down the van
that the two men disappeared in.

244
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,423
Based on the CCTV camera footage
and the witness statements,

245
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,091
the police are…

246
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,635
Jang Han-seok must've hired some men

247
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,721
as his mercenaries.

248
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,182
I hope Mr. Cassano

249
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,227
stays safe.

250
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,398
Mr. Nam.

251
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,195
No one can kill Vincenzo Cassano.

252
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,739
You know that.

253
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,193
Hello, Mr. Cho.

254
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,986
Are you after Chairman Jang?

255
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,404
Yes.

256
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,199
But he's disappeared from the GPS.

257
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,494
He must've gone underground
where there's no reception.

258
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,331
I think I know
where Choi Myung-hee is heading.

259
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,083
Where?

260
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,051
You finished off Han Seung-hyuk
like a scene from a movie.

261
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,680
I wanted to give him
the dramatic end he deserved.

262
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,183
I've switched the main bank account.

263
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,645
I've also wired some money
to the borrowed-name account for you.

264
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,064
Thank you. You should leave immediately.

265
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,519
Security!

266
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,062
Security!

267
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,323
Don't be a fool.

268
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,051
Are you looking for this?

269
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,060
How could they be so useless
when I paid a fortune?

270
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,355
When you're facing a predator,
it's better to hide than run.

271
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,607
Why are you so reckless?

272
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,485
I didn't know that.

273
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,488
I've always been a predator myself.

274
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,828
The money you wired to Jang Han-seok
will be used for a good cause.

275
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,003
It's been intercepted and sent
to a place that needs it.

276
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,773
You've made a fool of me
on so many levels.

277
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,486
That's my number-one specialty,

278
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,446
next to killing.

279
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,741
Let me just finish this.

280
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,409
Then you can kill me.

281
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,460
Aren't you…

282
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,173
more of a Zumba person than a beer person?

283
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,425
Right?

284
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,558
I will…

285
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,019
let you dance all you want.

286
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,361
So Ms. Choi, the CEO of Wusang,
was abducted in that car?

287
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,906
Yes. Her guards who were on standby
in the parking lot reported it.

288
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,116
Who are the abductors?

289
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,118
One of them hasn't been identified,

290
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,453
but the other is Vincenzo Cassano,

291
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,747
a member of the Italian Mafia.

292
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,333
-Why would a Mafia member…
-I'm not sure.

293
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,960
Anyway, Ms. Choi is the attorney

294
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,088
for Jang Han-seok
who is currently on the run.

295
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,509
And the late Han Seung-hyuk
was the former CEO of Wusang.

296
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:31,097
There's something fishy about it.
They must be related in some way.

297
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,601
Put out an APB on the Mafia member
and track him down along with Jang.

298
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,687
Also, secure footage from Namdongbu
and Ms. Choi's apartment.

299
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,938
Yes, sir.

300
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,891
Don't even try to stand up.
It'll only add to the pain.

301
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,064
Kill me already.

302
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,358
Stop messing around.

303
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,867
What are you going to do with me next?

304
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,621
I told you.
I won't let you die comfortably.

305
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,959
What difference does it make
if you kill me?

306
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,587
Think about it.
Will it bring peace to the world?

307
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,341
Or will it leave a meaningful message?

308
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,468
No way.

309
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,763
It makes no difference whatsoever.

310
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:59,560
Like you said, I'm just a scumbag
who was killed by another scumbag.

311
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,235
No matter how cleverly you kill me,

312
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,532
you're a scumbag like me all the same.

313
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,659
Not at all.

314
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,953
How so?

315
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,580
I'd love to hear how.

316
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,710
I am Vaisravana

317
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,170
who leads yakshas and rakshasas.

318
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,922
What are you talking about?

319
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:32,969
Are you joking?

320
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,724
It seems like our conversation is
making you less afraid of death.

321
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,928
Don't tell me this is…

322
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,816
You'll feel an intense pain
from beginning to end.

323
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,942
No.

324
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,905
You're going way too far.
Don't you think so, Vincenzo?

325
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,117
This isn't right. Didn't you say
you never harm women and children?

326
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,244
To me, you're not a woman.

327
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,538
You're just a monster…

328
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,250
driven by desires.

329
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,670
No.

330
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,924
This isn't right. There are other ways.

331
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,133
Use a gun.

332
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,886
Shoot me. Just shoot me!

333
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,054
Shoot me!

334
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,309
No, no. I'm sorry.

335
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,770
Get back here!

336
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,356
Vincenzo!

337
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,076
Mr. An, do we have a signal on Jang?

338
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,245
Yes, we have him again.

339
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,123
He's heading towards the Seobu Expressway.

340
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,167
It's far from where you are,

341
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,752
so I've sent a team to follow him.

342
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,087
I'll catch up soon.

343
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,673
Tell them to be careful
because Jang Han-seok has a gun.

344
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,925
And the police have put out an APB on you.

345
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,720
So you should move quickly.

346
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,805
I understand.

347
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,358
He's getting farther and farther away.
Step on it!

348
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,569
I'm going as fast as I can.

349
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,404
There's too many people. That's why.

350
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,823
That's ridiculous.
This isn't a cultivator.

351
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,576
We were in second gear. Sorry.

352
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,578
-Gosh!
-Seriously!

353
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,954
Damn it.

354
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,414
Let me switch to third gear.

355
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,082
We're going to lose him!

356
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,293
-Third. Good now?
-Good.

357
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,753
Good. Here we go. Third gear.

358
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,963
Switching to fourth gear.

359
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,280
Look at you guys. Why are you so down?

360
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,866
This isn't right for a chairman
of a conglomerate.

361
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,785
-How embarrassing.
-All right.

362
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,496
Let's get it on by the sea!

363
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,701
Don't resist.
You'll only be choked even harder.

364
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,672
Stop it, you bastard! That's enough!

365
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,756
Put down the knife!

366
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,969
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

367
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,418
-Mr. Lee!
-Mr. Lee!

368
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,754
Mr. Lee! What should we do?

369
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,213
-Call 911 right now.
-Okay.

370
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,673
Hang in there.

371
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,467
Help will arrive soon.

372
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,635
Hello? Is this 911?

373
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,388
I'm calling from Geumjo Port.

374
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,726
Someone has been stabbed. Please hurry.

375
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,144
That son of a bitch.

376
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,820
Mr. Lee.

377
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,907
We caught him…

378
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,867
right?

379
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,787
Yes, we did.

380
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,624
Don't hand him over to the police.

381
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,170
Make sure to punish him yourself.

382
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,050
Okay. Don't talk anymore.

383
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,512
Once Dal-rae…

384
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,390
is born,

385
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,226
I wanted…

386
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:02,024
to ask you to be her godfather.

387
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,569
Okay.

388
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,407
I'll do that. I'll be her godfather.

389
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,617
You…

390
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,622
You promised. Keep your promise.

391
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,668
Okay?

392
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,424
Of course.

393
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,634
I will.

394
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,803
Thank…

395
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,431
Thank you.

396
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,560
Mr. Lee.

397
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,228
Mr. Lee.

398
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,022
Mr. Lee.

399
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,899
Hurry!

400
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,568
Let me help him.

401
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,820
Mr. Lee, raise your right leg.

402
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,157
-I'll raise it, okay?
-Mr. Lee, don't close your eyes.

403
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,450
Hang in there.

404
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,285
What should we do?

405
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,202
No!

406
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,787
Don't touch it.

407
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,998
-Never.
-Do you even know what you're doing?

408
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,084
I used to be a surgical nurse.
The White Angel of Geumga-dong!

409
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,379
Hang in there. Don't talk to me.

410
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,182
Almost done. Hang in there.

411
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,609
That's not 911. It's the police.

412
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,801
See you again, Consigliere.

413
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,054
Thank you for everything.

414
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,056
Be safe.

415
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,562
Go on, now.

416
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,023
Go.

417
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,470
Stop the SUV. We'll fire if you don't.

418
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:40,099
Stop the SUV. We'll fire if you don't.

419
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,942
-What are you doing?
-We have a patient.

420
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,777
-Move your car!
-What are you doing?

421
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,029
-Move it.
-We have a patient here!

422
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,531
Move your car!

423
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,366
-Move it!
-Someone's hurt.

424
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,173
Okay.

425
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,890
He escaped safely.

426
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,689
And he has Chairman Jang with him.

427
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,901
Things will finally come to an end.

428
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,658
Ms. Hong.

429
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,373
Mr. Lee is…

430
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,716
What about him?

431
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,981
How did you find me?

432
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,568
Your brother told me.

433
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,737
What?

434
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,327
Hey, do you want to hear
something interesting?

435
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,331
On the morning of the inauguration,

436
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,376
Han-seok suddenly gave me a watch
as a gift.

437
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,377
Okay.

438
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,921
And matching watches at that.

439
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,048
He's not the type to do that.

440
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,890
So I found it suspicious
and disassembled it.

441
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,270
Guess what I found.

442
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,898
An expert said that it was a tracker.

443
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,068
A tracker? So what did you do?

444
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,737
I put it in his watch without his knowing.

445
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,866
And I didn't wear mine.

446
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:49,997
Also, I downloaded an app
that can track him whenever I want.

447
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,583
It was quite expensive. Was I ripped off?

448
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,211
But why are you tracking him?

449
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,132
I'm certain that
he'll do something horrible again soon.

450
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,593
Then he'll run away like always.

451
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,721
Even when he killed his friends
in middle school,

452
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,348
my father sent him away
so no one could find him.

453
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,519
Had he been punished then,

454
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,606
he may not have turned out this way.

455
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,822
But doesn't he change watches every day?
What's the use?

456
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,949
That's why I put trackers in all of them.

457
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,661
-What?
-I tend to be foolish like that.

458
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,588
In the end, he was right.

459
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,137
He's damn useless until the very end.

460
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,522
By the way,

461
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,192
what is this toy?

462
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,660
I learned it from the Russian Mafia
when I visited Russia.

463
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,080
It's called kop'yo iskuplen'ya.

464
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,295
"The spear of atonement."

465
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,308
Do you really think
I'll atone for my sins?

466
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,811
I couldn't care less.

467
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,981
As long as you're in pain, I'm happy.

468
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,233
You should've just killed me
back at the port.

469
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,860
I always keep my word.

470
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,449
Do you remember everything
I've told you until now?

471
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,710
Wait.

472
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,297
I'm glad you seem to remember.

473
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,597
What is this?

474
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:25,360
The spear of atonement
will pierce by 5mm every 5 minutes.

475
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,071
You'll feel lightheaded
from all the blood loss,

476
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,781
and feel excruciating pain.

477
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,160
Around tomorrow noon,

478
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,164
it'll pierce your lung,
and you'll die instantly.

479
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,417
Vincenzo.

480
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,171
Aren't we both businessmen?

481
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,840
I have many great offers to make.

482
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,594
You don't need to resort
to such barbaric acts!

483
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,971
-Please.
-Barbaric acts?

484
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,890
Yes.

485
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,355
This world has always been barbaric.

486
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,778
I'll give you all the money I have.

487
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:08,945
So, please…

488
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,448
If that's not enough,

489
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,034
you can cut off one of my limbs.

490
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,120
Sparing me isn't that difficult, right?

491
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,206
It's not.

492
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,751
But I don't want to.

493
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,014
It hasn't been five minutes yet!

494
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,143
I've controlled it manually for now.

495
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,646
I'll switch it back to auto.

496
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,025
Vincenzo. Please.

497
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,153
Vincenzo, this isn't you.

498
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,449
Just shoot me in the head, okay?

499
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,619
Just shoot me! Shoot!

500
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,706
Please… Vincenzo.

501
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,416
Go apologize to your brother.

502
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,757
Please…

503
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,718
I'll keep this as a trophy.

504
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:15,929
Vincenzo…

505
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,764
Vincenzo.

506
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,475
Hey!

507
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,271
Just shoot me! Kill me now!

508
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,125
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

509
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,424
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

510
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,358
POWER OFF

511
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,735
I'm sorry I'm late.

512
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,904
I've lured the investigation team
to Busan.

513
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,948
Here. It's a Korean passport.

514
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,451
You must board within the next 30 minutes.

515
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,287
Until then, your background check
and face recognition

516
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,289
will be linked to that photo.

517
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,793
After 30 minutes,
the data will be linked to you, so hurry.

518
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,128
Thank you.

519
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,507
You should thank Director Tae, not us.

520
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,093
I see. Please tell him I said thank you.

521
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,845
If you can't come back…

522
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,517
do give us a call someday.

523
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,021
Thank you,

524
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,189
Let's go.

525
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,426
Mr. Cassano.

526
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,681
You shouldn't move around.

527
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,974
I'm okay.

528
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,019
I'm glad I got to see you.

529
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,146
You should go now.

530
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,316
There will be a lot of headaches for you
after I leave.

531
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,735
I can handle that.

532
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,842
Goodbye.

533
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,934
Be safe.

534
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,896
I'll get going.

535
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,649
Hurry.

536
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,156
Thank you for everything.

537
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,618
Goodbye, Mr. Nam.

538
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,496
Sir, we have no time.

539
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:10,325
It's been a month since Lawyer C,
a former Italian Mafia member

540
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,160
charged with kidnapping Lawyer Choi

541
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,204
and Babel's Chairman Jang,
has been at large.

542
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,791
The police inspected all domestic ports
in case he'd try to stow away,

543
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,460
but they have failed to find
any trace of him.

544
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,047
Believing the suspect to be
hiding in the country,

545
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,092
the police have decided to reinforce…

546
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,474
In our vineyard,
you can buy or lease a single row

547
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,143
and tend to it on the weekends.

548
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,482
The rows with name tags on them
are already taken.

549
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,526
To top it all off,

550
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,446
you'll be able to make wine
with grapes you grow yourself.

551
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,785
Our vineyard has a winery
that you can use as well.

552
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,955
Would you like to take a look?

553
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,414
-Okay.
-Okay.

554
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,500
Let's go over there, sweetie.

555
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,044
It's the fertilizing season.

556
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,755
We've weeded out the soil,
so it's quite mushy.

557
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,340
-Be careful.
-Okay.

558
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,176
LEE JIN-A

559
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,908
I'll try my best to make wine
out of these cheap grapes.

560
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,210
1 YEAR LATER

561
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,464
-Wasn't his kick amazing?
-I agree.

562
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,341
-It was a 360-degree spin.
-He's totally into it these days.

563
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,594
That's exactly why
you don't get good grades.

564
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,345
You should study more like I do.

565
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,222
-I'm smarter than you.
-That's not true.

566
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,974
-You're wrong.
-I'm smarter than you.

567
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,684
I got a higher score last time.

568
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,811
-That was once.
-Still…

569
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,565
But I do usually get better grades.

570
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,150
That's true.

571
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,527
But not that much.

572
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,447
BABEL AND ALL ITS SUBSIDIARIES
TO GO INTO RECEIVERSHIP

573
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,449
Gosh, they're all so boring.

574
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,577
-Let's go watch a movie.
-Which one?

575
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,995
Let's think on our way there.

576
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,872
Let's check out the posters there.

577
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,419
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

578
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,108
Currently, Sangcheon-gu

579
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,947
is the poorest borough in the city.

580
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:59,452
Stopping the redevelopment
around Geumga Plaza

581
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,956
is a flagrant decision made
by the government

582
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,418
that blocks your ownership rights.

583
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,380
I, candidate three Kim Seok-u,

584
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,383
will restart the redevelopment plans

585
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:18,346
and make Sangcheon-gu a wealthy borough!

586
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,265
Everyone!

587
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,016
SANGCHEON-GU'S FUTURE
KIM SEOK-U

588
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,309
Kim Seok-u!

589
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,354
-Kim Seok-u!
-Kim Seok-u!

590
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:29,399
-Kim Seok-u!
-Kim Seok-u!

591
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,360
Are you sure it's the borough
that'll become rich?

592
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,458
Or…

593
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,004
is it you who'll become rich?

594
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,215
Who are you?

595
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:59,095
We're the Cassano Geumga Family.

596
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,900
Come on, now.

597
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:17,530
Interrupting a campaign is illegal.

598
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,448
Shut up.

599
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,326
What's illegal is
resuming the redevelopment.

600
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,996
We won't allow you to raze this area
to the ground.

601
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:29,709
We won't stand
for scumbags like you either.

602
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,463
Get rid of them, will you?

603
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,134
Let's go.

604
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,638
I don't think that's a wise decision.

605
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,973
No one can touch us.

606
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,433
Hey!

607
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,604
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

608
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,815
Be my guest.

609
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,234
We're not scared of the police at all.

610
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,737
I'm dying to bite him.

611
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,238
My teeth are itching.

612
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,823
Ms. Hong.

613
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,493
We'll take care of this.

614
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,328
You have a trial to attend.

615
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,372
Don't worry. We got this.

616
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,790
Thank you.

617
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,337
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

618
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,214
See you later.

619
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,299
Look at you.

620
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,551
Do you not know the strongman,
Baek Yong-gu?

621
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,303
Check this out.

622
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,222
You little…

623
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,933
The results of the retrial
for the murder of Hwang Deok-bae

624
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,559
from six years ago has come out.

625
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,895
He was found guilty
of attempted sexual assault,

626
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,897
and Oh, the accused, was found guilty

627
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,525
of manslaughter, not murder.

628
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,404
Chairwoman Seo Yeong-sun,
the former wife of Chairman Hwang,

629
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:43,366
was found guilty of negligence
despite witnessing the incident.

630
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,536
She has been arrested on the spot
following the trial.

631
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,622
This fact came to light
after Hwang Min-seong, her son,

632
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,874
submitted a written confession
from prison.

633
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,130
Look at you,

634
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,632
a nameless lawyer acting mighty.

635
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,261
Look at you, a rich, old fogey acting out.

636
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,637
You sly snake.

637
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,764
What the hell have you done to my son?

638
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,099
Nothing.

639
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:13,604
I just sent him some photos
of Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

640
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,774
You won't get away with this!

641
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,776
-You little witch.
-Move aside.

642
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,945
She always spews the same nonsense.

643
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,365
I won't see you out.

644
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,075
Excuse me.

645
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,744
Please share a few words.

646
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,037
-Please move aside.
-Hold on.

647
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,874
We have a few questions.

648
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,042
Please say a few words.

649
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,086
Be quiet!

650
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,465
-How do you feel?
-Are you sorry?

651
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,884
Please say something!

652
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,010
Wait!

653
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,600
-Please say a few words.
-Please say something!

654
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,977
-Are you happy with the result?
-How do you feel?

655
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,771
I truly am.

656
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,898
It's not a surprise that we won.

657
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:57,940
Is it?

658
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,320
-Pass.
-Go.

659
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,696
Good job.

660
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,783
Tae-ho…

661
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,750
DIRECTOR AN GI-SEOK

662
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,294
Where in the world are you, Consigliere?

663
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,174
I've been searching for a whole year.

664
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,766
What are you doing,
looking all sentimental?

665
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,267
Sir.

666
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,569
Have you yet to find Vincenzo?

667
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,697
No, sir. He vanished into thin air.

668
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,159
I'm sure he'll come back
when the time's right.

669
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:54,288
About the Guillotine file…

670
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,334
The prosecution wanted to do
a joint investigation,

671
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,669
but I turned it down.

672
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,088
I told them we'd do it alone.

673
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,048
That was a wise decision.

674
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:07,009
We must find every single one of them
and root them out.

675
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,344
We must.

676
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,304
Come in.

677
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,395
Right.

678
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,439
-Say hello.
-We already know each other.

679
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,066
Hi, old-looking man.

680
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,236
Hello, young-looking,sir.

681
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:26,821
Gosh.

682
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,906
What do you say

683
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,994
we bring him back to
the International Organized Crime Bureau?

684
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,704
I'd be more than happy.

685
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,915
Let's look for the consigliere first.

686
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,333
Let's do that.

687
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,337
Hey, can you please work?

688
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,716
You and your corn salad.

689
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,428
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

690
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,808
-Look into it immediately.
-Yes, sir.

691
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,479
-Right now?
-Yes.

692
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,318
Hello,
I'd like to pawn this tablet computer.

693
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,444
Goodness.

694
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:11,073
The specifications are below average.
I see many cracks as well.

695
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,117
I'm in need of urgent money.

696
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,243
Is that so?

697
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,204
-Dal-rae, what should I do?
-God, it's busted.

698
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,372
But it works just fine.

699
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,374
-Are you a student?
-Yes.

700
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,168
He's a student.

701
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:25,671
Let's take it.

702
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,423
Give him 180,000 won.

703
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,468
I'm sorry, Dal-rae.

704
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,636
Are you hungry?

705
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,346
I'll give you 200,000 won instead.

706
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,139
Have you gone insane?

707
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,682
-Here.
-I'm sorry.

708
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,602
-I'm sorry. Goodness.
-Here. Thank you.

709
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,604
-Thank you so much.
-Goodbye.

710
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:42,939
-Study hard.
-I will.

711
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,774
-Come back to get it.
-Okay. Thank you.

712
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:45,775
Dal-rae.

713
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:49,362
Seok-do, can you wipe the shelves?

714
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,489
I already did it.

715
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,824
Do it again. Once isn't enough.

716
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:54,992
You're so pretty.

717
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,163
Think of Dal-rae.

718
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:01,332
Right, Dal-rae?

719
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,792
You're adorable.

720
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,919
You are indeed.

721
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:13,552
Did you miss daddy?

722
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,974
-Honey, she needs to eat.
-Okay.

723
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,768
Did you miss me?

724
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,730
Let's lie down.

725
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,274
-Goodness.
-You're so cute.

726
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,944
-How nice.
-What a good girl.

727
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,238
Gosh, I'm so tired.

728
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,782
It's spotless.
Why did you tell me to wipe this?

729
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,534
Just be nice and wipe it.

730
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,995
I am. Gosh.

731
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,746
You're doing great.

732
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,833
By the way, had I fully recovered,

733
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:47,044
I would've flipped that truck over.

734
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:50,214
You should be grateful
that you're even alive.

735
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,300
Thanks to his first aid,
the surgery was a success.

736
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,427
It was dangerous.

737
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,304
Nutria of Geumga-dong.

738
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,527
Ma'am, this piano isn't working.

739
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,072
Oh, don't use that one. It's broken.

740
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,783
Don't play on this one.
Use the one behind you.

741
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,993
-Okay.
-Good.

742
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,778
Will you marry me?

743
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,280
Yes.

744
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,246
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL TEMPLE
NANYAK TEMPLE

745
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:17,676
-From black hair to white hair
-From black hair to white hair

746
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,726
Congratulations.

747
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:32,733
From black hair to white hair

748
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:37,988
We are all bound to meet again by fate.

749
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,491
I will look forward to that day.

750
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,915
I have a question to ask you
before I leave.

751
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,375
Sure.

752
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,882
I don't think I can give up
doing what I do.

753
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,594
I can't do what's right either.

754
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,518
Eventually, I'll end up returning
to my place.

755
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,397
I will feel regret and anguish

756
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,775
for the rest of my life.

757
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:25,119
Among the Four Heavenly Kings,
there's a king named Vaisravana.

758
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,499
It's the scary face you see
when you enter a temple.

759
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:37,798
Vaisravana keeps yakshas
and rakshasas in check

760
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:42,011
and protects Buddha's ways and all humans.

761
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,473
Since you have committed many sins,

762
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,894
you won't be able to become like Buddha
no matter how hard you try.

763
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,939
However, you can fight for the people

764
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,567
alongside the yakshas and the rakshasas.

765
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,737
You may not become like Buddha,

766
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:04,742
but you will get compliments from him
from time to time.

767
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,058
What if

768
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,605
you can never return to Korea?

769
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,320
I can visit you instead.

770
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,700
-The bridge of birds.
-What?

771
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,410
You know, on July 7.

772
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,413
Magpies and crows form a bridge

773
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,124
so that Gyeon-u and Ung-nyeo can meet.

774
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,254
It's Jik-nyeo, not Ung-nyeo.

775
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:41,964
I see.

776
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,924
But Mr. Nam said…

777
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,385
Then…

778
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:51,724
in our case, Inzaghi and its friends
could form a bridge for us.

779
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,476
You're right. Inzaghi.

780
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,687
Those pigeons are quite strong.

781
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,481
Then it'll be a bridge of pigeons.

782
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,359
I'm not joking.

783
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:05,988
I'll return like Gyeon-u did.

784
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:09,867
Okay.

785
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,203
I'm serious.

786
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,999
-Ms. Hong.
-What?

787
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,375
Who was Ung-nyeo then?

788
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:35,934
Great job.

789
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,856
I feel great.

790
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,242
It's Ms. Oh's death anniversary tomorrow.

791
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,119
I'm glad I could give her a gift.

792
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,332
I'm sure she's elated.

793
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:03,295
By the way,
there's something on your desk.

794
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:16,350
FRIENDS ARE LIKE ONE SOUL IN TWO BODIES

795
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:49,299
Right. This too.

796
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,677
What is this?

797
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,895
CELEBRATION OF KOREA AND ITALY'S
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

798
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,355
Do you want to go with me tomorrow?

799
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,444
But I'll be attending
a paper airplane competition tomorrow.

800
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:09,778
See?

801
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,451
You can do it, Edward.

802
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:17,661
Good.

803
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:22,374
I see.

804
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,766
CELEBRATION OF KOREA AND ITALY'S
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

805
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,364
It's been a while, Ambassador Sponza.

806
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,428
War and art are best observed
from a distance.

807
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,498
Good evening, miss.

808
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,466
Have you been well?

809
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,141
How did you get here?

810
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,062
I sneaked in with the Italian delegation.

811
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:09,648
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

812
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,905
Are you only able to come
during an event like this?

813
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,576
Yes. Just for a day.

814
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:23,328
But…

815
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,292
I'll invite you to my island.

816
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,088
Your island?

817
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,802
You mean the island in the postcard?

818
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,277
I bought a deserted island near Malta.

819
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,780
I named it myself as well. Pagliuzza.

820
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:01,575
In Korean, it means "straws."

821
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:07,247
You must've spent all your money on that.

822
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,082
I have a bit left.

823
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:14,087
Thanks for letting me hide the gold.

824
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,258
I was truly relieved
that you had that spot in your house.

825
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,245
Is that where you're living?

826
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,955
Yes.

827
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:14,499
The Cassano family settled there.

828
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,792
In secret, of course.

829
01:19:16,376 --> 01:19:17,794
Are you their boss now?

830
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,509
You're a boss now, not a consigliere?

831
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,515
The island has many purposes.

832
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:33,977
It's a refuge for exhausted fighters,

833
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,857
a hideout for your loved ones,
and a place of healing.

834
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:41,568
Can I go there as well?

835
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,403
Yes.

836
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,656
I've set aside a room for you.

837
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:49,993
No way.

838
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:51,912
I can't wait to go there.

839
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,968
I've missed you a lot.

840
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,516
Me too.

841
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:18,063
You've always been on my mind
ever since I left.

842
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:22,108
That's hard to believe.

843
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,694
Do you believe me now?

844
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,033
Villains never break up
because they're tenacious…

845
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:15,662
even when they love.

846
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:14,823
Two days ago, I used three Luciano
family members as manure for the vineyard

847
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:17,909
and took over the olive plantations
in Malta.

848
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:22,998
I'm still a villain
and couldn't care less about justice.

849
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,709
Justice is weak and empty.

850
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,922
One cannot win against any villains
with justice alone.

851
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,676
If merciless justice exists,

852
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,220
I am willing to yield to it.

853
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:42,142
Even villains long to live
in a peaceful world.

854
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:47,188
However, since that's impossible,
I've taken up a new hobby.

855
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:49,649
Getting rid of garbage.

856
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:53,945
If I don't do that, people will die
buried underneath the garbage.

857
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:02,120
There's one last thing I'd like to say
from a villain's perspective.

858
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,292
Evil is…

859
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:10,128
prevalen and vehement.

860
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:30,356
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHA SOON-BAE,
KIM SUNG-CHEOL, AND JEON GUK-HYANG

861
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:06,948
THE END

862
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:12,203
