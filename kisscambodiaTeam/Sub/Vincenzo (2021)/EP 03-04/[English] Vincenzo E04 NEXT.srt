00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:19,550
Someone has been calling you.

2
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:20,885
What? Who?

3
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:26,056
RDU-90.

4
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:29,643
Isn't that the researcher?

5
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,608
Dad.

6
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,321
Dad!

7
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,034
Dad!

8
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,536
No…

9
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,429
Dad…

<i>Hong, a civil rights lawyer,
passed away due to an accident</i>

11

<i>in Geumga-dong, Sangcheon-gu.</i>

12
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:28,882
<i>He was revealed to have violated
the attorneys-at-law act</i>

13
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,344

shocking the public.</i>

<i>and had given voice to the weak.</i>

17

<i>Due to this accident, however,
his true face was revealed.</i>

18
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,816
<i>While undergoing the recent trial,</i>

19
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,194
<i>Hong demanded money and bribed
those who were involved.</i>

20
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:51,947
<i>He also convinced Lee,
a deliveryman, to commit perjury.</i>

21
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,659
<i>He had been under investigation
after violating the attorneys-at-law act.</i>

22
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:58,412

<i>This is the medical report.</i>

35
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,383
<i>Babel Pharmaceuticals' new drug,
RDU-90, has been approved</i>

<i>RDU-90 is considered
the perfect painkiller</i>

38

Let's go to my…

67
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:10,075
<i>Water has been leaking
from an apartment in Mapo-gu</i>

68
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:13,453
<i>although it had been built
less than a year ago.</i>

69
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:16,331
<i>Poor construction has been suspected
as the cause.</i>

70
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,874
You're really closing down

71
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,001
this law firm, right?

72
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,419
<i>There had been issues…</i>

73
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:22,337
Yes.

74
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,632
<i>The residents are preparing</i>

75
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:30,846
<i>to file a lawsuit against the constructor

76
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,641
<i>cracks on the walls, and the frequent
malfunctioning of the elevator.</i>

77
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:38,019
<i>There has been an increasing number
of complaints regarding apartments,</i>

78
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:43,567
<i>and people have asked the government
to come up with an effective solution.</i>

79
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,860
<i>Next news.</i>

80
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:47,696
<i>This morning,
an unidentified male body was found</i>

<i>in the coastal waters of Gijang, Busan.</i>

82

<i>The police are currently trying
to identify the man…</i>

83
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,747
They've decided

84
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,750
to close the law firm.

85
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,672
You seem quite despondent.

86
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:10,427
Damn it. I haven't done anything for him.

87
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,804
What could you have done?

88
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:15,307
Were you going to beat up those bastards?

89
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,225
Why not? I could have if I wanted.

90
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:21,438
Then who will take care
of our plaza's issue?

91
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:25,150
Didn't Mr. Cassano say he'd buy a building
and let us move there?

92
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,818
Do you actually believe him?

93
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:29,905
I wonder how he's doing.

94
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:31,948
They said he'd wake up in a week.

95
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:34,951
He has been unconscious
for 9 days and 13 hours.

96
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:36,703
Mr. An.

97
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:40,582
Why would you count the days
he's been hospitalized?

98
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:43,293
I just enjoy counting time.

99
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,711
One hour, two hours…

100
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:47,964
I also don't believe
that he'll move us to another building.

101
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:50,759
-I think he was just bluffing.
-Bluffing?

102
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:53,803
He's not the type to bluff.

103
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,015
You're wrong. He bluffs quite a bit.

104
00:12:57,098 --> 00:13:00,018
He criticizes my dishes
as if he was a connoisseur.

105
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:04,272
He's been in a huge accident.
He must hate this country now.

106
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:06,441
So he'll probably return to Italy.

107
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,526
You're right.

108
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,446
He has no time to think
about other people like us.

109
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,697
Did you know?

110
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:19,704
Mr. Cassano installed electric pads
at the temple for the monks.

111
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:22,749
He also taught some boys
who were smoking around here a lesson.

112
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,210
Goodness. Really?

113
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:28,755
I believe you're making him out to be
more selfish than he actually is.

114
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,675
That's how I feel.

115
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,766
It's been ten days

116
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:42,894
since Dad passed away.

117
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,483
The media has painted him
as a crooked lawyer.

118
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,321
I've closed down Law Firm Jipuragi today.

119
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:56,950
But I have yet to find closure.

120
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,871
I don't believe
that it was a mere freak accident.

121
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,377
So I want to do something about this.

122
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,505
But I have no evidence.

123
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,216
I don't know where to start…

124
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:24,436
I must be crazy.

125
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,481
I said I wouldn't cry.

126
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,444
Don't be an idiot.

127
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,199
Get up and say something already.

128
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:40,201
I'm so frustrated.

129
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:43,288
I'm paying for this private room
and your hospital bills

130
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:44,956
just to hear your story.

131
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,375
Do you even know how much it costs?

132
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,628
-Then let's go to the bank first.
-Just wire it to me.

133
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,645
You woke up so randomly.

134
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:08,855
What is going on?

135
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:13,943
Let's go.

136
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:17,364
Where do you think you're going?
We need to see if you're all right.

137
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:20,366
Let's check for any numbness
or cognitive disorder.

138
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,745
The numbness subsided last night.

139
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:24,954
You woke up last night?

140
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,289
I remember everything.

141
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:30,502
And I recognize you,
so I'm fine, aren't I?

142
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,636
Then did you hear me cry just now?

143
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,640
You didn't sound like an idiot at all,

144
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:46,643
so don't worry.

145
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:50,063
Hey.

146
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:54,651
Why didn't he tell me that he was awake?

147
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,145
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

148
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:34,023
I sent this to my daughter recently
as a wake-up call.

149
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:35,525
RELINQUISHMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS

150
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:40,363
She'd become an incredible lawyer
if only she could think straight.

151
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:44,242
Times have changed.

152
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:47,996
Earnest, upright,
and old-fashioned lawyers like me

153
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,415
can never beat the people who are corrupt.

154
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:52,375
You need someone

155
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,044
who's strong and brazen.

156
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:58,339
Cha-young fits that criteria perfectly.

157
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:02,719
Then you should've told her so yourself.

158
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,387
She would never listen to me.

159
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,140
Maybe later. When the time's right.

160
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,728
<i>If I don't get the chance to tell her,
you should do it for me.</i>

161
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,534
Why do you carry around that lighter
when you don't smoke?

162
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:33,041
Because the sound helps me
focus and calm down.

163
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,962
What's your plan?

164
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,590
Something smells fishy.

165
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,888
I'm going to look into the accident
and the driver himself again.

166
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:49,891
It's all over.

167
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,186
I'm aware of that.

168
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:56,564
I just want to double-check.

169
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:00,610
Why?

170
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,405
Is this your way
of paying your father back?

171
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,367
That's not it.

172
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:10,338
I may discover something new.

173
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,916
Until two weeks ago, you were his enemy.

174
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,335
But not anymore?

175
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,381
You should've done that sooner.

176
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:23,925
Are head injuries known

177
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,261
to make people rude?

178
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,012
Anyway, don't do anything.

179
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:29,556
Nothing will change.

180
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,975
How can you say that
to a bereaved family member?

181
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,851
I've always wanted to tell you this.

182
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,229
Goodbye.

183
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,368
I'm so dumbfounded.

184
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:53,913
How dare he make me out to be
a horrible daughter?

185
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:56,332
<i>…a countermeasure is said
to be in the works.</i>

186
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,961
<i>Next news. The unidentified body
found in Gijang this morning</i>

187
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:03,298
<i>turned out to be a researcher
from a pharmaceutical company.</i>

188
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:08,678
<i>The police have notified
the family members of his death and…</i>

189
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:22,817
<i>Yu, a researcher, sent his will
to his company through a scheduled email.</i>

190
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,194
<i>The police believe it was suicide.</i>

191
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,572
<i>The company had been interrogating him</i>

192
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,992
<i>for siphoning pharmaceutical ingredients,
putting the victim under stress.</i>

193
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,828
<i>The police believe he committed suicide
due to the pressure.</i>

194
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:36,581
<i>The police will hand over his will
to his family</i>

195
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:39,459
<i>and investigate the incident
more thoroughly.</i>

196
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,377
<i>I'm Choi Yu-bin from YSN News.</i>

197
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:49,719
Detective Gu.

198
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:53,139
There's a pressing matter
you must look into right now.

199
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,091
Mr. Nam.

200
00:19:55,716 --> 00:20:00,638
I'll be your bodyguard
and do chores around the office for you.

201
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,431
Please don't close it down.

202
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:06,269
We can't keep the place for long.
Our registration will expire soon.

203
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,187
If this is about money,

204
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,940
sell anything you have to my pawnshop.

205
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:13,067
I'll give you a good price.

206
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,152
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:16,779
We have no money.

208
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,739
-Well…
-Gosh.

209
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:20,116
Sir!

210
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,909
-What?
-Sir!

211
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:23,452
You're back!

212
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,289
-Mr. Cassano.
-Sir.

213
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,543
I was worried.

214
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,420
Thank you.

215
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:35,506
You look better than I thought you'd be.

216
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,344
-Well, then.
-Wait.

217
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:44,682
About what you said about helping us
move to another building…

218
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,475
Let's talk about it next time.

219
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,104
-I need some rest.
-But…

220
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:53,232
By "talk about it next time,"

221
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:56,068
do you mean you'll reconsider it?

222
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:01,782
I mean we should talk about it again
next time.

223
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,535
Did you change your mind?

224
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:10,374
Aren't Italians known for being punctual
and keeping their promises?

225
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,918
Aren't they?

226
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,836
You can't do that.

227
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,213
We've put our trust in you.

228
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:17,757
We have nothing.

229
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,217
You shouldn't confuse people like us.

230
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:21,802
-You're right.
-Right.

231
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,763
-Come on, now.
-Let's go in.

232
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:25,514
We need food on our table!

233
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,892
-I told you, didn't I?
-This can't be.

234
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:29,810
-This is unfair.
-I knew it.

235
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:31,771
-Why won't he tell us?
-He can't do that.

236
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:33,147
Listen!

237
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:36,734
Don't you think you're being rude?

238
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,903
You're receiving free help from me,

239
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:42,448
and all you can do is suspect me
and complain?

240
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:44,742
Is it because we didn't pay him?

241
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,160
What I mean is,

242
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:48,746
you should at least
have an ounce of faith!

243
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,626
Since we've been betrayed so many times,

244
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,753
it's not easy for us to trust anyone.

245
00:21:56,253 --> 00:21:59,090
You should walk in our shoes for once.

246
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:00,174
Keep this up,

247
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:02,802
and I'll have no desire
to keep my promise.

248
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,012
So you're going back on your words.

249
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:08,140
That's not what he meant!

250
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:09,934
Damn it! I'm so frustrated!

251
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:12,561
If you keep being wishy-washy,

252
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:16,440
we won't be able to trust you.

253
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:19,443
Fine.

254
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:23,364
If you can't trust me,
you should look for another lawyer.

255
00:22:24,949 --> 00:22:26,242
But…

256
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:28,869
What a wonderful sight.

257
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,287
It is, isn't it?

258
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,083
Goodness.

259
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:38,170
I came here thinking you could be making
Molotov cocktails together.

260
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:40,131
I love how you've fallen apart.

261
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:42,675
This was exactly what I was hoping to see.

262
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,052
Let's see.

263
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:47,680
That geezer of a lawyer is dead now.

264
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,891
And they've ousted the Italian lawyer.

265
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:54,729
All right, then.
Let's talk compensation, shall we?

266
00:22:54,812 --> 00:22:56,021
I'll be generous.

267
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,941
Generous, my foot.
He's not running a charity.

268
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:00,693
I can hear you.

269
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:02,153
Isn't it too hot for a beanie?

270
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:05,197
Your face is like a heat wave.
Your face suffocates me.

271
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:08,117
Then is your face the rainy season?
It's so dark and gloomy.

272
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,202
What? What did you just say?

273
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:12,163
Cut the nonsense and leave.

274
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:14,206
How obnoxious. This doesn't involve you.

275
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,292
Stop trying to act cool.

276
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,753
How do we negotiate with you?

277
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:21,672
-Larry?
-We should at least discuss it.

278
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:23,632
Come to my office with your seal,

279
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:25,968
and we'll get it all sorted out at once.

280
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:31,932
Hey, Mr. Italian Lawyer.

281
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:38,647
What did you do to Mr. Na
that he's acting all scared?

282
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:40,816
What's it to you?

283
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,984
You little bastard!

284
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,028
Your bluffing is on another level!

285
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:47,114
Shut up. Adults are trying to talk here.

286
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:49,825
He was being way obnoxious.
I couldn't help it.

287
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:51,535
I'm sorry.

288
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:55,456
Listen carefully.

289
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:59,877
The day we demolish this place
and pour our first cement,

290
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,128
you will be under it.

291
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,593
Then you'll be there with me,

292
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,429
since I enjoy people's company.

293
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,353
Why you…

294
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:19,522
-He hit him.
-He got hit.

295
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,565
-He hit him.
-He slapped his face.

296
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:24,151
I swear he has a few screws loose.

297
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,111
He's not scared of anything.

298
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:29,073
It's all over now.

299
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,909
I'm not this generous usually.

300
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,703
-Hurry up and go.
-Let's go.

301
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:38,749
All right. You first, Larry.

302
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,918
You can use your thumbprint as well.

303
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,419
-Well…
-Let's go right away.

304
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:45,256
-What about an unofficial seal?
-That's fine too.

305
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,800
<i>Your guess was correct.</i>

306
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:50,427
<i>It was Yu Min-chul,
the researcher for Babel, who died.</i>

307
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:51,679
Cha-young.

308
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,015
Cha-young.

309
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:00,229
Hey, Cha-young.

310
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,648
Weren't you coming back tomorrow?

311
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,111
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

312
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:09,989
Why?

313
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:13,742
Mr. Yu Min-chul, the researcher,
and my father passed away.

314
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:16,036
-Was it a coincidence?
-What do you mean?

315
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,536
Did Babel Pharmaceuticals scheme this
along with Wusang?

316
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:21,020
Without my knowing.

317
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:26,130
I know you're not really yourself
right now,

318
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,385
but such a conjecture is inexcusable.

319
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:32,219
-Come back first.
-Please process my resignation.

320
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,889
Come on, Cha-young. What's with you?

321
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:38,517
Let her do what she wants. Let her resign.

322
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:45,024
There's no use keeping a hound
that bites the hand that feeds.

323
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:51,447
There are no bad dogs to begin with.

324
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:54,853
-It's mostly their owners' fault.
-Be honest.

325
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,537
You planned to double-cross us,
but things went awry, right?

326
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:04,958
That's such a lousy story you have.

327
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:09,048
I was going easy on you until now
since we were a family.

328
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:11,467
But not anymore.

329
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,385
Thank you for the encouragement.

330
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:19,558
Cha-young!

331
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:22,519
Are you seriously leaving?
You have to return everything.

332
00:26:22,603 --> 00:26:25,731
Your car keys,
and what about your studio apartment?

333
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,654
Here are my car keys.

334
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,822
I'll give you my house key
after I move out.

335
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:35,784
Cha-young.

336
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,351
Know your place.

337
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:52,094
I don't even have to lift a finger

338
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,052
to snap your neck like a twig.

339
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,201
Thank you for motivating me.

340
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:14,780
ATTORNEY HONG CHA-YOUNG

341
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:18,450
Hey, you're overreacting.

342
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:19,785
This isn't right.

343
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,495
You're being awfully casual today.

344
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,580
That's not the issue here.

345
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:24,665
Cha-young.

346
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:26,875
No, I won't let you go.

347
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,503
Tell the boss

348
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:33,424
that you made a mistake
because you were grieving.

349
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:35,426
And beg.

350
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:37,886
Koreans forgive you when you beg, right?

351
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:42,603
If you're too out of line,
even begging doesn't work.

352
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,810
No. Still, don't go.

353
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:49,148
I'll help you with everything.

354
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,441
I…

355
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:53,027
I can be your spy. Like James Bond.

356
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:54,945
Joon-woo.

357
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:57,397
Cha-young.

358
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:04,747
You're like glue.
Move. I need to move out of my house.

359
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,332
No.

360
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:09,251
Cha-young. If you leave like this,

361
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:12,040
I'll never see you again. Never.

362
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:15,336
Make your choice.

363
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:26,477
Cha-young!

364
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:31,482
It's over for us. Over!

365
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:18,487
<i>The public has shown great interest</i>

366
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,448
<i>in Babel Pharmaceuticals' new drug,
RDU-90.</i>

367
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:24,535
<i>Thanks to its lasting effects
and the lack of side effects,</i>

368
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:27,871
<i>it was known to be an innovative drug
since it was under clinical trial.</i>

369
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:30,999
<i>After learning about its upcoming release,</i>

370
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:35,462
<i>many countries such as Vietnam
and Mongolia have shown interest.</i>

371
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:39,508
<i>Babel Pharmaceuticals is willing
to do anything with open arms</i>

372
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:43,220
<i>if it's pertaining to the people's health.</i>

373
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:47,558
<i>During the testing period,
the company was involved in a lawsuit.</i>

374
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,310

00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:54,148

were exposed,</i>

376
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:56,984

NAMDO AUNTIE'S RESTAURANT

379
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:18,964
DO NOT CROSS

380
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,311
How dare you?

381
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:20,651
How…

382
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:52,224
I need to ask you a favor.

383
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:54,851
I keep asking you for favors.

384
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:57,145
Goodness, don't say that.

385
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:03,026
If it wasn't for you, I would have been
compost in a vineyard in Milano.

386
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:06,363
Tell me what you need.

387
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,821
Damn it! What the hell is that?

388
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:51,783
Who the hell could've done that?

389
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:56,955
What is certain is that
it wasn't the work of some small fry.

390
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,249
I agree.

391
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,335
It's Chairman Jang's house
for Pete's sake.

392
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:06,131
It's not easy to break into his room
with the security system and the guards.

393
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:10,886
I really don't know any opponents of ours

394
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,763
who'd hire such experts.

395
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:14,097
What are you doing there?

396
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:15,265
-What?
-Sorry?

397
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:16,350
REP. ATTORNEY

398
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,852
Oh, I'm formatting and reinstalling.

399
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:21,563
The computer was damaged by a virus.

400
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:24,775
-Why not call the tech team?
-He's not good at his job,

401
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:26,943
-but quite tech-savvy.
-Right.

402
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:28,612
Get it done and leave already.

403
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,949
My goodness.

404
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:37,788
We need to give Chairman Jang something
if we want to placate him.

405
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,625
How about her for the time being?

406
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,044
-Who?
-Someone who has a motive.

407
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,213
Her?

408
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:50,676
Come on, that's not right. How could you?

409
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,886
God, you're really evil.

410
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:56,807
We believe Ms. Hong Cha-young
is the most ideal suspect.

411
00:33:57,516 --> 00:34:00,686
I knew it was that lawyer!

412
00:34:01,436 --> 00:34:04,690
She's blaming my company
for her father's death!

413
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:09,236
Whatever. Put her behind bars
this instant.

414
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,625
All right.

415
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:27,045
Keep smiling.

416
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,925
Pretty soon, you'll be shedding
tears of blood.

417
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,262
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR BABEL

418
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,658
Dad.

419
00:34:57,242 --> 00:35:01,163
I don't think I can be a wonderful lawyer
like you.

420
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:05,083
But, instead,
I'll be one hell of a tenacious lawyer.

421
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:16,219
I hope we get along.

422
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,431
I hope we get along.

423
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,435
Sir, I hope we get along.

424
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:25,937
I hope we get along.

425
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,439
You're so beautiful.

426
00:35:28,023 --> 00:35:29,316
-I hope we get along.
-Okay.

427
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:31,359
You're also beautiful.

428
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:44,790
Law Firm Jipuragi has come back to life!

429
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:52,964
Feel free to ask me for help.

430
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:58,136
Does this mean we'll resume
what we've been working on?

431
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,348
Yes. I will continue my dad's work
regarding the lawsuit

432
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,183
related to this building's tenants.

433
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:06,728
Then what about Mr. Cassano?

434
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:10,065
Forget about him.
He can do whatever he likes.

435
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:12,692
We have her now.

436
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:15,266
I hope we get along.

437
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,990
Congratulations.

438
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:23,954
In any case,
I'll help you guys from now on.

439
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:28,166
Word has it that you were working
in opposition to your father.

440
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,128
That's all in the past.

441
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:35,155
I've been born again.

442
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:39,239
I will fight against corruption
and injustice while obeying the law.

443
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,263
With warmth and benevolence,

444
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:44,266
-I will embrace you--
-Ms. Hong Cha-young.

445
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:47,186
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

446
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:51,432
You're under arrest
for trespassing and blackmail.

447
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,928
-Let's make this easy.
-What do you mean?

448
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:55,860
Stay still.

449
00:36:55,944 --> 00:36:57,737
-Ms. Hong.
-What are you doing?

450
00:36:57,821 --> 00:36:59,614
-Come on.
-Don't cause a scene.

451
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:00,991
-No!
-Stop.

452
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:02,242
Come on!

453
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:05,370
I've been home since 7 p.m. last night.

454
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:09,499
For now, we can't verify
that you went home and stayed there.

455
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:12,669
Then check my phone's location
during the time of the incident.

456
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:15,255
Then you'll be able to verify that.

457
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,841
You could've left your phone at home
and gone out.

458
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:24,306
Are you saying I singlehandedly penetrated
Chairman Jang's security,

459
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:27,350
broke into his bedroom,
and put 50 syringes in his pillow?

460
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,436
Do you think I'm Black Widow?

461
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,062
-She was arrested?
-Yes.

462
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:33,273
They suddenly came and took her.

463
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:36,943
Did she break into someone's house
and threaten them?

464
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:37,861
She did.

465
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:41,072
How did you know that?

466
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,180
I didn't. I was just guessing.

467
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:46,661
I can't get her out.

468
00:37:46,745 --> 00:37:49,414
-So if you could help--
-She's competent enough

469
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:52,167
to get out of there before evening.
Don't worry.

470
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,585
Wait, sir.

471
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,670
We'd appreciate a bit of help.

472
00:37:55,754 --> 00:37:56,755
Please?

473
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:00,744
I…

474
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:05,082
I have an opera to watch.

475
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,309
What? An opera?

476
00:38:25,748 --> 00:38:29,001
<i>I don't need to worry about her.
She'll get out on her own.</i>

477
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:34,070
AM I EVIL?

478
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:45,929
"If I am indeed evil,

479
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:49,766
it's because…

480
00:38:52,102 --> 00:38:53,478
of you."

481
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:19,002
<i>I called the police station,
and things aren't looking good.</i>

482
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:22,090
Why can't she get out of there?

483
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:24,509
Jeez.

484
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,945
Come on!

485
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:34,978
Can you please be quiet? Please?

486
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,400
Her records are clean,
and her alibi checks out.

487
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:44,279
Her second-floor neighbor confirmed
seeing her through the window.

488
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,947
This is driving me crazy.

489
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:48,612
Wusang already paid us.

490
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:52,158
First, let's order some breakfast for her.

491
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:52,948
Okay.

492
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:08,511
-Cha-young.
-What? Hey.

493
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:13,389
You should've called sooner.
Wasn't I your only hope?

494
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:15,382
No, you were the 57th person I called.

495
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:16,478
What?

496
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:20,774
Who are you?

497
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:24,527
I'm from Law Firm Wusang.

498
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,009
I'm Lawyer Jang Joon-woo.

499
00:40:27,197 --> 00:40:29,906
Why did you come here, sir?

500
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,960
I'll sue if you've broken any rules

501
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,894
-while investigating.
-Stop embarrassing me.

502
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:35,955
Do you have proof?

503
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,582
You don't, right? Right?

504
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,210
That's enough.

505
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:41,586
So why is she still here?

506
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:44,047
I want to see your commanding officer.

507
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:45,482
This instant.

508
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:49,260
You should know better
than to throw a tantrum like this!

509
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,637
"A tantrum"?

510
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:56,059
Did he just curse at me?

511
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:59,020
Yes, he did.
He pretty much said, "You son of a…"

512
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:02,690
-How dare you?
-Here's your proof.

513
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,450
This is CCTV footage taken from
a convenience store in front of her house.

514
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:16,871
It shows that she came home from work

515
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:19,457
at 6:27 p.m. two nights ago

516
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:22,627
and stayed home until 8:12 a.m.
yesterday morning.

517
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:24,304
And who are you?

518
00:41:25,046 --> 00:41:27,423
I'm a lawyer and her legal representative.

519
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:29,641
What's gotten into him?

520
00:41:31,344 --> 00:41:35,890
Now, show me a irrefutable proof
that she had an accomplice.

521
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:42,450
If you don't have anything,

522
00:41:43,565 --> 00:41:45,692
she has every right to be released.

523
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:49,070
I was going to get you out of here. Right?

524
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:52,172
Do you have proof?

525
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:55,298
Do you?

526
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,091
Gosh, I knew it.

527
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:12,010
I'm hungry now that I feel better.

528
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:14,137
Order me some food before I go.

529
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:18,057
Who ordered the cheeseburgers
from BurgerJura?

530
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:19,392
Here!

531
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:27,483
Please calm down

532
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,486
and have some food.

533
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:33,615
You should've ordered some <i>seolleongtang</i>.

534
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:37,869
Did you only bring one ketchup?

535
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,871
Enjoy your meal.

536
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,214
I was going to have that.

537
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:52,300
Never mind. Go ahead.

538
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:54,886
Order some more burgers.

539
00:42:57,555 --> 00:42:59,807
-Isn't it too greasy?
-No.

540
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:05,939
I just can't have fries without ketchup.

541
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:07,398
It's so greasy.

542
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:09,817
Why didn't I think
of that convenience store?

543
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:15,740
POLICE

544
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:17,784
Yes, we're done here.

545
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,664
Okay. I'll leave as soon as I'm done here.

546
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,088
It's fine. Yes.

547
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:32,674
I'll see you later. All right.

548
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:38,137
Tell me the truth. It was you, wasn't it?

549
00:43:38,805 --> 00:43:42,350
You only came out of guilt
because they arrested me. Right?

550
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:44,519
You felt guilty.

551
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:45,979
What are you talking about?

552
00:43:48,523 --> 00:43:50,650
Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano?

553
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:58,716
You're the first Korean
to pronounce my name correctly.

554
00:44:00,243 --> 00:44:03,913
I used to be her assistant back in Wusang.
I'm Jang Joon-woo.

555
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:07,152
How do you know me?

556
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:11,337
Because I did a background check
on you for Cha-young.

557
00:44:13,756 --> 00:44:16,634
I was relieved to see
that you had no priors.

558
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:19,667
I should get going.

559
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:21,739
-Go. I'm leaving too.
-What?

560
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:23,282
Wait up!

561
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:24,826
But I just got here.

562
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,491
You can't just leave.

563
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:30,331
Gosh, it hurts.

564
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:32,595
I should get to work.

565
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:40,491
Welcome.

566
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,787
A double shot of espresso to have here.

567
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:47,998
Just have a cool, iced Americano.

568
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:54,672
In Italy, Americano is no better
than sewage waste.

569
00:44:56,423 --> 00:44:58,217
One iced sewage waste for me.

570
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:09,728
I'm the most sharp-witted person in Asia,

571
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:11,146
so come clean already.

572
00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:18,404
You must be the best
at feigning ignorance.

573
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:22,116
Don't you think this is a bit harsh
after what you put me through?

574
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,286
I thought you'd find your way out.

575
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:31,792
I apologize.

576
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:35,546
-I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
-Are you really?

577
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:39,425
It's as if you're apologizing
for canceling my song at a karaoke.

578
00:45:39,508 --> 00:45:42,761
I get pretty upset
when someone does that to me.

579
00:45:42,845 --> 00:45:44,346
Why the hell did you do it?

580
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,723
Because I was furious.

581
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:47,349
-What?
-That's how I operate.

582
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:48,976
"An eye for an eye."

583
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:53,188
Who do you think you are? Hammurabi?

584
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:56,108
"An eye for an eye," my foot.

585
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:58,319
I had to suffer because of you.

586
00:45:58,402 --> 00:45:59,862
I'll be careful from now on.

587
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:01,322
There's more?

588
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:03,741
Close down your law firm.

589
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:08,412
Who are you to tell me to do that?

590
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:11,290
Don't involve yourself with Wusang
or the Babel Group.

591
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:14,335
I refuse to accept such stupid advice.

592
00:46:19,798 --> 00:46:22,760
Do you know who called your father
before he died?

593
00:46:24,678 --> 00:46:26,305
The caller ID was RDU.

594
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,390
It was Mr. Yu Min-chul.

595
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,101
That's when I knew

596
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:33,646
that he and your father were connected.

597
00:46:33,729 --> 00:46:36,065
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

598
00:46:36,148 --> 00:46:38,233
That's such important information.

599
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:41,028
-I could've brought down Babel and--
-Nothing will change.

600
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,908
You may be able to prove
that Mr. Hong and Mr. Yu were connected.

601
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:49,703
But the fact that someone intentionally
killed them off?

602
00:46:50,913 --> 00:46:52,247
You can't prove that.

603
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:56,168
It will take time, but it's possible
if I gather the evidence.

604
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:02,299
You should know best…

605
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:07,137
that Wusang and Babel are invincible.

606
00:47:09,973 --> 00:47:12,351
Giving up on a hopeless war will give you

607
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:14,687
a new opportunity.

608
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:28,701
<i>Yes.</i>

609
00:47:28,784 --> 00:47:32,162
<i>If I can't do this alone,
I'm sure someone will help me.</i>

610
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,667
<i>I've helped out so many people.</i>

611
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:50,139
<i>What's this? Gosh, I'm sorry.</i>

612
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,607
<i>Put your faith in God.
He will show you the way.</i>

613
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:10,868
<i>The person you have called is unavailable,
so please leave a voicemail.</i>

614
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:13,704
<i>Your call will be charged after the beep.</i>

615
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:20,836
<i>Cha-young.</i>

616
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:24,214
<i>A rumor's been going around
that you were on Ms. Choi's blacklist.</i>

617
00:48:24,298 --> 00:48:26,258
<i>Who do you think is going to help you?</i>

618
00:48:26,341 --> 00:48:28,135
<i>I don't want to cut my career short.</i>

619
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,931
Gosh!

620
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,022
What is this about?

621
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:45,319
LAW FIRM JIPURAGI

622
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,577
They're all similar lawsuits
that I've won.

623
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,788
Real estate redemption
for small businesses

624
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,916
that have lost their ownership
due to large companies.

625
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,835
I did it without Wusang's knowledge.

626
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:04,046
I got a hefty sum for them.

627
00:49:09,384 --> 00:49:11,512
I'll help you get back Geumga Plaza.

628
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:13,597
I don't care why you want it,

629
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,141
but I just know
that you need it desperately.

630
00:49:16,225 --> 00:49:18,393
No, you need it at all costs.

631
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,145
You're the real owner, right?

632
00:49:28,278 --> 00:49:30,030
Why are you giving me this offer?

633
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:32,157
Let me in on whatever you're scheming.

634
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:33,492
Why should I?

635
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:36,161
Shouldn't I be the one
who's upset the most?

636
00:49:37,996 --> 00:49:39,706
It was my dad who died wrongfully.

637
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:46,004
Even still,

638
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:48,549
I can't let you.
It's not something a lawyer should do.

639
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:55,305
Right now, I'm not speaking to you
as a lawyer,

640
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:58,433
but as Hong Yu-chan's undutiful daughter.

641
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,529
Promise me you'll quit
if you cause a hindrance.

642
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:12,739
Deal.

643
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:17,035
Grab one.

644
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,497
-Why?
-We'll clink these instead of glasses.

645
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:22,457
-No, thanks.
-Hurry up.

646
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,626
Don't you want Geumga Plaza back?

647
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:35,971
Are you ready to turn the tables on them?

648
00:51:10,088 --> 00:51:13,717
Gosh, had those brakes not malfunctioned,

649
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:17,429
he wouldn't have died,
and you wouldn't have gotten injured.

650
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,932
They should do a better job
assembling cars.

651
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:24,895
You're just as insincere as you were
when you were interrogated.

652
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:28,482
I'm here to serve my time, aren't I?

653
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,859
Isn't that because

654
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,279
you made and circulated videos
that sexually exploited minors?

655
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:37,074
Why would you bring that up right now?

656
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:40,285
Did they promise to reduce your sentence
if you killed him

657
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,621
-and disguised it as an accident?
-What?

658
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:45,540
That's ridiculous.

659
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,167
But then again,

660
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:52,714
Wusang could give you a sentence
of two years or less

661
00:51:53,423 --> 00:51:56,802
thanks to Korea's lousy
and ludicrous sentencing guidelines.

662
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:00,764
I have no idea what you're on about.

663
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:05,060
I'm going to stand trial for what I did.

664
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:11,692
Shut up and listen carefully.

665
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:16,780
Tell me the truth from now on.

666
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,242
If you don't, you'll die tonight

667
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:23,829
just by brushing shoulders with someone.

668
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:31,545
What?

669
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:34,131
Did you think I'd be intimidated?

670
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:37,718
Who ordered you

671
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:39,845
to kill him with the truck?

672
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,396
This is your last chance.

673
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:53,567
Who ordered you?

674
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:57,863
Spill it, you asshole.

675
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:06,163
Let's go.

676
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,334
Wait.

677
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:19,009
Mr. Pyo.

678
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:21,553
I don't know his full name.

679
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:28,060
Mr. Pyo?

680
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:30,145
Just him?

681
00:53:30,228 --> 00:53:32,606
There was someone who looked like
his boss,

682
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:34,107
but I only know his number.

683
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:35,609
What does he do?

684
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:36,902
I don't know.

685
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:40,864
He came to the police station
where I was at and promised me

686
00:53:40,947 --> 00:53:43,492
that Wusang would reduce my sentence
if I did as told.

687
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:46,745
-I'm going to kill you all.
-I'm sorry.

688
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:49,247
I'm truly sorry.

689
00:53:50,582 --> 00:53:52,667
-What's the number?
-Sorry?

690
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:10,227
That's enough. Let's go.

691
00:54:15,357 --> 00:54:17,526
He's the one who did it.

692
00:54:20,362 --> 00:54:22,697
But I can't do anything to him.

693
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,955
I can't leave here empty-handed.

694
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:43,051
Mr. Lee!

695
00:54:44,344 --> 00:54:46,555
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

696
00:54:47,848 --> 00:54:52,144
I'm very relieved to hear
that you'll side with us!

697
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:53,478
What are you doing?

698
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:58,024
We'll re-investigate the incident

699
00:54:58,108 --> 00:54:59,776
according to your testimony

700
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:02,320
and get to the bottom of this.

701
00:55:02,404 --> 00:55:03,947
Why are you doing this?

702
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,074
That's not true. He's lying.

703
00:55:06,158 --> 00:55:07,450
Mr. Lee!

704
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,413
Your sense of justice will prevail.
Thank you so much!

705
00:55:11,496 --> 00:55:12,664
-What?
-Let's go.

706
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:17,919
-Wait.
-Thank you.

707
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:21,756
Wait! Hey!

708
00:55:22,424 --> 00:55:23,508
Damn it!

709
00:55:37,022 --> 00:55:40,108
Is this how lawyers in Italy
get their jobs done?

710
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:44,613
There are more heinous criminals there
than here.

711
00:55:45,697 --> 00:55:47,741
I'm very satisfied right now.

712
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:50,285
I think we have great teamwork as well.

713
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:52,454
You didn't chip in at all.

714
00:55:52,537 --> 00:55:54,039
What do you mean?

715
00:55:54,122 --> 00:55:56,958
I stayed emotional
and maintained the tension.

716
00:55:57,042 --> 00:55:58,668
I said all the lines.

717
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:00,253
Talking is important,

718
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:02,505
but setting the mood is also important.

719
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:04,007
How could you not know that?

720
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,719
Anyway, I loved the noir vibe as well.

721
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:11,097
That wasn't even the tip of the iceberg.

722
00:56:12,307 --> 00:56:13,308
Don't tell me

723
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:15,727
you'll shoot someone.

724
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:18,688
You can't own guns in Korea.

725
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:20,273
That won't happen.

726
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:22,275
Good. We're not filming a movie.

727
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,737
Let's go find Mr. Pyo.

728
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:33,578
What do you mean? An unexpected situation?

729
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:34,996
Yes.

730
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,208
It looks like the truck driver
is going to jump ship.

731
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,459
<i>Elaborate.</i>

732
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:44,172
Hong Cha-young and that Italian lawyer
stopped by.

733
00:56:44,256 --> 00:56:46,258
<i>It seemed like they were colluding.</i>

734
00:56:46,341 --> 00:56:47,550
Damn it.

735
00:57:11,574 --> 00:57:12,576
I'm sorry.

736
00:57:15,453 --> 00:57:17,080
Sorry doesn't cut it.

737
00:57:17,163 --> 00:57:19,207
You've dislocated my shoulder.

738
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,793
<i>You'll die tonight</i>

739
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,628
just by brushing shoulders with someone.

740
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:27,340
How dare you ignore me when I'm talking?

741
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:33,221
-Get him!
-Come here!

742
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:42,564
-Run!
-Run! Hurry!

743
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:43,648
Damn it!

744
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:55,368
Okay. I see.

745
00:57:56,828 --> 00:57:58,163
Thank you for telling me.

746
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:20,185
Lee Chung-il

747
00:58:22,187 --> 00:58:25,398
got himself into a fight
and was stabbed to death.

748
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:37,702
Are you glad?

749
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:43,958
It's annoying, and I feel like shit.

750
00:58:45,835 --> 00:58:47,379
This isn't what I imagined.

751
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,382
You can quit now if you want.

752
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:51,466
No.

753
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:54,552
I stand by my decision.

754
00:58:57,514 --> 00:58:59,265
Let's promise one thing.

755
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:03,228
We'll do whatever it takes,

756
00:59:04,437 --> 00:59:06,981
but let's not do anything
that takes people's lives.

757
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,465
Mr. Pyo's full name is Pyo Hyeok-pil.

758
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,301
I've located his whereabouts. See you.

759
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:36,386
Let me come with you.

760
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:38,388
Stay here. He may be dangerous.

761
00:59:38,471 --> 00:59:40,223
Victory and quantity go hand in hand.

762
00:59:40,932 --> 00:59:42,392
There's no harm in me coming.

763
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:43,435
Sir.

764
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:50,150
Let me come with you.

765
00:59:52,026 --> 00:59:56,030
I've finally learned about your plan.

766
00:59:57,615 --> 00:59:59,784
What are you doing there?

767
00:59:59,868 --> 01:00:02,412
I drank during the day
and fell asleep here.

768
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:04,748
You two woke me up.

769
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:05,832
You heard everything?

770
01:00:05,915 --> 01:00:09,377
Yes, but I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

771
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:13,381
Anyway, I'd like to avenge Mr. Hong.

772
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:16,217
I'll do anything.

773
01:00:36,654 --> 01:00:38,823
I've kept my skills hidden
for a long time.

774
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:43,620
Just tell me if you need them.

775
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:45,997
Skills?

776
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:11,749
When you make dirty money,
you're bound to lose them gambling.

777
01:02:16,421 --> 01:02:18,756
Hey. Were you talking to me?

778
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:24,846
You're the only one here
who abetted murder.

779
01:02:28,975 --> 01:02:30,143
Who are you?

780
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:37,358
I hate to admit it,
but I'm someone who needs you.

781
01:03:15,146 --> 01:03:16,356
The floor is filthy.

782
01:03:17,065 --> 01:03:20,276
My hands will get dirty moving him.

783
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:23,488
You two take care of this.

784
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:26,741
Please hold his arms,
and I'll hold his legs.

785
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:31,496
I don't think I've recovered fully
from my head injury.

786
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:35,708
Right, you need to recuperate.

787
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:47,011
PUNGMI RESTAURANT

788
01:03:47,095 --> 01:03:48,471
-Yes?
<i>-Hello, sir.</i>

789
01:03:48,554 --> 01:03:49,972
You should come here right now.

790
01:03:50,056 --> 01:03:51,349
What's wrong?

791
01:03:51,432 --> 01:03:55,103
<i>The prison guard who tipped us off
is demanding more money.</i>

792
01:03:55,186 --> 01:03:58,106
I've tried talking to him,
but he just won't listen.

793
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,900
Damn it. Where are you right now?

794
01:04:10,994 --> 01:04:12,996
Hey, where's that guard?

795
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,580
We're in huge trouble.

796
01:04:14,664 --> 01:04:15,873
What do you mean?

797
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:30,263
He's not dead, is he?

798
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:33,391
His stomach is moving.

799
01:04:34,934 --> 01:04:37,061
He has a bit of abdominal fat.

800
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,026
Come on.

801
01:05:02,587 --> 01:05:03,880
This is a Russian pistol.

802
01:05:05,465 --> 01:05:07,425
Tokarev TT-33.

803
01:05:09,761 --> 01:05:13,347
Neither the military
nor the NIS uses this model.

804
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:17,226
So how did a civilian obtain this gun?

805
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,944
Then again, you both served
in the military's intelligence division.

806
01:05:28,613 --> 01:05:31,199
It must be a cakewalk
to obtain a gun illegally.

807
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:39,832
Hurry up and answer me.

808
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:43,461
Who ordered you to kill
Mr. Hong and Mr. Yu?

809
01:05:58,643 --> 01:06:01,020
I hate wasting time as much as I hate

810
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:03,898
uncooked macaroni.

811
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:06,067
If you refuse to spill,

812
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,778
you'll end up just like Lee Chung-il did.

813
01:06:10,321 --> 01:06:12,698
Nod your head if you're willing to talk,

814
01:06:12,782 --> 01:06:14,534
and I'll spare you.

815
01:06:16,828 --> 01:06:19,372
If you don't talk,
I'll ram this into your head.

816
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:20,498
Talk!

817
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:38,474
This is your last chance.

818
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:42,061
Who was it?

819
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:47,024
Tell us. Hurry!

820
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,843
Sir.

821
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:16,053
Be careful

822
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,598
with that gun.

823
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:31,068
You have to talk now! This isn't a joke!

824
01:07:31,152 --> 01:07:32,194
Hurry!

825
01:07:57,386 --> 01:07:59,138
Did you think I wouldn't shoot?

826
01:08:00,097 --> 01:08:01,849
A gun is a murder weapon.

827
01:08:03,935 --> 01:08:06,395
Why did you do that?

828
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:09,649
We agreed not to kill anyone.

829
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:12,985
What if

830
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:16,948
he tells everyone about this?

831
01:08:26,123 --> 01:08:27,583
In that case,

832
01:08:30,962 --> 01:08:31,921
we should kill him.

RESTRICTED NUMBER

837
01:10:06,474 --> 01:10:07,433
Yes?

838
01:10:07,516 --> 01:10:10,352
There's only one way humans are born,

839
01:10:11,145 --> 01:10:14,148
-but there are countless ways to die.
<i>-Who are you?</i>

840
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:17,068
-Do you even know who I am?
<i>-Ms. Choi, I wonder which way</i>

841
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:19,820
-<i>would suit you the best.</i>
-Who the hell are you?

842
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:21,947
Someone you should fear.

843
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:31,832
It looks familiar, doesn't it?

844
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:35,211
<i>Why are you doing this?
At least tell me the reason.</i>

845
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:37,922
The owners of those bloody clothes told me

846
01:10:38,923 --> 01:10:42,927
that you ordered them to kill
Mr. Hong and Mr. Yu.

847
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,804
That's ludicrous.

848
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:46,388
Who'd believe them?

849
01:10:46,472 --> 01:10:48,307
I don't care what people believe.

850
01:10:49,141 --> 01:10:50,518
All that matters is that I do.

851
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:52,353
It really has nothing to do with me.

852
01:10:58,984 --> 01:11:00,402
<i>I'm a patient man,</i>

853
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:04,281
but I'm afraid I can't say the same
for that driver.

854
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,040
What do you want from me?

855
01:11:17,628 --> 01:11:19,588
Why is negotiating so difficult?

856
01:11:19,672 --> 01:11:21,006
What do you want?

857
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:24,218
Restore your victim Mr. Hong's honor

858
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:27,096
and those of the late test subjects
by tomorrow.

859
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,722
To do that,

860
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,852
you'll have to come clean
about what you did first.

861
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:36,939
Just kill me instead.

862
01:11:37,022 --> 01:11:40,526
Restoring their honor matters
much more than your worthless lives.

863
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:42,570
Do you think I'll listen to you?

864
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:47,741
That's up to you.

865
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:51,787
But you should remember
that freedom comes with a price.

866
01:12:33,996 --> 01:12:35,623
That darn punk…

867
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:38,834
You better stay well hidden.

868
01:12:39,793 --> 01:12:43,339
The moment I find you,
you're as good as dead.

01:17:09,646 --> 01:17:11,899
-There's a fire!
-Call 911!

882
01:17:14,193 --> 01:17:15,652
Hurry!

883
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:17,404
-Get out of there!
-Put out the fire!

884
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,284
Hurry up and call 911!

885
01:17:42,888 --> 01:17:46,016
Do you mind giving me a hand?

886
01:17:51,522 --> 01:17:53,065
One, two…

887
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:05,244
You were almost late.

888
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:07,079
You should've pulled him faster.

889
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:10,415
It's not easy
to grab onto the piano string.

890
01:18:10,499 --> 01:18:13,085
Mr. Nam's former profession paid off.

891
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:15,504
Who knew he used to be
a special effects makeup artist?

892
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:33,730
I'll spare you,

893
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:37,693
but you have to do as I say from now on.

894
01:18:38,402 --> 01:18:39,361
Okay.

895
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:45,075
We need information on
Babel Pharmaceuticals' supply warehouse.

896
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:04,928
<i>It's not hard at all.</i>

897
01:19:05,429 --> 01:19:08,265
<i>I have a knack for turning the tables.</i>

898
01:19:09,308 --> 01:19:11,560
<i>Please trust me on this. I can win this.</i>

899
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,017
Sir! We're in trouble!

900
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:54,770
There's been a fire at our warehouse!

901
01:19:56,688 --> 01:19:57,689
Move it!

902
01:19:58,357 --> 01:20:01,318
-Hey!
-Watch out!

903
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:03,528
-Over here!
-What are you doing?

904
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:09,576
You should get out of here, sir

905
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,746
-There may be toxic gases.
-Did you call 911?

906
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:14,915
-They're on their way.
-What?

907
01:20:14,998 --> 01:20:18,335
What about the sprinklers?
Why is the fire spreading so much?

908
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:20,170
Well…

909
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:28,595
AN HOUR AGO

910
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:45,278
-Run!
-Run!

911
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:46,905
Let's get out of here!

912
01:20:46,988 --> 01:20:47,864
Let's go!

913
01:21:41,042 --> 01:21:42,085
Sir.

914
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:51,678
I saw this coming!

915
01:21:52,387 --> 01:21:55,348
I'm certain that the bastards
who broke into my room did this!

916
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:56,725
Damn it!

917
01:21:57,517 --> 01:22:00,062
I'll catch them myself

918
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:03,023
and make them kneel before you!

919
01:22:03,106 --> 01:22:04,483
Shut up.

920
01:22:45,273 --> 01:22:46,399
That's incredible.

921
01:22:54,282 --> 01:22:55,659
Goodbye!

922
01:23:05,168 --> 01:23:07,128
<i>How could they make something like this?</i>

923
01:23:07,796 --> 01:23:10,882
I don't care if I go to prison.
I want to burn them down.

924
01:23:10,966 --> 01:23:13,009
All of the drugs!

925
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:33,446
"Set, stars.

926
01:23:35,323 --> 01:23:37,951
At dawn, I will win.

927
01:23:39,536 --> 01:23:41,246
I will win.

928
01:23:43,415 --> 01:23:45,542
I will win."

929
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:31,671
<i>Mr. Jang might not be the real boss.</i>

930
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:34,049
Then who could it be?

931
01:24:34,633 --> 01:24:36,801
<i>He must be Vincenzo.</i>

932
01:24:39,095 --> 01:24:40,764
That's why we need to change our approach.

933
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:44,309
<i>We'll use the law and the court,
two things we know best.</i>

934
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:47,103
I'll take all the cases
related to the Babel Group.

935
01:24:47,187 --> 01:24:49,314
<i>You have to follow my advice this time.</i>

936
01:24:49,397 --> 01:24:52,442
<i>I'm going to give you advice
on how to become a real villain.</i>

937
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:56,321
Cha-young. I can't keep going easy on you.

938
01:24:56,404 --> 01:24:58,406
<i>You can't do that.
You'll be in deep trouble.</i>

939
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:01,952
<i>Our goal is to keep fighting.</i>

940
01:25:03,495 --> 01:25:08,416
