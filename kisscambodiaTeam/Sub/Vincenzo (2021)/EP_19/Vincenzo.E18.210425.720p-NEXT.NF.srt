1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,314
Shoot first.

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,281
Vincenzo Cassano.

3
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:28,874
We're from the Interpol.

4
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:32,336
We came here to arrest you
and repatriate you.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,422
Drop your gun, Vincenzo Cassano.

6
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:18,066
Stay away! Stay away from me.

7
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:58,315
Put your guns down.

8
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,331
KIM IN-YONG

9
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:15,332
Officer Kim In-yong.

10
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,168
Officer Baek Gyeong-su.

11
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,419
Yes.

12
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:21,046
Go tell your superior

13
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,925
that the Interpol had no evidence
and went back.

14
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:28,637
Also, take care of these bodies.
Understood?

15
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:32,391
Do as I say,
or you'll be dead within two days.

16
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,101
Got it, Officer Baek?

17
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:35,852
Yes.

18
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,239
You go back and tell your boss

19
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:50,158
to stop acting up and wait for his death.

20
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:52,369
Yes, I will.

21
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:05,716
I'll get going.

22
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,054
Wait. I can't let you go like this.

23
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:14,808
Here's your preview.

24
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,897
For a moment there,
I thought I was going to die.

25
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:24,401
Didn't you say
you were just going to lure Vincenzo

26
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,153
for the Interpol to catch him?

27
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,530
Yes, I did.

28
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,532
Where did you get a gun?

29
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:32,534
Well…

30
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:38,498
I bought one to kill Vincenzo.

31
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:43,003
The Chief Prosecutor
brought in the Interpol.

32
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,422
Why did you try to kill him yourself?

33
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,466
Ms. Choi, are you stupid?

34
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,927
Vincenzo is a Mafia.

35
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:56,391
Unless he gets a death sentence in Italy,
he'll come back to kill us.

36
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,393
How can you not know that?

37
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:03,273
So there were Vincenzo's men
at the ice rink?

38
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,025
Yes.

39
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:08,653
He hid five of his men there.
That sly bastard.

40
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:12,074
Then it means
he fooled us completely, doesn't it?

41
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:13,658
As frustrating as it is…

42
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:16,953
it seems so.

43
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,624
Was he aware
that the Interpol was coming to get him?

44
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,752
Seeing he hid his men there.

45
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,212
About that…

46
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:30,342
I'm not so sure.

47
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:37,265
Did he hire more men
like they do in the Mafia?

48
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,393
Yes, you're probably right.
That must be it.

49
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:46,108
Stay away from guns
if you value your life.

50
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,527
Let's go, Ms. Choi.

51
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:50,695
Bye, Ms. Choi.

52
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,535
I know you're all busy.
Don't bother coming to see me.

53
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:03,583
You're hiding something.

54
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,545
Of course not. Can't you see I got shot?

55
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,171
I need you to be honest with me.

56
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,799
Come on. You don't trust me?

57
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,927
Just hold my hand. I'm in pain.

58
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:18,140
It hurts so much.

59
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:20,600
-I'll call you.
-Where are you going?

60
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:26,982
EPISODE 18

61
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:31,403
So this is your first task
as the Chief Prosecutor?

62
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:38,493
You win some, you lose some.
That's how it is, right?

63
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:42,497
Now that you've done this yourself,
what do you think?

64
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:46,918
After one more try,
I might be able to master it.

65
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,671
Do you know what the biggest problem is
right now?

66
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:51,298
VIP WARD

67
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,591
What could it be?

68
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:56,970
I'm afraid
you might also just have made it

69
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,264
on Vincenzo's hit list.

70
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,602
If you had sat back,
you could have spared your life.

71
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:06,646
He won't kill me
just because I brought in the Interpol.

72
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,569
Stop making things worse
by meddling in affairs you're not good at.

73
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:14,571
Focus on keeping your position

74
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,450
and staying alive. All right?

75
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:22,037
You look awful.

76
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,919
Who gives her the right
to talk to me like that?

77
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:32,422
Yes. Chief Prosecutor speaking.

78
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:35,217
I'm not interested.

79
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,594
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

80
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:45,393
Goodness.

81
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:48,939
If things had gone wrong, Mr. Cassano
would be on a plane right now.

82
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,068
That would have been horrible.

83
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,695
We almost said goodbye to you today.

84
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,161
We need to talk. It's urgent.

85
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:07,374
Han Seung-hyuk brought in the Interpol
to take you to Italy.

86
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,000
They'll be landing shortly.

87
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,097
What? Are you scared?

88
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:24,057
Of course.

89
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,142
We'll be surrounded by guns.

90
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,522
Just have one of them come close to me.

91
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,816
And leave the rest to me.

92
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:37,779
It's done.

93
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,364
-Great.
-Thanks.

94
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:56,840
Are you saying Paolo framed you?

95
00:08:57,924 --> 00:09:00,302
-Yes.
-How can we trust you?

96
00:09:01,011 --> 00:09:03,597
If my priority had been to escape,

97
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:05,807
I would have killed you all.

98
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,981
Leave me here. In return…

99
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,483
I have a present for you.

100
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:50,894
The list of bribes that Paolo gave
to politicians and ministers

101
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,439
and the recordings to prove that.

102
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,318
There's more.

103
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:10,330
Fly out to Malta tomorrow and look
for a paper company named Jason Fund.

104
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:13,625
Look into their accounting records
in that flash drive.

105
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,294
All of you will receive
a special promotion.

106
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,769
-Is it heavy?
-No, not at all.

107
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:33,978
-Give me some.
-I'm fine.

108
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,814
-It's okay.
-I'm really fine.

109
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:38,191
-You must be tired. Let me help.
-I'm not tired.

110
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:43,113
Why did you not betray me
when he said he'd make you the chairman?

111
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:45,824
He won't make me the real chairman.

112
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,617
I'll just be his puppet.

113
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:49,536
So I said no.

114
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,330
You did well today. Bye, then.

115
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:53,540
Wait a second.

116
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,668
They'll be suspicious.

117
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:02,590
Can you shoot me somewhere fleshy
so that the bullet just grazes me?

118
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:04,217
-In the arm?
-Yes.

119
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:11,015
-Get me the gun.
-Is it in the bag?

120
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,688
-Silencer.
-Silencer.

121
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:19,774
-Quickly.
-Quickly.

122
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:26,614
It might…

123
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,784
hurt more than you think. You might faint.

124
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,579
Don't worry. I can handle this much.

125
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:37,709
I didn't shoot yet.

126
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,295
-On three.
-On three.

127
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:41,588
-One.
-One.

128
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:42,839
-Two.
-Two.

129
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,221
It's not as bad as I thought,

130
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,432
Grandma. Why are you here, Grandma?

131
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,107
Hey.

132
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,443
Lovely morning.

133
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,613
-Can we have a word?
-Do you want a beating?

134
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:50,782
Gosh. Come on.

135
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,243
Please.

136
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,541
BYEBYE BALLOON TRAVEL

137
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:05,713
Jasmine tea? Coffee? Solomon's seal tea?

138
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:08,299
Don't bother.
Is there something you want to tell me?

139
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,977
The thing is…

140
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:23,565
a new hot-air balloon
arrived in Busan recently.

141
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,942
It's the latest model
and is very powerful.

142
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,777
It can fly extremely long distances.

143
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,696
Why are you telling me this?

144
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,327
ONE-TIME FREE TICKET

145
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:39,330
When you're in this line of work,

146
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,417
you might need to flee in a hurry one day.

147
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,627
You won't have time to book flights.

148
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,755
They might even bar you
from leaving the country.

149
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,097
Are you telling me

150
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:58,641
to escape using this?

151
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:01,394
We already helped 47 people
leave the country safely.

152
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:05,565
Sadly, two of them didn't make it.

153
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,110
I'd say it's a worthwhile bet.

154
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:16,075
Why are you trying to help me
after all I've done to you?

155
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:18,244
How should I put it?

156
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:23,207
It's kind of a wish fulfillment.

157
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:36,137
There was a man who dreamed of living
like Michael Corleone from The Godfather.

158
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,432
Then he met a real Corleone.

159
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:42,435
How could he not respect him?

160
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,029
Anyway, I'll hold on to it for now.

161
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:01,329
Yes?

162
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:02,997
Can you…

163
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:06,042
call me bro just once?

164
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:10,380
Bro…

165
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:15,134
my ass. I ought to beat you up.

166
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,305
All right. Fine.

167
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:23,726
Gosh, I've got goosebumps
all over my body.

168
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,645
My goodness.

169
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:28,147
Number one.

170
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:31,734
We need to remove the rest of
Jang Han-seok's pieces from the board.

171
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,278
All his pieces in Sangcheon-gu are gone.

172
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:36,990
So only the bigger pieces are left.

173
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,075
Then let's take care of them today.

174
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:42,412
It's going to be a long, hard day
for them.

175
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,206
Mr. Nam, what about the lawsuit
against Babel Tower?

176
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,541
It's ready.

177
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,086
All you have to do now is
submit it to the court.

178
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,067
-Gosh.
-I shouldn't do that.

179
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:16,237
-Oh, my.
-Look at that.

180
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,617
Come to Glory Sound Cafe by 3 p.m.,

181
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,411
or you'll be held responsible.

182
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,580
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

183
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:46,017
Why did he tell us to come
to a place like this?

184
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,685
I have no idea.

185
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:51,064
What are we going to do
in a public space like this?

186
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,357
His text startled me.

187
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,319
How dare he send us a message like that?

188
00:16:57,153 --> 00:16:59,447
Are you sure you'll be able to
build Babel Tower?

189
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,823
-What?
-I heard

190
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,825
that they are reexamining it now.

191
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:06,204
-From my experience…
-Why is this being played here?

192
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,955
What are you doing? Turn that off.

193
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,873
Quick!

194
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:10,666
Where's the manager?

195
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,960
-The media are already
-Is something wrong?

196
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:14,962
-starting to suspect…
-Turn that off.

197
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:16,297
-Hurry up.
-Quick.

198
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,966
-Okay.
-It's a minor error with the document.

199
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,093
No big deal.

200
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:21,928
-It's even louder now!
-Wusang will

201
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,805
-Move.
-take care of it in a few days.

202
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,848
-I'll pull the plug.
-Don't you worry.

203
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:28,684
My goodness.

204
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,439
-Damn it.
-I'm sorry.

205
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:34,774
I'm sorry.

206
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:46,911
Mr. Jang,
is this how you're going to play it?

207
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,704
It had nothing to do with me.

208
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:52,125
It was your house.

209
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,836
Your very own house!

210
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:56,754
It could have been a bug--

211
00:17:56,838 --> 00:18:00,007
This is completely different
from when Mr. Seo died.

212
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:01,425
I'm not in this alone.

213
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:04,679
If you keep this up, I won't sit back.
Do you understand?

214
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:06,806
Mr. Hwang. Hello?

215
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,564
Damn it.

216
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:23,489
This time,

217
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:27,660
we're determined to root out
all corruption related to the Babel Tower.

218
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:31,914
You're all about to witness
the shocking truth.

219
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:34,083
Would you like to add anything, gentleman?

220
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:38,838
In the Bible, the Tower of Babel falls
because of human greed.

221
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:42,633
And that's exactly what's going to happen
in court soon.

222
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,969
The Babel Tower will fall
before it's even built.

223
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,637
Any message for them?

224
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:55,855
These are going to be
our last words for Babel.

225
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,941
"You can see yourself out."

226
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:06,908
Goodbye.

227
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,706
-Anything else?
-What's your plan?

228
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,499
-What will happen next?
-Wait!

229
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,751
Please add something!

230
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:20,338
NANYAK TEMPLE

231
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:24,759
Have some fruit.

232
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:28,679
Sorry. We're going out to beg for alms.

233
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:32,892
You're begging for alms
quite often these days.

234
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,312
You've been doing it every day
lately, right?

235
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:39,148
Are you struggling?

236
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,983
No. We're okay.

237
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,986
Please leave the fruit inside.
I appreciate it.

238
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,655
-Sure.
-Goodbye, then.

239
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,077
See you.

240
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,584
The temple can't make ends meet
without any visitors.

241
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,128
I feel sorry for them.

242
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,506
My goodness.

243
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,800
If they're begging for alms every day,

244
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,885
their situation must be pretty bad.

245
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,431
They're monks, so they won't have
any money saved.

246
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:18,020
Who would want to visit the temple
when this whole building is a mess?

247
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:21,482
I would go, but I'm a Christian.

248
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:24,986
Then why don't we all chip in
and help them out?

249
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:28,114
Right. We should help each other
during hard times.

250
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:30,408
I'll go and talk
to the laundromat owner, too.

251
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,660
-Okay.
-All right. Let's do that.

252
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:37,081
Since we handed in the files, should
we start leveling the playing field?

253
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:41,419
Yes. We should do this fiercely
as my father wanted.

254
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,796
Take it easy.

255
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:46,757
I should say the same to you.
I'll see you later.

256
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,097
All right.

257
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:58,352
They checked, but there were no bugs.

258
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,773
How on earth was it recorded, then?

259
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,277
There were a lot of people.

260
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,404
It's likely that it was one of them.

261
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,450
No. This is Vincenzo's doing.

262
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:14,744
A humiliation worse than death.

263
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:18,039
To give you that, I'm playing a game
of chess with you starting today.

264
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,791
And I'll get rid of your pieces
one by one.

265
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:29,884
They're all gone.

266
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,802
If it really is Vincenzo's doing,

267
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:34,597
it's a pretty big blow this time.

268
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:40,102
My gosh. Those spineless idiots.

269
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:42,563
We should've gotten rid of them as I said.

270
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,982
This happened
because you didn't listen to me.

271
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:49,737
JIPURAGI FILED A CLAIM
FOR DAMAGES AGAINST BABEL

272
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:52,948
Did something else happen?

273
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:59,538
Hong Cha-young filed a claim for damages
against the Babel Group.

274
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,751
That claim must be the checkmate.

275
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,927
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES
AGAINST ILLEGAL ACTS

276
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,763
FILED BY: CHO YEONG-UN AND 10 OTHERS
AGAINST: THE BABEL GROUP

277
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:17,890
PLAINTIFF'S DEMAND

278
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:21,769
CHIEF PROSECUTOR HAN SEUNG-HYUK

279
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:24,897
BABEL HAS HIRED ANT COMPANY
TO THREATEN THE TENANTS

280
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,699
VINCENZO

281
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,412
Yes, this is Chief Prosecutor
Han Seung-hyuk.

282
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,498
I saw off the Interpol agents you sent.

283
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:47,586
I just did what's legally appropriate.

284
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,004
You shouldn't have done that.

285
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,632
Why does "legally appropriate" sound
so awkward

286
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,801
when it's coming from a Chief Prosecutor.

287
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:57,972
Let's make a deal tonight.

288
00:22:58,556 --> 00:22:59,431
Well…

289
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:01,725
why would I make a deal with you?

290
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,227
You should if you want to live.

291
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:07,022
I'm hanging up on the count of three.
One, two.

292
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,941
Wait… He hung up.

293
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:12,027
Damn it. He has the upper hand.

294
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,823
What kind of a deal does he want to make?

295
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,332
Bring some wet towels.

296
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,375
Let me join you.

297
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,174
How do you always find me?

298
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,967
Are you my stalker or what?

299
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:39,847
You may not know when,

300
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,267
but you look pretty calm
for someone who's going to die.

301
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:49,773
Didn't it occur to you
that we could kill you first?

302
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,108
No, not at all.

303
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,279
But if you win the lawsuit
regarding the Babel Tower,

304
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:56,989
we'll let you live a bit longer.

305
00:23:57,072 --> 00:23:58,073
There's no need.

306
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:02,244
I'll fulfill my dream of living longer
at a convenience store

307
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:04,538
by drinking some yogurt.

308
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,711
But it won't be a life worth living,

309
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:13,339
because we'll come after you again.

310
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:22,681
VOICE RECORDING

311
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:24,266
Pyo Hyeok-pil and I

312
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,769
were ordered by Choi Myung-hee

313
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:29,980
to kill Hong Yu-chan
and disguise it as a car accident.

314
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:35,486
Oh, my poor Crystal Balls.

315
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,322
Recordings like that are useless.

316
00:24:41,158 --> 00:24:44,370
On Choi Myung-hee's orders,
we've gotten rid of the following people.

317
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,122
Congressman Baek Min-u,

318
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:50,167
Park Dong-cheon of Gudam Police Station,

319
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:52,795
Deputy Minister Jung Jin-taek,

320
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:55,506
the Good Politics Committee
Chairman Lee Seon-u,

321
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:56,966
Reporter Lee Yang-su,

322
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:59,426
TQ Logistics'
labor union leader Kim Min-hyeok…

323
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,432
What do you want with those useless names?

324
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:11,021
I'll use this

325
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:14,608
to give you a Christmas present this year.

326
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:16,986
About 30 years in jail.

327
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:22,241
Don't you think the pot
is calling the kettle black?

328
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:23,659
Who's the pot?

329
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:27,329
Oh, I know. You're the pot.

330
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,707
-And I'm the kettle.
-You and Vincenzo…

331
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:33,335
Do you think you'll look clean
if you expose us?

332
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,130
We're not trying to look clean.

333
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,550
We just want to have the upper hand.

334
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:42,428
Yes. That's the spirit.

335
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:44,179
Good point.

336
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:46,974
Let's see who wins in the end.

337
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,044
All right.

338
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:18,464
I get that I upset you,

339
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:23,260
but people are bound to get hurt
during a war.

340
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:25,304
You know, like a collateral damage.

341
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,307
Anyway…

342
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:30,684
what deal did you mean?

343
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,027
A deal regarding your life.

344
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,487
What?

345
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:46,784
I was going to let you live,

346
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:51,205
but I decided to kill you after that stunt
you pulled with the Interpol.

347
00:26:58,712 --> 00:26:59,880
Seriously?

348
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:04,593
That's not something to make a deal about.

349
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,098
Life is the most precious gift
that was given to us.

350
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:10,224
Hey!

351
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:17,856
I'm a Chief Prosecutor
at the Namdongbu Office.

352
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,194
How dare you be so disrespectful
to your elder, you little brat?

353
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:26,698
Don't talk about age.

354
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:30,577
All age does is
give you a lot of responsibilities.

355
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:32,621
Don't take that tone with me!

356
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:35,791
You little brat!

357
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,877
Show some respect!

358
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:45,092
But, hey!
I'm signaling for you to come in!

359
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:47,136
I told you to come in
once I hit the table!

360
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,638
Why are you all so clueless?

361
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:51,265
Darn it.

362
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:53,851
Gosh, my hand hurts.

363
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,811
You're pretty old-fashioned and childish.

364
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,230
It's quite disappointing.

365
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:02,693
Fights are always
old-fashioned and childish.

366
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:04,695
I'm sure you know that.

367
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,044
Don't worry.
The bullets went through your legs.

368
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,421
What are you waiting for?

369
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:25,632
Come on! Do something!
Don't you have any guns?

370
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,387
-Get out, all of you.
-Get out.

371
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,432
Get out!

372
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:36,935
Come on, get out.
Take those guys on the floor.

373
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:55,621
I've never seen a sly person
who's not a coward.

374
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:57,498
You're right. I'm pretty sly.

375
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,041
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,336
Please don't kill me.

377
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:53,846
Who are you?

378
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:56,139
This is what you get
for disrespecting your elders.

379
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:25,812
Those darn geezers!

380
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:28,941
How dare they do this to him?

381
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:32,527
They're full of energy, aren't they?

382
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:34,071
They're provoking us.

383
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:36,114
Look at his foot.

384
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:39,701
Should we just get rid of them all?

385
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:43,538
They still have quite a lot of power
in this country.

386
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:45,582
It could just backfire on us.

387
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:49,336
It may not be now,
but we'll deal with them eventually.

388
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,673
They're useless to us now.

389
00:32:11,108 --> 00:32:13,568
A devil tantalizes

390
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,906
another devil…

391
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,506
Stop!

392
00:32:58,238 --> 00:32:59,322
-Get him!
-Damn it!

393
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:09,291
Get him.

394
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:10,459
Let's go.

395
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,592
There was no need
to beat him up like that.

396
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:25,182
You know who I am, don't you?

397
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:26,725
Mr. Kim.

398
00:33:27,392 --> 00:33:30,729
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk and I

399
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:33,440
have been close for a long time.

400
00:33:34,024 --> 00:33:35,609
He told me

401
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:39,029
to find you if I wanted to open
the secret room

402
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:40,864
in Geumga Plaza.

403
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:44,785
I can't open it.

404
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:47,871
The iris recognition device is
inside the room.

405
00:33:47,954 --> 00:33:50,040
Then we should find another way.

406
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:54,461
Who designed the security system?

407
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:55,712
I don't know.

408
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:59,174
Mr. Wang hired that person himself.

409
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:03,220
When installing security systems
in another country, you use local people

410
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:07,432
because security structures and methods
are different for each country.

411
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:13,772
Here.

412
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:22,197
You'll have to do some work
with my men starting today.

413
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,868
Look into all the security experts
and hackers

414
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:30,288
who were working in Korea
during that time.

415
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,000
How would I do that?

416
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:37,963
You're an intelligence agent.
You'd better pull it off

417
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,507
if you don't want to die with your family.

418
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,565
What is this?

419
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:14,332
Hey! Go!

420
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:15,750
Come on!

421
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:42,777
CHIEF PROSECUTOR HAN SEUNG-HYUK

422
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:47,365
We can't just sit back and watch anymore.

423
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:52,913
Mr. Jang could really end up dying.

424
00:35:53,622 --> 00:35:55,790
Terrorism, shooting…

425
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,461
Just arrest them and Vincenzo.

426
00:35:59,544 --> 00:36:01,671
You should know better.

427
00:36:02,297 --> 00:36:03,548
Arrest them?

428
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:07,177
That's only possible
when we have the upper hand.

429
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,386
If anything goes wrong,

430
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,097
all our bribes and the Guillotine file
could be revealed.

431
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,141
You're the Chief Prosecutor,

432
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:15,477
and you can't catch one lousy Mafia?

433
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,605
You were an ace prosecutor
of the Namdongbu office.

434
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,440
Can't you do anything right?

435
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:21,650
Hey!

436
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:28,073
You're in the Chief Prosecutor's office
right now!

437
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:29,032
Lower your voice.

438
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,867
All right, fine.

439
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:37,123
You know…

440
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,961
I've been thinking hard about it.

441
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,463
Let's use one of the Mafia's tactics.

442
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,593
The safest place to be right now

443
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:50,971
is jail.

444
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,722
You know what I mean?

445
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:54,766
Stop talking nonsense.

446
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:55,850
It does make sense.

447
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,603
Even for Vincenzo Cassano,

448
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:01,273
breaking into a jail cell won't be easy.

449
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:09,990
What do you mean?

450
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:13,159
Are you telling me to go to jail?

451
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:17,080
Just for a week or two. I'll make sure
you feel at home there.

452
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:20,542
Ms. Choi, you know how much I hate jail.

453
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,712
I've been hiding my identity
because I didn't want to go to jail.

454
00:37:23,795 --> 00:37:24,879
I know that.

455
00:37:25,463 --> 00:37:28,383
I'm not telling you to stay there.
It's just for your protection.

456
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:31,094
Protection or not,
I don't want to go to jail.

457
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:35,140
You must admit it now.

458
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:36,349
Vincenzo…

459
00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:39,686
We're no match for him.

460
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:42,772
Darn it!

461
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,651
I really mean it.

462
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:49,362
I don't want to go to jail!

463
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:55,785
Don't be afraid.

464
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,039
I'll make sure your cell
is like a hotel room.

465
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,249
Darn it.

466
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:15,889
BABEL GROUP

467
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,858
Mr. Jang Han-seok?

468
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:28,985
We're from the Namdongbu
Prosecution Service.

469
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:32,614
We are arresting you
on charges of tax evasion.

470
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:34,741
Me?

471
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:38,953
You have the right to consult an attorney,
to explain yourself,

472
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:41,414
and to a writ of habeas corpus.

473
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:45,168
You're always arresting innocent people.

474
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:48,004
Just be quiet. There are people watching.

475
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:52,592
Let me talk to my brother for a minute.

476
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:02,352
Launch Babel Bio while I'm away.

477
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,145
I postponed it.

478
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:05,605
What?

479
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:08,191
There are a lot of rumors
about Babel Bio right now.

480
00:39:08,274 --> 00:39:11,486
They're saying it's a front for inflating
stocks and manipulating accounts.

481
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:13,238
Who are you to decide that?

482
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,906
No, it wasn't all me.

483
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:17,575
The board and the Planning Division
advised me.

484
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,536
-Hey.
-And sir…

485
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,374
you told me to become a businessman
like Elizabeth Holmes.

486
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,170
But she's a fraud…

487
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:31,339
and she's in prison.

488
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:39,264
So what you were saying

489
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:41,391
was for me to become a fraud.

490
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:45,478
But I can't do that.
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.

491
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:51,151
Do you…

492
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,405
really have a death wish?

493
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,331
This is exhausting.

494
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,543
Why would I die?

495
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:11,421
This is all for your sake.

496
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:25,226
Take him.

497
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:47,832
Anyone hungry?

498
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,066
All right. Get out.

499
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:22,492
You must've had a tough time, sir.

500
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:29,499
-It's been a while, Mr. Jung.
-Hello, sir.

501
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,461
It's been a while for me too, sir.

502
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:39,133
Vincenzo won't stand still.
Are you sure you can return?

503
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:41,678
Did he not threaten you?

504
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,596
He did once.

505
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,058
But a prosecutor should never give in
to a Mafia.

506
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:49,727
Next week, he's going to become
an assistant chief.

507
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,563
He'll have more power then.

508
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:01,906
I see.

509
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:03,825
I'll look forward to it.

510
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,494
Thank you, sir.

511
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:08,121
Me too, sir.

512
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:23,386
You have good drinking etiquette.

513
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:25,388
I may lack knowledge,

514
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:27,724
but I'm confident about my etiquettes.

515
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:30,351
It's hot.

516
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:35,732
-By the way…
-Yes?

517
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:40,028
You won't kill me, right?

518
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,863
Yes.

519
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:46,409
Because it kind of looks like
you're repenting.

520
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:50,330
How can you tell if I'm repenting, though?

521
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,165
I could be putting up a front.

522
00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:53,958
You don't repent with words.

523
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,128
You do it by showing
how much you've changed.

524
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:59,130
I don't know how long it'll last,

525
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,549
but you're keeping it up pretty well.

526
00:43:02,342 --> 00:43:03,343
My gosh.

527
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:07,805
How are you so eloquent?

528
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:12,018
That was a compliment.

529
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:13,978
You're just amazing.

530
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:20,360
By the way, why are you helping me
despite the chairman position?

531
00:43:22,654 --> 00:43:24,197
Why am I helping you?

532
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,579
Because you just feel

533
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,332
like a brother to me.

534
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,046
It's strange.

535
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,758
You curse at me, and it's fine.

536
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:47,428
We play hockey, and I feel at ease.

537
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:52,684
And it just feels like
I'm drinking with a friend.

538
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:55,937
That's how I feel.

539
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:02,777
I'm only asking because I'm tipsy.

540
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:06,197
Can I treat you like a brother
when we're alone?

541
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,281
No.

542
00:44:09,242 --> 00:44:11,702
I understand, Mr. Cassano.

543
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:16,165
Fine, but you better mind your manners.

544
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,752
Okay, bro.

545
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,511
The food got cold.

546
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:30,721
It smells weird.

547
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:32,056
There's some left.

548
00:44:41,274 --> 00:44:42,525
-Hey.
-Yes?

549
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,236
It's a bit salty.

550
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:47,321
Maybe there's too much salt.

551
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:48,823
-Is that it?
-Yes.

552
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:54,036
Every time I invest, it's a flop.

553
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,913
He gave me some tips.

554
00:44:56,998 --> 00:44:58,833
Share some tips with me.

555
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,460
I'm so jealous.

556
00:45:10,678 --> 00:45:12,597
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

557
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:38,789
Jang Han-seo, you bastard.

558
00:45:44,504 --> 00:45:46,255
Inmate 6723, you have a visitor.

559
00:46:04,649 --> 00:46:05,942
I'm glad. I was bored.

560
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:11,405
What do you think?
Don't I look good in these clothes?

561
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:12,448
You do.

562
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,952
You look relaxed like you're in Cancún.

563
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:17,662
It's nice in here.

564
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:19,664
And people are nice too.

565
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:23,709
Do you think you're safe in there?

566
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:27,046
You must have people looking after you.

567
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:30,341
The head of the jail
must treat you well too.

568
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,885
I'm sure you did this in Italy too,
so you must know.

569
00:46:35,972 --> 00:46:37,640
I'm sorry for being a party pooper,

570
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:42,395
but do you think everything is going
according to your plan?

571
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:05,251
Don't you think I'd know
that your car was bulletproof?

572
00:47:41,746 --> 00:47:43,039
Do you really think

573
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,626
those men failed to kill you that night?

574
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:53,382
Persuade Jang Han-seok to go to jail

575
00:47:53,966 --> 00:47:55,343
without him knowing.

576
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:58,346
I can make that happen,

577
00:47:59,221 --> 00:48:02,058
but wouldn't he be suspicious
if I came up with a charge?

578
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:05,895
You'll find a reason
to arrest him tomorrow morning.

579
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:08,898
Okay.

580
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,400
I'm the one…

581
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:14,612
who put you in there.

582
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,038
Nothing's more entertaining

583
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,918
than an enemy who doesn't know
why they're losing.

584
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:31,379
Just kill me, you Mafia bastard.

585
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:33,547
Stop bothering me.

586
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:38,302
Tell me the truth.
Why are you keeping me alive?

587
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,098
You're afraid, aren't you?

588
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:46,977
You're afraid of the aftermath.

589
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:49,355
Right?

590
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,325
I thought you were smart,

591
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,121
but you still haven't caught up.

592
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,598
Let me tell you something new.

593
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:28,227
Guess what the Mafia used to call me.

594
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:35,943
It means "a cat that's full."

595
00:49:36,444 --> 00:49:38,070
A cat that's full

596
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,616
toys with a mouse all day
before eating it.

597
00:49:45,453 --> 00:49:48,372
When I was little,
a robber murdered my foster parents.

598
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:52,501
I joined the Mafia and tormented him
for two years.

599
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:56,756
Then he attempted suicide.

600
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:03,512
I had him receive treatment
in the best hospital.

601
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:05,890
The day he was discharged,

602
00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:11,437
I treated him to the best meal
and killed him.

603
00:50:13,814 --> 00:50:16,525
The real reason I've let you live so far

604
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:19,195
is because you're my mouse.

605
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,785
That's who I really am.

606
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:33,459
This is my last time toying with you
before gobbling you up.

607
00:50:34,752 --> 00:50:36,420
You're going to witness

608
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:41,300
the Babel Tower falling from your cell.

609
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:47,765
I can get out of here tomorrow if I want.

610
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:02,112
This is the information on your
paper company I got from Ragusang Gallery.

611
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,950
Did you think I gave Mr. Jung
the original copy?

612
00:51:11,872 --> 00:51:13,791
Idiot.

613
00:51:13,874 --> 00:51:15,209
You little…

614
00:51:15,793 --> 00:51:18,379
With this, you'll be in there
for another whole month…

615
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:22,508
no matter how hard they rack their brains
to get you out.

616
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:31,183
I hope you enjoy…

617
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:37,356
seeing the Babel Tower fall
from your cell.

618
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,592
Inmate 6723, let's go back.

619
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:06,635
Let me go!

620
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:15,603
About the information
on the paper company.

621
00:52:15,686 --> 00:52:17,521
Did he say there were no copies?

622
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:19,690
Yes, that's what he said.

623
00:52:19,773 --> 00:52:21,775
How could you blindly believe him?

624
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:25,070
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

625
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:28,157
It'll take some time
since it's a criminal charge.

626
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,074
Yes.

627
00:52:29,158 --> 00:52:32,494
Chairman Jang won't be released
anytime soon.

628
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,374
At this rate,
he might as well live behind bars.

629
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,084
Isn't that what many people want?

630
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:40,252
Hey…

631
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:44,006
You're right.

632
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:48,469
Chairman Jang Han-seo can retrieve
the Guillotine file.

633
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,558
Let's keep him behind bars a bit longer
with that information.

634
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:55,601
Should we?

635
00:52:57,269 --> 00:52:58,479
All right, then.

636
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:02,483
I'm more concerned
about the Babel Tower lawsuit.

637
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:06,070
Who knows what Vincenzo
and Hong Cha-young may do?

638
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:08,739
Sir, could you postpone my promotion
for a while?

639
00:53:09,448 --> 00:53:11,617
I'll take care of the lawsuit

640
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:14,912
and Chairman Jang's case myself.

641
00:53:20,793 --> 00:53:21,919
Hey, Luca.

642
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:25,297
Mr. Consigliere, I've arrived
at Incheon Airport.

643
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,218
"Incheon"?

644
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:31,345
What's wrong?

645
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:36,684
I had no idea that this was all his plan.

646
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,311
I'm sorry, sir.

647
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:42,898
In any case, I'm safe here, right?

648
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:44,024
Yes, sir.

649
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,655
Mr. Jung and I will take care
of the paper company

650
00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:51,573
as well as the Babel Tower.

651
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:56,620
I can't leave for now, right?

652
00:53:58,038 --> 00:53:58,956
No, sir.

653
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,586
I refuse to watch Babel Tower fall
from behind bars.

654
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:07,715
Get me out of here as soon as possible.
Got it?

655
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:09,967
Yes, sir.

656
00:54:13,387 --> 00:54:14,763
And Han-seo…

657
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:16,932
Keep an eye on him.

658
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:20,728
He seems to have awfully matured lately.

659
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:38,704
I'm looking for Vincenzo Cassano.

660
00:54:39,788 --> 00:54:41,373
-Consigliere?
-Yes.

661
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:44,168
Follow me.

662
00:54:51,467 --> 00:54:53,427
-How have you been, Luca?
-Excuse me.

663
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:57,014
Luca!

664
00:54:57,097 --> 00:55:00,893
Luca!

665
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:07,983
Are these your friends?

666
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:09,943
Everyone likes you.

667
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:11,570
Luca!

668
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:16,658
Consigliere.

669
00:55:16,742 --> 00:55:19,745
Dario and Sebastian have been killed
by the Luciano family.

670
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,664
There's no telling who's next.

671
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:27,336
What the hell is Paolo doing?

672
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,005
Paolo was indifferent from the get-go.

673
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:34,051
There's intel that the police are planning
to catch him,

674
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:36,178
so he's packing up to leave.

675
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:39,807
That heartless bastard!

676
00:55:41,016 --> 00:55:43,560
Their conversation seems quite serious.

677
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:46,688
I think a few people lost their lives,

678
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:49,608
and Vincenzo just swore.

679
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:52,027
Consigliere.

680
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:55,405
Come back to Italy and save our family.

681
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:58,784
If you don't,
it will be over for our family.

682
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,634
I've narrowed it down to
four security experts and hackers.

683
00:56:58,218 --> 00:56:59,261
Look at the last page.

684
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:05,100
PERSONAL INFORMATION

685
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:08,228
Her current home address is Geumga Plaza.

686
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:10,022
That's right.

687
00:57:12,524 --> 00:57:16,945
So the locksmith has been living
right next to the vault.

688
00:58:31,895 --> 00:58:32,980
What is this?

689
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:09,910
Don't go…

690
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:12,287
Come on, now.

691
01:00:12,371 --> 01:00:14,873
It's not like he's going to fight
in a war.

692
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,793
-Stop it.
-But he is going to fight in a war.

693
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:21,463
He might be fighting a battle
to the death--

694
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,799
-Enough.
-Okay.

695
01:00:24,716 --> 01:00:25,842
But I can't.

696
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,344
Mr. Nam

697
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:30,722
I'll only be away for two weeks.
Don't worry.

698
01:00:34,017 --> 01:00:38,647
But what if two weeks become four,
and four weeks become…

699
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:40,440
Please!

700
01:00:41,983 --> 01:00:45,487
I didn't know you could be so troublesome.

701
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:47,447
I'm sorry.

702
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:54,454
Don't worry.
We'll be okay for the time being.

703
01:00:55,163 --> 01:00:56,790
Chairman Jang is in jail after all.

704
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:02,879
Come on. Don't look at us like that.

705
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:07,676
Geumga Plaza is like a fortress.

706
01:01:22,315 --> 01:01:23,900
Mr. Nam.

707
01:01:25,068 --> 01:01:27,279
Please, don't cry.

708
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:30,115
Wipe your tears before you see him off.

709
01:01:56,975 --> 01:01:58,393
Hey, come on out!

710
01:01:58,477 --> 01:01:59,728
Coming!

711
01:02:04,316 --> 01:02:07,986
This is red pepper paste
and seasoned dried radish.

712
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:10,614
Have them while you're there, okay?

713
01:02:10,697 --> 01:02:12,657
-Thank you.
-I'll put it inside.

714
01:02:12,741 --> 01:02:13,992
There.

715
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:18,830
This is pickled lettuce that my mom made.

716
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,250
I'll put it in your suitcase.

717
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:27,005
This will bring you good luck.
Keep it with you at all times.

718
01:02:27,088 --> 01:02:29,508
It's true. They say it has magical powers.

719
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:31,009
-Yes.
-Thank you.

720
01:02:34,679 --> 01:02:37,349
We'll protect this place
for the next two weeks.

721
01:02:38,266 --> 01:02:41,019
You will come back for sure, right?

722
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:44,105
Of course, he will. Don't be absurd.

723
01:02:44,189 --> 01:02:46,066
He'll take care of everything

724
01:02:46,983 --> 01:02:48,443
and return right away.

725
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:52,405
Buddha will be by your side at all times.

726
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:55,200
Help us, merciful Buddha.

727
01:02:55,283 --> 01:02:56,159
Thank you.

728
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:02,290
Be careful.

729
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:06,670
Thanks, bro.

730
01:03:14,135 --> 01:03:15,345
Have a safe trip.

731
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:19,391
You should go.

732
01:03:23,979 --> 01:03:24,813
Your passport?

733
01:03:34,906 --> 01:03:36,283
Have a safe trip.

734
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:39,578
Make sure to eat on time.

735
01:03:39,661 --> 01:03:40,912
Don't take too long.

736
01:03:41,872 --> 01:03:42,706
Bye.

737
01:03:43,456 --> 01:03:44,457
Don't cry.

738
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,460
-Why are you crying?
-He'll be back soon.

739
01:03:47,544 --> 01:03:48,962
It's only for two weeks.

740
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:50,380
Are you sure?

741
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:52,507
You cried.

742
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:54,175
-I didn't.
-You did, didn't you?

743
01:04:10,108 --> 01:04:11,151
You should go.

744
01:04:12,027 --> 01:04:13,987
I'll see you off.

745
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,196
It's okay.

746
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:20,702
I'll be back.
Prepare for the lawsuit while I'm away.

747
01:04:20,785 --> 01:04:21,703
Okay.

748
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:27,125
And you don't need to buy me
a perfume or scarf on your way back.

749
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:28,043
Never.

750
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:36,426
Go inside and have a cup of coffee.

751
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:45,352
If something happens,

752
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:47,604
call me right away.

753
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:49,064
Don't you worry.

754
01:04:51,983 --> 01:04:52,901
I'll get going then.

755
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:57,405
Luca.

756
01:05:17,425 --> 01:05:18,468
Mr. Cassano!

757
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,815
Friends are…

758
01:05:32,941 --> 01:05:36,277
like two souls

759
01:05:37,153 --> 01:05:38,863
in one body.

760
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:49,499
Don't get hurt…

761
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:55,672
since it'll hurt me too.

762
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:08,226
I promise.

763
01:06:48,516 --> 01:06:50,018
Would you like some wine?

764
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:51,227
No, thank you.

765
01:07:05,825 --> 01:07:09,621
HOW TO BEFRIEND A BIRD

766
01:08:09,764 --> 01:08:11,307
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo.

767
01:08:16,187 --> 01:08:18,565
We won't become friends,

768
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:20,150
so I'll skip the introduction.

769
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:22,527
Open it right now.

770
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:27,866
I don't know what you're talking about.

771
01:08:28,741 --> 01:08:29,909
I don't know how.

772
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:38,001
Say that one more time,

773
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:39,711
and I'll kill you.

774
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:03,610
Did you see him off?

775
01:09:04,652 --> 01:09:05,570
Of course.

776
01:09:17,707 --> 01:09:19,542
He'll take care of everything and return

777
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:21,586
like he's been doing here.

778
01:09:22,712 --> 01:09:23,546
Of course.

779
01:09:24,797 --> 01:09:28,343
But this place does feel so empty
without him.

780
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:31,930
Two weeks?

781
01:09:32,597 --> 01:09:35,266
We'll be busy preparing for the trial,
and time will fly.

782
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,269
You're right. Let's focus on that.

783
01:09:39,187 --> 01:09:40,063
We can do it.

784
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:44,317
We can do it.

785
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:38,371
It's open.

786
01:10:59,183 --> 01:11:03,271
Where's the gold and the Guillotine file?

787
01:11:03,896 --> 01:11:05,231
I have no idea.

788
01:11:05,315 --> 01:11:08,067
Damn it. Where did you hide them?

789
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:10,570
I'm telling you the truth. I have no idea.

790
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:25,209
You little…

791
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:27,754
Tell me the truth.

792
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:29,088
Where is it?

793
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:46,689
Damn it.

794
01:11:47,357 --> 01:11:48,649
Go get her.

795
01:11:56,574 --> 01:11:58,201
Mr. Tak!

796
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,620
Mr. Lee!

797
01:12:01,913 --> 01:12:03,790
Mr. Park!

798
01:12:07,668 --> 01:12:08,961
What's wrong?

799
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:11,672
Some thugs barged into Nanyak Temple.

800
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,091
Who?

801
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:19,222
Mr. Nam, hurry upstairs
and call the others.

802
01:12:19,305 --> 01:12:21,182
I can't! Then you'll be in danger.

803
01:12:21,265 --> 01:12:22,475
Now!

804
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,526
Ms. Seo.

805
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,904
Come here while I'm asking you nicely.

806
01:12:36,864 --> 01:12:38,074
Who are you?

807
01:12:38,157 --> 01:12:41,202
This has nothing to do with you.
Stay out of it. It's dangerous.

808
01:12:41,786 --> 01:12:44,580
It does have something to do with me.
I'm her lawyer.

809
01:12:45,164 --> 01:12:46,791
I see.

810
01:12:46,874 --> 01:12:50,670
Jipuragi Law Firm.
You're Lawyer Hong Yu-chan's daughter.

811
01:12:51,379 --> 01:12:53,005
How do you know my dad?

812
01:12:53,756 --> 01:12:57,635
How could I not? He was an incredible man.

813
01:12:57,718 --> 01:12:58,761
Whatever.

814
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:01,639
-Just get lost.
-I guess

815
01:13:02,306 --> 01:13:05,560
he didn't teach you
how to respect your elders.

816
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:10,106
He taught me to show absolutely no respect
to people like you.

817
01:13:13,276 --> 01:13:14,318
Bring her over.

818
01:13:18,114 --> 01:13:20,741
Get your hands off of her!
You can't take her.

819
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:25,288
No!

820
01:13:51,939 --> 01:13:53,608
Stop right there.

821
01:14:15,713 --> 01:14:16,839
Mr. Cassano.

822
01:14:18,549 --> 01:14:19,592
Are you two all right?

823
01:14:20,176 --> 01:14:21,385
Why didn't you go?

824
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:24,180
I took care of it in another way.

825
01:14:27,016 --> 01:14:27,892
And…

826
01:14:29,227 --> 01:14:31,103
I forgot to feed Inzaghi as well.

827
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,238
Anyway, stand back.

828
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,284
Do you happen to be Vincenzo Cassano?

829
01:14:45,368 --> 01:14:46,744
That's none of your business.

830
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:51,082
I'll make you pay
in less than five minutes.
