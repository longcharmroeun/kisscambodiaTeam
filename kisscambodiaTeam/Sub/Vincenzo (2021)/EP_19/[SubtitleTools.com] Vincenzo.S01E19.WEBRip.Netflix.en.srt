1
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,785
Stop right there.

2
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:42,054
Mr. Cassano.

3
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:44,598
Are you guys okay?

4
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,391
Why didn't you go?

5
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,186
I took care of it in another way.

6
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:55,025
And I forgot to feed Inzaghi as well.

7
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,490
Anyway, stand back.

8
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,494
Do you happen to be Vincenzo Cassano?

9
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:06,912
That's none of your business.

10
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:11,333
I'll make you pay
in less than five minutes.

11
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,593
Go bring her to me.

12
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,161
Damn it!

13
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,280
Shit!

14
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,085
Oh, no. Stop it! Stop!

15
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,589
-Stop!
-Stop!

16
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:43,967
-Stop!
-Stop!

17
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:49,014
-Stop!
-Stop!

18
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,099
-Stop!
-Stop!

19
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,064
What the hell?

20
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,496

NOW, NUTRIA

30
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:43,814
I have underestimated you.

31
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:47,150
Mr. Cho, who is this guy?

32
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,903
He's candidate Park Seung-jun's
right-hand man.

33
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,113
I see.

34
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:55,617
Then Mr. Park is about to lose
his right hand today.

35
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,577
Let's talk.

36
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:01,456
-I have nothing to say to you.
-I can help you with that.

37
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,167
By the way, I'm really curious now.

38
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,212
Was there really gold here?

39
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,927
How dare he talk such bullshit?

40
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:17,347
What was he saying when he was hit?

41
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,516
I don't know. Did he say something?

42
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,726
-She came out of nowhere.
-That was fast.

43
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,019
My goodness.

44
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:25,147
She's the best. Way to go.

45
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,109
EPISODE 19

46
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:30,819
Everyone.

47
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,654
Are you all okay?

48
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:35,115
Of course. We're as good as new.

49
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:37,868
You guys sure can fight.

50
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,578
How have you been holding back?

51
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,746
We didn't have a good reason to fight.

52
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,082
And it usually bites us in the ass.

53
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,795
But we have a legitimate reason
to fight now.

54
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:53,008
And you are the ones who gave us
a legitimate reason to fight.

55
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,386
And you also got us together
as a community.

56
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,680
Let me say something fancy, too.

57
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:00,640
"If you walk alone, you reach quickly.

58
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,684
But if we go together, we can go far."

59
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:08,523
I wrote your name when I was asked
who my role model is at school.

60
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:11,318
-Good.
-That's great.

61
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:16,490
Thanks to you, I learned a thing
or two about the importance of power.

62
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:17,699
Thank you.

63
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,326
Merciful Buddha…

64
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,703
Hey, Nutria.

65
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,622
The only thing you could do was to bite.

66
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:26,082
Gosh, you know nothing.
That's an advanced skill.

67
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,585
I bite, chew, taste, and savor.
There's four levels.

68
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,047
Nutria, can you open this for me?

69
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:36,218
Don't do it!

70
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:40,096
-Did you see that?
-Are you okay?

71
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,806
-Blood. Is he bleeding?
-His tooth…

72
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,767
-His tooth…
-I think he chipped his tooth.

73
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,436
-Nutria.
-Nutria.

74
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:49,439
Mr. Cho.

75
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,818
You didn't answer my calls,
so I was worried.

76
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:57,239
I was ambushed.

77
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,157
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:01,743
By the way,

79
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,079
how did you secretly move the gold?

80
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:05,914
It must have attracted some attention.

81
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:17,092
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

82
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:20,470
I've wanted to ask you a question.

83
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,347
Go ahead.

84
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:37,779
Just what is…

85
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:40,907
under here?

86
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:46,663
I kept getting electing shocks
whenever I meditated here,

87
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,665
so I opened it.

88
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:16,985
Wait, sir. My finger!

89
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:20,822
One, two, three.

90
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:32,000
And we saw something
that looked like a door to a vault.

91
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:35,503
I couldn't stop shouting during meditation

92
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:37,964
because of the electricity.

93
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,426
Seeing how the light was on,

94
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:43,511
there must have been an electric leakage.

95
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,392
This is…

96
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:54,105
where the gold is stored…

97
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,733
isn't it?

98
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:02,906
Is the window open?

99
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,829
Right?

100
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:21,758
Yes.

101
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:38,817
Why didn't you tell the other tenants?

102
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,028
We didn't want there to be
a dispute over it.

103
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:45,865
So we waited for the owner.

104
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,200
I see.

105
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:54,666
Since you know now,

106
00:10:56,668 --> 00:11:00,046
please help me.

107
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:40,044
But how do you open the vault?

108
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,256
Ms. Seo.

109
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,217
It's time now.

110
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:49,929
Let's open the vault tomorrow.

111
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:54,809
At last!

112
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,356
-By the way, Mr. Cassano,
-Yes?

113
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,650
I will open the vault for you, but…

114
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:07,322
You'll get a fair share of your cut.
You trust me, right?

115
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,703
What are you…

116
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,712
Of course. I will open it right away!

117
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,464
Okay.

118
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:26,090
-Got that?
-Got it.

119
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:28,176
Got it.

120
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:31,804
-It's tomorrow.
-Yes.

121
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:32,847
Nice!

122
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:34,224
-Great!
-Yes.

123
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:36,017
-It hurts?
-Where?

124
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:23,815
We're almost there.

125
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,316
One, two…

126
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,860
Mr. Nam, pull it harder.

127
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,971
Please move the gold
little by little every day.

128
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:58,933
NANYAK TEMPLE

129
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,151
Then where is the gold?

130
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:57,367
Someone might hear us from outside.
Let me whisper it to you.

131
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,077
Yes.

132
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,215
Then, is the Guillotine file
with the gold?

133
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:13,591
No.

134
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:18,304
I hid the Guillotine file
somewhere only I know about.

135
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,810
He didn't even tell me.

136
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,228
Obviously, he didn't--

137
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,396
I know.

138
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,650
Mr. Cho.

139
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,404
I will tell you when the time is right.

140
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,823
GEUMGA PLAZA

141
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:47,583
Did you come back because of me?

142
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,212
Your Italian family needs you, too.

143
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:53,965
I took care of it.

144
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:57,176
How did you take care of it that quickly?

145
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,095
You didn't even leave Korea.

146
00:16:01,347 --> 00:16:02,598
Eighty million euros.

147
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:03,891
Pardon?

148
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:09,147
I promised to give them 80 million euros
for leaving my family alone.

149
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:11,983
By the way, 80 million euros is about…

150
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,237
a bit over 100 billion won.

151
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:23,911
Did they agree to that?

152
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:25,830
Yes. I sent over the contract.

153
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:29,042
My contract is credible
in the Mafia world.

154
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:38,801
Then I'm relieved.

155
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:43,598
Thank you.

156
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,100
And…

157
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:49,604
I'm so happy…

158
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,610
that you are back in one piece.

159
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,285
You look cool today just like that day.

160
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,456
The day we had the party.

161
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:17,215
You looked great in a Booralro suit
that I'd only heard about.

162
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,766
I was glad to meet…

163
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:33,815
someone who recognized
a Booralro suit that day.

164
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,261
What the…

165
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,179
Damn it.

166
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:33,249
I couldn't hug you earlier
because Mr. Cho was here.

167
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:34,167
Finally…

168
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:36,252
Mr. Cassano.

169
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,629
You've been hugging him
for over 20 seconds.

170
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:42,508
People say you barely notice newcomers,
but you notice people's absences.

171
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:47,597
Your absence left a hole
with a 30m diameter in my heart.

172
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,015
Okay.

173
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:52,852
Please stop hugging me now.
That hole has been filled in now.

174
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,691
Let him go, please.

175
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:01,277
-We should teach Park Seung-jun a lesson.
-Yes.

176
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:04,113
Right.

177
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,242
I don't care if he's running
for President. He needs a lesson.

178
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:09,994
You startled me.

179
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:14,248
Come on, my dear Guillotine file.

180
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,086
How many bribes did he take?

181
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,922
How corrupt is he?

182
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:31,390
CANDIDATE PARK SEUNG-JUN ACCUSED
OF BUYING LAND FOR SPECULATION

183
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,686
CANDIDATE PARK'S BROTHER-IN-LAW
COLLUDED AS THE HEAD OF IUDC

184
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,980
The article about Park Seung-jun is up.

185
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:40,399
What? I can't believe
he's running for president.

186
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,194
The whole family is corrupted.
Our country is doomed.

187
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,905
CANDIDATE PARK PROFITED OFF
LAND SPECULATION

188
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:49,825
I don't get it. What is wrong with you?

189
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,620
If only you got rid of Vincenzo
from the get-go…

190
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:56,249
With all due respect, sir,

191
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,793
I think you acted rashly.

192
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:01,128
What?

193
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:04,632
Did you tell Mr. Park
that you went after Vincenzo?

194
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,511
It's none of your business.

195
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:11,722
You should never underestimate him.

196
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,142
He has definite evidence to bring us down

197
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,395
but he's just spreading them as rumors.

198
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,772
He's toying with us.

199
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:24,568
It's likely he will use the evidence
during the Babel Tower trial.

200
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:28,155
All the videos of people
involved in the tower

201
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:30,950
as well as Mr. Park's involvement.

202
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:34,912
You two must be in that video too, right?

203
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:37,123
Then we'll all be arrested
if things go south.

204
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:40,042
-Yes.
-Mr. Kim.

205
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:42,837
There is a way to stop the trial.

206
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,758
But…

207
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:52,388
Mr. Park has to set something up for me.

208
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,141
Oh, right.

209
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,601
When will Mr. Jung get promoted?

210
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,771
He wants to take the promotion
after this case.

211
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,231
Just promote him.

212
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,442
He needs more authority
to make this go away.

213
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:06,485
Yes, sir.

214
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,529
Accept the promotion.

215
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:09,864
Yes, Mr. Kim.

216
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:14,702
Let me offer my congratulations
in advance, Mr. Jung.

217
00:21:22,918 --> 00:21:25,713
Gosh.
Does he think he runs this place, too?

218
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:26,964
You little…

219
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:30,426
Why are you even here
if you're going to act that way?

220
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:44,482
Did I offend you in any way?

221
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,568
No, not at all.

222
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,403
Why are you in a bad mood then?

223
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,654
Just because.

224
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:53,866
I see.

225
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:58,496
People can just be in a bad mood.
That happens.

226
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,052
Hey, over there!

227
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:14,595
Move!

228
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,641
Out of the way!

229
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,187
Stop him!

230
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,022
-Stop him now!
-My ear!

231
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,322
He still has his ear.

232
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:35,825
Come here.

233
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:37,284
Come here, you asshole!

234
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:38,869
Let go of me!

235
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:52,758
Ms. Hong.

236
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,552
Have this.

237
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:57,638
It'll help relieve stress.

238
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,478
I need these when I'm working.

239
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,188
They wake me up.

240
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,318
Come on!

241
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:15,239
What's wrong?

242
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,160
This is from
the Seoul Namdongbu District Court.

243
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:20,619
You should read this.

244
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:29,170
"The court finds it highly likely
that the Babel Tower trial

245
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:34,466
could be used by the press
and the opposition

246
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,097
to smear the name
of a specific presidential candidate.

247
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:42,766
Therefore, after much discussion,

248
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,686
the court has reached a ruling
that the trial will be postponed

249
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:47,021
until the election is over."

250
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,151
It looks like Mr. Park

251
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:54,195
pulled some strings.

252
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:56,780
Unbelievable. Gosh. This is just…

253
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:01,702
I mean, how could they stoop so low?

254
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:05,080
Since it was them who stooped this low,

255
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:06,457
we should do the same.

256
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,500
How?

257
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:10,502
It looks like
the trial won't be happening.

258
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:13,464
We have a magic lamp.

259
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:16,884
The Guillotine file?

260
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:22,264
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

261
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,603
Everything from here.

262
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:30,397
-Namdongbu office.
-Namdongbu office.

263
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:31,857
Right there.

264
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:34,860
Gosh.

265
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:37,321
Damn it.

266
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,869
I just read this on the anonymous
chat room for lawyers.

267
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,916
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk was
the one who postponed the trial.

268
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:52,419
What's more annoying is
that he finally got promoted.

269
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:55,547
That darned traitor.

270
00:24:55,631 --> 00:24:59,343
Let's give him a present
for the promotion then.

271
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,354
There we go.

272
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:16,610
You were right, Ms. Hong…

273
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:19,863
about how everyone here is
as crooked as the Mafia.

274
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,993
They group together
as government officials…

275
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:27,121
in finance, transport, taxes,
and even as alumni…

276
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:30,165
There are so many.

277
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,546
"It's okay to be corrupt
when you're competent."

278
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:37,881
This is what many of us believe.

279
00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:42,803
But…

280
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:45,431
how can you be competent
when you're corrupt?

281
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:48,017
Competent in looking after oneself, maybe.

282
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,060
But never when looking after others.

283
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:51,228
I see.

284
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:56,525
That makes sense looking at it
from a villain's point of view.

285
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:06,577
When you leave
after everything goes as planned,

286
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,620
you won't be able to come back, right?

287
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,710
But, to me,

288
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:19,256
Vincenzo Cassano will not be
remembered just as a memory.

289
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:23,344
Ms. Hong

290
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:30,684
I never make promises
unless it's for business purposes.

291
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:35,356
But I promise you this.

292
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:39,401
I will come back.

293
00:26:57,753 --> 00:27:00,839
"Further discussion
on the aforementioned trial was necessary,

294
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,467
and the court has reached a new decision.

295
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:06,804
The aforementioned trial is
unlikely to be abused

296
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:09,390
as a false propaganda
in the next presidential election,

297
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:13,894
and the suffering of the plaintiffs
from Babel Tower's development is greater.

298
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:17,856
Therefore, you are notified that the trial
will proceed as previously scheduled."

299
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,530
I'm sorry.

300
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:31,537
Mr. Jung.

301
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:34,623
You said you could handle it.
What is this?

302
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,212
They used the Guillotine file as leverage.

303
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:42,965
You should have seen that coming!

304
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:46,635
Since you saw it coming,
why don't you and Mr. Han handle this?

305
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:48,804
What did you say? Hey!

306
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,155
It's so cold. Gosh, it's freezing.

307
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,823
-It's so cold.
-Going home, sir?

308
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:09,616
Who are you?

309
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:11,577
It's Judge Heo.

310
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:14,037
Your Honor. Hey, man.

311
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:16,790
Listen. Ung-jin.

312
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:20,711
You are our last defender in this game.

313
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,296
Okay? You're the sweeper.

314
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:24,173
Yes.

315
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:27,050
So listen carefully. Focus!

316
00:28:27,134 --> 00:28:30,053
Gosh. You startled. I almost punched you.

317
00:28:30,137 --> 00:28:32,222
All right.

318
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:37,227
So whatever happens during the trial,
you must back us up at the end.

319
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,437
I got it, sir.

320
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:42,357
Get home safely, Mr. Chief Prosecutor.

321
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,735
Gosh. Don't be so formal with me.

322
00:28:44,818 --> 00:28:47,738
-I'll get going.
-Wait, your car is here.

323
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:49,865
We have the same cars!

324
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:52,242
Gosh.

325
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:57,080
Don't be like that. Don't do that.

326
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:59,166
Treat me like your friend.

327
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:01,585
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to sleep now.

328
00:29:01,668 --> 00:29:02,711
Bye.

329
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,799
See you.

330
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,969
Bye.

331
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:25,609
Sweeper, my ass.

332
00:29:26,193 --> 00:29:29,196
I know that he's just using me.

333
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,280
That jerk.

334
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:32,491
Open the door.

335
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,085
Let's go.

336
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:05,148
Hey.

337
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:08,193
Drive me home. Why did you stop here?

338
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,620
You…

339
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,957
You're Vincenzo Casanova.

340
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:27,754
Get out.

341
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:30,382
Get out of the car.

342
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:52,571
What do you want from me?

343
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,032
-I'll tell you a story.
-What story?

344
00:30:55,616 --> 00:30:59,786
King Cambyses of Ancient Persia
punished corrupt judges severely.

345
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:02,873
He once skinned a corrupt judge alive.

346
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:04,166
Oh, my.

347
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:06,460
-Do you know what happened next?
-No.

348
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:10,589
The corrupt judge's son was also a judge.
When he presided over trials,

349
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,801
the king made the son sit
on his father's skin.

350
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:18,597
So he could come to his senses
and give a fair trial.

351
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:21,308
Why are you telling me that?

352
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,480
I'm saying

353
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:29,524
you could have ended up like that
if we were in those times.

354
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:30,609
Gosh.

355
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:33,820
You're presiding over
Chairman Jang's trial, right?

356
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:35,948
Yes.

357
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,453
Do what you always have done
so that he can get out early.

358
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:46,124
Even if I try to get him out
as soon as possible,

359
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,377
it will take two months at least.

360
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,837
Then don't extend his imprisonment.

361
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:52,798
If you refuse…

362
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:57,928
you'll be getting
more than a wasp this time.

363
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,436
Goodbye.

364
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:10,941
DAY OF THE TRIAL

365
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:12,609
The law is like a spiderweb.

366
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:14,611
It has limited durability.

367
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:17,072
Strong wasps will tear it apart
and fly away,

368
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:19,533
but weak flies end up dead
on the spiderweb.

369
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:22,869
But the flies in this plaza
joined forces together

370
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:26,206
and are biting off everything
whether it's a wasp or a spiderweb.

371
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:29,251
And you'll see the result yourself today.

372
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:30,836
Watch carefully

373
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,921
what happens to the wasps.

374
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,464
Let's do this!

375
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:36,883
Let's go.

376
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,510
One, two, three.

377
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:40,721
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

378
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:47,936
Where's the file I've prepared?

379
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,980
Where is the file?

380
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:51,857
I told you ten times already!

381
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:54,901
I told you 1,000 times!

382
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:56,445
This way, sir.

383
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,836
Sit down.

384
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,254
We're in the sacred court.

385
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:20,218
All right.

386
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,098
All rise for the honorable Judge.

387
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:28,351
PLAINTIFF

388
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:29,394
DEFENDANT

389
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,187
Please be seated.

390
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:26,368
CHIEF PROSECUTOR HAN SEUNG-HYUK

391
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,709
We will now begin

392
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:39,673
the trial for case number 2021-30184,

393
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:44,094
Babel Group
versus the tenants of Geumga Plaza,

394
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:48,932
to settle the compensation
for damages caused

395
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:52,102
by Babel Group's illegal activities.

396
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:56,773
We will begin by
questioning the plaintiff's witness.

397
00:34:56,857 --> 00:35:00,986
Plaintiff's counsel,
you may question your witness.

398
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,906
Our witness is Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.
Please come forward.

399
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:11,705
Your tie.

400
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,208
Fix your hair.

401
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:17,961
Good luck!

402
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:39,983
WITNESS BOX

403
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:44,988
I solemnly swear…

404
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,827
-Your Honor.
-Yes?

405
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:54,497
My honorable judge.

406
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,082
Yes?

407
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,834
My testimony will be

408
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:02,130
about why Babel Group committed
the illegal activities.

409
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:06,509
And I will testify with video evidence.

410
00:36:06,593 --> 00:36:07,677
Your Honor.

411
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:10,472
His video evidence has nothing
to do with this trial.

412
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:14,226
We might find something important in it.

413
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:18,730
So I will decide whether it's relevant
or not after watching it.

414
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:19,648
Sit down.

415
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:32,077
Play the video.

416
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,455
Gosh.

417
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:36,957
-What's that?
-Goodness.

418
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,793
-Oh, my.
-What's he holding?

419
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:41,336
-A gold toad?
-No way!

420
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:44,673
-Come on.
-Is that really gold?

421
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:46,633
-That's gold.
-Look at that.

422
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:48,385
A gold toad?

423
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:58,144
DEFENDANT

424
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,956
What's with the blur?

425
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,672
Why are only our faces blurred?

426
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:27,590
Why…

427
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,948
Quiet down.

428
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,285
Please quiet down!

429
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:16,097
Stay away.

430
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:18,558
Don't…

431
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,860
Good to see you again, friend.

432
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,157
I warned you, didn't I?

433
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,117
To do whatever you like.

434
00:38:36,993 --> 00:38:39,913
That I'll come back for you
when you have everything you want.

435
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,051
Did you?

436
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,179
I don't seem to recall.

437
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,724
But you got your promotion
and tried to stop the hearing.

438
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:02,644
Congratulations.

439
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:05,313
You've ignored my warning
and chose to die.

440
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:09,025
Right.

441
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:11,027
You can't kill a prosecutor
in the court of law.

442
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:12,695
Don't push yourself.

443
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:17,909
Show me how humble you can be
in the next two days and I'll spare you.

444
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,578
I'm being generous.

445
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:21,996
You Mafia prick.

446
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,999
You can't toy with a prosecutor like this.

447
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:39,514
I'm not toying with you.

448
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:43,309
I'm giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

449
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,632
Gosh. This doesn't feel right.

450
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:22,223
Why on earth did they blur only our faces?

451
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:25,101
Why do you think? He wants to kill us.

452
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:28,897
It'll be hard to do that
if we're in prison.

453
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,732
I know. I know that, too.

454
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,612
By the way,

455
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:38,907
all of us are about to get killed.
Why do you look so calm?

456
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:43,786
What do you suggest I do, then?
Should I go somewhere and weep?

457
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:48,124
We need to figure out a way
to get out of this.

458
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:53,671
Why don't you find your own way out,
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?

459
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,048
What?

460
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:57,884
This is our farewell drink.

461
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,351
This is the perfect place.
You recruited me here.

462
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:08,478
Why would you say something like that?

463
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:10,855
Come on.

464
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:15,443
We need to close ranks even more
at times like this.

465
00:41:17,278 --> 00:41:18,947
Close ranks, my ass.

466
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:23,159
You coaxed Jang Han-seo
to save your own ass

467
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:27,330
and even begged Park Seung-jun
for you to become the chief prosecutor.

468
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:29,541
I should rip your mouth to pieces.

469
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,086
You're hurting my feelings!

470
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:37,715
Think about it.
Who helped you live in luxury like this?

471
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,511
Look at your face. It's glowing!
I bet you forgot how you started. Gosh.

472
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:44,681
Thank you so much, you slithering snake.

473
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:45,682
Snake?

474
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:50,520
If you get in the way of Chairman Jang
and me to save your own skin,

475
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:54,357
I will kill you myself. Got that?

476
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:05,493
I enjoyed the drink.

477
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:11,207
Fine. We should part our ways now.

478
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,293
Go. Leave, Myung-hee!

479
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:17,755
Don't you come back to me and beg!

480
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,008
I'm the chief prosecutor!

481
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:24,053
The Babel Tower scandal has come
as a huge shock to the public.

482
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:27,265
The illegal activities and corruption
in the prosecution, the police,

483
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,934
the National Assembly, the media,
and local organizations

484
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:32,604
have appalled the public.

485
00:42:33,104 --> 00:42:36,733
Moreover, the constant assaults on
and attempted murder of the tenants

486
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:39,986
of Geumga Plaza in the process
of illegally acquiring the land

487
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:42,614
for the Babel Tower
have angered the public.

488
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:45,116
Babel Group's ownership of Geumga Plaza

489
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,077
will be nullified
due to corruption and illegal activities

490
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:50,788
committed when acquiring
the permit for the construction.

491
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:14,395
Yes. Stop the production of RDU-90.

492
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:16,272
Yes. Cancel the order of raw materials.

493
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:19,776
No. It's okay.
It's fine, just do as I say.

494
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:22,362
Okay. Good day.

495
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,324
Sorry.
I have a lot of urgent matters to handle.

496
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:30,536
You…

497
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:33,998
really look like a real chairman now.

498
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:36,292
I'm so proud of you.

499
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:38,461
Why would you be? You're not my mom.

500
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:46,177
Oh, right.
What did you want to talk about?

501
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:47,929
Oh, right.

502
00:43:50,098 --> 00:43:54,894
You watched the video at the trial
yesterday, right?

503
00:43:54,977 --> 00:43:56,521
Only our faces were blurred.

504
00:43:58,022 --> 00:44:01,150
He did it so he could kill us.

505
00:44:02,402 --> 00:44:04,695
So you and I should join hands again--

506
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:07,281
No. I'll join hands with Vincenzo.

507
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:08,324
Pardon?

508
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,619
Vincenzo's in a different league

509
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:13,830
from you.

510
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:16,958
I'll team up with a pro.

511
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,210
But still,
you can't just toss me out like this.

512
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,170
Don't forget who introduced you to him.

513
00:44:21,254 --> 00:44:23,297
It was me!

514
00:44:24,424 --> 00:44:25,842
-Oh, right.
-Yes.

515
00:44:25,925 --> 00:44:28,177
You're right.

516
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,180
-Sorry. I forgot about that.
-Exactly.

517
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:33,766
-Thank you so much. I mean it.
-I understand.

518
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:35,893
It's okay.

519
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:38,813
But you're on your own now.

520
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,399
What do you mean?

521
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:42,900
-Mr. Chief Prosecutor…
-Let me join you.

522
00:44:44,193 --> 00:44:46,487
-you're on your own now.
-Sir.

523
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,407
Sir?

524
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:54,078
Mr. Han is leaving now.
Get his car now. He's in a hurry.

525
00:44:54,162 --> 00:44:56,956
No, I'm not. Can I join you?

526
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:09,677
Inmate 6723. Visitor.

527
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:38,122
What is it? Are you here to gloat?

528
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:39,540
That you won?

529
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:46,297
If you just hear the news,

530
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,342
you might not actually feel it.

531
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:05,983
Sorry I broke into your place.

532
00:47:09,714 --> 00:47:12,967
But what a relief.
It wasn't the real tower.

533
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:18,472
Now that Babel Tower
has been brought down,

534
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,267
you must know what's next.

535
00:47:32,987 --> 00:47:34,947
I'm a hungry cat now.

536
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:38,326
Fine. See if you can eat me.

537
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:41,245
Try to eat me whole.

538
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:45,458
I will when you get out.
Right after my celebration.

539
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:47,335
When I get out of here,

540
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,296
it won't be as Chairman Jang Han-seok.

541
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:53,424
Is that so?

542
00:47:54,008 --> 00:47:56,594
I will be the Jang Han-seok
that I was in my childhood.

543
00:47:58,012 --> 00:48:00,264
A monster that had no inhibitions.

544
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:06,937
You won't be going up against
the chairman of Babel.

545
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,692
You'll be up against just plain old me.

546
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:16,113
That'll be interesting.

547
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:19,367
You know my past very well.

548
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:23,663
What I did to my friends when I was young.

549
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,543
I think your watch…

550
00:48:30,878 --> 00:48:33,130
will end up in my walk-in closet.

551
00:48:38,386 --> 00:48:39,470
Suit yourself.

552
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:44,642
I have a knack
for straightening up delinquent kids.

553
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:57,238
Mr. Jung.

554
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:01,450
I have an urgent favor to ask you.

555
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:05,830
Let me…

556
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:10,042
stay in prison just for three months.

557
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:11,669
Pardon?

558
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:15,005
I'm sure you know why I'm asking you this.

559
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:16,674
Vincenzo…

560
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:18,884
Listen.

561
00:49:18,968 --> 00:49:21,887
Just come up with a charge
and lock me up just for three months.

562
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:24,849
And get me out if Vincenzo dies
during those three months.

563
00:49:26,016 --> 00:49:27,643
But still. I cannot--

564
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:29,812
Gosh. Just do it. Do it for me.

565
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:33,566
If you do it for me, I will give you
all the privileged information

566
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:35,526
on Wusang's clients
including Jang Han-seok.

567
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:38,779
It'll be as good as
having the Guillotine file.

568
00:49:39,363 --> 00:49:43,284
With that information,
you will climb up the ladder smoothly.

569
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:48,956
Come on. Just do it.

570
00:49:59,592 --> 00:50:00,718
You think this is pizza?

571
00:50:00,801 --> 00:50:02,303
Yes, Korean-style pizza.

572
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:06,974
Vincenzo.

573
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,562
Are you really going to leave Korea
once everything is over?

574
00:50:12,188 --> 00:50:13,147
Yes.

575
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,193
Can't you just stay here?

576
00:50:17,276 --> 00:50:20,738
I can hire you as a legal advisor
for Babel Group.

577
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:23,240
-You'll be a director.
-I'm good.

578
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:31,499
Then don't leave without saying goodbye.
Okay?

579
00:50:31,582 --> 00:50:33,501
That's what the Mafia does in the movies.

580
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:36,754
Some Mafia members have
week-long farewell parties.

581
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:40,508
Seriously.
Your party has to last a week, too. Okay?

582
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:45,763
Have you heard from Jang Han-seok?

583
00:50:46,472 --> 00:50:47,723
No. He's been quiet.

584
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:51,977
He'll get what he deserves
if we provide all the evidence, right?

585
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:54,480
We don't know that yet.

586
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:58,943
Then could he be released
after two months?

587
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:03,405
Listen.

588
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:06,951
Go abroad for now, just for a few months.

589
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,286
Okay?

590
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:15,000
Once he gets out…

591
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:17,711
you'll be his first target.

592
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:19,547
I'll recommend a few safe places.

593
00:51:23,759 --> 00:51:25,010
I'm good.

594
00:51:26,637 --> 00:51:27,847
When I started this…

595
00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:31,267
I knew I'd have to risk my life
at some point.

596
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:34,353
Besides, I made a promise to you.

597
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:38,357
You can keep your promise later.
I want you to reconsider.

598
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:46,740
No. I'll fight.

599
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,786
I have 20 bodyguards.
It won't be that easy to get to me.

600
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:58,168
And more importantly…

601
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:02,089
I have you.

602
00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:04,425
You know everything,

603
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,470
keep me safe,
and beat up all the bad guys.

604
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:10,848
That's you. Goodness.

605
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,517
Why are you so cool?

606
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:17,396
Hey, that's soy sauce. Don't drink it.

607
00:52:17,479 --> 00:52:18,564
That's salty.

608
00:52:19,773 --> 00:52:21,984
You should have told me sooner.

609
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:32,369
What should I do to get Mr. Jang out?

610
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:36,957
What should I do?

611
00:52:57,645 --> 00:53:00,773
Mr. Cassano,
once Jang Han-seok is released,

612
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:02,483
we'll do as planned, right?

613
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:07,154
Ms. Hong.

614
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:10,616
You really don't have to join me

615
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:14,995
to finish off Jang Han-seok.

616
00:53:16,497 --> 00:53:19,583
So far, we've been like vigilantes.
But after this,

617
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,378
we'll be monsters.

618
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:24,797
And I want to protect

619
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:27,299
your virtue.

620
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,723
To be honest, everything we did

621
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:40,020
was so cruel
that it was hard for me to endure.

622
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:45,734
But do you know why I supported you?

623
00:53:47,987 --> 00:53:51,991
There's no law that can punish
a monster like Jang Han-seok.

624
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:55,035
And there are no other options.

625
00:53:56,704 --> 00:54:00,165
That's why I supported your method,
the lesser evil.

626
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:04,294
I thought that was the right thing to do.

627
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:16,682
NAM JU-SUNG

628
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,809
EVERYONE IN THE VIDEO WE PROVIDED
WAS RELEASED

629
00:54:20,144 --> 00:54:21,311
Unbelievable.

630
00:54:22,688 --> 00:54:23,647
What is it?

631
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:27,317
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk released everyone.

632
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:31,113
Everyone in the video
that was taken at Jang Han-seok's house.

633
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:39,538
That means he turned down
my last act of generosity.

634
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:52,217
How could you ask for help

635
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:54,678
after screwing this up
in every possible way?

636
00:54:55,304 --> 00:54:57,639
We can put an end to everything
for good this time.

637
00:54:57,723 --> 00:55:00,267
Including Vincenzo
and the Guillotine file.

638
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:03,437
Forget it.

639
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,606
We'll take care of Vincenzo

640
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:08,901
and the Guillotine file ourselves.

641
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:12,154
I don't think that's a good idea.

642
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:15,741
Mr. Park is in the middle of his campaign.

643
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:19,953
What if your attempt to get rid of him
goes south and affects the campaign?

644
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,248
That will be another scandal.

645
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:30,714
For Mr. Park's safety,

646
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:33,967
let me take care of this problem.

647
00:55:34,718 --> 00:55:37,554
So how will you do that?

648
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,778
Please do whatever it takes
to get Mr. Jang out of prison.

649
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:56,532
He's the biggest problem right now.

650
00:55:56,615 --> 00:55:58,992
Getting him out is next to impossible.

651
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,161
Mr. Kim.

652
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:08,085
-Give me that.
-How does it look?

653
00:56:09,628 --> 00:56:11,255
-Did you get it?
-This one.

654
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:16,593
I already fabricated evidence

655
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:19,054
that I'd incited, threatened,
and pressured Babel

656
00:56:19,138 --> 00:56:21,849
for my own benefit
since when I was working as a prosecutor.

657
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:25,561
No judge or prosecutor
will be able to tear down my claim.

658
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:27,771
With my evidence,

659
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:33,152
it'll look like
Mr. Jang was no more than my puppet.

660
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:45,664
Are you saying that you'll…

661
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:47,291
Yes.

662
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:54,047
I'll take the fall for everything
and go to prison.

663
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:59,887
Mr. Jang is the only one
who can put an end

664
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:02,639
to Mr. Park's Babel Tower scandal

665
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:05,642
and bring down Vincenzo.

666
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:08,896
Mr. Jung!

667
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:13,775
Many congratulations on your promotion!

668
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:16,653
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

669
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:19,072
-Mr. Jung!
-Yes!

670
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:25,412
We are the prosecutors of this country.

671
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:29,291
Do not cave in or lose,

672
00:57:29,374 --> 00:57:32,085
especially to those rich assholes.

673
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:36,340
If they challenge our authority,
stomp them out.

674
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:38,300
Got it?

675
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:39,259
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

676
00:57:39,343 --> 00:57:40,636
Raise your glasses.

677
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:45,641
Cheers to Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office!

678
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:47,809
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

679
00:57:47,893 --> 00:57:49,102
Go, Namdongbu!

680
00:57:49,186 --> 00:57:50,646
-Congrats.
-Drink!

681
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:53,315
Congratulations, Mr. Jung!

682
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:56,610
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

683
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:25,097
You…

684
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:27,140
Vincenzo.

685
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:31,728
Hey!

686
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,479
You bastard…

687
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:18,025
It's rare for me to be so generous,
but you won't accept.

688
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:19,776
Shut up, you Mafia prick.

689
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:23,739
You sure talk big for a lowlife criminal.

690
00:59:23,822 --> 00:59:26,491
I may be a criminal,
but I'm aware of the things I did.

691
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:28,201
Why aren't you?

692
00:59:28,994 --> 00:59:30,287
I haven't done anything wrong.

693
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:34,291
I live by the law and its principles.

694
00:59:34,374 --> 00:59:35,334
All right.

695
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:38,879
Since you won't acknowledge what
you've done, I'll free you from your sins.

696
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:50,015
That which has no life has no sin.

697
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:07,574
-Hey, isn't that a person?
-What?

698
01:00:09,326 --> 01:00:10,243
What the…

699
01:00:44,444 --> 01:00:45,737
I finished one.

700
01:00:47,072 --> 01:00:51,368
And I must take care of the rest
one by one.

701
01:00:56,748 --> 01:00:57,791
For me…

702
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:01,461
and for Ms. Hong.

703
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:16,727
The fabricated evidence is ironclad.

704
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:19,229
You didn't have to go that far.

705
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:20,897
It's all right.

706
01:01:21,732 --> 01:01:23,692
I'll humiliate myself once

707
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:26,403
and go down for all the charges
to make it all go away.

708
01:01:27,446 --> 01:01:30,907
Once you get out, recuperate,

709
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,409
and get me out later.

710
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:39,458
When you get out,
you will be the vice chairwoman…

711
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:42,461
of the Babel Group.

712
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:46,673
Thank you.

713
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:52,554
You told me to keep an eye
on Mr. Jang Han-seo.

714
01:01:53,764 --> 01:01:56,391
He's definitely with Vincenzo now.

715
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:01,062
He makes it so obvious.

716
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:09,446
Did you hear that
Mr. Jung committed suicide?

717
01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:10,447
Yes.

718
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,159
He should've at least
let him enjoy his party.

719
01:02:14,826 --> 01:02:16,286
He's so cruel.

720
01:02:18,413 --> 01:02:19,790
Vincenzo is…

721
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,584
making his moves now.

722
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:26,588
I'll do as you say on one condition.

723
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:30,967
I want to be released quickly

724
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:33,845
without anyone knowing.

725
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:37,140
Don't let anyone know.

726
01:02:39,351 --> 01:02:40,477
It'll be just me.

727
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:53,532
One, two. One, two, three, four.

728
01:02:53,615 --> 01:02:55,826
One, two. One, two, three, four.

729
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:56,743
That's it.

730
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:01,623
Ms. Choi.

731
01:03:01,706 --> 01:03:03,917
We're from Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

732
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,712
You're under arrest for instigating
and abetting tax evasion and murder.

733
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:08,964
Is that true?

734
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:10,799
Give me two minutes.

735
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:12,592
Just two minutes.

736
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:16,012
You don't have to read me
the Miranda rights.

737
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:20,308
Choi Myung-hee was arrested?

738
01:03:20,392 --> 01:03:24,479
Yes. And the charges against her
are just huge.

739
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:27,190
Her subordinate must have reported her.

740
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:29,109
Then, I'm sure it was Mr. Yoon.

741
01:03:29,693 --> 01:03:32,195
I mean, she must've made
his life a living hell.

742
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:37,325
That happens
when you fail to protect your family.

743
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:11,359
SEOUL NAMDONGBU DETENTION CENTER

744
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:36,820
Are you going somewhere?

745
01:05:36,903 --> 01:05:39,322
A judicial training reunion.
Why do you ask?

746
01:05:39,406 --> 01:05:42,242
I see. I thought
you were going to ask me out.

747
01:05:42,325 --> 01:05:44,244
Gosh. You were totally off.

748
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:48,248
But why? You said you weren't
on good terms with them.

749
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:49,666
I'm not going there for fun.

750
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:51,960
I need to check
if they're badmouthing me or not.

751
01:05:52,043 --> 01:05:53,795
I see. When will it be over?

752
01:05:53,878 --> 01:05:54,963
I'll have to see.

753
01:05:55,547 --> 01:05:58,967
By the way, if you're going home,
you should go up that way.

754
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,511
I'm going somewhere, too.

755
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:02,429
As if.

756
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:04,806
I'm leaving. Don't skip your meal.

757
01:06:04,889 --> 01:06:07,183
-When will it be over?
-No idea!

758
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,269
-Are you going to drink?
-A lot!

759
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:11,396
-Should I pick you up later?
-No.

760
01:06:11,479 --> 01:06:12,689
Is that for women only?

761
01:06:13,398 --> 01:06:14,816
There are men, too.

762
01:06:22,741 --> 01:06:23,825
Hello, sir.

763
01:06:24,492 --> 01:06:25,910
Yes, our merciful Buddha.

764
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:28,038
Did you eat?

765
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,373
I see. You're fasting.

766
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:33,084
No. I'm sorry. Bye.

767
01:06:33,168 --> 01:06:34,419
Okay, bye.

768
01:07:39,984 --> 01:07:41,361
Hey, Mi-gyeong.

769
01:07:41,444 --> 01:07:42,862
I'm in the parking lot.

770
01:07:42,946 --> 01:07:45,365
Yes. Hye-won and Hye-ju are there, right?

771
01:07:45,448 --> 01:07:48,159
Yes. Okay. I'll be there in a bit.

772
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,945
Mr. Kim? I thought you went home.

773
01:08:27,073 --> 01:08:27,907
Mr. Kim?

774
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:07,614
I came out quietly
to surprise you, brother.

775
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,662
What's the point of hiring bodyguards?

776
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:17,165
When I offered money,
they all took it and left.

777
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:21,377
CEO JANG HAN-SEO

778
01:09:24,088 --> 01:09:25,882
You incompetent traitor.

779
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:28,551
I didn't betray you.

780
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:33,514
I was trying to run the company properly.

781
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:44,150
I brought your gun.

782
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,783
I couldn't get one at such short notice.

783
01:09:57,163 --> 01:09:58,164
Okay.

784
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,668
I see.

785
01:10:02,418 --> 01:10:04,545
Now I really can't keep you alive.

786
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:10,176
I'm sure you understand that.

787
01:10:19,602 --> 01:10:20,687
Yes.

788
01:10:23,523 --> 01:10:25,775
I was bound to suffer
the same fate as Father.

789
01:10:28,945 --> 01:10:30,280
I will accept it.

790
01:10:47,672 --> 01:10:50,258
HONG CHA-YOUNG

791
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:56,472
The person you have reached
cannot come to the phone right now.

792
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:58,099
Please leave a message…

793
01:13:39,469 --> 01:13:40,636
Han-seo.

794
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:48,102
Han-seo.

795
01:13:53,858 --> 01:13:54,942
Are you okay?

796
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:32,146
I didn't think you would abduct me,
but you did.

797
01:14:33,856 --> 01:14:35,983
This makes you such a cheap villain.

798
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,402
What's the difference?

799
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:41,656
All villains are the same.

800
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:43,574
No matter how hard I think about it,

801
01:14:44,408 --> 01:14:46,244
you are not a human being.

802
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:55,836
Don't you know how much I love you?

803
01:14:58,005 --> 01:14:59,173
That makes me human.

804
01:14:59,257 --> 01:15:01,467
Abducting a woman you love

805
01:15:01,551 --> 01:15:04,804
is not love, but a crime,
you crazy asshole.

806
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:06,556
Sorry, Cha-young.

807
01:15:09,642 --> 01:15:12,645
But to me, my principle comes before love.

808
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:14,230
Your principle?

809
01:15:14,897 --> 01:15:17,066
Killing everyone you don't like?

810
01:15:19,527 --> 01:15:22,321
What a load of bull.

811
01:15:25,032 --> 01:15:26,075
Han-seok.

812
01:15:27,326 --> 01:15:31,163
Someone like you
shouldn't have been born at all.

813
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:41,632
That hurts a lot.

814
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:45,177
I shouldn't have been born?

815
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:49,056
Isn't it harsh, Han-seo?

816
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:55,438
Kill me already.

817
01:15:56,772 --> 01:15:58,566
Don't be stupid and call Mr. Cassano.

818
01:15:58,649 --> 01:16:00,359
I can't do that.

819
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:03,529
That's the reason I abducted you.

820
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:09,368
Hey!

821
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:13,831
Don't use me to harm him. Just kill me!

822
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:25,092
INCOMING CALL
JANG HAN-SEOK

823
01:16:26,302 --> 01:16:28,054
ACCEPT

824
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:29,764
Where is Ms. Hong?

825
01:16:30,473 --> 01:16:32,141
Shouldn't you ask me how I am first?

826
01:16:32,892 --> 01:16:34,352
I just got out.

827
01:16:34,435 --> 01:16:35,603
I don't care.

828
01:16:36,729 --> 01:16:38,230
Where is Ms. Hong?

829
01:16:38,814 --> 01:16:40,358
Come to where I am now.

830
01:16:41,984 --> 01:16:43,277
She's alive.

831
01:16:45,529 --> 01:16:47,281
Please bear with me.

832
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:49,784
I heard from my fellow inmates

833
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:52,578
that this trick works the best

834
01:16:53,704 --> 01:16:56,082
when you need to lure
someone who owes you something.

835
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:59,251
If anything happens to her, I'll kill you.

836
01:16:59,335 --> 01:17:01,545
If you don't hurry,
something will happen to her.

837
01:17:54,682 --> 01:17:56,225
The bloody necklace…

838
01:17:57,518 --> 01:17:58,769
It was shocking, right?

839
01:17:59,854 --> 01:18:00,855
It was pig's blood.

840
01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:04,150
I tried your method.

841
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:05,693
You're worse than I thought.

842
01:18:08,821 --> 01:18:09,989
You abducted your brother

843
01:18:11,115 --> 01:18:13,409
and a woman too?

844
01:18:15,286 --> 01:18:18,038
A rat who's about to be devoured by a cat

845
01:18:18,122 --> 01:18:19,165
has no rules.

846
01:18:19,749 --> 01:18:21,208
Do you think you'll live

847
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:23,252
if you kill everyone here?

848
01:18:23,919 --> 01:18:25,087
Right.

849
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:27,673
The Mafia always has backup.

850
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:29,550
Think carefully.

851
01:18:31,177 --> 01:18:32,803
Whatever you do, you'll die.

852
01:18:32,887 --> 01:18:34,472
Even if I do,

853
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:36,932
I want to see you die first.

854
01:18:57,536 --> 01:18:58,704
Pick it up, Han-seo.

855
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,001
Pick it up!

856
01:19:17,264 --> 01:19:18,474
Chairman Jang.

857
01:19:19,475 --> 01:19:21,519
Beat him to death with it,

858
01:19:21,602 --> 01:19:22,520
and I'll spare you.

859
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,397
What?

860
01:19:27,858 --> 01:19:30,110
Not only will I spare your life,

861
01:19:30,194 --> 01:19:32,071
but I'll also give you all of Babel.

862
01:19:32,154 --> 01:19:33,572
You crazy asshole!

863
01:19:38,828 --> 01:19:41,080
You really are mad, aren't you?

864
01:19:56,053 --> 01:19:58,931
Cha-young, be quiet.

865
01:20:00,766 --> 01:20:03,102
If you keep talking,
I'm really going to kill you.

866
01:20:03,769 --> 01:20:05,145
Do it then.

867
01:20:06,522 --> 01:20:08,315
Stop this ridiculous joke.

868
01:20:50,316 --> 01:20:51,650
Do as he says.

869
01:20:55,988 --> 01:20:57,531
If I kill Vincenzo…

870
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:01,994
will you really let me live?

871
01:21:02,828 --> 01:21:03,829
Of course.

872
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:06,290
You're my brother, after all.

873
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:23,933
I'm sorry…

874
01:21:25,726 --> 01:21:27,227
Mr. Cassano.

875
01:21:28,395 --> 01:21:29,521
It's okay.

876
01:21:31,106 --> 01:21:33,067
You have no other choice.

877
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:38,364
Okay.

878
01:21:42,242 --> 01:21:44,203
I'll make a decision I won't regret.

879
01:22:20,155 --> 01:22:21,490
Please, stop!

880
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:45,175
