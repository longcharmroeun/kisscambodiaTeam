1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,785
Stop right there.

2
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,054
Mr. Cassano.

3
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,598
Are you guys okay?

4
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,391
Why didn't you go?

5
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,186
I took care of it in another way.

6
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,025
And I forgot to feed Inzaghi as well.

7
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,490
Anyway, stand back.

8
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,494
Do you happen to be Vincenzo Cassano?

9
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,912
That's none of your business.

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,333
I'll make you pay
in less than five minutes.

11
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,593
Go bring her to me.

12
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,161
Damn it!

13
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,280
Shit!

14
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,085
Oh, no. Stop it! Stop!

15
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,589
-Stop!
-Stop!

16
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,967
-Stop!
-Stop!

17
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,014
-Stop!
-Stop!

18
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,099
-Stop!
-Stop!

19
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,064
What the hell?

20
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,496

NOW, NUTRIA

30
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,814
I have underestimated you.

31
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,150
Mr. Cho, who is this guy?

32
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,903
He's candidate Park Seung-jun's
right-hand man.

33
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,113
I see.

34
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:49,617
Then Mr. Park is about to lose
his right hand today.

35
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,577
Let's talk.

36
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,456
-I have nothing to say to you.
-I can help you with that.

37
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,167
By the way, I'm really curious now.

38
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,212
Was there really gold here?

39
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,927
How dare he talk such bullshit?

40
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,347
What was he saying when he was hit?

41
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,516
I don't know. Did he say something?

42
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,726
-She came out of nowhere.
-That was fast.

43
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,019
My goodness.

44
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,147
She's the best. Way to go.

45
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,109
EPISODE 19

46
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,819
Everyone.

47
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,654
Are you all okay?

48
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,115
Of course. We're as good as new.

49
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,868
You guys sure can fight.

50
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,578
How have you been holding back?

51
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,746
We didn't have a good reason to fight.

52
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,082
And it usually bites us in the ass.

53
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,795
But we have a legitimate reason
to fight now.

54
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,008
And you are the ones who gave us
a legitimate reason to fight.

55
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,386
And you also got us together
as a community.

56
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,680
Let me say something fancy, too.

57
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,640
"If you walk alone, you reach quickly.

58
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,684
But if we go together, we can go far."

59
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,523
I wrote your name when I was asked
who my role model is at school.

60
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,318
-Good.
-That's great.

61
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,490
Thanks to you, I learned a thing
or two about the importance of power.

62
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,699
Thank you.

63
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,326
Merciful Buddha…

64
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,703
Hey, Nutria.

65
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,622
The only thing you could do was to bite.

66
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,082
Gosh, you know nothing.
That's an advanced skill.

67
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,585
I bite, chew, taste, and savor.
There's four levels.

68
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,047
Nutria, can you open this for me?

69
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,218
Don't do it!

70
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,096
-Did you see that?
-Are you okay?

71
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,806
-Blood. Is he bleeding?
-His tooth…

72
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,767
-His tooth…
-I think he chipped his tooth.

73
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,436
-Nutria.
-Nutria.

74
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,439
Mr. Cho.

75
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,818
You didn't answer my calls,
so I was worried.

76
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,239
I was ambushed.

77
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,157
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,743
By the way,

79
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,079
how did you secretly move the gold?

80
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,914
It must have attracted some attention.

81
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,092
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

82
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,470
I've wanted to ask you a question.

83
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,347
Go ahead.

84
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,779
Just what is…

85
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,907
under here?

86
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,663
I kept getting electing shocks
whenever I meditated here,

87
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,665
so I opened it.

88
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,985
Wait, sir. My finger!

89
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,822
One, two, three.

90
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:26,000
And we saw something
that looked like a door to a vault.

91
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,503
I couldn't stop shouting during meditation

92
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,964
because of the electricity.

93
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,426
Seeing how the light was on,

94
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,511
there must have been an electric leakage.

95
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,392
This is…

96
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,105
where the gold is stored…

97
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,733
isn't it?

98
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,906
Is the window open?

99
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,829
Right?

100
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,758
Yes.

101
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,817
Why didn't you tell the other tenants?

102
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,028
We didn't want there to be
a dispute over it.

103
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,865
So we waited for the owner.

104
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,200
I see.

105
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,666
Since you know now,

106
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,046
please help me.

107
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:34,044
But how do you open the vault?

108
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,256
Ms. Seo.

109
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,217
It's time now.

110
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,929
Let's open the vault tomorrow.

111
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,809
At last!

112
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,356
-By the way, Mr. Cassano,
-Yes?

113
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,650
I will open the vault for you, but…

114
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,322
You'll get a fair share of your cut.
You trust me, right?

115
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,703
What are you…

116
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,712
Of course. I will open it right away!

117
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,464
Okay.

118
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,090
-Got that?
-Got it.

119
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,176
Got it.

120
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,804
-It's tomorrow.
-Yes.

121
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,847
Nice!

122
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,224
-Great!
-Yes.

123
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,017
-It hurts?
-Where?

124
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,815
We're almost there.

125
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,316
One, two…

126
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,860
Mr. Nam, pull it harder.

127
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,971
Please move the gold
little by little every day.

128
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,933
NANYAK TEMPLE

129
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,151
Then where is the gold?

130
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,367
Someone might hear us from outside.
Let me whisper it to you.

131
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,077
Yes.

132
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,215
Then, is the Guillotine file
with the gold?

133
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,591
No.

134
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,304
I hid the Guillotine file
somewhere only I know about.

135
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,810
He didn't even tell me.

136
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,228
Obviously, he didn't--

137
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,396
I know.

138
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,650
Mr. Cho.

139
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,404
I will tell you when the time is right.

140
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,823
GEUMGA PLAZA

141
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,583
Did you come back because of me?

142
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,212
Your Italian family needs you, too.

143
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,965
I took care of it.

144
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,176
How did you take care of it that quickly?

145
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,095
You didn't even leave Korea.

146
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,598
Eighty million euros.

147
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,891
Pardon?

148
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,147
I promised to give them 80 million euros
for leaving my family alone.

149
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,983
By the way, 80 million euros is about…

150
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,237
a bit over 100 billion won.

151
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,911
Did they agree to that?

152
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,830
Yes. I sent over the contract.

153
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,042
My contract is credible
in the Mafia world.

154
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,801
Then I'm relieved.

155
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,598
Thank you.

156
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,100
And…

157
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,604
I'm so happy…

158
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,610
that you are back in one piece.

159
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,285
You look cool today just like that day.

160
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,456
The day we had the party.

161
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:11,215
You looked great in a Booralro suit
that I'd only heard about.

162
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,766
I was glad to meet…

163
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,815
someone who recognized
a Booralro suit that day.

164
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,261
What the…

165
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,179
Damn it.

166
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,249
I couldn't hug you earlier
because Mr. Cho was here.

167
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,167
Finally…

168
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,252
Mr. Cassano.

169
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,629
You've been hugging him
for over 20 seconds.

170
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,508
People say you barely notice newcomers,
but you notice people's absences.

171
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,597
Your absence left a hole
with a 30m diameter in my heart.

172
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,015
Okay.

173
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,852
Please stop hugging me now.
That hole has been filled in now.

174
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,691
Let him go, please.

175
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,277
-We should teach Park Seung-jun a lesson.
-Yes.

176
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,113
Right.

177
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,242
I don't care if he's running
for President. He needs a lesson.

178
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,994
You startled me.

179
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,248
Come on, my dear Guillotine file.

180
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,086
How many bribes did he take?

181
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,922
How corrupt is he?

182
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,390
CANDIDATE PARK SEUNG-JUN ACCUSED
OF BUYING LAND FOR SPECULATION

183
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,686
CANDIDATE PARK'S BROTHER-IN-LAW
COLLUDED AS THE HEAD OF IUDC

184
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,980
The article about Park Seung-jun is up.

185
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,399
What? I can't believe
he's running for president.

186
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,194
The whole family is corrupted.
Our country is doomed.

187
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,905
CANDIDATE PARK PROFITED OFF
LAND SPECULATION

188
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,825
I don't get it. What is wrong with you?

189
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,620
If only you got rid of Vincenzo
from the get-go…

190
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,249
With all due respect, sir,

191
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,793
I think you acted rashly.

192
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,128
What?

193
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,632
Did you tell Mr. Park
that you went after Vincenzo?

194
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,511
It's none of your business.

195
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,722
You should never underestimate him.

196
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,142
He has definite evidence to bring us down

197
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,395
but he's just spreading them as rumors.

198
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,772
He's toying with us.

199
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,568
It's likely he will use the evidence
during the Babel Tower trial.

200
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,155
All the videos of people
involved in the tower

201
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,950
as well as Mr. Park's involvement.

202
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,912
You two must be in that video too, right?

203
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,123
Then we'll all be arrested
if things go south.

204
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
-Yes.
-Mr. Kim.

205
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,837
There is a way to stop the trial.

206
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,758
But…

207
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,388
Mr. Park has to set something up for me.

208
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,141
Oh, right.

209
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,601
When will Mr. Jung get promoted?

210
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,771
He wants to take the promotion
after this case.

211
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,231
Just promote him.

212
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,442
He needs more authority
to make this go away.

213
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,485
Yes, sir.

214
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,529
Accept the promotion.

215
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,864
Yes, Mr. Kim.

216
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,702
Let me offer my congratulations
in advance, Mr. Jung.

217
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,713
Gosh.
Does he think he runs this place, too?

218
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,964
You little…

219
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,426
Why are you even here
if you're going to act that way?

220
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,482
Did I offend you in any way?

221
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,568
No, not at all.

222
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,403
Why are you in a bad mood then?

223
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,654
Just because.

224
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,866
I see.

225
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,496
People can just be in a bad mood.
That happens.

226
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,052
Hey, over there!

227
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,595
Move!

228
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,641
Out of the way!

229
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,187
Stop him!

230
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,022
-Stop him now!
-My ear!

231
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,322
He still has his ear.

232
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,825
Come here.

233
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,284
Come here, you asshole!

234
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,869
Let go of me!

235
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,758
Ms. Hong.

236
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,552
Have this.

237
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,638
It'll help relieve stress.

238
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,478
I need these when I'm working.

239
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,188
They wake me up.

240
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,318
Come on!

241
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,239
What's wrong?

242
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,160
This is from
the Seoul Namdongbu District Court.

243
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,619
You should read this.

244
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:23,170
"The court finds it highly likely
that the Babel Tower trial

245
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:28,466
could be used by the press
and the opposition

246
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:34,097
to smear the name
of a specific presidential candidate.

247
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,766
Therefore, after much discussion,

248
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,686
the court has reached a ruling
that the trial will be postponed

249
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,021
until the election is over."

250
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,151
It looks like Mr. Park

251
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,195
pulled some strings.

252
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,780
Unbelievable. Gosh. This is just…

253
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,702
I mean, how could they stoop so low?

254
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,080
Since it was them who stooped this low,

255
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,457
we should do the same.

256
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,500
How?

257
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,502
It looks like
the trial won't be happening.

258
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,464
We have a magic lamp.

259
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,884
The Guillotine file?

260
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,264
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

261
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,603
Everything from here.

262
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,397
-Namdongbu office.
-Namdongbu office.

263
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:25,857
Right there.

264
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,860
Gosh.

265
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,321
Damn it.

266
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,869
I just read this on the anonymous
chat room for lawyers.

267
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,916
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk was
the one who postponed the trial.

268
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,419
What's more annoying is
that he finally got promoted.

269
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,547
That darned traitor.

270
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,343
Let's give him a present
for the promotion then.

271
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,354
There we go.

272
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,610
You were right, Ms. Hong…

273
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,863
about how everyone here is
as crooked as the Mafia.

274
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,993
They group together
as government officials…

275
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,121
in finance, transport, taxes,
and even as alumni…

276
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,165
There are so many.

277
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,546
"It's okay to be corrupt
when you're competent."

278
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,881
This is what many of us believe.

279
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,803
But…

280
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,431
how can you be competent
when you're corrupt?

281
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,017
Competent in looking after oneself, maybe.

282
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,060
But never when looking after others.

283
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,228
I see.

284
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,525
That makes sense looking at it
from a villain's point of view.

285
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,577
When you leave
after everything goes as planned,

286
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,620
you won't be able to come back, right?

287
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,710
But, to me,

288
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:13,256
Vincenzo Cassano will not be
remembered just as a memory.

289
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,344
Ms. Hong

290
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:24,684
I never make promises
unless it's for business purposes.

291
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,356
But I promise you this.

292
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,401
I will come back.

293
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,839
"Further discussion
on the aforementioned trial was necessary,

294
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,467
and the court has reached a new decision.

295
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,804
The aforementioned trial is
unlikely to be abused

296
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,390
as a false propaganda
in the next presidential election,

297
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,894
and the suffering of the plaintiffs
from Babel Tower's development is greater.

298
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,856
Therefore, you are notified that the trial
will proceed as previously scheduled."

299
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,530
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,537
Mr. Jung.

301
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,623
You said you could handle it.
What is this?

302
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,212
They used the Guillotine file as leverage.

303
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,965
You should have seen that coming!

304
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,635
Since you saw it coming,
why don't you and Mr. Han handle this?

305
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,804
What did you say? Hey!

306
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,155
It's so cold. Gosh, it's freezing.

307
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,823
-It's so cold.
-Going home, sir?

308
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,616
Who are you?

309
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,577
It's Judge Heo.

310
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,037
Your Honor. Hey, man.

311
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,790
Listen. Ung-jin.

312
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,711
You are our last defender in this game.

313
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,296
Okay? You're the sweeper.

314
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,173
Yes.

315
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,050
So listen carefully. Focus!

316
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,053
Gosh. You startled. I almost punched you.

317
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,222
All right.

318
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:31,227
So whatever happens during the trial,
you must back us up at the end.

319
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,437
I got it, sir.

320
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,357
Get home safely, Mr. Chief Prosecutor.

321
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,735
Gosh. Don't be so formal with me.

322
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,738
-I'll get going.
-Wait, your car is here.

323
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,865
We have the same cars!

324
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,242
Gosh.

325
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't be like that. Don't do that.

326
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,166
Treat me like your friend.

327
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,585
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to sleep now.

328
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,711
Bye.

329
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,799
See you.

330
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,969
Bye.

331
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,609
Sweeper, my ass.

332
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,196
I know that he's just using me.

333
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,280
That jerk.

334
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,491
Open the door.

335
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,085
Let's go.

336
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,148
Hey.

337
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,193
Drive me home. Why did you stop here?

338
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,620
You…

339
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,957
You're Vincenzo Casanova.

340
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,754
Get out.

341
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,382
Get out of the car.

342
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,571
What do you want from me?

343
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,032
-I'll tell you a story.
-What story?

344
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,786
King Cambyses of Ancient Persia
punished corrupt judges severely.

345
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,873
He once skinned a corrupt judge alive.

346
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,166
Oh, my.

347
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,460
-Do you know what happened next?
-No.

348
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,589
The corrupt judge's son was also a judge.
When he presided over trials,

349
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,801
the king made the son sit
on his father's skin.

350
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,597
So he could come to his senses
and give a fair trial.

351
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,308
Why are you telling me that?

352
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,480
I'm saying

353
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,524
you could have ended up like that
if we were in those times.

354
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,609
Gosh.

355
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,820
You're presiding over
Chairman Jang's trial, right?

356
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,948
Yes.

357
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,453
Do what you always have done
so that he can get out early.

358
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:40,124
Even if I try to get him out
as soon as possible,

359
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,377
it will take two months at least.

360
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,837
Then don't extend his imprisonment.

361
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,798
If you refuse…

362
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,928
you'll be getting
more than a wasp this time.

363
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,436
Goodbye.

364
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,941
DAY OF THE TRIAL

365
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,609
The law is like a spiderweb.

366
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,611
It has limited durability.

367
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,072
Strong wasps will tear it apart
and fly away,

368
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,533
but weak flies end up dead
on the spiderweb.

369
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,869
But the flies in this plaza
joined forces together

370
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,206
and are biting off everything
whether it's a wasp or a spiderweb.

371
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,251
And you'll see the result yourself today.

372
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,836
Watch carefully

373
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,921
what happens to the wasps.

374
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,464
Let's do this!

375
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,883
Let's go.

376
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,510
One, two, three.

377
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,721
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

378
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,936
Where's the file I've prepared?

379
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,980
Where is the file?

380
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,857
I told you ten times already!

381
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,901
I told you 1,000 times!

382
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,445
This way, sir.

383
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,836
Sit down.

384
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,254
We're in the sacred court.

385
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,218
All right.

386
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,098
All rise for the honorable Judge.

387
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,351
PLAINTIFF

388
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,394
DEFENDANT

389
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,187
Please be seated.

390
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,368
CHIEF PROSECUTOR HAN SEUNG-HYUK

391
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,709
We will now begin

392
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:33,673
the trial for case number 2021-30184,

393
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:38,094
Babel Group
versus the tenants of Geumga Plaza,

394
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:42,932
to settle the compensation
for damages caused

395
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,102
by Babel Group's illegal activities.

396
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,773
We will begin by
questioning the plaintiff's witness.

397
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,986
Plaintiff's counsel,
you may question your witness.

398
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,906
Our witness is Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.
Please come forward.

399
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,705
Your tie.

400
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,208
Fix your hair.

401
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,961
Good luck!

402
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,983
WITNESS BOX

403
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,988
I solemnly swear…

404
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,827
-Your Honor.
-Yes?

405
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,497
My honorable judge.

406
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,082
Yes?

407
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,834
My testimony will be

408
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,130
about why Babel Group committed
the illegal activities.

409
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,509
And I will testify with video evidence.

410
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,677
Your Honor.

411
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,472
His video evidence has nothing
to do with this trial.

412
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,226
We might find something important in it.

413
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,730
So I will decide whether it's relevant
or not after watching it.

414
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,648
Sit down.

415
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,077
Play the video.

416
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,455
Gosh.

417
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,957
-What's that?
-Goodness.

418
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,793
-Oh, my.
-What's he holding?

419
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,336
-A gold toad?
-No way!

420
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,673
-Come on.
-Is that really gold?

421
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,633
-That's gold.
-Look at that.

422
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,385
A gold toad?

423
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,144
DEFENDANT

424
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,956
What's with the blur?

425
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,672
Why are only our faces blurred?

426
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,590
Why…

427
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,948
Quiet down.

428
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,285
Please quiet down!

429
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,097
Stay away.

430
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,558
Don't…

431
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,860
Good to see you again, friend.

432
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,157
I warned you, didn't I?

433
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,117
To do whatever you like.

434
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,913
That I'll come back for you
when you have everything you want.

435
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,051
Did you?

436
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,179
I don't seem to recall.

437
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,724
But you got your promotion
and tried to stop the hearing.

438
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,644
Congratulations.

439
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,313
You've ignored my warning
and chose to die.

440
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,025
Right.

441
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,027
You can't kill a prosecutor
in the court of law.

442
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,695
Don't push yourself.

443
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,909
Show me how humble you can be
in the next two days and I'll spare you.

444
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,578
I'm being generous.

445
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,996
You Mafia prick.

446
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,999
You can't toy with a prosecutor like this.

447
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,514
I'm not toying with you.

448
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,309
I'm giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

449
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,632
Gosh. This doesn't feel right.

450
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,223
Why on earth did they blur only our faces?

451
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,101
Why do you think? He wants to kill us.

452
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,897
It'll be hard to do that
if we're in prison.

453
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,732
I know. I know that, too.

454
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,612
By the way,

455
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,907
all of us are about to get killed.
Why do you look so calm?

456
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,786
What do you suggest I do, then?
Should I go somewhere and weep?

457
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,124
We need to figure out a way
to get out of this.

458
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,671
Why don't you find your own way out,
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?

459
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,048
What?

460
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,884
This is our farewell drink.

461
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,351
This is the perfect place.
You recruited me here.

462
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,478
Why would you say something like that?

463
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,855
Come on.

464
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,443
We need to close ranks even more
at times like this.

465
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,947
Close ranks, my ass.

466
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,159
You coaxed Jang Han-seo
to save your own ass

467
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,330
and even begged Park Seung-jun
for you to become the chief prosecutor.

468
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,541
I should rip your mouth to pieces.

469
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,086
You're hurting my feelings!

470
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,715
Think about it.
Who helped you live in luxury like this?

471
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,511
Look at your face. It's glowing!
I bet you forgot how you started. Gosh.

472
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,681
Thank you so much, you slithering snake.

473
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,682
Snake?

474
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:44,520
If you get in the way of Chairman Jang
and me to save your own skin,

475
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,357
I will kill you myself. Got that?

476
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,493
I enjoyed the drink.

477
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,207
Fine. We should part our ways now.

478
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,293
Go. Leave, Myung-hee!

479
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,755
Don't you come back to me and beg!

480
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,008
I'm the chief prosecutor!

481
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,053
The Babel Tower scandal has come
as a huge shock to the public.

482
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,265
The illegal activities and corruption
in the prosecution, the police,

483
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,934
the National Assembly, the media,
and local organizations

484
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,604
have appalled the public.

485
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,733
Moreover, the constant assaults on
and attempted murder of the tenants

486
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,986
of Geumga Plaza in the process
of illegally acquiring the land

487
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,614
for the Babel Tower
have angered the public.

488
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,116
Babel Group's ownership of Geumga Plaza

489
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,077
will be nullified
due to corruption and illegal activities

490
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,788
committed when acquiring
the permit for the construction.

491
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,395
Yes. Stop the production of RDU-90.

492
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,272
Yes. Cancel the order of raw materials.

493
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,776
No. It's okay.
It's fine, just do as I say.

494
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,362
Okay. Good day.

495
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,324
Sorry.
I have a lot of urgent matters to handle.

496
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,536
You…

497
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,998
really look like a real chairman now.

498
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,292
I'm so proud of you.

499
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,461
Why would you be? You're not my mom.

500
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,177
Oh, right.
What did you want to talk about?

501
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,929
Oh, right.

502
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:48,894
You watched the video at the trial
yesterday, right?

503
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,521
Only our faces were blurred.

504
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,150
He did it so he could kill us.

505
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,695
So you and I should join hands again--

506
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,281
No. I'll join hands with Vincenzo.

507
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,324
Pardon?

508
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,619
Vincenzo's in a different league

509
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,830
from you.

510
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,958
I'll team up with a pro.

511
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,210
But still,
you can't just toss me out like this.

512
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,170
Don't forget who introduced you to him.

513
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,297
It was me!

514
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,842
-Oh, right.
-Yes.

515
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,177
You're right.

516
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,180
-Sorry. I forgot about that.
-Exactly.

517
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,766
-Thank you so much. I mean it.
-I understand.

518
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,893
It's okay.

519
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,813
But you're on your own now.

520
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,399
What do you mean?

521
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,900
-Mr. Chief Prosecutor…
-Let me join you.

522
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,487
-you're on your own now.
-Sir.

523
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,407
Sir?

524
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,078
Mr. Han is leaving now.
Get his car now. He's in a hurry.

525
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,956
No, I'm not. Can I join you?

526
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,677
Inmate 6723. Visitor.

527
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,122
What is it? Are you here to gloat?

528
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,540
That you won?

529
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,297
If you just hear the news,

530
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,342
you might not actually feel it.

531
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,983
Sorry I broke into your place.

532
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,967
But what a relief.
It wasn't the real tower.

533
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,472
Now that Babel Tower
has been brought down,

534
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,267
you must know what's next.

535
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,947
I'm a hungry cat now.

536
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,326
Fine. See if you can eat me.

537
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,245
Try to eat me whole.

538
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,458
I will when you get out.
Right after my celebration.

539
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,335
When I get out of here,

540
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,296
it won't be as Chairman Jang Han-seok.

541
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,424
Is that so?

542
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,594
I will be the Jang Han-seok
that I was in my childhood.

543
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,264
A monster that had no inhibitions.

544
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,937
You won't be going up against
the chairman of Babel.

545
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,692
You'll be up against just plain old me.

546
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,113
That'll be interesting.

547
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,367
You know my past very well.

548
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,663
What I did to my friends when I was young.

549
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,543
I think your watch…

550
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,130
will end up in my walk-in closet.

551
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,470
Suit yourself.

552
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,642
I have a knack
for straightening up delinquent kids.

553
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,238
Mr. Jung.

554
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,450
I have an urgent favor to ask you.

555
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,830
Let me…

556
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,042
stay in prison just for three months.

557
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,669
Pardon?

558
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,005
I'm sure you know why I'm asking you this.

559
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,674
Vincenzo…

560
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,884
Listen.

561
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,887
Just come up with a charge
and lock me up just for three months.

562
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,849
And get me out if Vincenzo dies
during those three months.

563
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,643
But still. I cannot--

564
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,812
Gosh. Just do it. Do it for me.

565
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,566
If you do it for me, I will give you
all the privileged information

566
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,526
on Wusang's clients
including Jang Han-seok.

567
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,779
It'll be as good as
having the Guillotine file.

568
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:37,284
With that information,
you will climb up the ladder smoothly.

569
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,956
Come on. Just do it.

570
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,718
You think this is pizza?

571
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,303
Yes, Korean-style pizza.

572
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,974
Vincenzo.

573
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,562
Are you really going to leave Korea
once everything is over?

574
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,147
Yes.

575
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,193
Can't you just stay here?

576
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,738
I can hire you as a legal advisor
for Babel Group.

577
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,240
-You'll be a director.
-I'm good.

578
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:25,499
Then don't leave without saying goodbye.
Okay?

579
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,501
That's what the Mafia does in the movies.

580
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,754
Some Mafia members have
week-long farewell parties.

581
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,508
Seriously.
Your party has to last a week, too. Okay?

582
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,763
Have you heard from Jang Han-seok?

583
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,723
No. He's been quiet.

584
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,977
He'll get what he deserves
if we provide all the evidence, right?

585
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,480
We don't know that yet.

586
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,943
Then could he be released
after two months?

587
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,405
Listen.

588
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,951
Go abroad for now, just for a few months.

589
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,286
Okay?

590
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,000
Once he gets out…

591
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,711
you'll be his first target.

592
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,547
I'll recommend a few safe places.

593
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,010
I'm good.

594
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,847
When I started this…

595
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,267
I knew I'd have to risk my life
at some point.

596
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,353
Besides, I made a promise to you.

597
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,357
You can keep your promise later.
I want you to reconsider.

598
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,740
No. I'll fight.

599
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,786
I have 20 bodyguards.
It won't be that easy to get to me.

600
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,168
And more importantly…

601
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,089
I have you.

602
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,425
You know everything,

603
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,470
keep me safe,
and beat up all the bad guys.

604
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,848
That's you. Goodness.

605
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,517
Why are you so cool?

606
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,396
Hey, that's soy sauce. Don't drink it.

607
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,564
That's salty.

608
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,984
You should have told me sooner.

609
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:26,369
What should I do to get Mr. Jang out?

610
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,957
What should I do?

611
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,773
Mr. Cassano,
once Jang Han-seok is released,

612
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,483
we'll do as planned, right?

613
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,154
Ms. Hong.

614
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,616
You really don't have to join me

615
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,995
to finish off Jang Han-seok.

616
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,583
So far, we've been like vigilantes.
But after this,

617
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,378
we'll be monsters.

618
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,797
And I want to protect

619
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,299
your virtue.

620
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,723
To be honest, everything we did

621
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,020
was so cruel
that it was hard for me to endure.

622
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,734
But do you know why I supported you?

623
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,991
There's no law that can punish
a monster like Jang Han-seok.

624
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,035
And there are no other options.

625
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,165
That's why I supported your method,
the lesser evil.

626
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,294
I thought that was the right thing to do.

627
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:10,682
NAM JU-SUNG

628
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,809
EVERYONE IN THE VIDEO WE PROVIDED
WAS RELEASED

629
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,311
Unbelievable.

630
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,647
What is it?

631
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,317
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk released everyone.

632
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,113
Everyone in the video
that was taken at Jang Han-seok's house.

633
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,538
That means he turned down
my last act of generosity.

634
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,217
How could you ask for help

635
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,678
after screwing this up
in every possible way?

636
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,639
We can put an end to everything
for good this time.

637
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,267
Including Vincenzo
and the Guillotine file.

638
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,437
Forget it.

639
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,606
We'll take care of Vincenzo

640
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,901
and the Guillotine file ourselves.

641
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:06,154
I don't think that's a good idea.

642
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,741
Mr. Park is in the middle of his campaign.

643
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,953
What if your attempt to get rid of him
goes south and affects the campaign?

644
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,248
That will be another scandal.

645
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,714
For Mr. Park's safety,

646
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,967
let me take care of this problem.

647
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,554
So how will you do that?

648
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,778
Please do whatever it takes
to get Mr. Jang out of prison.

649
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:50,532
He's the biggest problem right now.

650
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,992
Getting him out is next to impossible.

651
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,161
Mr. Kim.

652
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,085
-Give me that.
-How does it look?

653
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,255
-Did you get it?
-This one.

654
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,593
I already fabricated evidence

655
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,054
that I'd incited, threatened,
and pressured Babel

656
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,849
for my own benefit
since when I was working as a prosecutor.

657
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:19,561
No judge or prosecutor
will be able to tear down my claim.

658
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,771
With my evidence,

659
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:27,152
it'll look like
Mr. Jang was no more than my puppet.

660
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,664
Are you saying that you'll…

661
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,291
Yes.

662
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,047
I'll take the fall for everything
and go to prison.

663
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,887
Mr. Jang is the only one
who can put an end

664
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,639
to Mr. Park's Babel Tower scandal

665
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,642
and bring down Vincenzo.

666
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,896
Mr. Jung!

667
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:07,775
Many congratulations on your promotion!

668
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,653
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

669
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,072
-Mr. Jung!
-Yes!

670
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,412
We are the prosecutors of this country.

671
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,291
Do not cave in or lose,

672
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,085
especially to those rich assholes.

673
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:30,340
If they challenge our authority,
stomp them out.

674
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,300
Got it?

675
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,259
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

676
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,636
Raise your glasses.

677
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,641
Cheers to Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office!

678
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,809
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

679
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,102
Go, Namdongbu!

680
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,646
-Congrats.
-Drink!

681
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,315
Congratulations, Mr. Jung!

682
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:50,610
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

683
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,097
You…

684
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,140
Vincenzo.

685
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,728
Hey!

686
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,479
You bastard…

687
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,025
It's rare for me to be so generous,
but you won't accept.

688
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,776
Shut up, you Mafia prick.

689
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,739
You sure talk big for a lowlife criminal.

690
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:20,491
I may be a criminal,
but I'm aware of the things I did.

691
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,201
Why aren't you?

692
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,287
I haven't done anything wrong.

693
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:28,291
I live by the law and its principles.

694
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,334
All right.

695
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,879
Since you won't acknowledge what
you've done, I'll free you from your sins.

696
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:44,015
That which has no life has no sin.

697
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,574
-Hey, isn't that a person?
-What?

698
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,243
What the…

699
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,737
I finished one.

700
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:45,368
And I must take care of the rest
one by one.

701
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,791
For me…

702
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,461
and for Ms. Hong.

703
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,727
The fabricated evidence is ironclad.

704
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,229
You didn't have to go that far.

705
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,897
It's all right.

706
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,692
I'll humiliate myself once

707
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,403
and go down for all the charges
to make it all go away.

708
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,907
Once you get out, recuperate,

709
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,409
and get me out later.

710
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,458
When you get out,
you will be the vice chairwoman…

711
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,461
of the Babel Group.

712
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,673
Thank you.

713
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,554
You told me to keep an eye
on Mr. Jang Han-seo.

714
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,391
He's definitely with Vincenzo now.

715
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,062
He makes it so obvious.

716
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,446
Did you hear that
Mr. Jung committed suicide?

717
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,447
Yes.

718
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,159
He should've at least
let him enjoy his party.

719
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,286
He's so cruel.

720
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,790
Vincenzo is…

721
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,584
making his moves now.

722
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,588
I'll do as you say on one condition.

723
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,967
I want to be released quickly

724
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,845
without anyone knowing.

725
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,140
Don't let anyone know.

726
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,477
It'll be just me.

727
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,532
One, two. One, two, three, four.

728
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,826
One, two. One, two, three, four.

729
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,743
That's it.

730
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,623
Ms. Choi.

731
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,917
We're from Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

732
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,712
You're under arrest for instigating
and abetting tax evasion and murder.

733
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:02,964
Is that true?

734
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,799
Give me two minutes.

735
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,592
Just two minutes.

736
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,012
You don't have to read me
the Miranda rights.

737
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,308
Choi Myung-hee was arrested?

738
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,479
Yes. And the charges against her
are just huge.

739
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,190
Her subordinate must have reported her.

740
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,109
Then, I'm sure it was Mr. Yoon.

741
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,195
I mean, she must've made
his life a living hell.

742
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:31,325
That happens
when you fail to protect your family.

743
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,359
SEOUL NAMDONGBU DETENTION CENTER

744
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,820
Are you going somewhere?

745
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:33,322
A judicial training reunion.
Why do you ask?

746
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,242
I see. I thought
you were going to ask me out.

747
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,244
Gosh. You were totally off.

748
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:42,248
But why? You said you weren't
on good terms with them.

749
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,666
I'm not going there for fun.

750
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,960
I need to check
if they're badmouthing me or not.

751
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,795
I see. When will it be over?

752
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:48,963
I'll have to see.

753
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,967
By the way, if you're going home,
you should go up that way.

754
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,511
I'm going somewhere, too.

755
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:56,429
As if.

756
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,806
I'm leaving. Don't skip your meal.

757
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,183
-When will it be over?
-No idea!

758
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,269
-Are you going to drink?
-A lot!

759
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,396
-Should I pick you up later?
-No.

760
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:06,689
Is that for women only?

761
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,816
There are men, too.

762
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:17,825
Hello, sir.

763
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,910
Yes, our merciful Buddha.

764
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,038
Did you eat?

765
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,373
I see. You're fasting.

766
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,084
No. I'm sorry. Bye.

767
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,419
Okay, bye.

768
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,361
Hey, Mi-gyeong.

769
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,862
I'm in the parking lot.

770
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,365
Yes. Hye-won and Hye-ju are there, right?

771
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,159
Yes. Okay. I'll be there in a bit.

772
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,945
Mr. Kim? I thought you went home.

773
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:21,907
Mr. Kim?

774
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,614
I came out quietly
to surprise you, brother.

775
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,662
What's the point of hiring bodyguards?

776
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:11,165
When I offered money,
they all took it and left.

777
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,377
CEO JANG HAN-SEO

778
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,882
You incompetent traitor.

779
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,551
I didn't betray you.

780
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,514
I was trying to run the company properly.

781
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,150
I brought your gun.

782
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,783
I couldn't get one at such short notice.

783
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,164
Okay.

784
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,668
I see.

785
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,545
Now I really can't keep you alive.

786
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,176
I'm sure you understand that.

787
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,687
Yes.

788
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,775
I was bound to suffer
the same fate as Father.

789
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,280
I will accept it.

790
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,258
HONG CHA-YOUNG

791
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:50,472
The person you have reached
cannot come to the phone right now.

792
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,099
Please leave a message…

793
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,636
Han-seo.

794
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,102
Han-seo.

795
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:48,942
Are you okay?

796
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,146
I didn't think you would abduct me,
but you did.

797
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,983
This makes you such a cheap villain.

798
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,402
What's the difference?

799
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,656
All villains are the same.

800
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,574
No matter how hard I think about it,

801
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,244
you are not a human being.

802
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,836
Don't you know how much I love you?

803
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,173
That makes me human.

804
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,467
Abducting a woman you love

805
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,804
is not love, but a crime,
you crazy asshole.

806
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:00,556
Sorry, Cha-young.

807
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:06,645
But to me, my principle comes before love.

808
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,230
Your principle?

809
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,066
Killing everyone you don't like?

810
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:16,321
What a load of bull.

811
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,075
Han-seok.

812
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:25,163
Someone like you
shouldn't have been born at all.

813
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:35,632
That hurts a lot.

814
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,177
I shouldn't have been born?

815
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:43,056
Isn't it harsh, Han-seo?

816
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:49,438
Kill me already.

817
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,566
Don't be stupid and call Mr. Cassano.

818
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,359
I can't do that.

819
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,529
That's the reason I abducted you.

820
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,368
Hey!

821
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,831
Don't use me to harm him. Just kill me!

822
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,092
INCOMING CALL
JANG HAN-SEOK

823
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,054
ACCEPT

824
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,764
Where is Ms. Hong?

825
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,141
Shouldn't you ask me how I am first?

826
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,352
I just got out.

827
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,603
I don't care.

828
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,230
Where is Ms. Hong?

829
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,358
Come to where I am now.

830
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,277
She's alive.

831
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:41,281
Please bear with me.

832
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,784
I heard from my fellow inmates

833
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,578
that this trick works the best

834
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:50,082
when you need to lure
someone who owes you something.

835
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,251
If anything happens to her, I'll kill you.

836
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,545
If you don't hurry,
something will happen to her.

837
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,225
The bloody necklace…

838
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:52,769
It was shocking, right?

839
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:54,855
It was pig's blood.

840
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,150
I tried your method.

841
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,693
You're worse than I thought.

842
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:03,989
You abducted your brother

843
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:07,409
and a woman too?

844
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:12,038
A rat who's about to be devoured by a cat

845
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,165
has no rules.

846
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,208
Do you think you'll live

847
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,252
if you kill everyone here?

848
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,087
Right.

849
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,673
The Mafia always has backup.

850
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,550
Think carefully.

851
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,803
Whatever you do, you'll die.

852
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,472
Even if I do,

853
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,932
I want to see you die first.

854
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:52,704
Pick it up, Han-seo.

855
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,001
Pick it up!

856
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,474
Chairman Jang.

857
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,519
Beat him to death with it,

858
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:16,520
and I'll spare you.

859
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,397
What?

860
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:24,110
Not only will I spare your life,

861
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,071
but I'll also give you all of Babel.

862
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,572
You crazy asshole!

863
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,080
You really are mad, aren't you?

864
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,931
Cha-young, be quiet.

865
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:57,102
If you keep talking,
I'm really going to kill you.

866
01:20:57,769 --> 01:20:59,145
Do it then.

867
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,315
Stop this ridiculous joke.

868
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,650
Do as he says.

869
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,531
If I kill Vincenzo…

870
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,994
will you really let me live?

871
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:57,829
Of course.

872
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,290
You're my brother, after all.

873
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,933
I'm sorry…

874
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,227
Mr. Cassano.

875
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:23,521
It's okay.

876
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:27,067
You have no other choice.

877
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:32,364
Okay.

878
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:38,203
I'll make a decision I won't regret.

879
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,490
Please, stop!

880
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:39,175
