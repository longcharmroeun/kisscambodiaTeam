1
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:40,670
I was scared to death.

2
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,090
Why didn't you answer your phone?

3
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,884
That's what technology is for.

4
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,679
I didn't want to put you in danger. Sorry.

5
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:51,431
And what if I am?

6
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:55,936
We're partners,
so we should share the danger.

7
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:59,231
-You really piss me off.
-Ms. Hong.

8
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:01,608
The real boss behind Babel.

9
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,444
I know who it is.

10
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:07,364
Really?

11
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:08,323
Yes.

12
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:28,260
Who is the real boss?

13
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:31,763
Who is this chairman?

14
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:32,931
I don't know.

15
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,478
Jang Han-seok!

16
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:40,272
Jang Han-seok.

17
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,944
But we thought he was living
a quiet life in the States.

18
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:47,404
No.

19
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,323
He was behind this the whole time.

20
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,451
CHAIRMAN

21
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:57,414
Let's call him.

22
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:15,557
Cha-young, over here!

23
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:45,337
Aren't you getting a call?

24
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,756
What? A call?

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,637
No. I'm not getting any calls.

26
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:58,850
I should report this to the police.

27
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:04,189
Mr. Cassano told us
never to report this to the police.

28
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,400
Mr. Cassano will take care of it.

29
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,069
Put it back in.

30
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:12,948
Okay.

31
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:16,618
There's no answer.

32
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:19,871
That's odd. He would answer
if he wanted to know what happened.

33
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:20,997
Right.

34
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:01,705
Who are they?

35
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:05,834
They are Mr. Cassano's shadows.

36
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,838
Take these three to the warehouse.
I'll be there soon.

37
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,047
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

38
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:16,761
Why didn't you bring them with you?

39
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:20,181
I told them to keep an eye on you
just in case.

40
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:30,150
Thanks, Joon-woo. You should go home.

41
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,360
No. I want to stay with you.

42
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:33,737
Just go!

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,239
Mr. Jang.

44
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,118
Today was an exception,

45
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,746
but you shouldn't come next time.

46
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:51,338
Okay. I won't.

47
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,223
Why does he look so pitiful?

48
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:22,327
Can you two help clean…

49
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,210
Your car door was open,
so we just took these out.

50
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,170
We'll clean up here.

51
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:34,380
So it'll look like nothing happened here.

52
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,677
You cannot tell the other tenants
what happened.

53
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:40,929
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

54
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,807
Ms. Hong and I will take the killers' car.

55
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,725
You two can take my car.

56
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:49,020
-Okay.
-And pick up the empty shells, too.

57
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,108
Don't worry.

58
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,445
When it comes to picking up empty shells,
Korean men are the best.

59
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,114
Salute!

60
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:14,671
He almost got me!

61
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,508
How did he beat the three of them
all at once?

62
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:33,356
EPISODE 11

63
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:38,278
Damn it.

64
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:40,155
What is this?

65
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:43,783
This is just like the movies.

66
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,786
Will this actually kill them?

67
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,329
I've never done this before.

68
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:51,499
But they might die sooner than I thought.

69
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:02,719
Okay. Pay attention.

70
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,679
We have some bookkeeping to do.

71
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,808
First, you were the ones
who set the villa on fire

72
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:11,311
and killed the researchers, right?

73
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:32,040
Yes! It was us!

74
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:33,333
Yes, we did it!

75
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,506
Next.

76
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:45,178
You also killed Director Gil and
investigators from the prosecution, right?

77
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,095
Damn it.

78
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:00,151
-Yes!
-We did it! We killed them.

79
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:01,528
-Stop it!
-Stop!

80
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,654
Stop!

81
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:08,660
Here's the most important question.

82
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,497
The four people who committed suicide.

83
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:15,708
You set it up, didn't you?

84
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,134
-Yes. It was us.
-Yes.

85
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,554
We did that, too.

86
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,723
Stop it. Please stop it!

87
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:32,600
-Please!
-Please!

88
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,024
-Stop it!
-Please!

89
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,485
-Don't!
-Stop!

90
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,825
Do you finally understand

91
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:53,288
the pain they felt
as they lay dying in the car?

92
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:56,165
We only did what we were told to!

93
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,668
We were following Jang Han-seok's orders!

94
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:19,063
Where is…

95
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:21,274
Jang Han-seok?

96
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:23,651
The only thing I know
is that he's in Korea.

97
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,737
We've never seen his face!

98
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,114
-Are you sure he's in Korea?
-Yes!

99
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,907
He gives us orders through the phone.

100
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:33,411
And when he calls us,
he uses a voice changer.

101
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:34,412
Yes, sir.

102
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:36,456
Don't come to the plaza.
Go to the underpass

103
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:38,833
-where you abducted them.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,002
Stop lying.

105
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,171
I'm sure you know where he is.

106
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:44,714
We're telling the truth.

107
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:46,883
We really don't know where he is!

108
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:50,720
This is all they know.

109
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,981
I guess they're useless now.

110
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,526
Should we get rid of them?

111
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,028
-Don't kill us.
-Spare us.

112
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:08,446
Don't kill us.

113
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:13,868
You bastards deserve to die
over and over again.

114
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,161
People usually

115
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:18,706
don't reflect on their past actions
when they avert a crisis.

116
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,504
Especially people like you
don't have a sense of guilt to repent.

117
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:26,214
Just hand us over to the police!

118
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:28,174
We'll face the punishment of the law!

119
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:31,344
The punishment of the law?

120
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,348
And who will that benefit?

121
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,183
Let's go.

122
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:47,318
-Don't kill us!
-Let us out!

123
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:54,492
Let us out!

124
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,666
Yes, Mr. Cho.

125
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,839
Yes. Locate the cell phone
of the number I sent you.

126
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:11,717
Okay.

127
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:18,224
I know that they are helping us,

128
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,476
but I get mad whenever I see them.

129
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,855
Those two, you mean?

130
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,898
Whenever I see them,

131
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,402
I'm reminded of my father's incident.

132
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,447
I can understand that.

133
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,241
They killed your father,
but you can't do anything.

134
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,871
You remember what I told you
when we caught them, right?

135
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:41,747
When you're in a war,

136
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:45,001
it's the most effective to use
your enemy's hunting dogs.

137
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:49,046
We're using them
because I accepted what you told me.

138
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,257
Once they become useless to us,

139
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:55,595
I'll help you throw them
into the tiger's cage. Just wait.

140
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,477
Where did you learn to fight like that?

141
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,688
I had martial arts training as a kid.

142
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,232
My teacher was a former GIS member.

143
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:10,443
"GIS"?

144
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:12,987
-Italian special forces.
-I see.

145
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,741
That explains why you looked cool
when fighting.

146
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:21,954
I trained my ass off.

147
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,749
It was the only way

148
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:28,419
for a weak Asian kid to protect himself
among bigger racist Caucasians.

149
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,005
I had to fight.

150
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,262
What will you do with those three killers?

151
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:42,892
I'll show them mercy
since I don't want to make use of them.

152
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:01,869
Today, I'll show mercy

153
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,499
by letting them face
a less painful punishment

154
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,086
than they deserve.

155
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,674
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

156
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,967
-Drink it up.
-All right.

157
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,553
-Cheers.
-I will.

158
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:21,013
-Bottoms up.
-Is it true?

159
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:23,975
Mr. Tak beat those thugs
with a pair of scissors?

160
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,060
-Watch.
-Okay.

161
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,229
He used his scissors like this.

162
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,151
From the first moment I saw him

163
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:37,321
I could sense that he had this
special energy within him.

164
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:38,364
Gosh, I'm hot.

165
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,241
Were you in some kind of organization?

166
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:42,702
-Gosh, no. What organization?
-Were you?

167
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:45,496
It's just that in my hometown, Chungju,

168
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,875
-people called me Lightning Scissors.
-Gosh.

169
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,002
You're fast as lightning,
hence the nickname.

170
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:55,590
There's a monk we call "Lightning Moktak"
for hitting the moktak fast.

171
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,760
Gosh, you should consider
yourselves lucky.

172
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,971
Do you know how scary those thugs are?

173
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:03,973
When did you get here?

174
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:07,393
You should be careful around people
with the Gurkha knife tattoos.

175
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,854
They go around the redevelopment sites

176
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:12,231
And anyone that doesn't listen to them

177
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,567
ends up dead.

178
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,486
They come to your house at night
and beat you to death.

179
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,363
Gosh. Anyway,

180
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:22,783
I wonder when Mr. Martial Arts over there
will show us his skills.

181
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,702
What a series of disappointments.

182
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:30,041
Well, I guess Mr. Lee does lack
this critical blow to end the fight.

183
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,460
That's right.

184
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:36,172
He can beat neighborhood thugs,
but he's not that good.

185
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:41,135
Anyway, when it comes to fighting,

186
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:45,222
Mr. Tak is ranked number one
in the plaza now.

187
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:47,058
And Mr. Cassano is the second best.

188
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:48,768
No, I don't agree.

189
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:52,855
I think Mr. Cassano's moves
are graceful like Donnie Yen.

190
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,899
It's embarrassing to say this,

191
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:59,362
but Vincenzo Cassano's movements
are sloppy like Stephen Chow's.

192
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,823
That's not true.
They aren't sloppy at all.

193
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:05,284
Mr. Cassano is like a bat out of hell.

194
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:15,836
How odd.

195
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,882
Just a few hours ago,
I did something I'd never imagined,

196
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,926
but it seems I can drink just fine.

197
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,804
Ms. Hong, you belong in the Mafia.

198
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:27,598
Let's drink until 2 a.m.
and call it a night.

199
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:29,892
You said it. Just until 2 a.m.

200
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,107
Hey, it's 3 a.m.!

201
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,071
Should we wrap it up?

202
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,035
Let's drink until 4 a.m.

203
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,579
We have a lot of food left.

204
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,581
Right.

205
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,211
We can't throw these away, right?

206
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,695
You know makgeolli…

207
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:25,823
is like a black hole.

208
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,743
Once you start drinking,
you end up in a black hole.

209
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:35,916
You know…

210
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:43,299
I'm sorry about what I did
at the underpass.

211
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:47,720
I hugged you, remember?

212
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,097
You were flustered, right?

213
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:55,102
Don't apologize.

214
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,980
You were worried.

215
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:00,858
But…

216
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:05,988
after hugging you…

217
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:09,200
something got iffy.

218
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,662
My heart went like…

219
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,834
It went like this.

220
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:20,795
I couldn't tell…

221
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:25,299
if my heart pounded like that

222
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:30,513
because you were in danger
or because I had feelings for you.

223
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:40,439
I need to test this out.

224
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,446
Gosh, be careful.

225
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,616
I'm not that drunk.

226
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,458
Get up.

227
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:00,376
What?

228
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,003
-Get up.
-Why?

229
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:04,964
Okay.

230
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:14,265
I'm going to hug you for ten seconds.

231
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:16,851
Let's say I'm testing to see
if I have feelings for you.

232
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:20,271
Don't move.

233
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,190
Okay. I won't move.

234
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:25,317
Stay still.

235
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,443
Okay.

236
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:41,477
I was wrong.

237
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,856
It was because you were in danger earlier.

238
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:55,783
I'm so thirsty now.

239
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:05,668
Mr. Cassano, we have a lot of makgeolli
in the warehouse.

240
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,212
I would appreciate it if you brought them.

241
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,536
You're here.

242
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:43,914
Have you been well?

243
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,458
Yes. I've been well.

244
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:50,254
You seem tired.

245
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:52,464
I had a lot of work.

246
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:54,717
You should take it easy.

247
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:59,054
You don't want your handsome face
to get haggard.

248
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,480
You're eating your meals
and taking your medicine, right?

249
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:10,107
Of course.

250
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:13,527
Otherwise, you'd scold me again.

251
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,826
Your doctor told me the other day…

252
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:25,456
that you beat lung cancer 28 years ago.

253
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,375
Yes.

254
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:33,839
It seems the only thing I have
in this world isn't that healthy.

255
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:37,593
Did you not have any family…

256
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,054
back then?

257
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:45,309
I did. I had a son.

258
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:53,192
But my days were numbered,

259
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,652
so I had to send him away.

260
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:57,905
To where?

261
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,117
Very far away.

262
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:09,416
To a place where my son
would grow up happily.

263
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:15,255
Without his mom…

264
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:18,383
he wouldn't have been happy anywhere.

265
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:28,977
Mr. Hong told me a long time ago

266
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,689
that you accepted
the cancer and the sentence

267
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:36,276
because of your guilt
over abandoning your son.

268
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,701
I'm sure your son is doing well.

269
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,914
So don't feel guilty and get better.

270
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,209
Don't give up on yourself like this.

271
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,089
Okay?

272
00:22:58,757 --> 00:22:59,758
Okay.

273
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,344
I'll do that.

274
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,889
I'll try.

275
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:26,743
Shouldn't we still come up
with some sort of plan?

276
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:32,541
Don't worry.

277
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,879
Vincenzo and Cha-young can never find me.

278
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:41,425
They won't get anything
from interrogating those three killers.

279
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,928
But wouldn't they come
after me and Ms. Choi

280
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:47,556
to find out who you are?

281
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:53,937
-Can you endure torture?
-What?

282
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,981
-"What?"
-Pardon? Sorry?

283
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:59,651
You know, like being hung
upside down and being electrocuted,

284
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:02,070
or being beat senselessly
with a baseball bat.

285
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:03,822
No. I cannot endure that kind of…

286
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,742
Yes. I can endure it.

287
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:10,120
Damn it.

288
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,164
They were my most useful hunting dogs.

289
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,751
It's hard to find hunting dogs like them.

290
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,795
Unless you want to have him stuffed
as a trophy,

291
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,840
we can just chase him away.

292
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:25,302
Why don't we handle
Vincenzo differently this time?

293
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:26,678
How?

294
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:28,847
Let's take the easy route.

295
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:34,645
There's the fact that
Vincenzo is in the Mafia.

296
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:38,649
-You were so cool.
-Stop that. You're embarrassing me.

297
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:41,860
-Gosh, it wasn't anything special.
-Can you teach me that?

298
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:43,111
Don't tell people…

299
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:44,780
Hey.

300
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:49,326
Vincenzo Cassano. Good morning.

301
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:50,244
Hello.

302
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,704
Wait.

303
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,460
When you need muscle
or help with getting your money back,

304
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:01,004
tell me anytime.

305
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:07,636
He beat up the thugs who came
to demolish the plaza yesterday.

306
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:09,429
He told us that he used to be called

307
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:12,683
Lightning Scissors of Chungju.

308
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,059
I see.

309
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,145
Good day.

310
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:20,607
What?

311
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:22,401
What kind of response was that?

312
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,319
Shouldn't he at least look surprised?

313
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:30,367
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

314
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,871
Mr. Cassano, I need to talk to you.

315
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,959
Please let me be your bodyguard.

316
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,168
Don't.

317
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:41,586
She says no.

318
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,297
You don't need to pay me.

319
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,174
I just want to help you.

320
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,136
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

321
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:52,389
I don't need a bodyguard.

322
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:53,932
No, you will need one.

323
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,268
He says he doesn't need one!

324
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:58,603
I'm not rich or well-educated,

325
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:01,064
but I would like to have a job
that is meaningful.

326
00:26:06,486 --> 00:26:09,489
I want to help you with the talent I have

327
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,199
to bring down bad guys.

328
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,744
What if you get in trouble
and lose everything again?

329
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:15,996
When will we have babies then?

330
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,622
I'm not trying to lose anything.

331
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:21,251
I'm doing this because
I want to make Dal-rae proud of his dad.

332
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:22,461
How old are you?

333
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,547
Why are you trying to live life like
a Hong Kong action movie?

334
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,216
Should I let them have their way then?

335
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,677
I must show them
that I will put up a fight

336
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:34,222
no matter how insignificant I may be!

337
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,850
Okay. I got it. Let me think about it.

338
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:39,019
-Don't even think about it!
-Okay, I won't.

339
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:42,272
Mr. Cassano, please trust me
and let me be your bodyguard.

340
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:43,523
-Mr. Cassano.
-Come here.

341
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:46,276
Mr. Cassano.

342
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,862
Are you testing me right now?

343
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:50,405
Don't lift me above your head!

344
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,616
I'll leave you if you do!

345
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,377
Yes, Mr. Cho.

346
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,879
I tracked down the number you gave me,

347
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:07,381
but we have a problem.

348
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:11,718
So the records
of Jang Han-seok's burner phone

349
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:15,722
and the killers' phones have been erased
from the cell towers, right?

350
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:19,142
Yes. When he got to them,
they were erasing all the records.

351
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,353
Not everyone can do that.

352
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:23,313
I'm sure the higher-ups pressured them.

353
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:27,401
But luckily, we got the locations
of the last contact.

354
00:27:28,402 --> 00:27:31,279
This is when I called Jang Han-seok
with the killer's phone.

355
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:32,447
Take a look.

356
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:40,288
Yang-dong, Giseong-gu, Seoul…

357
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,373
Yang-dong?

358
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,377
Wait, that's where the underpass is.

359
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:49,423
That means Jang Han-seok was near by then.

360
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:52,467
My gosh. Where was he hiding?

361
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,344
What a rat!

362
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:56,388
He's such a sly and annoying rat!

363
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:59,975
If this is our only lead,
how will we find Jang Han-seok?

364
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:07,733
-You come here often.
-Yes.

365
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:12,446
My chef has sent you some risotto today.

366
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,115
I feel bad taking free food.

367
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:17,451
We're having a meeting now.
We'll eat afterwards.

368
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:19,161
-Okay.
-Thank you.

369
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:24,875
I'll look into the routes people can take
to approach the underpass.

370
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:25,876
-You do that.
-Okay.

371
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:29,963
Isn't this crazy though?
He could have been watching us.

372
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:32,382
It means he was in the area.

373
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:35,802
Why are there two dishes?

374
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:39,181
You said not to bring yours the other day.

375
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:42,350
But, still…

376
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,229
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
to bring yours too next time.

377
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:49,399
Okay.

378
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,945
-Thanks.
-Sure. Sorry.

379
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:00,619
-Thanks.
-Sorry.

380
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:03,997
Thank you.

381
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,208
I'm sorry.

382
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,168
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

383
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,378
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

384
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:12,547
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

385
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,925
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you. Sorry.

386
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,676
-Thank you.
-Sure.

387
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,928
Thank you.

388
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:25,477
We can't track his phone's location.

389
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,854
There's nothing we can do for now.

390
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,316
This would be a piece of cake
for an intelligence agency.

391
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:36,905
An?

392
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:50,627
What are you doing?

393
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,212
-What's this?
-Don't touch that.

394
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,094
Bye.

395
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:04,349
NANYAK TEMPLE

396
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:10,856
Are you Jeokha?

397
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:11,815
Yes.

398
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:14,192
We're from
the Administrative Headquarters.

399
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:16,736
-I see. Hello.
-I see.

400
00:30:18,154 --> 00:30:19,489
How may I help you?

401
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:22,284
Someone has blown the whistle
on Nanyak Temple

402
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,494
on the Jogye Order webpage.

403
00:30:25,787 --> 00:30:26,830
A whistleblower?

404
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:29,666
What do you mean?

405
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:32,544
They said
you forced people to make hefty donations

406
00:30:32,627 --> 00:30:34,045
and rarely held services.

407
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,046
Pardon?

408
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,506
This is not true.

409
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,425
-This is slander.
-I'm sorry.

410
00:30:39,092 --> 00:30:41,261
But we must follow the protocol
and investigate.

411
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:43,305
-Please excuse us.
-What…

412
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:47,809
But…

413
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:49,728
Wait.

414
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,326
I'm feeling down.

415
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:08,580
I should have my vitamins.

416
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:13,543
Can I have one?

417
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:16,463
This is for women.
There's a different product for men.

418
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:18,673
I see. Okay.

419
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,968
You could've bought men's vitamins too.

420
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,643
To locate Jang Han-seok,

421
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:32,729
we need to pressure Wusang
or Chairman Jang Han-seo.

422
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,232
But I doubt we'll get anything from them.

423
00:31:36,316 --> 00:31:39,069
We need to find someone
who knows Jang Han-seok's face.

424
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:40,904
That won't be easy to do.

425
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:43,782
Someone who knows…

426
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:45,241
Jeez!

427
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:48,328
Ms. Seo?

428
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:59,589
It's the monthly game day today.
I was wondering if you could attend.

429
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:06,137
The tenants get together
and play games to bond.

430
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,348
The losers buy lunch.

431
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:09,557
I see.

432
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:12,978
We skipped last month's game day
as there was a lot happening.

433
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:15,855
Why don't you all join us today?

434
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:17,524
What kind of game do you play?

435
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:18,692
Mafia.

436
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:21,820
Pardon?

437
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:30,453
Do you not know how to play Mafia?

438
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:35,208
I'm good.

439
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,669
You guys can go have fun.

440
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,262
Mr. Cassano. Please join us.

441
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:49,097
If you don't come,

442
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:52,017
I won't go either.

443
00:32:57,355 --> 00:33:00,483
She really wants you to come.
Why don't you join us?

444
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:03,778
If you don't know the rules,
I'll explain them on our way.

445
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:05,405
-They are very simple.
-I said no.

446
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:06,573
Let's go play the game.

447
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:08,825
Let's go. We need something
to uplift our mood.

448
00:33:08,908 --> 00:33:09,784
-I'm good.
-Let's go.

449
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:11,244
-Let's go. It's fun.
-Let's go.

450
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:12,746
-It'll be fun.
-I'm really good.

451
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:14,164
-I'm really good.
-Let's go.

452
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:15,832
-Come on.
-I said no!

453
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:21,880
It’s morning.

454
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:25,508
COP, CITIZEN, MAFIA, COP, MAFIA, CITIZEN

455
00:33:25,592 --> 00:33:29,220
CITIZEN, CITIZEN, DOCTOR, CITIZEN, CITIZEN
CITIZEN, CITIZEN

456
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:31,890
Well, this is obvious.

457
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:34,059
Hey, Vincenzo Cassano.

458
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:37,687
You're a Mafia, right?

459
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:40,940
I also believe that
the handsome lawyer over there is a Mafia.

460
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,735
I'm not a Mafia.

461
00:33:43,818 --> 00:33:47,322
I think you are

462
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,824
No, I'm not.
I don't look anything like a Mafia.

463
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:53,203
I think he's denying it because he is.

464
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:57,749
I don't think Mr. Cassano is a Mafia.

465
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,043
Hold on.

466
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:02,045
He must also be a Mafia.

467
00:34:02,128 --> 00:34:05,340
You can tell by the way he smiles.

468
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:08,176
Gosh. I think
that pawnshop lady is a Mafia.

469
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,011
Look at her face. She looks sly.

470
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:11,387
That's just how I look.

471
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:14,849
I think the owner of Byebye Balloon
is in the Mafia.

472
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:18,520
By the way, who invited
the Byebye Balloon guys?

473
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:21,940
We just figured we should come
since we're family now.

474
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,483
-Don't you agree?
-Right.

475
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:24,484
I think…

476
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:27,904
That Park Saeroyi wannabe is a Mafia.

477
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:29,114
Don't call me that!

478
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,826
Look who's talking.
You look like a North Korean soldier.

479
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,744
I don't look like that at all.

480
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:36,871
You rebel scum!

481
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:39,040
What? "Rebel scum"?

482
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:40,959
All right. Stop it.

483
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:44,045
We must vote now. It's nighttime.

484
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:45,463
Okay. Put your heads down.

485
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:47,966
-Put your heads down.
-Seriously.

486
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:10,738
Excuse us.

487
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:14,701
Excuse us!

488
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:18,413
What? We're closed.

489
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:20,623
Who's Mr. Vincenzo Cassano?

490
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:22,333
It's me. What is this about?

491
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:26,004
I'm from the International Crimes Division
of Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

492
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:30,049
You're under arrest for attempted murder,
aiding and abetting, and blackmail.

493
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,510
You have the right to consult an attorney,

494
00:35:32,594 --> 00:35:35,763
explain yourself,
and to a writ of habeas corpus.

495
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:38,391
What are you talking about?

496
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:39,767
You're in the Italian Mafia.

497
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:42,020
You're a consigliere.

498
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:46,065
Yes, we're looking for the Mafia members,
but this is a game.

499
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:48,526
-It's not real. It's a game.
-Arrest him.

500
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:52,906
Get up.

501
00:35:54,908 --> 00:35:57,118
-My goodness.
-What? Is this true?

502
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,328
-What's happening?
-What?

503
00:35:58,411 --> 00:35:59,746
Finish your game.

504
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:03,333
You can represent me.

505
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,084
-Come with me.
-Isn't this a game?

506
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,502
He's really leaving.

507
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:09,297
-I'm coming with you as his lawyer.
-What?

508
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,673
-What?
-No!

509
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:14,677
Where are you going?

510
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:18,389
He's in the Mafia.

511
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,244
My cell phone was vibrating
inside my jacket.

512
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:44,290
I thought I was in a horror movie.

513
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:48,544
You really dodged a bullet.

514
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:51,631
You know what? Whatever they try,

515
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:55,093
they can't find me. Never.

516
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,433
-Sir.
-Yes.

517
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:06,145
How about you entrust me

518
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,315
with Babel Pharmaceuticals?

519
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,278
You want to run the company
without my interference?

520
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:16,322
No. That's not what I meant.

521
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:20,285
I have learned a lot from you,

522
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:23,454
so I think I can do it by myself.

523
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:25,373
Right.

524
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,042
I bet you have your own ideas, too.

525
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,627
No!

526
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,548
Should I slit your throat,
so you stop thinking?

527
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:19,260
Sir. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

528
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:22,013
No. Maybe I should die.

529
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:24,098
Sir! No!

530
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:26,225
That way, Babel will be yours.

531
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:43,242
Sir. I'm so sorry.

532
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:46,204
I just wanted to lessen your burden.
That's all.

533
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:47,747
I'm sorry.

534
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:52,210
My burden isn't Babel Pharmaceuticals.

535
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,130
It's you.

536
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:01,761
I'll never ask something like that again.
I'm sorry.

537
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,598
If you ask me something like that again,
I swear…

538
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,561
I'll kill you.

539
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:13,189
I mean it, my brother.

540
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,090
Gosh, I lost my temper again.

541
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:48,099
From now on, I will think more carefully
before I speak.

542
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:52,478
I'll get going first.

543
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,107
Finish your breakfast.

544
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,235
I lost my appetite because of you.

545
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,177
Oh, no!

546
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,512
I've acted so cheeky with him.

547
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,139
It's so embarrassing!

548
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:32,643
I saw it in movies. The Mafia is so cruel.

549
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:34,604
They kill people with guns

550
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:36,981
-and hang people in front of their houses.
-Right.

551
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:39,817
What did I tell you?
I told you he wasn't ordinary.

552
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:44,655
By the way, when he was getting arrested,
they said he was a corn salad.

553
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,032
What does that mean?

554
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:47,700
Toto told me…

555
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:51,496
that's what they call
the top Mafia member. Corn Salad.

556
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,040
What a savory and refreshing title.

557
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:59,003
You know what?
Why don't we ask him for help?

558
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:01,756
-With what?
-With finding the gold.

559
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,091
They are real pros at stuff like this.

560
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,176
That's right.

561
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:07,345
We're not getting anywhere.

562
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:11,599
Then let's tell him about the gold bars.

563
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,435
I'm sure he will give us a solution.

564
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:18,981
Then let's tell him we'll give him
a small cut and get him to help us.

565
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:21,692
But he was arrested.
He can't help us from prison.

566
00:41:21,776 --> 00:41:24,820
Why did the prosecutors from Namdongbu
arrest Vincenzo?

567
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:28,032
I think he's being set up
by Wusang, Babel, and Namdongbu.

568
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:31,244
I knew his mess would catch up with him.

569
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:34,914
Stay out of this. It's a headache.

570
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:38,918
No. We must take Vincenzo Cassano
from them and handle him ourselves.

571
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:41,796
Forget it. We won't get anything from it.

572
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:43,548
Let them handle him.

573
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,677
Sir.

574
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,098
Don't you have any pride?

575
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:53,099
Pride?

576
00:41:53,182 --> 00:41:54,892
Why are you bringing that up now?

577
00:41:54,976 --> 00:42:00,231
Clearly, the head of the International
Crimes Division in Korea is you.

578
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,486
But those people in Namdongbu ignored you
and handled this on their own.

579
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,407
Small-time prosecutors who know
nothing about international crimes.

580
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,119
By taking Vincenzo from them,
we will clearly show them who's in charge

581
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:17,290
and that the head
of this whole operation is you.

582
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,209
He's right!

583
00:42:22,169 --> 00:42:24,880
Thank you, ma'am!

584
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,969
Director Tae.

585
00:42:30,511 --> 00:42:34,849
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

586
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:39,770
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

587
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:43,482
Bring him here now.

588
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:46,402
We'll deal with Vincenzo.

589
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,738
Director Tae.

590
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:50,906
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

591
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,994
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

592
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,787
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Director Tae.

593
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,256
The consigliere of the Cassano Family.

594
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:13,596
Look at these bodies.

595
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:19,644
You sure know
how to work your knife, don't you?

596
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:23,105
How many people did you kill?

597
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:28,611
Arresting him without any definite
evidence is a violation of the law.

598
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,238
Here's the evidence.

599
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:36,410
These photos show no ties to Mr. Cassano.

600
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:39,330
And you need more than a few photos
to arrest him.

601
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,668
I have more than a few photos.

602
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:48,255
You've been causing
a lot of trouble these days.

603
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,758
Given the circumstances,

604
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:53,844
you will be subject to deportation.

605
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:56,514
If the grounds for deportation are clear.

606
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:58,974
I can make whatever grounds I want.

607
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:00,393
That again?

608
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:05,398
Predetermine the punishment
and fabricating evidence?

609
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:12,279
Watch your tone.

610
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:16,242
Please, escort them out.

611
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:18,077
You can't do this!

612
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:23,541
Let's go.

613
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:38,556
Sit tight. I'll do whatever I can.

614
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,391
It's fine.

615
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,602
I can take care of myself.

616
00:44:43,686 --> 00:44:46,063
-Go.
-Let's go.

617
00:44:48,774 --> 00:44:49,859
Wait!

618
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:18,053
An?

619
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:51,504
Who are you?

620
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:55,299
I'm from the International
Organized Crime Bureau

621
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:57,635
of the International Security
Intelligence Service.

622
00:45:59,345 --> 00:46:00,846
I'm Team Leader An Gi-seok.

623
00:46:01,722 --> 00:46:03,057
AN GI-SEOK

624
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,475
No way.

625
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:08,771
I'm here to take Vincenzo Cassano
into our custody.

626
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:11,398
But we're the ones who caught him.

627
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:14,610
Please cooperate
so that Vincenzo Cassano can

628
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:16,445
cooperate with our bureau.

629
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:17,988
The cause is confidential,

630
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:21,909
and you will hand over
all the evidence you have as well.

631
00:46:24,578 --> 00:46:27,998
This is our warrant for his custody
from the Ministry of Justice.

632
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:37,091
Hey…

633
00:46:49,645 --> 00:46:51,605
Let's go, Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

634
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:53,649
Ms. Hong Cha-young.

635
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,707
You little… Damn it.

636
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:12,543
Why you…

637
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:14,795
The International Security
Intelligence Service?

638
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:20,092
Yes. They took him because they had to
keep an eye on him for national security.

639
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:22,052
What? Why would they…

640
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,557
Why would they want him?

641
00:47:27,266 --> 00:47:30,102
I don't know what it is exactly,

642
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:33,522
but I'm sure there's something big
behind this.

643
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:38,569
I think you should pay more attention
to keeping your identity concealed.

644
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:40,779
We're up against an intelligence agency.

645
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:44,199
When it comes to intel,
they're better than us.

646
00:47:44,283 --> 00:47:45,326
That's what they do.

647
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:47,494
Right. You have a point.

648
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:52,750
My gosh. Do you think Vincenzo
could be a spy or something?

649
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,127
-He must be a spy.
-That's what she just said.

650
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:04,637
So…

651
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:08,098
you've been surveilling me the whole time?

652
00:48:08,724 --> 00:48:09,808
I'm sorry.

653
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,311
It was my mission, so I had no choice.

654
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:14,438
I know everything you've been up to

655
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:18,400
including your attempt to find out
who Chairman Jang Han-seok is.

656
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,654
Then, how come you didn't do anything?

657
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:24,573
I would have arrested you
if you violated the law.

658
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:28,243
But Mr. Consigliere
fought for justice, the weak,

659
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:31,080
and Buddha.

660
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:33,290
So I didn't do anything.

661
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:36,126
I see. Buddha was one of them.

662
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:39,338
What do you plan to do with me?

663
00:48:39,421 --> 00:48:42,841
I take it you will continue
to fight against Babel. Am I correct?

664
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:43,759
Yes.

665
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:51,141
I'm on your side. I want to help you.

666
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:54,228
No, listen. This makes no sense right now.

667
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:55,854
Will you really help us?

668
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:59,274
Yes. I will help you
for the good of our country and justice.

669
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:00,943
As you know, I'm in the Mafia,

670
00:49:01,777 --> 00:49:03,654
and you work for an intelligence agency.

671
00:49:03,737 --> 00:49:06,699
That doesn't matter.
I respect you, Mr. Consigliere.

672
00:49:06,782 --> 00:49:07,866
Why?

673
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,079
Because you repented your past sins
and are devoted to fighting evil.

674
00:49:22,756 --> 00:49:24,967
Then we'll gladly accept your help.

675
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,802
-It's settled, then.
-Deal.

676
00:49:26,885 --> 00:49:29,179
But I have three conditions.

677
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:31,932
-Gosh. Three?
-Number one.

678
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:36,270
you must include me
as an official member of your group.

679
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,355
-Okay.
-Number two.

680
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:41,108
Keep my identity secret
from the other tenants.

681
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,484
Okay.

682
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:43,402
Number three.

683
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:51,118
-Give me a hug.
-Okay.

684
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:52,286
What?

685
00:49:53,954 --> 00:49:56,373
-What?
-It's embarrassing to say this…

686
00:49:58,417 --> 00:50:00,169
but it's just such a huge honor.

687
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:04,548
He said it's a huge honor. Come on.
Give the man a hug.

688
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:06,091
What are you talking about?

689
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:18,145
How about a handshake instead?

690
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:25,944
Good.

691
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,918
Okay, but you're too close.

692
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:42,878
I can't believe…

693
00:50:43,754 --> 00:50:47,591
that I'm in the presence
of a real consigliere.

694
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:51,804
I have no regrets now, Mr. Consigliere.

695
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:57,768
These photos…

696
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:00,229
It's the evidence we got
from the Namdongbu Office.

697
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:01,605
What is it, Mr. Consigliere?

698
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,775
-Oh, my God.
-What's the matter?

699
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,152
These photos are…

700
00:51:09,404 --> 00:51:12,241
probably from the man
Jang Han-seok sent to Italy.

701
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:14,910
A prosecutor can't get these photos.

702
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:18,705
What if he gave Jang Han-seok
these photos in person?

703
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:23,252
It's highly likely that he saw his face.

704
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:26,129
Gosh. I got goosebumps.

705
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:31,802
If we can find this informant,

706
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:34,304
we can get to Jang Han-seok.

707
00:51:34,388 --> 00:51:35,722
We should find him then.

708
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:37,850
-An.
-Yes?

709
00:51:37,933 --> 00:51:40,018
I mean, Mr. An.

710
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:44,481
You can help me with this, right?

711
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:46,191
Of course.

712
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:48,527
Thank you. See you later.

713
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:52,072
Thank you. Let's go, Ms. Hong.

714
00:51:52,155 --> 00:51:55,242
I'll look forward to working with you.
See you at the plaza.

715
00:51:56,076 --> 00:51:58,370
I'm rooting for you, Mr. Consigliere!

716
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:02,124
Always! We can do this!

717
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:08,589
The Korean man

718
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:11,758
who was asking about you?

719
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:12,676
Yes.

720
00:52:13,302 --> 00:52:15,304
See if you can get a photo
or a video of him.

721
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:18,557
I heard he met with Giorgio
at Hotel Caruso.

722
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,851
I'll look into the security cameras there.

723
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:22,519
Do it as soon as possible.

724
00:52:26,064 --> 00:52:27,733
How long do you think it'll take?

725
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:30,569
Three or four hours will suffice.

726
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:01,808
WELCOME BACK
MAFIA'S CORN SALAD VINCENZO!

727
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:14,905
-I'll just leave.
-No way.

728
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:19,868
Mr. Cassano! This way!

729
00:53:19,952 --> 00:53:20,953
Okay.

730
00:53:29,127 --> 00:53:31,797
A hero of Geumga Plaza is born.

731
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,839
Come on.

732
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:35,759
Is this a wedding hall? What is all this?

733
00:53:58,407 --> 00:53:59,491
Let us welcome

734
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:03,620
the return of the great Mafia,
Corn Salad Vincenzo!

735
00:54:06,832 --> 00:54:09,501
Everyone wants to hug you today.

736
00:54:09,584 --> 00:54:13,255
-We want a strong leader!
-Yes!

737
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:17,259
We don't want a weak leader
who's all talk and no action.

738
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:20,721
-The Mafia have their turf, right?
-Right.

739
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:22,556
Make our plaza your turf.

740
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,433
-Yes.
-You're our Corn Salad.

741
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:28,270
Please, lead us

742
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:29,521
so we can fight back harder.

743
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:30,564
Well…

744
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,483
What we need is the ability to fight,
not peace.

745
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:37,696
I'm so happy that you are in the Mafia.

746
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:40,198
-Let's do this, Corn Salad!
-Corn Salad!

747
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:42,951
-Corn Salad!
-Corn Salad!

748
00:54:43,035 --> 00:54:44,536
-Corn Salad.
-Wait.

749
00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:46,788
It's not a Corn Salad.

750
00:54:46,872 --> 00:54:48,749
It's consigliere.

751
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:49,666
-What?
-What?

752
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,627
You said Corn Salad was the title
for the scariest Mafia member.

753
00:54:52,711 --> 00:54:53,879
-Corn Salad?
-Hey.

754
00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:59,384
Well, I said it was consigliere.

755
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:00,469
Let's move on.

756
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:02,137
A round of applause!

757
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:11,605
You're supposed to eat tofu
after your release.

758
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:12,814
I'm good.

759
00:55:12,898 --> 00:55:15,275
-No.
-No. You have to eat it.

760
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:17,069
-Just one bite.
-You have to.

761
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:18,320
Take a bite.

762
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:23,325
-Isn't it great?
-Good!

763
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,327
Gosh.

764
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,162
I'm glad that we didn't cross him.

765
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:29,831
We could have really died.

766
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:32,918
He won't try to get back at us, right?

767
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:36,797
He won't
because we already look so pathetic.

768
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,173
Consigliere.

769
00:55:43,678 --> 00:55:45,138
I'm glad that you got out.

770
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:48,183
I feel like I'm one of the residents
in Jongno,

771
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:51,186
welcoming Kim Du-han on his release.

772
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,271
"Stand up, Du-han.

773
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:55,649
Du-han, you're the pride of Joseon!

774
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:57,567
No. Get up! You must!

775
00:55:57,651 --> 00:55:58,485
You are…"

776
00:55:58,568 --> 00:55:59,945
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

777
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:02,030
-That's enough.
-Okay.

778
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:05,450
With all the support you have,
why don't you make your own family here?

779
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:07,619
Geumga Family, Mr. Corn Salad.

780
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:13,667
Yes?

781
00:56:16,044 --> 00:56:18,171
It's Luca.

782
00:56:18,255 --> 00:56:19,756
-Luca.
-Luca.

783
00:56:30,225 --> 00:56:31,726
He's super-fast.

784
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,895
Professionals sure are different.

785
00:56:36,398 --> 00:56:37,566
He really is a Mafia.

786
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:49,661
By the way, will we be able to find out
who he is only with this video?

787
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:05,510
-Can you find out who he is?
-Gosh.

788
00:57:06,094 --> 00:57:08,638
This is a piece of cake.

789
00:57:11,224 --> 00:57:12,893
How long will this take?

790
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:16,396
Five hours will be more than enough.

791
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:18,940
That's pretty impressive.

792
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:23,069
Then again,
think about all the taxes we pay.

793
00:57:27,616 --> 00:57:30,285
What are you doing, An? Get their order.

794
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:34,206
Okay. Truffle porcini spaghetti.

795
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:35,207
Okay.

796
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:37,334
Kimchi fried rice.

797
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:40,253
Okay. They want kimchi fried rice.

798
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:42,214
Kimchi fried rice.

799
00:57:42,714 --> 00:57:45,258
Wait. Who orders kimchi fried rice
at a pasta restaurant?

800
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:02,817
You were here, Mr. Cassano.

801
00:58:04,486 --> 00:58:05,445
Hello.

802
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:07,822
What's the matter?

803
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:10,825
I WANT TO REPORT A CORRUPT TEMPLE

804
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,791
And you don't know who posted this online?

805
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:20,961
It was anonymous.
So they couldn't tell us who wrote this.

806
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,547
This is defamation.

807
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,550
If it's a false accusation,
we can sue them for compensation.

808
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:30,303
What happens
if you can't prove this is not true?

809
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:32,973
We will be suspended, and the temple…

810
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:35,976
might have to close down.

811
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:38,228
This is so unfair.

812
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:42,566
He's been devoted to the teachings
of Buddha all his life.

813
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:45,819
First, we must find out
who wrote such lies online.

814
00:59:03,628 --> 00:59:07,799
By the way, Mr. Jang, it's very loud.
Are you sure this is okay?

815
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:11,219
Hunting is allowed in the nearby
mountains. I can shoot here.

816
00:59:11,303 --> 00:59:12,345
I see.

817
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:17,642
-Damn it.
-You're not even that far,

818
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,436
but you can't hit your target.

819
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:21,313
Well, that's because…

820
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,148
You should try it. Go ahead.

821
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:24,858
-Me?
-Yes. Do it.

822
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:26,735
Okay. All right.

823
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:28,486
-I'll try it. Okay.
-Go ahead.

824
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,989
Gosh. I'm kind of embarrassed.

825
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:33,575
-Just do it.
-Okay.

826
00:59:47,672 --> 00:59:48,506
What was that?

827
00:59:49,257 --> 00:59:52,719
I was the best marksman
during my military service.

828
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:56,348
The gun is working fine.

829
01:00:05,565 --> 01:00:06,733
How did he do that?

830
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:20,246
My brother has

831
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,125
no intention of
putting me in charge of Babel.

832
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:28,129
Vincenzo keeps outsmarting him.
He's not that good, either.

833
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:30,924
Well…

834
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:33,927
Vincenzo has had the upper hand lately.

835
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:36,930
Like the incident at the underpass.

836
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:40,266
Exactly. He would've been killed
if he'd been caught there.

837
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:44,938
I wish he was caught.

838
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,321
That's what you really want, right?

839
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:57,742
-No, what I meant was…
-You want to oust your brother

840
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:00,120
and run Babel by yourself, right?

841
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,335
Don't say stuff like that.

842
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:09,671
But you are worried
about the aftermath, right?

843
01:01:09,754 --> 01:01:12,632
You don't know how to run the company
without your brother.

844
01:01:14,134 --> 01:01:15,510
Don't worry.

845
01:01:16,094 --> 01:01:19,389
I will support you, so Babel can run
smoothly like a well-oiled machine.

846
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:51,921
Will Ms. Choi Myung-hee back me up too?

847
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:53,214
Ms. Choi…

848
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:57,510
isn't the type to take risks.

849
01:01:58,094 --> 01:01:59,220
Forget her, then.

850
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:07,520
But…

851
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:12,150
-do you really think I can do this?
-Of course.

852
01:02:12,692 --> 01:02:15,695
I'll risk my life to serve you.

853
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:19,741
You and I aren't some moths
flying into fire knowing they'll die.

854
01:02:19,824 --> 01:02:22,452
We will be phoenixes instead.

855
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:34,380
Then let's come up with a plan…

856
01:02:37,217 --> 01:02:38,510
without anyone knowing.

857
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,318
Damn it.

858
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:17,173
Mr. Cassano.

859
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:25,849
The issue Nanyak Temple's having…

860
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:30,228
Did you do it?

861
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:32,146
Yes.

862
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,358
Wait, what? Well, that's…

863
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:38,444
I wanted to get the gold
out of there quickly.

864
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:45,994
I'm sorry.

865
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:50,957
I should apologize.

866
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:54,669
I've been taking too much time.
You must've been frustrated.

867
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:57,297
No, I was rash.

868
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,799
I shouldn't have done that.
I was just impatient.

869
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:05,805
Let's discuss it before we do anything
just like we've been doing.

870
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,434
We're friends.

871
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:12,145
Yes. I understand, Mr. Cassano.

872
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:15,648
It won't happen ever again.

873
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,403
Write on the bulletin board
that your accusations were false.

874
01:04:21,279 --> 01:04:22,780
We can't do that to the monks.

875
01:04:24,073 --> 01:04:25,742
I'll post a correction.

876
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,411
Please do. I'll get going.

877
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,121
Okay.

878
01:04:53,144 --> 01:04:54,354
Mr. Corn Salad.

879
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:55,855
We need to talk.

880
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:01,819
What did you just say?

881
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:03,237
Gold!

882
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,406
-"Gold"?
-Gold.

883
01:05:06,699 --> 01:05:08,868
We received information

884
01:05:08,952 --> 01:05:13,873
that there is 12 billion won's worth
of gold bars hidden in this building.

885
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:17,251
But we don't know the exact location.

886
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:20,380
We've searched every corner
of the building for a month.

887
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,966
Who told you that there's gold here?

888
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:25,551
A neighborhood beggar, Gilbert.

889
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:27,512
I see.

890
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:29,764
A homeless guy.

891
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:31,391
Isn't this your specialty?

892
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:36,813
Does everyone at the plaza
know about this?

893
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:39,399
Yes. Except for you three
from Jipuragi Law Firm.

894
01:05:40,817 --> 01:05:42,068
If you help us,

895
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:45,238
we'll all chip in and give you a cut.

896
01:05:48,783 --> 01:05:49,993
Hey!

897
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:51,869
Why are you so rude?

898
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:54,664
I wasn't being rude.

899
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:59,168
Gosh! There's gold in this building!

900
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:00,086
-Yes.
-Yes.

901
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:01,713
There's gold here?

902
01:06:02,213 --> 01:06:05,049
-Gosh. Who knew I'd see gold bars?
-Mr. Cassano.

903
01:06:06,676 --> 01:06:08,928
-Be quiet.
-Okay.

904
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:11,973
Okay. I'm sorry.

905
01:06:12,056 --> 01:06:13,599
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

906
01:06:14,225 --> 01:06:15,810
-By the way…
-Yes?

907
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:18,104
…how is that gold yours?

908
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:19,897
It must belong to someone.

909
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:22,650
Finders keepers.

910
01:06:23,943 --> 01:06:25,278
Right, my keeper?

911
01:06:26,404 --> 01:06:27,780
That was witty.

912
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:30,783
-That's so funny.
-I'm good, aren't I?

913
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:36,539
Please help us.

914
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:40,126
Okay. Bye.

915
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:50,845
How dare they think it's theirs?
How dare they?

916
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:31,886
What's this?

917
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,453
REPORT ON KIM SANG-YUN

918
01:07:57,537 --> 01:08:00,331
PERSONAL INFORMATION ON KIM SANG-YUN

919
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:02,166
Kim Sang-yun, 41 years old.

920
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,919
A former VP
of a multi-national arms company, DO Arms.

921
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:08,714
He's working as a weapon lobbyist
and an informant in Europe now.

922
01:08:10,508 --> 01:08:12,343
No wonder his intel was good.

923
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,762
But I'm glad that he's in Korea.

924
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:19,308
Let's start looking
for Jang Han-seok again.

925
01:08:24,856 --> 01:08:25,898
What is it?

926
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,277
We should meet today.
I've got important information.

927
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,444
Stop lying.

928
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:31,863
I'm serious.

929
01:08:31,946 --> 01:08:34,866
Babel Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals
won't compensate the victims.

930
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:35,783
What?

931
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:40,496
Okay.

932
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:44,542
I'll go meet Joon-woo.

933
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,919
Find out who Jang Han-seok is.

934
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:47,920
Okay.

935
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:17,575
Who are you?

936
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:49,357
Yes, I did those things,

937
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:53,277
but you only collected
negative information.

938
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,947
Jang Han-seok will get the wrong idea.

939
01:09:57,406 --> 01:10:00,493
I made a lot of donations
and saved a lot of people.

940
01:10:05,623 --> 01:10:09,085
Will I end up killing you or…

941
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:12,463
sparing you?

942
01:10:12,964 --> 01:10:14,257
Just kill me.

943
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:17,551
You want to know
who Jang Han-seok is, right?

944
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:19,345
But I cannot tell you.

945
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,889
Even if I save myself
by telling you who he is,

946
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:23,724
I'll be dead in a week.

947
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:28,020
What if I find you a way
for you to survive?

948
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:29,146
It won't work.

949
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:31,023
And I don't trust you.

950
01:10:36,529 --> 01:10:39,782
So you'll keep your secret
and stay loyal to him.

951
01:10:43,828 --> 01:10:44,912
What a fine lobbyist.

952
01:10:45,663 --> 01:10:48,541
I've been tortured by the Russian Mafia,
terrorists, and rebels.

953
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,335
This isn't my first rodeo.

954
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:54,672
I can endure all kinds of pain
you throw at me.

955
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:00,803
I guess you don't know this.

956
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:05,766
There's a limit to pain,

957
01:11:06,684 --> 01:11:10,062
but there's no limit to one's fear.

958
01:11:56,275 --> 01:11:58,611
The first round is a tie.

959
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:00,363
Round two.

960
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:03,824
I'll go first this time.

961
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:07,912
Wait.

962
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:15,628
The second round is also a tie.

963
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:18,839
Round three.

964
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:21,425
I'll go first again.

965
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,146
The third round is also a tie.

966
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,564
Round four.

967
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:42,238
Stop. Stop it! I'll tell you everything.

968
01:12:44,657 --> 01:12:46,450
I'll tell you who Jang Han-seok is.

969
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:48,494
He's…

970
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:50,621
He's a lawyer at Wusang.

971
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:57,378
His name at Wusang is…

972
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,381
Jang Joon-woo.

973
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:12,351
Give me the intel now.

974
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:27,283
I'll show you this document
in exchange for information about you.

975
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,326
Hey, you can't do that.

976
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,578
Forget it then.

977
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:33,330
Okay.

978
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:40,796
REPORT ON BABEL'S
COMPENSATION WITHDRAWAL

979
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,132
This is the report
from Choi Myung-hee to Mr. Han.

980
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:45,176
I got it from the bin
in the boss's office.

981
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:48,846
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CAUSE TO COMPENSATE…

982
01:13:48,929 --> 01:13:51,390
Babel Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals
will make an announcement

983
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,017
on withdrawing their
compensation next week.

984
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:58,063
But Chairman Jang Han-seo promised
to compensate them on TV.

985
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:00,858
Damn it. Those assholes!

986
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:04,695
All right. You tell me something
about what you're up to.

987
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:10,034
Yes.

988
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,162
Just listen. Don't say anything.

989
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:18,417
Jang Joon-woo is…

990
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:22,671
Jang Han-seok.

991
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:31,847
Jang Joon-woo, your junior and intern,

992
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,602
was Jang Han-seok all along.

993
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:52,076
What will you do?

994
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:56,539
You'll stick to the plan, right?

995
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,067
Jang Joon-woo.

996
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:49,883
Mr. Cassano?

997
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:05,065
Kneel.

998
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:07,151
-What's going on?
-Kneel.

999
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:09,695
Do it.

1000
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:15,117
Can you tell me

1001
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,829
what's going on here?

1002
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:37,139
That's enough.

1003
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:40,934
Jang Han-seok.

1004
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:50,694
Damn it.

1005
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:52,613
You got me.

1006
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,203
How did you find out?

1007
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:00,996
You can hide the fire,

1008
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,581
but you can't hide the smoke.

1009
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:04,458
I guess there was still some smoke left

1010
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:07,836
even when I had the fan on high.

1011
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,050
Say your last prayer.

1012
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,219
I don't pray.

1013
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:31,402
Kill me already.

1014
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,113
You Mafia bastard.

1015
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:41,412
As you wish.

1016
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,940
It's time for you to make a decision.

1017
01:18:53,484 --> 01:18:54,902
I guess a war broke out.

1018
01:18:54,985 --> 01:19:00,199
I heard that you're ready to bring
all six charges against the Babel Group.

1019
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:03,035
The entire country will be in an uproar
if this is exposed.

1020
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,579
I'll help you kill my brother as you wish

1021
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:07,706
so just leave me and Babel alone.

1022
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:10,334
If you choose the wrong one,

1023
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:13,295
you'll end up falling to your death.

1024
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:16,507
I really am going to kill you soon.
Run if you're afraid.

1025
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,258
I'll follow you there too.
