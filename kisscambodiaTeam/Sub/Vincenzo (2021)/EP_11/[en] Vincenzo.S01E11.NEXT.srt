1
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,670
I was scared to death.

2
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,090
Why didn't you answer your phone?

3
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,884
That's what technology is for.

4
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,679
I didn't want to put you in danger. Sorry.

5
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,431
And what if I am?

6
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,936
We're partners,
so we should share the danger.

7
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,231
-You really piss me off.
-Ms. Hong.

8
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,608
The real boss behind Babel.

9
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,444
I know who it is.

10
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,364
Really?

11
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,323
Yes.

12
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,260
Who is the real boss?

13
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,763
<i>Who is this chairman?</i>

14
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,931
I don't know.

15
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,478
Jang Han-seok!

16
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,272
Jang Han-seok.

17
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,944
But we thought he was living
a quiet life in the States.

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,404
No.

19
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,323
He was behind this the whole time.

20
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,451
CHAIRMAN

21
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,414
Let's call him.

22
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,557
Cha-young, over here!

23
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,337
Aren't you getting a call?

24
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,756
What? A call?

25
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,637
No. I'm not getting any calls.

26
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,850
I should report this to the police.

27
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:51,189
Mr. Cassano told us
never to report this to the police.

28
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,400
Mr. Cassano will take care of it.

29
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
Put it back in.

30
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,948
Okay.

31
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,618
There's no answer.

32
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,871
That's odd. He would answer
if he wanted to know what happened.

33
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,997
Right.

34
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,705
Who are they?

35
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,834
They are Mr. Cassano's shadows.

36
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,838
Take these three to the warehouse.
I'll be there soon.

37
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,047
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

38
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,761
Why didn't you bring them with you?

39
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,181
I told them to keep an eye on you
just in case.

40
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,150
Thanks, Joon-woo. You should go home.

41
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,360
No. I want to stay with you.

42
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,737
Just go!

43
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,239
Mr. Jang.

44
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,118
Today was an exception,

45
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,746
but you shouldn't come next time.

46
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,338
Okay. I won't.

47
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,223
Why does he look so pitiful?

48
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,327
Can you two help clean…

49
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,210
Your car door was open,
so we just took these out.

50
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,170
We'll clean up here.

51
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,380
So it'll look like nothing happened here.

52
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,677
You cannot tell the other tenants
what happened.

53
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,929
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

54
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,807
Ms. Hong and I will take the killers' car.

55
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,725
You two can take my car.

56
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,020
-Okay.
-And pick up the empty shells, too.

57
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,108
Don't worry.

58
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,445
When it comes to picking up empty shells,
Korean men are the best.

59
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,114
Salute!

60
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,671
He almost got me!

61
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,508
How did he beat the three of them
all at once?

62
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,356
EPISODE 11

63
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,278
Damn it.

64
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,155
What is this?

65
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,783
This is just like the movies.

66
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,786
Will this actually kill them?

67
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,329
I've never done this before.

68
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,499
But they might die sooner than I thought.

69
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,719
Okay. Pay attention.

70
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,679
We have some bookkeeping to do.

71
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,808
First, you were the ones
who set the villa on fire

72
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,311
and killed the researchers, right?

73
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,040
Yes! It was us!

74
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,333
Yes, we did it!

75
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,506
Next.

76
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:32,178
You also killed Director Gil and
investigators from the prosecution, right?

77
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,095
Damn it.

78
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,151
-Yes!
-We did it! We killed them.

79
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,528
-Stop it!
-Stop!

80
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,654
Stop!

81
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,660
Here's the most important question.

82
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,497
The four people who committed suicide.

83
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,708
You set it up, didn't you?

84
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,134
-Yes. It was us.
-Yes.

85
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,554
We did that, too.

86
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,723
Stop it. Please stop it!

87
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,600
-Please!
-Please!

88
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,024
-Stop it!
-Please!

89
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,485
-Don't!
-Stop!

90
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,825
Do you finally understand

91
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,288
the pain they felt
as they lay dying in the car?

92
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,165
We only did what we were told to!

93
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,668
We were following Jang Han-seok's orders!

94
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,063
Where is…

95
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,274
Jang Han-seok?

96
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,651
The only thing I know
is that he's in Korea.

97
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,737
We've never seen his face!

98
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,114
-Are you sure he's in Korea?
-Yes!

99
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,907
He gives us orders through the phone.

100
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>And when he calls us,
he uses a voice changer.</i>

101
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,412
Yes, sir.

102
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,456
<i>Don't come to the plaza.
Go to the underpass</i>

103
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,833
-<i>where you abducted them.</i>
-Yes, sir.

104
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,002
Stop lying.

105
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,171
I'm sure you know where he is.

106
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,714
We're telling the truth.

107
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,883
We really don't know where he is!

108
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,720
This is all they know.

109
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,981
I guess they're useless now.

110
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,526
Should we get rid of them?

111
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,028
-Don't kill us.
-Spare us.

112
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,446
Don't kill us.

113
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,868
You bastards deserve to die
over and over again.

114
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,161
People usually

115
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,706
don't reflect on their past actions
when they avert a crisis.

116
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,504
Especially people like you
don't have a sense of guilt to repent.

117
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,214
Just hand us over to the police!

118
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,174
We'll face the punishment of the law!

119
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,344
The punishment of the law?

120
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,348
And who will that benefit?

121
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
Let's go.

122
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,318
-Don't kill us!
-Let us out!

123
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,492
Let us out!

124
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,666
Yes, Mr. Cho.

125
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,839
Yes. Locate the cell phone
of the number I sent you.

126
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,717
Okay.

127
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,224
I know that they are helping us,

128
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,476
but I get mad whenever I see them.

129
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,855
Those two, you mean?

130
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,898
Whenever I see them,

131
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm reminded of my father's incident.

132
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,447
I can understand that.

133
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,241
They killed your father,
but you can't do anything.

134
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,871
You remember what I told you
when we caught them, right?

135
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,747
When you're in a war,

136
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,001
it's the most effective to use
your enemy's hunting dogs.

137
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,046
We're using them
because I accepted what you told me.

138
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,257
Once they become useless to us,

139
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,595
I'll help you throw them
into the tiger's cage. Just wait.

140
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,477
Where did you learn to fight like that?

141
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,688
I had martial arts training as a kid.

142
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,232
My teacher was a former GIS member.

143
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,443
"GIS"?

144
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,987
-Italian special forces.
-I see.

145
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,741
That explains why you looked cool
when fighting.

146
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,954
I trained my ass off.

147
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,749
It was the only way

148
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,419
for a weak Asian kid to protect himself
among bigger racist Caucasians.

149
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,005
I had to fight.

150
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,262
What will you do with those three killers?

151
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,892
I'll show them mercy
since I don't want to make use of them.

152
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,869
<i>Today, I'll show mercy</i>

153
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,499
<i>by letting them face
a less painful punishment</i>

154
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,086
<i>than they deserve.</i>

155
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,674
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

156
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,967
-Drink it up.
-All right.

157
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,553
-Cheers.
-I will.

158
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,013
-Bottoms up.
-Is it true?

159
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,975
Mr. Tak beat those thugs
with a pair of scissors?

160
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,060
-Watch.
-Okay.

161
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,229
He used his scissors like this.

162
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,151
From the first moment I saw him

163
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,321
I could sense that he had this
special energy within him.

164
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,364
Gosh, I'm hot.

165
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,241
Were you in some kind of organization?

166
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,702
-Gosh, no. What organization?
-Were you?

167
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,496
It's just that in my hometown, Chungju,

168
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,875
-people called me Lightning Scissors.
-Gosh.

169
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,002
You're fast as lightning,
hence the nickname.

170
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,590
There's a monk we call "Lightning Moktak"
for hitting the <i>moktak</i> fast.

171
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,760
Gosh, you should consider
yourselves lucky.

172
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,971
Do you know how scary those thugs are?

173
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,973
When did you get here?

174
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,393
You should be careful around people
with the Gurkha knife tattoos.

175
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,854
They go around the redevelopment sites

176
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,231
And anyone that doesn't listen to them

177
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,567
ends up dead.

178
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,486
They come to your house at night
and beat you to death.

179
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,363
Gosh. Anyway,

180
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,783
I wonder when Mr. Martial Arts over there
will show us his skills.

181
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,702
What a series of disappointments.

182
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:17,041
Well, I guess Mr. Lee does lack
this critical blow to end the fight.

183
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,460
That's right.

184
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:23,172
He can beat neighborhood thugs,
but he's not that good.

185
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,135
Anyway, when it comes to fighting,

186
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,222
Mr. Tak is ranked number one
in the plaza now.

187
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,058
And Mr. Cassano is the second best.

188
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,768
No, I don't agree.

189
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,855
I think Mr. Cassano's moves
are graceful like Donnie Yen.

190
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,899
It's embarrassing to say this,

191
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,362
but Vincenzo Cassano's movements
are sloppy like Stephen Chow's.

192
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,823
That's not true.
They aren't sloppy at all.

193
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,284
Mr. Cassano is like a bat out of hell.

194
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,836
<i>How odd.</i>

195
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>Just a few hours ago,
I did something I'd never imagined,</i>

196
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,926
<i>but it seems I can drink just fine.</i>

197
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,804
<i>Ms. Hong, you belong in the Mafia.</i>

198
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,598
<i>Let's drink until 2 a.m.
and call it a night.</i>

199
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,892
<i>You said it. Just until 2 a.m.</i>

200
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,107
Hey, it's 3 a.m.!

201
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,071
Should we wrap it up?

202
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,035
Let's drink until 4 a.m.

203
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,579
We have a lot of food left.

204
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,581
Right.

205
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,211
We can't throw these away, right?

206
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,695
You know <i>makgeolli</i>…

207
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,823
is like a black hole.

208
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,743
Once you start drinking,
you end up in a black hole.

209
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,916
You know…

210
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,299
I'm sorry about what I did
at the underpass.

211
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,720
I hugged you, remember?

212
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,097
You were flustered, right?

213
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,102
Don't apologize.

214
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,980
You were worried.

215
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,858
But…

216
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,988
after hugging you…

217
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,200
something got iffy.

218
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,662
My heart went like…

219
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,834
It went like this.

220
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,795
I couldn't tell…

221
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,299
if my heart pounded like that

222
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:17,513
because you were in danger
or because I had feelings for you.

223
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,439
I need to test this out.

224
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,446
Gosh, be careful.

225
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,616
I'm not that drunk.

226
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,458
Get up.

227
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,376
What?

228
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,003
-Get up.
-Why?

229
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:51,964
Okay.

230
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,265
I'm going to hug you for ten seconds.

231
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,851
Let's say I'm testing to see
if I have feelings for you.

232
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,271
Don't move.

233
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,190
Okay. I won't move.

234
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,317
Stay still.

235
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,443
Okay.

236
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,477
I was wrong.

237
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,856
It was because you were in danger earlier.

238
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,783
I'm so thirsty now.

239
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,668
Mr. Cassano, we have a lot of <i>makgeolli</i>
in the warehouse.

240
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,212
I would appreciate it if you brought them.

241
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,536
You're here.

242
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,914
Have you been well?

243
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,458
Yes. I've been well.

244
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,254
You seem tired.

245
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
I had a lot of work.

246
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,717
You should take it easy.

247
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,054
You don't want your handsome face
to get haggard.

248
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,480
You're eating your meals
and taking your medicine, right?

249
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,107
Of course.

250
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,527
Otherwise, you'd scold me again.

251
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,826
Your doctor told me the other day…

252
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,456
that you beat lung cancer 28 years ago.

253
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,375
Yes.

254
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,839
It seems the only thing I have
in this world isn't that healthy.

255
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,593
Did you not have any family…

256
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,054
back then?

257
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,309
I did. I had a son.

258
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,192
But my days were numbered,

259
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,652
so I had to send him away.

260
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,905
To where?

261
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,117
Very far away.

262
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:56,416
To a place where my son
would grow up happily.

263
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,255
Without his mom…

264
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,383
he wouldn't have been happy anywhere.

265
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,977
Mr. Hong told me a long time ago

266
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,689
that you accepted
the cancer and the sentence

267
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,276
because of your guilt
over abandoning your son.

268
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,701
I'm sure your son is doing well.

269
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,914
So don't feel guilty and get better.

270
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,209
Don't give up on yourself like this.

271
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,089
Okay?

272
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,758
Okay.

273
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,344
I'll do that.

274
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,889
I'll try.

275
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,743
Shouldn't we still come up
with some sort of plan?

276
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,541
Don't worry.

277
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,879
Vincenzo and Cha-young can never find me.

278
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,425
They won't get anything
from interrogating those three killers.

279
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,928
But wouldn't they come
after me and Ms. Choi

280
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,556
to find out who you are?

281
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,937
-Can you endure torture?
-What?

282
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,981
-"What?"
-Pardon? Sorry?

283
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,651
You know, like being hung
upside down and being electrocuted,

284
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,070
or being beat senselessly
with a baseball bat.

285
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,822
No. I cannot endure that kind of…

286
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,742
Yes. I can endure it.

287
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,120
Damn it.

288
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,164
They were my most useful hunting dogs.

289
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,751
It's hard to find hunting dogs like them.

290
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,795
Unless you want to have him stuffed
as a trophy,

291
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,840
we can just chase him away.

292
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,302
Why don't we handle
Vincenzo differently this time?

293
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,678
How?

294
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,847
Let's take the easy route.

295
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,645
There's the fact that
Vincenzo is in the Mafia.

296
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,649
-You were so cool.
-Stop that. You're embarrassing me.

297
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,860
-Gosh, it wasn't anything special.
-Can you teach me that?

298
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,111
Don't tell people…

299
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,780
Hey.

300
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,326
Vincenzo Cassano. Good morning.

301
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,244
Hello.

302
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,704
Wait.

303
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,460
When you need muscle
or help with getting your money back,

304
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,004
tell me anytime.

305
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:54,636
He beat up the thugs who came
to demolish the plaza yesterday.

306
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,429
He told us that he used to be called

307
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,683
Lightning Scissors of Chungju.

308
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,059
I see.

309
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,145
Good day.

310
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,607
What?

311
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,401
What kind of response was that?

312
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,319
Shouldn't he at least look surprised?

313
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,367
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

314
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,871
Mr. Cassano, I need to talk to you.

315
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,959
Please let me be your bodyguard.

316
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,168
Don't.

317
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,586
She says no.

318
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,297
You don't need to pay me.

319
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,174
I just want to help you.

320
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,136
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

321
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,389
I don't need a bodyguard.

322
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,932
No, you will need one.

323
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,268
He says he doesn't need one!

324
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,603
I'm not rich or well-educated,

325
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,064
but I would like to have a job
that is meaningful.

326
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,489
I want to help you with the talent I have

327
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,199
to bring down bad guys.

328
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,744
What if you get in trouble
and lose everything again?

329
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,996
When will we have babies then?

330
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,622
I'm not trying to lose anything.

331
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,251
I'm doing this because
I want to make Dal-rae proud of his dad.

332
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,461
How old are you?

333
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,547
Why are you trying to live life like
a Hong Kong action movie?

334
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,216
Should I let them have their way then?

335
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,677
I must show them
that I will put up a fight

336
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,222
no matter how insignificant I may be!

337
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,850
Okay. I got it. Let me think about it.

338
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,019
-Don't even think about it!
-Okay, I won't.

339
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,272
Mr. Cassano, please trust me
and let me be your bodyguard.

340
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,523
-Mr. Cassano.
-Come here.

341
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,276
Mr. Cassano.

342
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,862
Are you testing me right now?

343
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,405
Don't lift me above your head!

344
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,616
I'll leave you if you do!

345
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,377
Yes, Mr. Cho.

346
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,879
I tracked down the number you gave me,

347
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,381
but we have a problem.

348
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,718
<i>So the records
of Jang Han-seok's burner phone</i>

349
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,722
and the killers' phones have been erased
from the cell towers, right?

350
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,142
Yes. When he got to them,
they were erasing all the records.

351
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,353
Not everyone can do that.

352
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,313
I'm sure the higher-ups pressured them.

353
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,401
But luckily, we got the locations
of the last contact.

354
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,279
This is when I called Jang Han-seok
with the killer's phone.

355
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,447
Take a look.

356
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,288
Yang-dong, Giseong-gu, Seoul…

357
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,373
Yang-dong?

358
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,377
Wait, that's where the underpass is.

359
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,423
That means Jang Han-seok was near by then.

360
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,467
My gosh. Where was he hiding?

361
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,344
What a rat!

362
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,388
He's such a sly and annoying rat!

363
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,975
If this is our only lead,
how will we find Jang Han-seok?

364
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,733
-You come here often.
-Yes.

365
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:59,446
My chef has sent you some risotto today.

366
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,115
I feel bad taking free food.

367
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,451
We're having a meeting now.
We'll eat afterwards.

368
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,161
-Okay.
-Thank you.

369
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,875
I'll look into the routes people can take
to approach the underpass.

370
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,876
-You do that.
-Okay.

371
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,963
Isn't this crazy though?
He could have been watching us.

372
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,382
It means he was in the area.

373
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,802
Why are there two dishes?

374
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,181
You said not to bring yours the other day.

375
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,350
But, still…

376
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,229
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
to bring yours too next time.

377
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,399
Okay.

378
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,945
-Thanks.
-Sure. Sorry.

379
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,619
-Thanks.
-Sorry.

380
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,997
Thank you.

381
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,208
I'm sorry.

382
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,168
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

383
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,378
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

384
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,547
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

385
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,925
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you. Sorry.

386
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,676
-Thank you.
-Sure.

387
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,928
Thank you.

388
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,477
We can't track his phone's location.

389
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,854
There's nothing we can do for now.

390
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,316
This would be a piece of cake
for an intelligence agency.

391
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,905
An?

392
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,627
What are you doing?

393
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,212
-What's this?
-Don't touch that.

394
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,094
Bye.

395
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,349
NANYAK TEMPLE

396
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,856
Are you Jeokha?

397
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,815
Yes.

398
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,192
We're from
the Administrative Headquarters.

399
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,736
-I see. Hello.
-I see.

400
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,489
How may I help you?

401
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,284
Someone has blown the whistle
on Nanyak Temple

402
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,494
on the Jogye Order webpage.

403
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,830
A whistleblower?

404
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,666
What do you mean?

405
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,544
They said
you forced people to make hefty donations

406
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,045
and rarely held services.

407
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,046
Pardon?

408
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,506
This is not true.

409
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,425
-This is slander.
-I'm sorry.

410
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,261
But we must follow the protocol
and investigate.

411
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,305
-Please excuse us.
-What…

412
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,809
But…

413
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,728
Wait.

414
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,326
I'm feeling down.

415
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,580
I should have my vitamins.

416
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,543
Can I have one?

417
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,463
This is for women.
There's a different product for men.

418
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,673
I see. Okay.

419
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,968
You could've bought men's vitamins too.

420
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,643
To locate Jang Han-seok,

421
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,729
we need to pressure Wusang
or Chairman Jang Han-seo.

422
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,232
But I doubt we'll get anything from them.

423
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,069
We need to find someone
who knows Jang Han-seok's face.

424
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,904
That won't be easy to do.

425
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,782
Someone who knows…

426
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,241
Jeez!

427
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,328
Ms. Seo?

428
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,589
It's the monthly game day today.
I was wondering if you could attend.

429
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,137
The tenants get together
and play games to bond.

430
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,348
The losers buy lunch.

431
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,557
I see.

432
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,978
We skipped last month's game day
as there was a lot happening.

433
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,855
Why don't you all join us today?

434
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,524
What kind of game do you play?

435
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,692
Mafia.

436
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,820
Pardon?

437
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:17,453
Do you not know how to play Mafia?

438
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,208
I'm good.

439
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,669
You guys can go have fun.

440
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,262
Mr. Cassano. Please join us.

441
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,097
If you don't come,

442
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,017
I won't go either.

443
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,483
She really wants you to come.
Why don't you join us?

444
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,778
If you don't know the rules,
I'll explain them on our way.

445
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,405
-They are very simple.
-I said no.

446
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,573
Let's go play the game.

447
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,825
Let's go. We need something
to uplift our mood.

448
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:56,784
-I'm good.
-Let's go.

449
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,244
-Let's go. It's fun.
-Let's go.

450
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,746
-It'll be fun.
-I'm really good.

451
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,164
-I'm really good.
-Let's go.

452
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,832
-Come on.
-I said no!

453
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,880
It’s morning.

454
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,508
COP, CITIZEN, MAFIA, COP, MAFIA, CITIZEN

455
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,220
CITIZEN, CITIZEN, DOCTOR, CITIZEN, CITIZEN
CITIZEN, CITIZEN

456
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,890
Well, this is obvious.

457
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,059
Hey, Vincenzo Cassano.

458
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,687
You're a Mafia, right?

459
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,940
I also believe that
the handsome lawyer over there is a Mafia.

460
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,735
I'm not a Mafia.

461
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,322
<i>I think you are</i>

462
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,824
No, I'm not.
I don't look anything like a Mafia.

463
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,203
I think he's denying it because he is.

464
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,749
I don't think Mr. Cassano is a Mafia.

465
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,043
Hold on.

466
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,045
He must also be a Mafia.

467
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,340
You can tell by the way he smiles.

468
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,176
Gosh. I think
that pawnshop lady is a Mafia.

469
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,011
Look at her face. She looks sly.

470
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,387
That's just how I look.

471
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,849
I think the owner of Byebye Balloon
is in the Mafia.

472
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,520
By the way, who invited
the Byebye Balloon guys?

473
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,940
We just figured we should come
since we're family now.

474
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,483
-Don't you agree?
-Right.

475
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,484
I think…

476
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,904
That Park Saeroyi wannabe is a Mafia.

477
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,114
Don't call me that!

478
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,826
Look who's talking.
You look like a North Korean soldier.

479
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,744
I don't look like that at all.

480
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,871
You rebel scum!

481
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,040
What? "Rebel scum"?

482
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,959
All right. Stop it.

483
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,045
We must vote now. It's nighttime.

484
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,463
Okay. Put your heads down.

485
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,966
-Put your heads down.
-Seriously.

486
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,738
Excuse us.

487
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,701
Excuse us!

488
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,413
What? We're closed.

489
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,623
Who's Mr. Vincenzo Cassano?

490
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,333
It's me. What is this about?

491
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,004
I'm from the International Crimes Division
of Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

492
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,049
You're under arrest for attempted murder,
aiding and abetting, and blackmail.

493
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,510
You have the right to consult an attorney,

494
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,763
explain yourself,
and to a writ of habeas corpus.

495
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,391
What are you talking about?

496
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,767
You're in the Italian Mafia.

497
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,020
You're a consigliere.

498
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:33,065
Yes, we're looking for the Mafia members,
but this is a game.

499
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,526
-It's not real. It's a game.
-Arrest him.

500
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,906
Get up.

501
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,118
-My goodness.
-What? Is this true?

502
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,328
-What's happening?
-What?

503
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,746
Finish your game.

504
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,333
You can represent me.

505
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,084
-Come with me.
-Isn't this a game?

506
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,502
He's really leaving.

507
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,297
-I'm coming with you as his lawyer.
-What?

508
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,673
-What?
-No!

509
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,677
Where are you going?

510
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,389
He's in the Mafia.

511
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,244
My cell phone was vibrating
inside my jacket.

512
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,290
I thought I was in a horror movie.

513
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,544
You really dodged a bullet.

514
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,631
You know what? Whatever they try,

515
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,093
they can't find me. Never.

516
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,433
-Sir.
-Yes.

517
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,145
How about you entrust me

518
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,315
with Babel Pharmaceuticals?

519
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,278
You want to run the company
without my interference?

520
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,322
No. That's not what I meant.

521
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,285
I have learned a lot from you,

522
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,454
so I think I can do it by myself.

523
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,373
Right.

524
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,042
I bet you have your own ideas, too.

525
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,627
No!

526
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,548
Should I slit your throat,
so you stop thinking?

527
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,260
Sir. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

528
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,013
No. Maybe I should die.

529
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,098
Sir! No!

530
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,225
That way, Babel will be yours.

531
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,242
Sir. I'm so sorry.

532
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,204
I just wanted to lessen your burden.
That's all.

533
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,747
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,210
My burden isn't Babel Pharmaceuticals.

535
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,130
It's you.

536
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,761
I'll never ask something like that again.
I'm sorry.

537
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,598
If you ask me something like that again,
I swear…

538
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,561
I'll kill you.

539
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,189
I mean it, my brother.

540
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,090
Gosh, I lost my temper again.

541
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,099
From now on, I will think more carefully
before I speak.

542
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,478
I'll get going first.

543
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,107
Finish your breakfast.

544
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,235
I lost my appetite because of you.

545
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,177
Oh, no!

546
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,512
I've acted so cheeky with him.

547
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,139
It's so embarrassing!

548
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,643
I saw it in movies. The Mafia is so cruel.

549
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,604
They kill people with guns

550
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,981
-and hang people in front of their houses.
-Right.

551
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,817
What did I tell you?
I told you he wasn't ordinary.

552
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,655
By the way, when he was getting arrested,
they said he was a corn salad.

553
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,032
What does that mean?

554
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,700
Toto told me…

555
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,496
that's what they call
the top Mafia member. Corn Salad.

556
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,040
What a savory and refreshing title.

557
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:46,003
You know what?
Why don't we ask him for help?

558
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,756
-With what?
-With finding the gold.

559
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,091
They are real pros at stuff like this.

560
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,176
That's right.

561
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,345
We're not getting anywhere.

562
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,599
Then let's tell him about the gold bars.

563
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,435
I'm sure he will give us a solution.

564
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,981
Then let's tell him we'll give him
a small cut and get him to help us.

565
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,692
But he was arrested.
He can't help us from prison.

566
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,820
Why did the prosecutors from Namdongbu
arrest Vincenzo?

567
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,032
I think he's being set up
by Wusang, Babel, and Namdongbu.

568
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,244
I knew his mess would catch up with him.

569
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,914
Stay out of this. It's a headache.

570
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,918
No. We must take Vincenzo Cassano
from them and handle him ourselves.

571
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,796
Forget it. We won't get anything from it.

572
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,548
Let them handle him.

573
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,677
Sir.

574
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,098
Don't you have any pride?

575
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,099
Pride?

576
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,892
Why are you bringing that up now?

577
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:47,231
Clearly, the head of the International
Crimes Division in Korea is you.

578
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,486
But those people in Namdongbu ignored you
and handled this on their own.

579
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,407
Small-time prosecutors who know
nothing about international crimes.

580
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,119
By taking Vincenzo from them,
we will clearly show them who's in charge

581
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:04,290
and that the head
of this whole operation is you.

582
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,209
He's right!

583
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,880
Thank you, ma'am!

584
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,969
Director Tae.

585
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:21,849
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

586
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,770
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

587
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,482
Bring him here now.

588
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,402
We'll deal with Vincenzo.

589
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,738
Director Tae.

590
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,906
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

591
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,994
-Director Tae.
-Director Tae.

592
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,787
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Director Tae.

593
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,256
The consigliere of the Cassano Family.

594
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,596
Look at these bodies.

595
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,644
You sure know
how to work your knife, don't you?

596
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,105
How many people did you kill?

597
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,611
Arresting him without any definite
evidence is a violation of the law.

598
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,238
Here's the evidence.

599
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:23,410
These photos show no ties to Mr. Cassano.

600
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,330
And you need more than a few photos
to arrest him.

601
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,668
I have more than a few photos.

602
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,255
You've been causing
a lot of trouble these days.

603
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,758
Given the circumstances,

604
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,844
you will be subject to deportation.

605
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,514
If the grounds for deportation are clear.

606
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,974
I can make whatever grounds I want.

607
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,393
That again?

608
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,398
Predetermine the punishment
and fabricating evidence?

609
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,279
Watch your tone.

610
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,242
Please, escort them out.

611
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,077
You can't do this!

612
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,541
Let's go.

613
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,556
Sit tight. I'll do whatever I can.

614
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,391
It's fine.

615
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,602
I can take care of myself.

616
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,063
-Go.
-Let's go.

617
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,859
Wait!

618
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,053
An?

619
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,504
Who are you?

620
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,299
I'm from the International
Organized Crime Bureau

621
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,635
of the International Security
Intelligence Service.

622
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,846
I'm Team Leader An Gi-seok.

623
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,057
AN GI-SEOK

624
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,475
No way.

625
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,771
I'm here to take Vincenzo Cassano
into our custody.

626
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,398
But we're the ones who caught him.

627
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,610
Please cooperate
so that Vincenzo Cassano can

628
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,445
cooperate with our bureau.

629
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,988
The cause is confidential,

630
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,909
and you will hand over
all the evidence you have as well.

631
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,998
This is our warrant for his custody
from the Ministry of Justice.

632
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,091
Hey…

633
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,605
Let's go, Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

634
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,649
Ms. Hong Cha-young.

635
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,707
You little… Damn it.

636
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,543
Why you…

637
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,795
<i>The International Security
Intelligence Service?</i>

638
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:07,092
Yes. They took him because they had to
keep an eye on him for national security.

639
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,052
What? Why would they…

640
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,557
Why would they want him?

641
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,102
I don't know what it is exactly,

642
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,522
but I'm sure there's something big
behind this.

643
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,569
I think you should pay more attention
to keeping your identity concealed.

644
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,779
We're up against an intelligence agency.

645
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,199
When it comes to intel,
they're better than us.

646
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,326
That's what they do.

647
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,494
Right. You have a point.

648
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,750
My gosh. Do you think Vincenzo
could be a spy or something?

649
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,127
-He must be a spy.
-That's what she just said.

650
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,637
So…

651
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,098
you've been surveilling me the whole time?

652
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,808
I'm sorry.

653
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,311
It was my mission, so I had no choice.

654
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,438
I know everything you've been up to

655
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,400
including your attempt to find out
who Chairman Jang Han-seok is.

656
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,654
Then, how come you didn't do anything?

657
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,573
I would have arrested you
if you violated the law.

658
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,243
But Mr. Consigliere
fought for justice, the weak,

659
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,080
and Buddha.

660
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,290
So I didn't do anything.

661
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,126
I see. Buddha was one of them.

662
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,338
What do you plan to do with me?

663
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,841
I take it you will continue
to fight against Babel. Am I correct?

664
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:30,759
Yes.

665
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:38,141
I'm on your side. I want to help you.

666
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,228
No, listen. This makes no sense right now.

667
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,854
Will you really help us?

668
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,274
Yes. I will help you
for the good of our country and justice.

669
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,943
As you know, I'm in the Mafia,

670
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,654
and you work for an intelligence agency.

671
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,699
That doesn't matter.
I respect you, Mr. Consigliere.

672
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,866
Why?

673
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,079
Because you repented your past sins
and are devoted to fighting evil.

674
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,967
Then we'll gladly accept your help.

675
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,802
-It's settled, then.
-Deal.

676
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,179
But I have three conditions.

677
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,932
-Gosh. Three?
-Number one.

678
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:23,270
you must include me
as an official member of your group.

679
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,355
-Okay.
-Number two.

680
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,108
Keep my identity secret
from the other tenants.

681
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,484
Okay.

682
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,402
Number three.

683
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,118
-Give me a hug.
-Okay.

684
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,286
What?

685
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,373
-What?
-It's embarrassing to say this…

686
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,169
but it's just such a huge honor.

687
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,548
He said it's a huge honor. Come on.
Give the man a hug.

688
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,091
What are you talking about?

689
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,145
How about a handshake instead?

690
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:12,944
Good.

691
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,918
Okay, but you're too close.

692
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,878
I can't believe…

693
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,591
that I'm in the presence
of a real consigliere.

694
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,804
I have no regrets now, Mr. Consigliere.

695
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,768
These photos…

696
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,229
It's the evidence we got
from the Namdongbu Office.

697
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,605
What is it, Mr. Consigliere?

698
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,775
-Oh, my God.
-What's the matter?

699
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,152
These photos are…

700
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,241
probably from the man
Jang Han-seok sent to Italy.

701
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,910
A prosecutor can't get these photos.

702
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:05,705
What if he gave Jang Han-seok
these photos in person?

703
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:10,252
It's highly likely that he saw his face.

704
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,129
Gosh. I got goosebumps.

705
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,802
If we can find this informant,

706
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,304
we can get to Jang Han-seok.

707
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,722
We should find him then.

708
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,850
-An.
-Yes?

709
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,018
I mean, Mr. An.

710
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,481
You can help me with this, right?

711
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,191
Of course.

712
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,527
Thank you. See you later.

713
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,072
Thank you. Let's go, Ms. Hong.

714
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,242
I'll look forward to working with you.
See you at the plaza.

715
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,370
I'm rooting for you, Mr. Consigliere!

716
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,124
Always! We can do this!

717
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,589
The Korean man

718
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,758
who was asking about you?

719
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,676
Yes.

720
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,304
See if you can get a photo
or a video of him.

721
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,557
I heard he met with Giorgio
at Hotel Caruso.

722
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,851
I'll look into the security cameras there.

723
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,519
Do it as soon as possible.

724
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,733
How long do you think it'll take?

725
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,569
Three or four hours will suffice.

726
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,808
WELCOME BACK
MAFIA'S CORN SALAD VINCENZO!

727
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,905
-I'll just leave.
-No way.

728
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,868
Mr. Cassano! This way!

729
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,953
Okay.

730
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,797
A hero of Geumga Plaza is born.

731
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,839
Come on.

732
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,759
Is this a wedding hall? What is all this?

733
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,491
Let us welcome

734
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:50,620
the return of the great Mafia,
Corn Salad Vincenzo!

735
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,501
Everyone wants to hug you today.

736
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:00,255
-We want a strong leader!
-Yes!

737
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,259
We don't want a weak leader
who's all talk and no action.

738
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,721
-The Mafia have their turf, right?
-Right.

739
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,556
Make our plaza your turf.

740
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,433
-Yes.
-You're our Corn Salad.

741
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,270
Please, lead us

742
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,521
so we can fight back harder.

743
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,564
Well…

744
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,483
What we need is the ability to fight,
not peace.

745
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:24,696
I'm so happy that you are in the Mafia.

746
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,198
-Let's do this, Corn Salad!
-Corn Salad!

747
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,951
-Corn Salad!
-Corn Salad!

748
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,536
-Corn Salad.
-Wait.

749
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,788
It's not a Corn Salad.

750
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,749
It's consigliere.

751
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,666
-What?
-What?

752
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,627
You said Corn Salad was the title
for the scariest Mafia member.

753
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,879
-Corn Salad?
-Hey.

754
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:46,384
Well, I said it was consigliere.

755
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,469
Let's move on.

756
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,137
A round of applause!

757
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,605
You're supposed to eat tofu
after your release.

758
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,814
I'm good.

759
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,275
-No.
-No. You have to eat it.

760
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,069
-Just one bite.
-You have to.

761
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,320
Take a bite.

762
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,325
-Isn't it great?
-Good!

763
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,327
Gosh.

764
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,162
I'm glad that we didn't cross him.

765
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,831
We could have really died.

766
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,918
He won't try to get back at us, right?

767
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,797
He won't
because we already look so pathetic.

768
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,173
Consigliere.

769
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,138
I'm glad that you got out.

770
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,183
I feel like I'm one of the residents
in Jongno,

771
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,186
welcoming Kim Du-han on his release.

772
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,271
"Stand up, Du-han.

773
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,649
Du-han, you're the pride of Joseon!

774
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,567
No. Get up! You must!

775
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,485
You are…"

776
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,945
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

777
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,030
-That's enough.
-Okay.

778
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,450
With all the support you have,
why don't you make your own family here?

779
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,619
Geumga Family, Mr. Corn Salad.

780
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,667
Yes?

781
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,171
It's Luca.

782
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,756
-Luca.
-Luca.

783
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,726
He's super-fast.

784
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,895
Professionals sure are different.

785
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,566
He really is a Mafia.

786
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:36,661
By the way, will we be able to find out
who he is only with this video?

787
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,510
-Can you find out who he is?
-Gosh.

788
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,638
This is a piece of cake.

789
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,893
How long will this take?

790
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,396
Five hours will be more than enough.

791
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,940
That's pretty impressive.

792
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,069
Then again,
think about all the taxes we pay.

793
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,285
What are you doing, An? Get their order.

794
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:21,206
Okay. Truffle porcini spaghetti.

795
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,207
Okay.

796
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,334
Kimchi fried rice.

797
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,253
Okay. They want kimchi fried rice.

798
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,214
Kimchi fried rice.

799
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,258
Wait. Who orders kimchi fried rice
at a pasta restaurant?

800
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,817
You were here, Mr. Cassano.

801
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,445
Hello.

802
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,822
What's the matter?

803
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,825
I WANT TO REPORT A CORRUPT TEMPLE

804
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,791
And you don't know who posted this online?

805
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,961
It was anonymous.
So they couldn't tell us who wrote this.

806
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,547
This is defamation.

807
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,550
If it's a false accusation,
we can sue them for compensation.

808
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,303
What happens
if you can't prove this is not true?

809
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,973
We will be suspended, and the temple…

810
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:22,976
might have to close down.

811
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,228
This is so unfair.

812
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,566
He's been devoted to the teachings
of Buddha all his life.

813
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,819
First, we must find out
who wrote such lies online.

814
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:54,799
By the way, Mr. Jang, it's very loud.
Are you sure this is okay?

815
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,219
Hunting is allowed in the nearby
mountains. I can shoot here.

816
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,345
I see.

817
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,642
-Damn it.
-You're not even that far,

818
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,436
but you can't hit your target.

819
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,313
Well, that's because…

820
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,148
You should try it. Go ahead.

821
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,858
-Me?
-Yes. Do it.

822
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,735
Okay. All right.

823
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,486
-I'll try it. Okay.
-Go ahead.

824
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,989
Gosh. I'm kind of embarrassed.

825
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:20,575
-Just do it.
-Okay.

826
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,506
What was that?

827
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:39,719
I was the best marksman
during my military service.

828
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,348
The gun is working fine.

829
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,733
How did he do that?

830
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,246
My brother has

831
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,125
no intention of
putting me in charge of Babel.

832
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,129
Vincenzo keeps outsmarting him.
He's not that good, either.

833
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,924
Well…

834
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,927
Vincenzo has had the upper hand lately.

835
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,930
Like the incident at the underpass.

836
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:27,266
Exactly. He would've been killed
if he'd been caught there.

837
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,938
I wish he was caught.

838
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,321
That's what you really want, right?

839
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,742
-No, what I meant was…
-You want to oust your brother

840
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,120
and run Babel by yourself, right?

841
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,335
Don't say stuff like that.

842
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,671
But you are worried
about the aftermath, right?

843
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,632
You don't know how to run the company
without your brother.

844
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,510
Don't worry.

845
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,389
I will support you, so Babel can run
smoothly like a well-oiled machine.

846
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,921
Will Ms. Choi Myung-hee back me up too?

847
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,214
Ms. Choi…

848
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,510
isn't the type to take risks.

849
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,220
Forget her, then.

850
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,520
But…

851
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,150
-do you really think I can do this?
-Of course.

852
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,695
I'll risk my life to serve you.

853
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,741
You and I aren't some moths
flying into fire knowing they'll die.

854
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,452
We will be phoenixes instead.

855
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,380
Then let's come up with a plan…

856
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,510
without anyone knowing.

857
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,318
Damn it.

858
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,173
Mr. Cassano.

859
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,849
The issue Nanyak Temple's having…

860
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,228
Did you do it?

861
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,146
Yes.

862
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,358
Wait, what? Well, that's…

863
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,444
I wanted to get the gold
out of there quickly.

864
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:32,994
I'm sorry.

865
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,957
I should apologize.

866
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,669
I've been taking too much time.
You must've been frustrated.

867
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,297
No, I was rash.

868
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,799
I shouldn't have done that.
I was just impatient.

869
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,805
Let's discuss it before we do anything
just like we've been doing.

870
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,434
We're friends.

871
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,145
Yes. I understand, Mr. Cassano.

872
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,648
It won't happen ever again.

873
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,403
Write on the bulletin board
that your accusations were false.

874
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,780
We can't do that to the monks.

875
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,742
I'll post a correction.

876
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,411
Please do. I'll get going.

877
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,121
Okay.

878
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,354
Mr. Corn Salad.

879
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,855
We need to talk.

880
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,819
What did you just say?

881
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,237
Gold!

882
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,406
-"Gold"?
-Gold.

883
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,868
We received information

884
01:05:55,952 --> 01:06:00,873
that there is 12 billion won's worth
of gold bars hidden in this building.

885
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,251
But we don't know the exact location.

886
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,380
We've searched every corner
of the building for a month.

887
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,966
Who told you that there's gold here?

888
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,551
A neighborhood beggar, Gilbert.

889
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,512
I see.

890
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,764
A homeless guy.

891
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,391
Isn't this your specialty?

892
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,813
Does everyone at the plaza
know about this?

893
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,399
Yes. Except for you three
from Jipuragi Law Firm.

894
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,068
If you help us,

895
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,238
we'll all chip in and give you a cut.

896
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:36,993
Hey!

897
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,869
Why are you so rude?

898
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,664
I wasn't being rude.

899
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,168
Gosh! There's gold in this building!

900
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,086
-Yes.
-Yes.

901
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,713
There's gold here?

902
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:52,049
-Gosh. Who knew I'd see gold bars?
-Mr. Cassano.

903
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,928
-Be quiet.
-Okay.

904
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,973
Okay. I'm sorry.

905
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:00,599
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

906
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,810
-By the way…
-Yes?

907
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:05,104
…how is that gold yours?

908
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,897
It must belong to someone.

909
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,650
Finders keepers.

910
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,278
Right, my keeper?

911
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,780
That was witty.

912
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,783
-That's so funny.
-I'm good, aren't I?

913
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,539
Please help us.

914
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,126
Okay. Bye.

915
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,845
How dare they think it's theirs?
How dare they?

916
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,886
What's this?

917
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,453
REPORT ON KIM SANG-YUN

918
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,331
PERSONAL INFORMATION ON KIM SANG-YUN

919
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,166
<i>Kim Sang-yun, 41 years old.</i>

920
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,919
A former VP
of a multi-national arms company, DO Arms.

921
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:55,714
He's working as a weapon lobbyist
and an informant in Europe now.

922
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,343
No wonder his intel was good.

923
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,762
But I'm glad that he's in Korea.

924
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:06,308
Let's start looking
for Jang Han-seok again.

925
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:12,898
What is it?

926
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,277
We should meet today.
I've got important information.

927
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,444
<i>Stop lying.</i>

928
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,863
I'm serious.

929
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,866
Babel Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals
won't compensate the victims.

930
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:22,783
What?

931
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,496
Okay.

932
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,542
I'll go meet Joon-woo.

933
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,919
Find out who Jang Han-seok is.

934
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:34,920
Okay.

935
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:04,575
Who are you?

936
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,357
Yes, I did those things,

937
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,277
but you only collected
negative information.

938
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:42,947
Jang Han-seok will get the wrong idea.

939
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,493
I made a lot of donations
and saved a lot of people.

940
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:56,085
Will I end up killing you or…

941
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,463
sparing you?

942
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,257
Just kill me.

943
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,551
You want to know
who Jang Han-seok is, right?

944
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,345
But I cannot tell you.

945
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,889
Even if I save myself
by telling you who he is,

946
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,724
I'll be dead in a week.

947
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,020
What if I find you a way
for you to survive?

948
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,146
It won't work.

949
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,023
And I don't trust you.

950
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,782
So you'll keep your secret
and stay loyal to him.

951
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:31,912
What a fine lobbyist.

952
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,541
I've been tortured by the Russian Mafia,
terrorists, and rebels.

953
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,335
This isn't my first rodeo.

954
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,672
I can endure all kinds of pain
you throw at me.

955
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,803
I guess you don't know this.

956
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,766
There's a limit to pain,

957
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,062
but there's no limit to one's fear.

958
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,611
The first round is a tie.

959
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,363
Round two.

960
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,824
I'll go first this time.

961
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,912
Wait.

962
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,628
The second round is also a tie.

963
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:05,839
Round three.

964
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,425
I'll go first again.

965
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:21,146
The third round is also a tie.

966
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,564
Round four.

967
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:29,238
Stop. Stop it! I'll tell you everything.

968
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,450
I'll tell you who Jang Han-seok is.

969
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,494
He's…

970
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,621
He's a lawyer at Wusang.

971
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:44,378
<i>His name at Wusang is</i>…

972
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,381
<i>Jang Joon-woo.</i>

973
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,351
Give me the intel now.

974
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:14,283
I'll show you this document
in exchange for information about you.

975
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:16,326
Hey, you can't do that.

976
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,578
Forget it then.

977
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,330
Okay.

978
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,796
REPORT ON BABEL'S
COMPENSATION WITHDRAWAL

979
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,132
This is the report
from Choi Myung-hee to Mr. Han.

980
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,176
I got it from the bin
in the boss's office.

981
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,846
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CAUSE TO COMPENSATE…

982
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,390
Babel Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals
will make an announcement

983
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,017
on withdrawing their
compensation next week.

984
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,063
But Chairman Jang Han-seo promised
to compensate them on TV.

985
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,858
Damn it. Those assholes!

986
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,695
All right. You tell me something
about what you're up to.

987
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,034
<i>Yes.</i>

988
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,162
Just listen. Don't say anything.

989
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:05,417
Jang Joon-woo is…

990
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:09,671
Jang Han-seok.

991
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,847
<i>Jang Joon-woo, your junior and intern,</i>

992
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:23,602
<i>was Jang Han-seok all along.</i>

993
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,076
What will you do?

994
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,539
You'll stick to the plan, right?

995
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,067
Jang Joon-woo.

996
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,883
Mr. Cassano?

997
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,065
Kneel.

998
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,151
-What's going on?
-Kneel.

999
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:56,695
Do it.

1000
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:02,117
Can you tell me

1001
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,829
what's going on here?

1002
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,139
That's enough.

1003
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,934
Jang Han-seok.

1004
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,694
Damn it.

1005
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,613
You got me.

1006
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,203
How did you find out?

1007
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:47,996
You can hide the fire,

1008
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,581
but you can't hide the smoke.

1009
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,458
I guess there was still some smoke left

1010
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:54,836
even when I had the fan on high.

1011
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,050
Say your last prayer.

1012
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,219
I don't pray.

1013
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,402
Kill me already.

1014
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:21,113
You Mafia bastard.

1015
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,412
As you wish.

1016
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,940
<i>It's time for you to make a decision.</i>

1017
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,902
<i>I guess a war broke out.</i>

1018
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:47,199
I heard that you're ready to bring
all six charges against the Babel Group.

1019
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,035
The entire country will be in an uproar
if this is exposed.

1020
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,579
I'll help you kill my brother as you wish

1021
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,706
<i>so just leave me and Babel alone.</i>

1022
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,334
<i>If you choose the wrong one,</i>

1023
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,295
you'll end up falling to your death.

1024
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:03,507
<i>I really am going to kill you soon.
Run if you're afraid.</i>

1025
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,258
<i>I'll follow you there too.</i>

1026
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:11,598
