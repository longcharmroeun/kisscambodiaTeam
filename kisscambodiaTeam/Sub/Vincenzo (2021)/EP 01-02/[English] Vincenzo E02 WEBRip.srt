1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,170
You jerk.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,926
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

3
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,845
If you take one more step…

4
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:27,933
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

5
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,310
Just stay still.

6
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:32,062
Everyone, stay still.

7
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:36,317
Babel E&C bought this building
through an illegal means.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,110
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

9
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:39,320
Now!

10
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,407
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

11
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,328
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

12
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:53,042
This building belongs to me.

13
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:56,295
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

14
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:57,713
-What?
-What did he say?

15
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:58,964
He said…

16
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:05,387
<i>È mio!</i>

17
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,056
<i>È mio!</i>

18
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,896
Take your men and get lost.
Then, I'll help you back up.

19
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,272
I'll get lost. Help me up.

20
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:17,191
-What?
-I'll leave, so help me up.

21
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,485
-Promise me.
-Seriously. I promise.

22
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:20,653
Do I really need to?

23
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:22,571
Okay. I can't straighten my finger.

24
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,157
-This hurts. Oh, my finger.
-Stamp it.

25
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,659
You cruel bastard.

26
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,077
Come on. I stamped it.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,620
Help me up. Hurry.

28
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,830
Go on. Help him.

29
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:35,125
Bring me up! Hurry up!

30
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,710
Boss!

31
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,048
Be careful.

32
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:43,384
-Goodness!
-It hurts!

33
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:45,052
-Boss, are you okay?
-Hey!

34
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,054
Boss, are you all right?

35
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,265
Oh, no! You're bleeding!

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,478
This could leave a scar.

37
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,814
This could leave a scar. Damn it.

38
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:03,279
-Kill that bastard.
-Grab your weapons.

39
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:05,948
I know you're a lowlife punk,

40
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,368
but aren't you breaking your promise
way too soon?

41
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:11,453
Let's go!

42
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:17,251
Hey! Stop it! Stop right there.

43
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,128
-What?
-Seriously?

44
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,755
Mr. Park, you should leave.

45
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,173
There are reporters outside.

46
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:24,633
Reporters? Why?

47
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:26,677
How should I know?

48
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,387
All right.

49
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,390
-Let's quickly disperse.
-Leave.

50
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:32,891
-What?
-Get lost.

51
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,478
Hey. Hey!

52
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,189
Stay right there.

53
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:42,067
I'll hang you from this very plaza soon.

54
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:44,236
Damn it!

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,155
Damn it, this scar!

56
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,867
-Goodness.
-Those bastards.

57
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,785
What was that?

58
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,120
We should talk.

59
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,169
Gosh.

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,839
Didn't I tell you not to fool around?

61
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,924
I wasn't fooling around.

62
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:09,011
I told you Mr. Cho was threatened
to sign the contract.

63
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:11,430
"Threatened"? Gosh.

64
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:13,349
That was quite a stunt you put up there.

65
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:15,559
You guys are amazing.

66
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:16,935
Why are you so childish?

67
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,354
Why won't you…

68
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,732
Why won't he trust me?

69
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,736
Seeing how you're speaking Italian,
you must feel guilty.

70
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,446
Shut up!

71
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,490
It sounds like you're cursing.

72
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:33,202
Think about it.

73
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,413
Why would I still be here
if I sold this building?

74
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:38,666
I'd take the money and go abroad.

75
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,334
-That's true.
-Be quiet!

76
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:45,506
Go back to your country
and stop inconveniencing us.

77
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,425
Babel E&C, Babel Pharmaceuticals,
and Law Firm Wusang

78
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:49,843
are all garbage.

79
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,428
Leave. All of you.

80
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:54,431
Somehow, I got caught in the crossfire.
Unbelievable.

81
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,225
I don't expect you to believe me.

82
00:03:56,934 --> 00:04:00,020
I'm going to get this building back.

83
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,735
That's impossible.

84
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,612
The contract has been signed already.

85
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,577
How may I help you?

86
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm a reporter from HBN.

87
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,747
I'd like to meet with…

88
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,460
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.
He gave us the tip. Is he here?

89
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:25,462
He called you here?

90
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,553
Sir.

91
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,974
What a surprise.
You even called the reporters.

92
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,225
EPISODE 2

93
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:41,311
However, there's something
I just can't wrap my head around.

94
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,068
Why would you get worked up over this
even more so than your client?

95
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:49,778
The building was sold at a high price,

96
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:51,613
so you'll be getting a hefty sum.

97
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,492
Putting aside the money,
wouldn't this upset anyone?

98
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,410
Not at all.

99
00:04:56,493 --> 00:05:00,789
Lawyers don't usually involve themselves
in matters like these.

100
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:03,292
European lawyers are quite strict
about these things.

101
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,877
What are you trying to say?

102
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,089
My experience tells me
that there's more to this.

103
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,133
A reason enough to make them act this way.

104
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,301
So…

105
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,348
What could that be?

106
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:21,226
Beats me.

107
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:26,190
But it must be something
that's more valuable than the building.

108
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,378
I saw this coming.

109
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,839
Those show-offs in flashy suits

110
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,925
are all the same.

111
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:54,676
Six days is nowhere enough.

112
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,679
I ought to put him in a guillotine choke
for 11 days straight.

113
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:00,474
Can you please sit down and talk?

114
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:01,725
Sit down.

115
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:05,854
He robbed us blind, didn't he?

116
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,814
I said we shouldn't trust him

117
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,233
and his good looks!

118
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:11,026
I knew it when he badmouthed my food.

119
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:13,278
It's obvious that I'm older than him,

120
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:14,780
but he spoke casually to me.

121
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:18,325
This Booralro or Vincenzo guy
is more heinous than the building owner.

122
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:22,246
You're right. He totally deceived us.

123
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,082
Should I go teach him a lesson?

124
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:29,419
How about I slam that face of his
on the ground?

125
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,255
Should I fling him to the ground?

126
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,297
Gosh.

127
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:35,384
I get that you're upset,
but you shouldn't hurt his face.

128
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,804
You should stop high-fiving the ground
whenever you're drunk.

129
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:41,848
Why are we always the ones
to get robbed blind?

130
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:44,434
We're not that stupid.

131
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,395
But we're not that smart, either.

132
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:48,272
You still don't know the times table.

133
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:49,439
I can't believe you.

134
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:53,277
I even got a new stamp
to seal the agreement.

135
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:58,448
Aren't Italian men
supposed to be gentlemen?

136
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:03,036
Not at all. They slack off
and are terrific liars.

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,081
They distract people
with their hand gestures.

138
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:09,376
-What should we do?
-You can…

139
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,045
You can just move to another temple.

140
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:16,216
Not at all. We will stay by your side
until the end.

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,178
I'll need to verify whether
he has truly deceived us or not.

142
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:22,556
Look what happened.
What's the point of that?

143
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,309
We already lost our building.

144
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:28,270
He was the one who called the reporters.

145
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,480
What's his plan? Why is he confusing us?

146
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:32,399
I'll make a thorough evaluation

147
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,152
on whether he's on our side or not.

148
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:40,532
Higher.

149
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,370
Okay, get ready.

150
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:48,081
Good.

151
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:55,547
-Four. Turn your waist. One, two, three.
-That's it.

152
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:56,840
All right. Two.

153
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:59,301
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

154
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,139
Our dear Deputy Minister Lee Nam-su.

155
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,525
All right.

156
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,906
So…

157
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:24,910
Just say that you, Minister Park Dae-jin,

158
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:28,747
and President Kim Song-hyeon
of JT Investment…

159
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,458
The three of you had some sushi

160
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,711
at a restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.
That's all I need from you.

161
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:37,464
What kind of story will you concoct
with the reporters

162
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:39,591
this time around?

163
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:42,678
Gosh. That's hurtful to hear.

164
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:45,305
I'm here to protect you.

165
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:48,392
I'm not going to reveal this to the public
or call any reporters.

166
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:51,978
You're planning to use JT Investment
to get to the top.

167
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,815
-I can't let you do that.
-Sir.

168
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:56,650
Do you know what my specialty is?

169
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:01,113
I can turn the most heartfelt stories
into the most heinous ones.

170
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,156
Is that so?

171
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,828
You don't believe me.

172
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,082
Minister Kim Ui-pyeong from Cheongbaek-ri

173
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:16,253
who had 1.07 billion won in debt
and no house to his name.

174
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,506
Who do you think accused him

175
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,010
of illegally accumulating two billion won
and made him end up

176
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,054
-killing himself?
-Look here, Ms. Choi!

177
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:28,223
Sir, you see,

178
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:33,729
I'm the person who can find faults
in the most innocent people.

179
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,439
Wait and see.

180
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,858
I'm sorry, sir.

181
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,527
Don't say that.

182
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:45,198
I'm glad your family's safe.

183
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:49,077
The plaza…

184
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,665
The plaza building.

185
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,294
If Babel E&C demolishes it,
they'll find out.

186
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,632
You have to demolish it before they do.

187
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,638
<i>But there's more.</i>

188
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:12,184
<i>That secret room comes
with a special feature.</i>

189
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,103
3 YEARS AGO

190
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:16,480
What is it?

191
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,191
It has to do
with the structure of the room.

192
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:22,819
The room will be touching
the building's columns and the beams

193
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:26,948
and will be equipped with
a device that amplifies impact.

194
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,077
When the room is put
under a considerable impact,

195
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:34,372
the impact will cause the columns
and the beams to crack,

196
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,042
and the building will collapse.

197
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:49,012
<i>If anyone tries to break in
to steal the gold,</i>

198
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:54,559
<i>the building itself</i>

199
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,312
<i>will be their graveyard.</i>

200
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,690
<i>And there is one more important thing.</i>

201
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:03,068
You must get rid of everyone

202
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:06,279
who has built that room
or is aware of its existence.

203
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:11,618
<i>Except for Mr. Cho and me, of course.</i>

204
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:19,793
For anyone apart from you
to get that gold,

205
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:21,878
the building…

206
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:26,883
will have to be demolished.

207
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,470
The family will gift you the blueprint

208
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:33,223
as proof of our friendship.

209
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:36,393
1 YEAR AGO

210
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,738
WANG SHAOLIN, A CHINESE TYCOON,
DIES OF CARDIAC ARREST AFTER A SWIM

211
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,129
Does his family know
about the secret room?

212
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:05,046
10 MONTHS AGO

213
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,174
No. It's just the three of us who know.

214
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:12,846
Given his nature,
I'm certain he didn't tell anyone.

215
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,184
Mr. Cho.

216
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,438
Care to make
some retirement money with me?

217
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:24,399
3 MONTHS AGO

218
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:31,364
<i>Babel E&C has begun purchasing
the shops and residences around the area.</i>

219
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:35,118
They also contacted me. What should I do?

220
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,621
Tell them that you're going to rebuild it.

221
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:40,665
We only need two days
after the construction begins.

222
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,835
Two days to move the gold.

223
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,795
NANYAK TEMPLE

224
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,303
<i>I need to kick them out
and demolish this building.</i>

225
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:56,222
<i>I have to retrieve the gold.</i>

226
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:59,976
When should I tell the workers to come?

227
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:03,104
Please tell your friend to come
three days later.

228
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,399
That'll do.

229
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,360
Okay. I got it.

230
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:11,571
Are you going to fix something in there?

231
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:15,116
Yes. We're going to fix the boiler.

232
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:18,995
By the way, why are you here?

233
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,124
I liked this text.

234
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,876
I see.

235
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,796
"Do not expect to get rich
through illegal means."

236
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,090
Yes, you shouldn't do that.

237
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,841
Sir.

238
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:33,969
"Don't be greedy for wealth or land.

239
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:35,387
Do what's right."

240
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,264
-Let's go inside.
-Thank you.

241
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:46,940
Praying on the cold floor

242
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,276
-gave me hemorrhoids.
-Oh, dear.

243
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:52,362
I know.

244
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:56,783
That sharp and heavy pain…

245
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,452
Let's install a boiler this weekend.

246
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:00,662
No!

247
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:12,215
I mean…

248
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,134
Why waste money

249
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:17,512
when they'll be demolishing
this place anyway?

250
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:20,306
I'll buy you an electric pad
that can cover this size

251
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,310
-and pay for the electricity.
-That's okay. Don't worry about it.

252
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:24,644
I said no!

253
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:26,354
Sir.

254
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:33,778
Please don't refuse my goodwill.

255
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:37,198
I'd like to show my appreciation
for you all.

256
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:46,124
He must've felt Buddha's presence
from beneath again.

257
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:47,250
I see.

258
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:53,089
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

259
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,549
-Gosh.
-Okay.

260
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,441
The witness of the recording
confessed to perjury.

261
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,401
Even if the second trial takes place,

262
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:15,445
it'll be dismissed
due to lack of evidence.

263
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,614
-It's over then.
-Yes.

264
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:19,616
My dad has no more cards up his sleeve.

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,161
Yu-chan must be getting old.

266
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:24,829
He's out of moves.

267
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,418
-Good luck wrapping things up.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:33,546
Cha-young!

269
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,298
You startled me! You…

270
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:37,926
Damn it. Gosh.

271
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,304
You have no class and no manners.

272
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,681
Look at you wearing sneakers at work.

273
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:47,519
Why did you pick him of all people?

274
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:50,063
It was you who picked me, sir.

275
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,148
I did?

276
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,194
I should quit drinking.

277
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,032
Cha-young.

278
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:02,534
Quiet down.

279
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:05,370
Cha-young. You see…

280
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:06,663
What? What is it?

281
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:09,791
Babel Pharmaceutical's
Drug Development Division called.

282
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:12,544
Qua… What was it?

283
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,879
-Quarantine?
-Right! One of its researchers

284
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,798
who was quarantined went missing.

285
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,049
What?

286
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,053
The Italian Intelligence Service
sent this.

287
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:23,179
Okay.

288
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:25,265
DIRECTOR TAE JONG-GU

289
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,394
After their boss died, Vincenzo Cassano,

290
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:32,355
the successor in line,
was targeted by the mob.

291
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,398
I believe…

292
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,110
I believe he fled here
to avoid getting killed.

293
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:40,655
What does a member of the Mafia
coming to Korea

294
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,824
have to do with our security?

295
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,450
What do you mean?

296
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,828
The most wicked gang in the world
advanced into--

297
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:49,747
"Advanced"?
Is that what you think this is?

298
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:53,293
Then, if two of them flew in,
it might as well be an invasion.

299
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:57,005
What if Vincenzo creates
a new gang in Korea?

300
00:16:57,088 --> 00:16:58,631
He needs money to do that.

301
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:01,468
How much could he have brought
before fleeing?

302
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,053
He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.

303
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,472
Why would a member of the Mafia
hide money here?

304
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:08,933
There are plenty of places
better suited for that.

305
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:11,060
Please authorize this mission first.

306
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:12,812
I'll get to the bottom of this.

307
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,731
You'd better not spend any of our money.

308
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,233
For every 10 won, I'll deduct 100,000 won.

309
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,902
-Sir!
-Enough!

310
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,364
What was that? Yes.
Go help the yakuza division.

311
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:26,576
A yakuza breaded himself
with a stab knife yesterday…

312
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,912
No. He stabbed the bread with a knife…

313
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:31,873
Damn it. I can't even say it right.

314
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:32,874
Get out!

315
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,961
But they're the Mafia.

316
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:39,005
Like the movie, <i>The Godfather.</i>

317
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:40,131
Hey.

318
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,483
SHINKWANG BANK
1,198,345 WON

319
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,151
This is enough.

320
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:05,365
Just you wait, Vincenzo Cassano.

321
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,826
I'll pay for the mission
out of my own pocket.

322
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,582
TOTAL

323
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,750
INTEREST ON LOAN

324
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,043
REMAINING BALANCE

325
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,631
It's okay.

326
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,261
It's all right. I can do it.

327
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:30,265
<i>O sole mio</i>

328
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,225
REMAINING BALANCE

329
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,270
<i>You said that you told the truth
for the victims of Babel.</i>

330
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,605
<i>-Was everything a lie?
-Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

331
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,315
<i>Why did you lie?</i>

332
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,026
-I told you that you would regret it
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

333
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,653
one day.

334
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:45,488
<i>I felt guilty.</i>

335
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,324
-You sold your conscience for money
<i>-Any words to the victims?</i>

336
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:49,826
and broke the hearts of the bereaved.

337
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,494
<i>I'm sorry for causing confusion.</i>

338
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:54,247
<i>I'm truly sorry to everyone
that I've hurt. I'm sorry.</i>

339
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,796
What are you doing?

340
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,840
Getting rid
of the Babel lawsuit documents.

341
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:05,633
It's really over now.

342
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,218
Don't be absurd.

343
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:09,053
-It's not over--
-Until it's over?

344
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:12,682
-But it is really over now.
-We still have hope.

345
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,475
Trials are full of twists and turns.

346
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,019
And they always work against us.

347
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,395
Maybe not this time around.

348
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,233
-God help us.
-Oh, God.

349
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,484
You little…

350
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,245
Back for more tricks, are you?

351
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:36,998
I have a favor.

352
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:41,044
Please share with me the documents
you have on Babel E&C.

353
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:42,086
What for?

354
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:44,255
I see.

355
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,841
You want to study your enemy
before defeating them?

356
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:48,468
Gosh.

357
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,636
Are you still pulling this stunt?

358
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,971
Yes.

359
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:57,268
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

360
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:58,686
You should leave.

361
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:06,861
The one who helps out the losing team
in a war isn't an enemy but--

362
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,363
An ally. Right?

363
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:09,364
You little…

364
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,993
That ally…

365
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:44,816
Sir.

366
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:52,031
There are things that can only be verified
through trust.

367
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:55,868
If you want to win,

368
00:20:56,786 --> 00:21:00,248
give me a chance instead of doubting me.

369
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,509
-Ju-sung.
-Yes?

370
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:14,220
Hand him all the documents

371
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,849
-we have on Babel E&C.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,385
It's been two days.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

373
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,471
Look at her.

374
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,348
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:35,767
Seriously.

376
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:41,356
I told you to keep a close eye
on all the newly employed researchers.

377
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,274
I didn't want them to complain,

378
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:45,401
so I got them to stay
at the chairman's villa.

379
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,821
If that researcher

380
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:51,157
talks nonsense, we'll lose this suit.

381
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,576
And It'll be the end
for that new drug as well!

382
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,536
I'm truly sorry.

383
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:58,748
Do the higher-ups know?

384
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:00,166
No, ma'am. They don't.

385
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,752
Let's keep it that way.

386
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,253
Don't you dare tell them.

387
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:08,508
Okay.

388
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:17,934
This is driving me nuts.

389
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:20,436
No matter how hard we cover it up,

390
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,480
one whistleblower will end everything.

391
00:22:24,065 --> 00:22:27,402
-What if they go to your dad?
-Gosh!

392
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:31,614
I didn't say it out loud
because I didn't want to jinx it.

393
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,243
Sorry, Cha-young.

394
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,955
They can go to the police,
the prosecution, or the reporters.

395
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:40,957
Just not my dad.

396
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,256
Seeing how we haven't heard anything,
I don't think they're there yet.

397
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:50,591
If they knew anything,

398
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:52,635
they wouldn't go to an incompetent lawyer.

399
00:22:57,014 --> 00:22:58,141
Who is that?

400
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:00,101
-Chairman Jang Han-seo of Babel.
-What?

401
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:04,188
Hello, sir.

402
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:07,650
Who are you?

403
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,194
I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
from Law Firm Wusang,

404
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:11,612
in charge of the Babel lawsuit.

405
00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:16,534
I heard about you.
Didn't she ask to borrow my villa?

406
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:20,246
That's right.
I had to because it was the safest place.

407
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,709
It's fine. I rarely go there.
Tell me if you need anything.

408
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:28,087
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

409
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:29,589
Yes, sir.

410
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:38,723
I get that he's a chairman, but how can he
talk down to us on our first encounter?

411
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:40,433
And he's young too.

412
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,562
Anyone who's rich and powerful

413
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:46,814
can do so even if they're younger than me.

414
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,568
-I see.
-Hold on.

415
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,947
Thanks to you, I have a bad feeling.

416
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:56,949
I'm going home.

417
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,410
Already?

418
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:04,957
Want some steak? I got paid yesterday.

419
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,418
No, thanks. I have somewhere to go.

420
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:12,798
She always leaves without me.

421
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:16,052
Cha-young! Your car's over there!

422
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:17,929
The other way!

423
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:25,811
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

424
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:36,948
BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS SUED
AFTER TEST SUBJECT DIES

425
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:39,992
Mr. Nam.

426
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,330
May I see the documents
regarding the lawsuit, please?

427
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,583
-Why?
-I'm just curious.

428
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,627
Well…

429
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:52,171
I need his permission.

430
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,798
Hand them over to him.

431
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,633
Every single one of them.

432
00:24:57,885 --> 00:24:58,844
Yes, sir.

433
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,222
Here are your documents.

434
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,941
You did well dealing with Lee Nam-su.

435
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:13,526
Good work.

436
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:15,945
He was quick-witted,
so we could wrap it up quickly.

437
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,822
-Who's next?
-That's it for now.

438
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,909
He's going to hand it over
to Prosecutor Seo U-yeong.

439
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:23,452
Prosecutor Seo U-yeong?

440
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:27,164
Mr. Seo.

441
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:29,834
This isn't your nephew's specialty.

442
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:32,878
All the more reason to hire him.
That's how he'll learn.

443
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:37,633
Also, there's something you must do
right now.

444
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:42,805
It's about my colleague,
Chief Kim Won-u's scandal.

445
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,265
Can you wrap that up for us?

446
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:52,648
The sexually assaulted victim
testified against him.

447
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:55,484
Another woman who was at the scene
also testified,

448
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:59,780
and the footage of the villa was found,
which is more than enough evidence.

449
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:04,744
Exactly. That's why I want you
to touch it up, so it looks less serious.

450
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:07,538
This matter doesn't only pertain
to Mr. Kim.

451
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:10,875
The honor of our office is at stake.

452
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,628
Sir, let me pour you a glass.

453
00:26:21,552 --> 00:26:23,721
Damn it.

454
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:29,352
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

455
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:35,566
How many times has it been just today?

456
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:43,491
How do I sound him out?

457
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:49,622
Cha-young, you can do it.

458
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:07,640
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

459
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:09,600
<i>He's sleeping soundly.</i>

460
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,727
<i>I guess there's nothing going on.</i>

461
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:18,776
BABEL E&C, BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS

462
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:22,988
What are you doing?

463
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,116
Why are you back?

464
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:29,912
-Answer me.
-Did you see my wallet?

465
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,580
I lost it.

466
00:27:31,664 --> 00:27:33,124
It's not here.

467
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:35,334
I cleaned the entire office today.

468
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:40,381
Where could it be?

469
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:42,341
I can guarantee that it's not here.

470
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,141
Why is he reading these?

471
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,851
Because he wanted to.

472
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,103
"Know your enemy
if you want to beat them."

473
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:55,563
What?

474
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,314
Babel Group is…

475
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:02,486
Would you mind me being vulgar?

476
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,738
Knock yourself out.

477
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,283
They're assholes.

478
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,618
"Assholes"?

479
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:12,329
They do everything the yakuza
and the Mafia do.

480
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:13,998
Everyone knows that.

481
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,167
But some lawyers help them
stay out of jail.

482
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,753
Mr. "Vincenzo Quassano."

483
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:20,129
Why are you doing this?

484
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:22,048
They're really out of line.

485
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,258
They're just like the Mafia.

486
00:28:24,341 --> 00:28:27,678
And Law Firm Wusang, their partner,
is no exception.

487
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,180
To be clear,

488
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:32,808
Law Firm Wusang is a parasite
that mooches off those assholes.

489
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:33,934
Correct.

490
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:36,896
Assholes like them should be made to pay.

491
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:40,066
"Pay". I like the sound of that.

492
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,860
They ought to.

493
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:45,571
You guys click very well.

494
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:47,907
How about you two start streaming online?

495
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,285
Call it, "Hong-Vin TV," or "Hong-Qua TV."

496
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:53,704
That sounds nice.

497
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:55,623
I should get going now.

498
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,541
I'll be glad to help
if you need anything else.

499
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,919
-Do you have more?
-Yes, we do. We have plenty.

500
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,130
No, thank you. This will suffice.

501
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:04,632
Sir. Your tie.

502
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:06,926
Thank you.

503
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:08,761
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

504
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:13,390
Goodness, look at her.

505
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:18,938
Was this your plan B?

506
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:21,607
Provoking my dad to continue fighting
against Babel

507
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,943
while you make a profit off the lawsuit?

508
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:25,402
Am I right?

509
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:27,154
I'm going to eat. Please leave.

510
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:32,118
Unfortunately, we're closed for the day

511
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,702
since we ran out of ingredients.

512
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:37,706
You can go to Yeongho Snack Bar.

513
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:40,876
They have the best <i>tteokbokki</i>
in this neighborhood.

514
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,224
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

515
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:57,685
Welcome.

516
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,189
I won't sell anything to you.

517
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:04,233
-But I want to eat.
-I said no food for you.

518
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:07,820
Then, I'll buy it.

519
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:13,450
I never said you could sit there.

520
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,369
Do you not want to eat?

521
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,127
Sit down.

522
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,506
-What do you want?
-Take your pick.

523
00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:29,133
<i>Tteokbokki</i>

524
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:32,553
Flour rice cakes, traditional <i>gochujang</i>,
and a bit of artificial--

525
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:33,470
Two servings of <i>tteokbokki</i>.

526
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,434
You're pretty basic.

527
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,560
"Basic"?

528
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:41,312
You know "asshole" but not "basic"?

529
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,481
It means "common."

530
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:48,694
Let's make this clear.

531
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:52,698
I have no reason to provoke your dad.
I'm preparing myself for war.

532
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:58,120
Your enemy has tanks and armored vehicles.

533
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,331
What use would 200 stones be?

534
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:01,874
Do you think that's all I have?

535
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:05,419
Yes. The weak usually resort to
throwing stones or butting heads

536
00:31:05,502 --> 00:31:07,504
when they are out of options.

537
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,008
I didn't think of head-butting.

538
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:17,097
Go back to Italy and fight
against those you're used to.

539
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:19,433
This country doesn't suit you.

540
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:20,935
Why not?

541
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,939
In Italy, only the Mafia
perform such heinous deeds.

542
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,775
But everyone here runs
their own gangs and cartels.

543
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,694
The National Assembly, prosecution,
police, public offices, and companies.

544
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:31,904
All of them.

545
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:35,282
It doesn't matter who you're up against.

546
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,409
It'll be a grueling ordeal for you.

547
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:38,327
Why?

548
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:40,955
Because that's Korea.

549
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,753
-Thanks for the advice.
-Your <i>tteokbokki</i> is ready.

550
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:54,009
May I have a glass of water?

551
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:56,845
You can get it yourself.

552
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:59,598
That is a water filter dispenser.

553
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:09,358
-Let's eat.
-Thank…

554
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:20,286
Happiness isn't far away.

555
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:21,996
-Do you like it?
-Yes!

556
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:26,208
I'm home. I'm hungry.

557
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,766
What are you doing?

558
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:45,936
What?

559
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,896
Didn't I tell you not to smoke?

560
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,190
I didn't.
I was just standing next to them.

561
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:54,069
I told you I'd give you a good beating
if you lied.

562
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:56,905
Snap out of it! Don't hit your son!

563
00:32:56,989 --> 00:33:00,409
If you don't want to die,
put your guard up.

564
00:33:01,243 --> 00:33:02,745
Mom! Come on, it hurts.

565
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,663
One, two.

566
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:06,832
You little brat!

567
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,380
Does she have a black belt?

568
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:20,512
Goodness.

569
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:25,184
Oh, dear.

570
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:36,570
You want me to cover for a filthy bastard
and take all the blame?

571
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:42,326
Let's go.

572
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:54,046
I'll destroy each and every
last one of you, you assholes.

573
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:00,719
Hello, there!

574
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,560
I'll just cut to the chase.

575
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:11,939
Ms. Choi. I mean, Myung-hee.

576
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:14,358
Hey.

577
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:18,362
Join my law firm. Okay?

578
00:34:20,614 --> 00:34:23,158
You impudent brat. Explain yourself.

579
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,619
Prosecutor General Hwang and Mr. Seo.

580
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:29,039
Everyone knows they're trying
to form a cartel of sorts

581
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,833
at the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

582
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,085
One that's impenetrable
by even the Reform Committee.

583
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,754
Do you think they'll let you in? No way!

584
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,632
They'll use and discard you
like they did today.

585
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:40,217
Enough already.

586
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:44,596
Just drink up and stop nagging me.

587
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,056
<i>I'm not nagging.</i>

588
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,310
<i>If you join us,</i>

589
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:54,022
I'll let you bring down that prosecution.

590
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:55,357
Have you gone insane?

591
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:01,029
You know I'm helping out
Babel Group, right?

592
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:04,491
They'll back us up no matter what.

593
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:06,410
They are just a company.

594
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:09,872
In three years, they'll be
one of the twenty richest companies.

595
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:12,291
Their drugs are second to none.

596
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:15,627
Also, their chairman has a few
loose screws and is easy to handle.

597
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:21,175
You must have a good reason
to be cleaning up after their messes.

598
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:22,176
Exactly.

599
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,180
Even though I'm cleaning up their shit,

600
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:27,389
I keep getting richer.

601
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:32,019
Unbelievable.

602
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,022
So you want us to act like their bidets?

603
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:37,316
I'll do all the trivial work.

604
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,776
You just need to leave them
a solid impression.

605
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,696
Have you been working
as a salesman instead?

606
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:45,657
Just choose me
like you choose your clothes.

607
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:48,285
I heard it takes you ten minutes
to shop for clothes.

608
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:52,080
The alcohol is getting the better of me.

609
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,460
Exactly how crazy is this chairman?

610
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:25,864
It's all my fault.

611
00:36:26,907 --> 00:36:29,534
I should've kept an eye
on the researchers, but I failed.

612
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:31,536
I'll take care of it as soon as…

613
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:42,339
I'm sorry for the delay
in the Babel Tower construction.

614
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:44,383
There were issues with the building owner.

615
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:45,884
I'll also take care of…

616
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:54,393
I promise

617
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:57,104
to be more thorough from now on.

618
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:00,315
I promise I won't disappoint you again.

619
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:05,988
Please give me one more chance.

620
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:09,783
I promise I'll do better.

621
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:35,600
Look at me.

622
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,145
Don't tell me you've already run out
of ingredients.

623
00:38:20,854 --> 00:38:21,688
No.

624
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:25,567
If it wasn't Italy,
where did you learn to cook?

625
00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:29,613
Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province.

626
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,949
At a place called
Mom's Touch Cooking Academy.

627
00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:35,660
"Mom's Touch"?

628
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,457
Serve me food until I can finally
get a taste of a mom's touch.

629
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,250
But I'm not a mom.

630
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:47,089
If not, then I'll have no choice
but to expose you.

631
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:49,007
-Sorry?
-<i>Risotto allo zafferano.</i>

632
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:58,558
Saffron risotto.

633
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,353
Okay. I'll get it ready.

634
00:39:44,187 --> 00:39:46,314
It tastes like vomited baby food…

635
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:48,108
How should I put it?

636
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:50,944
Yes. And it's been mixed
in wine and broth.

637
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:57,742
You have a knack for making awful food.

638
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:12,591
If you look over here…

639
00:40:12,674 --> 00:40:14,384
-Sir.
-Yes?

640
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:16,803
We need to go somewhere.

641
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:18,805
Where?

642
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:25,020
They won't see you without an appointment.

643
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:27,355
-Let's ask.
-What?

644
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:33,069
How may I help you?

645
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:35,155
I'm here to see Mr. Na Deok-jin
of Investment and Development.

646
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:36,698
-Have you called beforehand?
-No.

647
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,993
I'm afraid you can't meet him.

648
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,709
BILL OF INDICTMENT

649
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:51,338
Tell him he has a bill of indictment
for threatening and abetting an abduction.

650
00:40:57,385 --> 00:40:58,637
When did you get that?

651
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:11,316
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

652
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,569
Let me see the bill. Let's read it.

653
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,377
BILL OF INDICTMENT

654
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,962
THREAT AND ABETTING AN ABDUCTION

655
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:38,301
It's empty.

656
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,638
I lied, so we could meet.

657
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:46,393
We've paid you enough already. Why…

658
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:50,272
-But why are you so clingy?
-We're not clingy.

659
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,107
We just want to correct what's wrong.

660
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,485
Sure. Then, feel free to sue or report me.

661
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:57,320
Do as you please.

662
00:41:57,404 --> 00:41:59,614
Or demonstrate in front of the Blue House

663
00:41:59,698 --> 00:42:01,741
-and shave your head.
-No.

664
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,744
I thought I'd do the same as you did.

665
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,624
We'll kidnap your family

666
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,543
and force you to cancel the contract.

667
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:16,214
Are you a die-hard fan of <i>The Godfather</i>?

668
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:18,008
Are you mimicking the Mafia

669
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:19,926
since you're from Italy?

670
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:28,393
I'm glad you asked.

671
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:31,479
If we were in Italy,

672
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:34,649
you would've become a fertilizer
for the vineyards.

673
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,863
You would have become some cheap wine
being sold on a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

674
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:45,410
I'm not here to negotiate but to warn you.

675
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,746
We're not going to take it anymore.

676
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:50,790
Okay.

677
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:03,386
Was that how you did things in Italy?

678
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,846
At times.

679
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,724
I loved what you said.

680
00:43:08,558 --> 00:43:10,560
"Vineyard fertilizer.
Buy-one-get-one-free."

681
00:43:12,437 --> 00:43:13,605
"Hey.

682
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,650
You're buy-two-get-one-free."

683
00:43:17,817 --> 00:43:19,611
I should use it sometime.

684
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:25,909
Let's eat. It's on me.
Two meals for the price of one.

685
00:43:28,328 --> 00:43:29,162
RESIGNATION LETTER

686
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:34,376
Some company must've given you an offer.

687
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:36,544
Law Firm Wusang? Wintis?

688
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:39,756
-Ko and Gu?
-No.

689
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:42,509
I just want to rest.

690
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:44,344
Don't sugarcoat it.

691
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:46,805
What's the real reason?

692
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:48,556
I just…

693
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:52,560
I'm sick of being your hound.

694
00:43:52,644 --> 00:43:54,688
That's a bit harsh.

695
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:56,189
I'm sorry to break it to you,

696
00:43:56,272 --> 00:43:59,526
but wherever you go,
you'll always be a hound on a leash.

697
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:00,694
Probably.

698
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:02,779
However,

699
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:06,241
my leash will probably be longer.

700
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:09,828
And they'll feed me better.

701
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:15,959
Goodbye, guys.

702
00:44:16,543 --> 00:44:18,044
Where do you think you're going?

703
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:21,256
Hey, Ms. Choi. Hey!

704
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:32,100
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

705
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:45,822
Prosecutor or not, I'm going to
destroy all of you before I leave.

706
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:04,632
What's with the meeting?

707
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,678
This way, please.

708
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,268
You splurged, didn't you?

709
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:17,145
Isn't that Prosecutor Choi?

710
00:45:18,188 --> 00:45:19,481
Sit down.

711
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:24,861
I'm sorry to gather you all so suddenly.

712
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:27,238
We have an important guest.

713
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:30,533
I'm sure you all know her.
It's Prosecutor Choi Myung-hee.

714
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:33,912
From this day on,

715
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:37,749
she will be a senior lawyer at Wusang.

716
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:44,255
Soon, she will represent us on my behalf.

717
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:54,849
I knew you'd be happy.

718
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:59,020
Wusang will be invincible.

719
00:45:59,729 --> 00:46:00,939
Please say a word or two.

720
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:03,525
I have two things to say. Number one.

721
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:07,487
One who achieves small victories
will eventually achieve big ones.

722
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,864
Number two. I beg you.

723
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:13,159
Let's not work hard
if it can't be appreciated. That's all.

724
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:17,372
Clap, will you?

725
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:24,295
Look at her acting all tough
from the get-go.

726
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:27,924
She just got here.
How could she represent our law firm?

727
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:29,217
She's a mere rookie.

728
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,177
Well, she was the best prospector there.

729
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:34,931
Ms. Hong should be the one
to represent us.

730
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,475
She achieved the most out of all of us.

731
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:43,356
You're not consoling or bashing me.
What is this?

732
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:45,483
Bash you?

733
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:47,485
We're just upset by the unfair treatment.

734
00:46:48,111 --> 00:46:50,947
But I can see you grinning.

735
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,828
She's so quick to notice.

736
00:46:57,328 --> 00:46:59,080
How did she know we were happy?

737
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:02,667
I knew it ever since
he deducted the withholding taxes.

738
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,460
Gosh.

739
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:23,271
I get you,

740
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:24,647
but you don't have soul.

741
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:27,358
You look more like a patient
than a zombie.

742
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:29,277
I could do just as much.

743
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,822
Like this.

744
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:36,492
You're so good. I can do it too.

745
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:41,831
I'm a pretty zombie.

746
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:46,002
-Goodness, you're terrifying.
-Go away.

747
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:48,504
-That's not how you do it.
-Try that again, Larry.

748
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:50,256
Not like this. Do this.

749
00:47:51,674 --> 00:47:53,468
That's it.

750
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:55,678
No, try harder. Put your back into it.

751
00:47:55,762 --> 00:47:58,014
That's it.

752
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,068
-Goodness.
-Wait.

753
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:13,029
I heard some gagging noises.

754
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:15,365
What were you doing?

755
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:18,743
I was chosen to coach the zombies

756
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:22,914
for the upcoming <i>Train to Ulsan Part Two</i>.
I was practicing.

757
00:48:22,997 --> 00:48:24,248
We were helping him out.

758
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:25,500
I see.

759
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:27,502
Yes.

760
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,545
Good luck.

761
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:33,841
Let's go.

762
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:35,718
Okay.

763
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,264
Darn it.

764
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:42,475
-How humiliating.
-Oh, no.

765
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:45,603
His cold gaze.

766
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,857
He probably saw the roof of my mouth.

767
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:53,361
What should I do?

768
00:48:55,738 --> 00:48:56,906
What should I do?

769
00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:03,997
Let us know if you need extras
for the movie.

770
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,164
I'll do my best.

771
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:07,709
Me, too. I'm serious.

772
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,544
-No, you can't.
-Please.

773
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:12,547
No, I need to ask them for permission.

774
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:18,678
From what I've seen of Babel E&C,

775
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:21,931
they forcibly evict the residents
one week after the notice.

776
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:23,766
Yes, they've always done that.

777
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:26,269
They demolish the non-residential areas

778
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:28,312
and instill fear
in the remaining residents.

779
00:49:28,396 --> 00:49:31,149
It's downright illegal,
but Law Firm Wusang has their back.

780
00:49:31,232 --> 00:49:35,028
Isn't there a law
that protects the tenants?

781
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:40,241
I heard they need to pay
a premium compensation to the tenants

782
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:42,827
and negotiate the demolition date
with an officer.

783
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,911
That's what I read.

784
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:47,498
You've studied a lot.

785
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:53,796
They were being too ridiculous
that I had to read up on it.

786
00:49:54,547 --> 00:49:55,548
I see.

787
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:59,927
Those rules exist, but they force
the tenants out with a small sum.

788
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:02,555
People get hurt or die too.

789
00:50:03,973 --> 00:50:06,642
They'll probably carry out
the eviction suit first.

790
00:50:06,726 --> 00:50:07,894
We should get ready.

791
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:09,604
Isn't the biggest issue here

792
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:12,148
the forced illegal demolition?

793
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:13,274
Yes.

794
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:15,902
They'll make a move in a day or two.

795
00:50:17,153 --> 00:50:18,529
But there's nothing we can do.

796
00:50:20,907 --> 00:50:22,033
Gosh.

797
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,330
Here. Do you want one?

798
00:50:27,413 --> 00:50:29,791
-No, thank you.
-Then, why…

799
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:37,465
Do you drink?

800
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:46,224
You've never <i>makgeolli</i> before?

801
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:48,643
-No.
-I see.

802
00:50:49,268 --> 00:50:51,771
It only gives a mild hangover,
so drink up.

803
00:50:51,854 --> 00:50:53,397
Here. Bottoms up.

804
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,608
Here you go.

805
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,913
I can finally taste it
now that I've had my second glass.

806
00:51:08,996 --> 00:51:12,583
In that case, drink up.

807
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:14,127
Here you go.

808
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:19,715
Cheers.

809
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:40,486
By the way, should I congratulate you
for diving headfirst into hell?

810
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:45,032
I'm fighting against Babel
because I'm stupid.

811
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:46,784
But not you.

812
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,079
By the way,

813
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:55,418
are you also a public defender?

814
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:58,504
I am. For one person.

815
00:52:00,423 --> 00:52:02,508
I truly pity her.

816
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:06,262
She was falsely charged with murder.

817
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:09,891
And yet, she accepted it

818
00:52:10,516 --> 00:52:12,435
and made peace with her pancreatic cancer.

819
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:17,648
Why

820
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:21,110
would she do that?

821
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:28,284
She believes she's being punished
for abandoning her son in the past.

822
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:31,746
She says feeling guilty isn't enough.

823
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:36,042
There are people who readily accept
their punishment.

824
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:40,087
And there are those who are shameless
even after committing crimes.

825
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:42,006
In any case,

826
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:45,384
only the kindhearted and the weak suffer.

827
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:47,970
I know you won't get it.

828
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:50,932
For the past two days,

829
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:55,853
I experienced firsthand

830
00:52:56,938 --> 00:52:58,314
how the weak suffered.

831
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:02,818
I couldn't do anything.

832
00:53:05,238 --> 00:53:06,614
So I became even more furious.

833
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:10,826
Those who are truly weak endure
the feeling of helplessness and rage

834
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:13,621
until the day they die.

835
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:24,590
I have a question.

836
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:28,469
What's the story
behind your law firm's name?

837
00:53:32,932 --> 00:53:34,809
I don't defend my clients.

838
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:37,561
I become their last straw, a <i>jipuragi</i>.

839
00:53:39,355 --> 00:53:42,441
When they don't have anyone to lean on,

840
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:45,528
they can still grab onto me.

841
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:48,406
I am their last straw.

842
00:53:54,412 --> 00:53:55,496
Excuse me.

843
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,500
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

844
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:04,839
Hello, I'm listening.

845
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,425
<i>Hello?</i>

846
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:16,726
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

847
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:19,770
Was that a prank call?

848
00:54:26,444 --> 00:54:28,654
I heard this is how you pour drinks here.

849
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,910
You seem quite genuine today.

850
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:37,163
Or have I become dull?

851
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,792
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

852
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,212
You need to turn around and drink.

853
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:46,964
Yes.

854
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,429
Just turn halfway.

855
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:55,181
Halfway.

856
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:05,358
We've pretty much won
the Babel Pharmaceuticals case.

857
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:07,151
Ms. Hong just needs to finish up.

858
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:09,904
Babel E&C is the problem here.

859
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:12,573
We need to demolish a plaza
in Geumga-dong.

860
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:13,741
Brace yourselves.

861
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:15,785
Why do they need to brace themselves?

862
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:19,580
It's quite sly.

863
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:21,791
Demolishing it right away
would be illegal,

864
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:24,293
so we bring in heavy equipment
for a so-called cleanup

865
00:55:24,377 --> 00:55:26,170
and accidentally damage the building.

866
00:55:26,253 --> 00:55:28,005
The tenants move out in fear,

867
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:29,382
and Babel claims it's a mistake.

868
00:55:29,465 --> 00:55:30,966
The building becomes vacant in a few days.

869
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,844
Legal or not, we'll get the job done

870
00:55:33,928 --> 00:55:35,513
because they trust us.

871
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:40,309
Lawyers are better than prosecutors
at making people shit their pants.

872
00:55:40,393 --> 00:55:43,145
Such assholes.

873
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,440
She says that all the time.

874
00:55:47,983 --> 00:55:49,276
And…

875
00:55:50,736 --> 00:55:52,363
Oh, dear.

876
00:55:54,156 --> 00:55:57,368
Your dad is once again leading
the Development Opposition Committee.

877
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:00,871
What a fun life he's living.

878
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:06,085
Shouldn't we estimate the scale of damage?

879
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:09,547
Thankfully, it'll be smaller than
the redevelopment in Yucheon-dong.

880
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,174
I believe four people still died there.

881
00:56:12,258 --> 00:56:13,634
That's not bad.

882
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:16,137
Twelve people died
during Yonghu-dong's redevelopment.

883
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,140
It's fine. They'll crawl out
when push comes to shove.

884
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,976
Right. Don't forget your dad.

885
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:30,317
Let's see.

886
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,160
I heard that they're demolishing it.

887
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,790
They're so cruel. There are people--

888
00:56:44,874 --> 00:56:46,000
It's not cruel!

889
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:50,546
It wouldn't be so cruel
if they moved out willingly.

890
00:56:56,093 --> 00:56:59,930
What's with those people?
How can they be so dense?

891
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,975
It's easier said than done.

892
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:09,571
Their lawyer is the one who's the worst.

893
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,737
If he's a lawyer,
he should be more levelheaded.

894
00:57:41,514 --> 00:57:42,765
Hello.

895
00:57:42,848 --> 00:57:44,808
Doesn't it feel like
your head's been split open?

896
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,228
Mine's already smashed.

897
00:57:47,311 --> 00:57:50,856
Yes. I'm having a pretty bad hangover.

898
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,401
Come over. Let's eat something.

899
00:57:54,485 --> 00:57:56,278
<i>I'll text you my address.</i>

900
00:57:56,362 --> 00:57:57,404
But I…

901
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:02,504
<i>Come in.</i>

902
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,620
It's a mess, isn't it?

903
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:07,456
The soup just needs to boil,
so please sit down.

904
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,041
There's nothing worth looking at.

905
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,336
All right.

906
00:58:20,136 --> 00:58:22,513
You must have another daughter.

907
00:58:22,596 --> 00:58:24,140
What? No.

908
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:25,600
That's Cha-young.

909
00:58:26,392 --> 00:58:27,518
What?

910
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:38,237
I see.

911
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:45,119
Hello, Chairman Jang.

912
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:49,790
They've informed me
that they're ready for the demolition.

913
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:53,085
We'll be ready by tomorrow as well.

914
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:54,879
Yes, sir.

915
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:57,882
Don't worry.

916
00:58:57,965 --> 00:59:00,343
This is our job.

917
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:05,097
I believe they'll start working
around 11 p.m. tomorrow.

918
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:07,558
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

919
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:12,480
Cha-young!

920
00:59:13,689 --> 00:59:15,399
-What is it this time?
-They're--

921
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:17,318
What? What is it?

922
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:19,487
Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

923
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,656
That's when they'll demolish the building.

924
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,952
I heard Mr. Han speaking
with that impudent chairman.

925
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:30,623
They're ready, and they'll do it tomorrow.

926
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:31,999
What?

927
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,341
How is it? Don't you feel so much better?

928
00:59:40,424 --> 00:59:41,634
-Right?
-Yes.

929
00:59:42,676 --> 00:59:44,136
I make the best--

930
00:59:44,845 --> 00:59:46,263
Can you please pick up?

931
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:47,890
I called you more than 30 times.

932
00:59:47,973 --> 00:59:49,225
You're so noisy.

933
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:51,227
What is it this time?

934
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:53,813
Why do you still have these hanging?

935
00:59:53,896 --> 00:59:55,731
You're going to donate them?

936
00:59:57,692 --> 00:59:59,068
Eat while you're here. Come.

937
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,323
There's a serious problem.

938
01:00:04,407 --> 01:00:06,826
-This isn't a time to be eating.
-What is it?

939
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:12,415
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

940
01:00:12,498 --> 01:00:13,999
See? You screen my calls.

941
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:16,210
-Why do you ignore my calls? Why?
-Sorry?

942
01:00:18,462 --> 01:00:21,215
I see. One moment, please.

943
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:22,633
Hang on.

944
01:00:28,264 --> 01:00:31,350
I'd like to tell you about what they did
to their test subjects.

945
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:33,185
So there were problems, weren't there?

946
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:35,646
Yes. I can't tell you the details
over the phone.

947
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,064
I'd like to meet soon.

948
01:00:37,148 --> 01:00:39,066
Of course.

949
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:40,901
Go ahead.

950
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:43,154
All right.

951
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,407
I'll head over there right now. Goodbye.

952
01:00:52,538 --> 01:00:53,748
Babel E&C is--

953
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:56,542
This is urgent. Speak with him, okay?

954
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:58,461
Dad! Mr. Hong!

955
01:01:11,307 --> 01:01:12,349
What is it?

956
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:23,277
They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.

957
01:01:24,445 --> 01:01:26,280
Evacuate the tenants right now.

958
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:29,158
They say they'll avoid
the residential area,

959
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:31,535
but who knows what'll happen?

960
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:36,040
I've only met you three days ago,

961
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:38,083
but this is the first time
you seem worried.

962
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:43,672
I'm worried about none other than myself.

963
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:45,925
If my dad gets hurt during the demolition,

964
01:01:46,008 --> 01:01:47,843
it'll do me no good.

965
01:01:48,427 --> 01:01:52,306
Think about it.
What will my colleagues think of me?

966
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:53,974
I see.

967
01:01:58,604 --> 01:02:02,733
What is this place? A crime scene?

968
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:08,739
Darn it. You're done, right?

969
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,116
Unbelievable.

970
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,286
I told him many times
not to pile up the dirty dishes.

971
01:02:27,716 --> 01:02:32,429
MOTEL

972
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:49,071
Hello, Mr. Yu Min-chul.

973
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:14,930
<i>They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

974
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:17,224
<i>Evacuate the tenants right now.</i>

975
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:27,985
<i>How can I stop them?</i>

976
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:30,654
<i>How?</i>

977
01:03:35,326 --> 01:03:36,243
<i>What?</i>

978
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:37,786
Tonight?

979
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,496
Yes, at 11 p.m.

980
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,332
How could you tell us now?

981
01:03:41,415 --> 01:03:43,918
-You're unbelievable.
-When they come,

982
01:03:44,001 --> 01:03:48,255
I could grab and nail them to the ground.

983
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:50,174
Since I know martial arts,

984
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:52,635
I'm afraid I might kill them.

985
01:03:52,718 --> 01:03:53,886
Nail them, my foot.

986
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:55,930
We should evacuate. Do you want to die?

987
01:03:56,013 --> 01:03:59,767
Goodness. Babel, those assholes.

988
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,727
I hope they all go under!

989
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,936
Is there a solution?

990
01:04:03,771 --> 01:04:05,940
Mr. Hong is busily--

991
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:07,024
Busily doing what?

992
01:04:07,107 --> 01:04:08,108
Tell us.

993
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:09,777
I didn't see him all day.

994
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:16,200
This is where we live and work.

995
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:20,913
If we evacuate,
we'll be leaving behind everything.

996
01:04:22,498 --> 01:04:26,877
I bought all my utensils new last month.

997
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,087
Me too.

998
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,631
I got a loan two months ago
and bought a new piano.

999
01:04:30,714 --> 01:04:31,966
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

1000
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:33,217
Mr. Cassano.

1001
01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:36,637
Say something, will you?

1002
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:40,599
Goodness, that damn man.

1003
01:04:40,683 --> 01:04:42,226
What the hell is he doing?

1004
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:45,562
Who cares? Let's go pack our things.

1005
01:04:45,646 --> 01:04:49,358
I'll protest outside and distract them.

1006
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:51,819
What the hell are you doing?

1007
01:04:54,029 --> 01:04:58,575
Sir, you don't have time
to be liking photos online.

1008
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:00,703
-What?
-What is he liking?

1009
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:05,582
Come up with a solution, will you?

1010
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,681
IMAGES MATCHING VINCENZO CASSANO
SEARCHED ON 13:11

1011
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:24,393
Isn't anyone in here?

1012
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:27,146
Hold on.

1013
01:05:27,229 --> 01:05:28,939
Who locked the door?

1014
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:33,235
Damn it. Hey, open up.

1015
01:05:36,822 --> 01:05:38,574
Vincenzo Cassano…

1016
01:05:39,074 --> 01:05:41,076
Vincenzo Cassano.

1017
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:46,874
<i>O sole mio</i>

1018
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,794
-Pack everything!
-Goodness!

1019
01:05:55,382 --> 01:05:56,550
Hey…

1020
01:06:03,682 --> 01:06:04,600
<i>Is that true?</i>

1021
01:06:04,683 --> 01:06:05,768
Yes.

1022
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,645
I called you yesterday,
but you weren't picking up.

1023
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:11,440
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

1024
01:06:11,523 --> 01:06:12,858
What time is it?

1025
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,028
Let me think. What should I do?

1026
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,616
What should I do?

1027
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:26,288
ATTORNEY HONG CHA-YOUNG

1028
01:06:43,055 --> 01:06:44,681
I'll call you back.

1029
01:06:47,017 --> 01:06:48,644
Nothing is easy these days.

1030
01:06:49,311 --> 01:06:52,231
Everything requires so much work.
It's such a headache.

1031
01:06:52,314 --> 01:06:57,528
All notable paintings
have several layers of paint.

1032
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:01,657
But then again, it's our job
to paint over without leaving a trace.

1033
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:06,787
-When will I get to see the chairman?
-Right.

1034
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:08,956
In two days.

1035
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:13,210
He has great expectations for you.

1036
01:07:14,545 --> 01:07:16,797
I need to see for myself how crazy he is.

1037
01:07:19,716 --> 01:07:20,592
Sir.

1038
01:07:22,553 --> 01:07:23,595
Why are you here?

1039
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:25,305
I have something urgent to report.

1040
01:07:26,515 --> 01:07:27,599
What is it?

1041
01:07:27,683 --> 01:07:30,435
I caught wind of something
at the Babel headquarters.

1042
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:32,980
One of the researchers
of Babel Pharmaceuticals

1043
01:07:33,939 --> 01:07:35,566
ran away during the quarantine.

1044
01:07:35,649 --> 01:07:36,942
What?

1045
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:38,443
Damn it.

1046
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:41,154
They've dropped a giant bomb on us.

1047
01:07:41,238 --> 01:07:42,823
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1048
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:56,086
Shouldn't you go?

1049
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,880
There's nothing I can do.

1050
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:23,447
Where are you, Dad?

1051
01:08:24,656 --> 01:08:26,450
Why are you still there?

1052
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:28,493
Don't worry. I won't die.

1053
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:31,371
Cut that nonsense and get out of there.

1054
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:35,125
I'm turning my phone off again.
You're distracting me.

1055
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,004
Dad!

1056
01:08:39,087 --> 01:08:40,881
Oh, come on!

1057
01:08:41,506 --> 01:08:43,091
Wait!

1058
01:08:56,146 --> 01:08:57,773
The stress is killing me.

1059
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:02,486
-Hello, sir.
-Hey!

1060
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:03,570
Where are you?

1061
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:05,614
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

1062
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:16,500
Come over here.

1063
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:18,752
Okay.

1064
01:09:20,337 --> 01:09:21,254
All right.

1065
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:23,090
Sir, we're ready.

1066
01:09:27,469 --> 01:09:30,138
All right! Let's go!

1067
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:31,515
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1068

Come on.

1069
01:10:17,978 --> 01:10:18,854
Damn it.

1070
01:10:51,762 --> 01:10:52,929
What is this?

These men love this party.

1081
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:19,224
They've been complimenting.

1082
01:12:19,307 --> 01:12:20,892
Hello. Thank you for coming.

-Cheers.

1084
01:12:23,728 --> 01:12:26,189
We still have a lot of time,
so please enjoy the party.

1085
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,196
Let's leave him here. Let's go.

1086
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:58,949
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

1087
01:13:59,032 --> 01:14:00,158
We don't need him.

1088
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:01,785
Wait.

1089
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,167

1090
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:12,837

1094
01:15:08,768 --> 01:15:11,021
Excuse me for a second, sir.

1095
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,773
Hello, sir.

1096
01:15:13,857 --> 01:15:16,526
He's the owner of the shop next door.

1097
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,527
I see.

1098
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,279
Hello. Thank you for coming.

1099
01:15:19,362 --> 01:15:20,405
The spaghetti is good.

1100
01:15:20,488 --> 01:15:22,699
-Please escort them.
-This way.

1101
01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:51,246
<i>Have you grasped the core problem
of this lawsuit?</i>

1102
01:16:51,329 --> 01:16:54,165
Drugs? Cartels? Do you think this is
some American TV show?

1103
01:16:54,249 --> 01:16:56,334
Stupid idiot.

1104
01:16:56,418 --> 01:16:57,669
Hey, it's Vincenzo!

1105
01:16:57,752 --> 01:17:00,130
<i>They're not businessmen. They're monsters.</i>

1106
01:17:00,213 --> 01:17:03,258
<i>They couldn't care less
about the lives of others.</i>

1107
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:06,636
Can you not represent
Babel Pharmaceuticals?

1108
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,514
<i>That will be the end of you, you brat.</i>

1109
01:17:09,597 --> 01:17:10,890
<i>I will not cave in without a fight.</i>

1110
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:12,892
Why are you so reckless?

1111
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:15,687
For me, running away
isn't the coward's way out.

1112
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,273
<i>It's putting other people in danger.</i>

1113
01:17:18,356 --> 01:17:20,024
<i>Don't try anything funny.</i>

1114
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:21,609
You'll be dead if anything happens to me.
