1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,270
You jerk.

2
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,026
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

3
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,945
If you take one more step…

4
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,033
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

5
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,410
Just stay still.

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,162
Everyone, stay still.

7
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:23,417
Babel E&C bought this building
through an illegal means.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,210
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

9
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,420
Now!

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,507
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

11
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,428
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,142
This building belongs to me.

13
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,395
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

14
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,813
-What?
-What did he say?

15
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,064
He said…

16
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>È mio!</i>

17
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,156
<i>È mio!</i>

18
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,996
Take your men and get lost.
Then, I'll help you back up.

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,372
I'll get lost. Help me up.

20
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,291
-What?
-I'll leave, so help me up.

21
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,585
-Promise me.
-Seriously. I promise.

22
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,753
Do I really need to?

23
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,671
Okay. I can't straighten my finger.

24
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,257
-This hurts. Oh, my finger.
-Stamp it.

25
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,759
You cruel bastard.

26
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,177
Come on. I stamped it.

27
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,720
Help me up. Hurry.

28
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,930
Go on. Help him.

29
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,225
Bring me up! Hurry up!

30
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,810
Boss!

31
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,148
Be careful.

32
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,484
-Goodness!
-It hurts!

33
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,152
-Boss, are you okay?
-Hey!

34
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,154
Boss, are you all right?

35
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,365
Oh, no! You're bleeding!

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,578
This could leave a scar.

37
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,914
This could leave a scar. Damn it.

38
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,379
-Kill that bastard.
-Grab your weapons.

39
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,048
I know you're a lowlife punk,

40
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,468
but aren't you breaking your promise
way too soon?

41
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,553
Let's go!

42
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,351
Hey! Stop it! Stop right there.

43
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,228
-What?
-Seriously?

44
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,855
Mr. Park, you should leave.

45
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,273
There are reporters outside.

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,733
Reporters? Why?

47
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,777
How should I know?

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,487
All right.

49
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,490
-Let's quickly disperse.
-Leave.

50
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,991
-What?
-Get lost.

51
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,578
Hey. Hey!

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,289
Stay right there.

53
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,167
I'll hang you from this very plaza soon.

54
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,336
Damn it!

55
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,255
Damn it, this scar!

56
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,967
-Goodness.
-Those bastards.

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,885
What was that?

58
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,220
We should talk.

59
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,269
Gosh.

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,939
Didn't I tell you not to fool around?

61
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,024
I wasn't fooling around.

62
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,111
I told you Mr. Cho was threatened
to sign the contract.

63
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,530
"Threatened"? Gosh.

64
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,449
That was quite a stunt you put up there.

65
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,659
You guys are amazing.

66
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,035
Why are you so childish?

67
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,454
Why won't you…

68
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,832
Why won't he trust me?

69
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,836
Seeing how you're speaking Italian,
you must feel guilty.

70
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,546
Shut up!

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,590
It sounds like you're cursing.

72
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,302
Think about it.

73
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,513
Why would I still be here
if I sold this building?

74
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,766
I'd take the money and go abroad.

75
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,434
-That's true.
-Be quiet!

76
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,606
Go back to your country
and stop inconveniencing us.

77
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,525
Babel E&C, Babel Pharmaceuticals,
and Law Firm Wusang

78
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,943
are all garbage.

79
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,528
Leave. All of you.

80
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,531
Somehow, I got caught in the crossfire.
Unbelievable.

81
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,325
I don't expect you to believe me.

82
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm going to get this building back.

83
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,835
That's impossible.

84
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,712
The contract has been signed already.

85
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,677
How may I help you?

86
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,179
I'm a reporter from HBN.

87
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,847
I'd like to meet with…

88
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,560
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.
He gave us the tip. Is he here?

89
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,562
He called you here?

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,653
Sir.

91
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,074
What a surprise.
You even called the reporters.

92
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,325
EPISODE 2

93
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,411
However, there's something
I just can't wrap my head around.

94
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:35,168
Why would you get worked up over this
even more so than your client?

95
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,878
The building was sold at a high price,

96
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,713
so you'll be getting a hefty sum.

97
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,592
Putting aside the money,
wouldn't this upset anyone?

98
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,510
Not at all.

99
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,889
Lawyers don't usually involve themselves
in matters like these.

100
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,392
European lawyers are quite strict
about these things.

101
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,977
What are you trying to say?

102
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,189
My experience tells me
that there's more to this.

103
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,233
A reason enough to make them act this way.

104
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,401
So…

105
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,448
What could that be?

106
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,326
Beats me.

107
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,290
But it must be something
that's more valuable than the building.

108
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,478
I saw this coming.

109
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,939
Those show-offs in flashy suits

110
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,025
are all the same.

111
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,776
Six days is nowhere enough.

112
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,779
I ought to put him in a guillotine choke
for 11 days straight.

113
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,574
Can you please sit down and talk?

114
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,825
Sit down.

115
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,954
He robbed us blind, didn't he?

116
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,914
I said we shouldn't trust him

117
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,333
and his good looks!

118
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,126
I knew it when he badmouthed my food.

119
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,378
It's obvious that I'm older than him,

120
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,880
but he spoke casually to me.

121
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,425
This Booralro or Vincenzo guy
is more heinous than the building owner.

122
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,346
You're right. He totally deceived us.

123
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,182
Should I go teach him a lesson?

124
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,519
How about I slam that face of his
on the ground?

125
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,355
Should I fling him to the ground?

126
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,397
Gosh.

127
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,484
I get that you're upset,
but you shouldn't hurt his face.

128
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,904
You should stop high-fiving the ground
whenever you're drunk.

129
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,948
Why are we always the ones
to get robbed blind?

130
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,534
We're not that stupid.

131
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,495
But we're not that smart, either.

132
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,372
You still don't know the times table.

133
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,539
I can't believe you.

134
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,377
I even got a new stamp
to seal the agreement.

135
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,548
Aren't Italian men
supposed to be gentlemen?

136
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,136
Not at all. They slack off
and are terrific liars.

137
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,181
They distract people
with their hand gestures.

138
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,476
-What should we do?
-You can…

139
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,145
You can just move to another temple.

140
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,316
Not at all. We will stay by your side
until the end.

141
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,278
I'll need to verify whether
he has truly deceived us or not.

142
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,656
Look what happened.
What's the point of that?

143
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,409
We already lost our building.

144
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,370
He was the one who called the reporters.

145
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,580
What's his plan? Why is he confusing us?

146
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,499
I'll make a thorough evaluation

147
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,252
on whether he's on our side or not.

148
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,632
Higher.

149
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,470
Okay, get ready.

150
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,181
Good.

151
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,647
-Four. Turn your waist. One, two, three.
-That's it.

152
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,940
All right. Two.

153
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,401
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

154
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,239
Our dear Deputy Minister Lee Nam-su.

155
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,625
All right.

156
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,006
So…

157
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,010
Just say that you, Minister Park Dae-jin,

158
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,847
and President Kim Song-hyeon
of JT Investment…

159
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,558
The three of you had some sushi

160
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,811
at a restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.
That's all I need from you.

161
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,564
What kind of story will you concoct
with the reporters

162
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,691
this time around?

163
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,778
Gosh. That's hurtful to hear.

164
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,405
I'm here to protect you.

165
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,492
I'm not going to reveal this to the public
or call any reporters.

166
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,078
You're planning to use JT Investment
to get to the top.

167
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,915
-I can't let you do that.
-Sir.

168
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,750
Do you know what my specialty is?

169
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,213
I can turn the most heartfelt stories
into the most heinous ones.

170
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,256
Is that so?

171
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,928
You don't believe me.

172
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,182
Minister Kim Ui-pyeong from Cheongbaek-ri

173
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,353
who had 1.07 billion won in debt
and no house to his name.

174
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,606
Who do you think accused him

175
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,110
of illegally accumulating two billion won
and made him end up

176
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,154
-killing himself?
-Look here, Ms. Choi!

177
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,323
Sir, you see,

178
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:20,829
I'm the person who can find faults
in the most innocent people.

179
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,539
Wait and see.

180
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,958
I'm sorry, sir.

181
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,627
Don't say that.

182
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm glad your family's safe.

183
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,177
The plaza…

184
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,765
The plaza building.

185
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,394
If Babel E&C demolishes it,
they'll find out.

186
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,732
You have to demolish it before they do.

187
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,738
<i>But there's more.</i>

188
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,284
<i>That secret room comes
with a special feature.</i>

189
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,203
3 YEARS AGO

190
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,580
What is it?

191
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,291
It has to do
with the structure of the room.

192
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,919
The room will be touching
the building's columns and the beams

193
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,048
and will be equipped with
a device that amplifies impact.

194
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,177
When the room is put
under a considerable impact,

195
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,472
the impact will cause the columns
and the beams to crack,

196
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,142
and the building will collapse.

197
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,112
<i>If anyone tries to break in
to steal the gold,</i>

198
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>the building itself</i>

199
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,412
<i>will be their graveyard.</i>

200
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,790
<i>And there is one more important thing.</i>

201
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,168
You must get rid of everyone

202
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,379
who has built that room
or is aware of its existence.

203
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,718
<i>Except for Mr. Cho and me, of course.</i>

204
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,893
For anyone apart from you
to get that gold,

205
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,978
the building…

206
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,983
will have to be demolished.

207
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,570
The family will gift you the blueprint

208
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,323
as proof of our friendship.

209
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,493
1 YEAR AGO

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,838
WANG SHAOLIN, A CHINESE TYCOON,
DIES OF CARDIAC ARREST AFTER A SWIM

211
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,229
Does his family know
about the secret room?

212
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
10 MONTHS AGO

213
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,274
No. It's just the three of us who know.

214
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,946
Given his nature,
I'm certain he didn't tell anyone.

215
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,284
Mr. Cho.

216
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,538
Care to make
some retirement money with me?

217
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,499
3 MONTHS AGO

218
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,464
<i>Babel E&C has begun purchasing
the shops and residences around the area.</i>

219
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,218
They also contacted me. What should I do?

220
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,721
Tell them that you're going to rebuild it.

221
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,765
We only need two days
after the construction begins.

222
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,935
Two days to move the gold.

223
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,895
NANYAK TEMPLE

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,403
<i>I need to kick them out
and demolish this building.</i>

225
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,322
<i>I have to retrieve the gold.</i>

226
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,076
When should I tell the workers to come?

227
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,204
Please tell your friend to come
three days later.

228
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,499
That'll do.

229
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,460
Okay. I got it.

230
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,671
Are you going to fix something in there?

231
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,216
Yes. We're going to fix the boiler.

232
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,095
By the way, why are you here?

233
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,224
I liked this text.

234
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,976
I see.

235
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,896
"Do not expect to get rich
through illegal means."

236
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,190
Yes, you shouldn't do that.

237
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:18,941
Sir.

238
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,069
"Don't be greedy for wealth or land.

239
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,487
Do what's right."

240
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,364
-Let's go inside.
-Thank you.

241
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,040
Praying on the cold floor

242
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,376
-gave me hemorrhoids.
-Oh, dear.

243
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,462
I know.

244
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,883
That sharp and heavy pain…

245
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,552
Let's install a boiler this weekend.

246
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,762
No!

247
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,315
I mean…

248
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,234
Why waste money

249
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,612
when they'll be demolishing
this place anyway?

250
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,406
I'll buy you an electric pad
that can cover this size

251
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,410
-and pay for the electricity.
-That's okay. Don't worry about it.

252
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,744
I said no!

253
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,454
Sir.

254
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,878
Please don't refuse my goodwill.

255
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,298
I'd like to show my appreciation
for you all.

256
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,224
He must've felt Buddha's presence
from beneath again.

257
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,350
I see.

258
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,189
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

259
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,649
-Gosh.
-Okay.

260
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,541
The witness of the recording
confessed to perjury.

261
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,501
Even if the second trial takes place,

262
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,545
it'll be dismissed
due to lack of evidence.

263
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,714
-It's over then.
-Yes.

264
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,716
My dad has no more cards up his sleeve.

265
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,261
Yu-chan must be getting old.

266
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,929
He's out of moves.

267
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,518
-Good luck wrapping things up.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,646
Cha-young!

269
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,398
You startled me! You…

270
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,026
Damn it. Gosh.

271
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,404
You have no class and no manners.

272
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,781
Look at you wearing sneakers at work.

273
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,619
Why did you pick him of all people?

274
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,163
It was you who picked me, sir.

275
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,248
I did?

276
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,294
I should quit drinking.

277
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,132
Cha-young.

278
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,634
Quiet down.

279
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,470
Cha-young. You see…

280
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,763
What? What is it?

281
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,891
Babel Pharmaceutical's
Drug Development Division called.

282
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,644
Qua… What was it?

283
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,979
-Quarantine?
-Right! One of its researchers

284
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,898
who was quarantined went missing.

285
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,149
What?

286
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,153
The Italian Intelligence Service
sent this.

287
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,279
Okay.

288
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,365
DIRECTOR TAE JONG-GU

289
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,494
After their boss died, Vincenzo Cassano,

290
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,455
the successor in line,
was targeted by the mob.

291
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,498
I believe…

292
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,210
I believe he fled here
to avoid getting killed.

293
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,755
What does a member of the Mafia
coming to Korea

294
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,924
have to do with our security?

295
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,550
What do you mean?

296
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,928
The most wicked gang in the world
advanced into--

297
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,847
"Advanced"?
Is that what you think this is?

298
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,393
Then, if two of them flew in,
it might as well be an invasion.

299
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,105
What if Vincenzo creates
a new gang in Korea?

300
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,731
He needs money to do that.

301
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,568
How much could he have brought
before fleeing?

302
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,153
He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.

303
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,572
Why would a member of the Mafia
hide money here?

304
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,033
There are plenty of places
better suited for that.

305
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,160
Please authorize this mission first.

306
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,912
I'll get to the bottom of this.

307
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,831
You'd better not spend any of our money.

308
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,333
For every 10 won, I'll deduct 100,000 won.

309
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,002
-Sir!
-Enough!

310
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,464
What was that? Yes.
Go help the yakuza division.

311
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,676
A yakuza breaded himself
with a stab knife yesterday…

312
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,012
No. He stabbed the bread with a knife…

313
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,973
Damn it. I can't even say it right.

314
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,974
Get out!

315
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,061
But they're the Mafia.

316
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,105
Like the movie, <i>The Godfather.</i>

317
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,231
Hey.

318
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,583
SHINKWANG BANK
1,198,345 WON

319
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,251
This is enough.

320
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,465
Just you wait, Vincenzo Cassano.

321
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,926
I'll pay for the mission
out of my own pocket.

322
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,682
TOTAL

323
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,850
INTEREST ON LOAN

324
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,143
REMAINING BALANCE

325
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,731
It's okay.

326
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,361
It's all right. I can do it.

327
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,365
<i>O sole mio</i>

328
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,325
REMAINING BALANCE

329
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,370
<i>You said that you told the truth
for the victims of Babel.</i>

330
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,705
<i>-Was everything a lie?
-Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

331
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,415
<i>Why did you lie?</i>

332
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,126
-I told you that you would regret it
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

333
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,753
one day.

334
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,588
<i>I felt guilty.</i>

335
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,424
-You sold your conscience for money
<i>-Any words to the victims?</i>

336
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,926
and broke the hearts of the bereaved.

337
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,594
<i>I'm sorry for causing confusion.</i>

338
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,347
<i>I'm truly sorry to everyone
that I've hurt. I'm sorry.</i>

339
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,896
What are you doing?

340
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,940
Getting rid
of the Babel lawsuit documents.

341
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,733
It's really over now.

342
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,318
Don't be absurd.

343
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,153
-It's not over--
-Until it's over?

344
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,782
-But it is really over now.
-We still have hope.

345
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,575
Trials are full of twists and turns.

346
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,119
And they always work against us.

347
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,495
Maybe not this time around.

348
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,333
-God help us.
-Oh, God.

349
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,584
You little…

350
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,345
Back for more tricks, are you?

351
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,098
I have a favor.

352
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,144
Please share with me the documents
you have on Babel E&C.

353
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,186
What for?

354
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
I see.

355
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,941
You want to study your enemy
before defeating them?

356
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,568
Gosh.

357
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
Are you still pulling this stunt?

358
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,071
Yes.

359
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,368
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

360
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,786
You should leave.

361
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,961
The one who helps out the losing team
in a war isn't an enemy but--

362
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,463
An ally. Right?

363
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,464
You little…

364
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,093
That ally…

365
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,916
Sir.

366
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,131
There are things that can only be verified
through trust.

367
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,968
If you want to win,

368
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,348
give me a chance instead of doubting me.

369
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,609
-Ju-sung.
-Yes?

370
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,320
Hand him all the documents

371
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,949
-we have on Babel E&C.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,585
It's been two days.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

373
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,671
Look at her.

374
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,548
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:22,967
Seriously.

376
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,556
I told you to keep a close eye
on all the newly employed researchers.

377
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,474
I didn't want them to complain,

378
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,601
so I got them to stay
at the chairman's villa.

379
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,021
If that researcher

380
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,357
talks nonsense, we'll lose this suit.

381
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,776
And It'll be the end
for that new drug as well!

382
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,736
I'm truly sorry.

383
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,948
Do the higher-ups know?

384
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,366
No, ma'am. They don't.

385
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,952
Let's keep it that way.

386
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,453
Don't you dare tell them.

387
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,708
Okay.

388
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,134
This is driving me nuts.

389
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,636
No matter how hard we cover it up,

390
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,680
one whistleblower will end everything.

391
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:14,602
-What if they go to your dad?
-Gosh!

392
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,814
I didn't say it out loud
because I didn't want to jinx it.

393
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,443
Sorry, Cha-young.

394
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,155
They can go to the police,
the prosecution, or the reporters.

395
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,157
Just not my dad.

396
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,456
Seeing how we haven't heard anything,
I don't think they're there yet.

397
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,791
If they knew anything,

398
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,835
they wouldn't go to an incompetent lawyer.

399
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,341
Who is that?

400
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,301
-Chairman Jang Han-seo of Babel.
-What?

401
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,388
Hello, sir.

402
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,850
Who are you?

403
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,394
I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
from Law Firm Wusang,

404
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,812
in charge of the Babel lawsuit.

405
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,734
I heard about you.
Didn't she ask to borrow my villa?

406
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,446
That's right.
I had to because it was the safest place.

407
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,909
It's fine. I rarely go there.
Tell me if you need anything.

408
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,287
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

409
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,789
Yes, sir.

410
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:25,923
I get that he's a chairman, but how can he
talk down to us on our first encounter?

411
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,633
And he's young too.

412
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,762
Anyone who's rich and powerful

413
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,014
can do so even if they're younger than me.

414
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,768
-I see.
-Hold on.

415
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,147
Thanks to you, I have a bad feeling.

416
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,149
I'm going home.

417
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,610
Already?

418
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,157
Want some steak? I got paid yesterday.

419
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,618
No, thanks. I have somewhere to go.

420
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,998
She always leaves without me.

421
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,252
Cha-young! Your car's over there!

422
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,129
The other way!

423
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,011
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

424
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,148
BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS SUED
AFTER TEST SUBJECT DIES

425
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,192
Mr. Nam.

426
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,530
May I see the documents
regarding the lawsuit, please?

427
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,783
-Why?
-I'm just curious.

428
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,827
Well…

429
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,371
I need his permission.

430
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,998
Hand them over to him.

431
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,833
Every single one of them.

432
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,044
Yes, sir.

433
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,422
Here are your documents.

434
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,141
You did well dealing with Lee Nam-su.

435
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:00,726
Good work.

436
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,145
He was quick-witted,
so we could wrap it up quickly.

437
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,022
-Who's next?
-That's it for now.

438
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,109
He's going to hand it over
to Prosecutor Seo U-yeong.

439
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,652
Prosecutor Seo U-yeong?

440
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,364
Mr. Seo.

441
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,034
This isn't your nephew's specialty.

442
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,078
All the more reason to hire him.
That's how he'll learn.

443
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,833
Also, there's something you must do
right now.

444
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,005
It's about my colleague,
Chief Kim Won-u's scandal.

445
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,465
Can you wrap that up for us?

446
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,848
The sexually assaulted victim
testified against him.

447
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,684
Another woman who was at the scene
also testified,

448
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,980
and the footage of the villa was found,
which is more than enough evidence.

449
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:51,944
Exactly. That's why I want you
to touch it up, so it looks less serious.

450
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,738
This matter doesn't only pertain
to Mr. Kim.

451
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,075
The honor of our office is at stake.

452
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,828
Sir, let me pour you a glass.

453
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,921
Damn it.

454
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,552
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

455
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,766
How many times has it been just today?

456
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,691
How do I sound him out?

457
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,822
Cha-young, you can do it.

458
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,840
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

459
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,800
<i>He's sleeping soundly.</i>

460
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,927
<i>I guess there's nothing going on.</i>

461
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,976
BABEL E&C, BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS

462
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,188
What are you doing?

463
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,316
Why are you back?

464
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,112
-Answer me.
-Did you see my wallet?

465
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,780
I lost it.

466
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,324
It's not here.

467
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,534
I cleaned the entire office today.

468
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,581
Where could it be?

469
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,541
I can guarantee that it's not here.

470
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,341
Why is he reading these?

471
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,051
Because he wanted to.

472
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,303
"Know your enemy
if you want to beat them."

473
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,763
What?

474
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,514
Babel Group is…

475
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,686
Would you mind me being vulgar?

476
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,938
Knock yourself out.

477
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,483
They're assholes.

478
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:56,818
"Assholes"?

479
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,529
They do everything the yakuza
and the Mafia do.

480
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,198
Everyone knows that.

481
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,367
But some lawyers help them
stay out of jail.

482
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,953
Mr. "Vincenzo Quassano."

483
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,329
Why are you doing this?

484
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,248
They're really out of line.

485
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,458
They're just like the Mafia.

486
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,878
And Law Firm Wusang, their partner,
is no exception.

487
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,380
To be clear,

488
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,008
Law Firm Wusang is a parasite
that mooches off those assholes.

489
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,134
Correct.

490
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,096
Assholes like them should be made to pay.

491
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,266
"Pay". I like the sound of that.

492
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,060
They ought to.

493
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,771
You guys click very well.

494
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,107
How about you two start streaming online?

495
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,485
Call it, "Hong-Vin TV," or "Hong-Qua TV."

496
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,904
That sounds nice.

497
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,823
I should get going now.

498
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,741
I'll be glad to help
if you need anything else.

499
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,119
-Do you have more?
-Yes, we do. We have plenty.

500
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,330
No, thank you. This will suffice.

501
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,832
Sir. Your tie.

502
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,126
Thank you.

503
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,961
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

504
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,590
Goodness, look at her.

505
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,138
Was this your plan B?

506
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,807
Provoking my dad to continue fighting
against Babel

507
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,143
while you make a profit off the lawsuit?

508
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,602
Am I right?

509
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,354
I'm going to eat. Please leave.

510
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,318
Unfortunately, we're closed for the day

511
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,902
since we ran out of ingredients.

512
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,906
You can go to Yeongho Snack Bar.

513
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,076
They have the best <i>tteokbokki</i>
in this neighborhood.

514
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,424
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

515
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,885
Welcome.

516
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,389
I won't sell anything to you.

517
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,433
-But I want to eat.
-I said no food for you.

518
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,020
Then, I'll buy it.

519
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,650
I never said you could sit there.

520
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,569
Do you not want to eat?

521
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,327
Sit down.

522
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,706
-What do you want?
-Take your pick.

523
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,333
<i>Tteokbokki</i>

524
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,753
Flour rice cakes, traditional <i>gochujang</i>,
and a bit of artificial--

525
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,670
Two servings of <i>tteokbokki</i>.

526
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,634
You're pretty basic.

527
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,760
"Basic"?

528
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,512
You know "asshole" but not "basic"?

529
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,681
It means "common."

530
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,894
Let's make this clear.

531
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,898
I have no reason to provoke your dad.
I'm preparing myself for war.

532
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,320
Your enemy has tanks and armored vehicles.

533
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,531
What use would 200 stones be?

534
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,074
Do you think that's all I have?

535
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,619
Yes. The weak usually resort to
throwing stones or butting heads

536
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,704
when they are out of options.

537
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,208
I didn't think of head-butting.

538
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,297
Go back to Italy and fight
against those you're used to.

539
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,633
This country doesn't suit you.

540
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,135
Why not?

541
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,139
In Italy, only the Mafia
perform such heinous deeds.

542
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,975
But everyone here runs
their own gangs and cartels.

543
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,894
The National Assembly, prosecution,
police, public offices, and companies.

544
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,104
All of them.

545
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,482
It doesn't matter who you're up against.

546
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,609
It'll be a grueling ordeal for you.

547
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,527
Why?

548
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,155
Because that's Korea.

549
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,953
-Thanks for the advice.
-Your <i>tteokbokki</i> is ready.

550
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,209
May I have a glass of water?

551
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,045
You can get it yourself.

552
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,798
That is a water filter dispenser.

553
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,558
-Let's eat.
-Thank…

554
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,486
Happiness isn't far away.

555
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,196
-Do you like it?
-Yes!

556
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,408
I'm home. I'm hungry.

557
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,966
What are you doing?

558
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,136
What?

559
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,096
Didn't I tell you not to smoke?

560
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,390
I didn't.
I was just standing next to them.

561
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,269
I told you I'd give you a good beating
if you lied.

562
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
Snap out of it! Don't hit your son!

563
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,609
If you don't want to die,
put your guard up.

564
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,945
Mom! Come on, it hurts.

565
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,863
One, two.

566
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,032
You little brat!

567
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,580
Does she have a black belt?

568
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,712
Goodness.

569
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,384
Oh, dear.

570
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,770
You want me to cover for a filthy bastard
and take all the blame?

571
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,526
Let's go.

572
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,246
I'll destroy each and every
last one of you, you assholes.

573
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,919
Hello, there!

574
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,760
I'll just cut to the chase.

575
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,139
Ms. Choi. I mean, Myung-hee.

576
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,558
Hey.

577
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,562
Join my law firm. Okay?

578
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,358
You impudent brat. Explain yourself.

579
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,819
Prosecutor General Hwang and Mr. Seo.

580
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,239
Everyone knows they're trying
to form a cartel of sorts

581
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,033
at the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

582
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,285
One that's impenetrable
by even the Reform Committee.

583
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,954
Do you think they'll let you in? No way!

584
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,832
They'll use and discard you
like they did today.

585
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,417
Enough already.

586
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,796
Just drink up and stop nagging me.

587
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,256
<i>I'm not nagging.</i>

588
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,510
<i>If you join us,</i>

589
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,222
I'll let you bring down that prosecution.

590
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,557
Have you gone insane?

591
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,229
You know I'm helping out
Babel Group, right?

592
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,691
They'll back us up no matter what.

593
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,610
They are just a company.

594
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:57,072
In three years, they'll be
one of the twenty richest companies.

595
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,491
Their drugs are second to none.

596
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,827
Also, their chairman has a few
loose screws and is easy to handle.

597
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:08,375
You must have a good reason
to be cleaning up after their messes.

598
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,376
Exactly.

599
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,380
Even though I'm cleaning up their shit,

600
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,589
I keep getting richer.

601
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,219
Unbelievable.

602
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,222
So you want us to act like their bidets?

603
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,516
I'll do all the trivial work.

604
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,976
You just need to leave them
a solid impression.

605
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,896
Have you been working
as a salesman instead?

606
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,857
Just choose me
like you choose your clothes.

607
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,485
I heard it takes you ten minutes
to shop for clothes.

608
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,280
The alcohol is getting the better of me.

609
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,660
Exactly how crazy is this chairman?

610
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,064
It's all my fault.

611
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,734
I should've kept an eye
on the researchers, but I failed.

612
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,736
I'll take care of it as soon as…

613
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,539
I'm sorry for the delay
in the Babel Tower construction.

614
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,583
There were issues with the building owner.

615
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,084
I'll also take care of…

616
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,593
I promise

617
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,304
to be more thorough from now on.

618
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,515
I promise I won't disappoint you again.

619
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,188
Please give me one more chance.

620
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,983
I promise I'll do better.

621
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,800
Look at me.

622
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,345
Don't tell me you've already run out
of ingredients.

623
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:08,888
No.

624
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,767
If it wasn't Italy,
where did you learn to cook?

625
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,813
Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province.

626
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,149
At a place called
Mom's Touch Cooking Academy.

627
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,860
"Mom's Touch"?

628
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,657
Serve me food until I can finally
get a taste of a mom's touch.

629
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,450
But I'm not a mom.

630
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:34,289
If not, then I'll have no choice
but to expose you.

631
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,207
-Sorry?
-<i>Risotto allo zafferano.</i>

632
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,758
Saffron risotto.

633
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,553
Okay. I'll get it ready.

634
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,514
It tastes like vomited baby food…

635
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,308
How should I put it?

636
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,144
Yes. And it's been mixed
in wine and broth.

637
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,942
You have a knack for making awful food.

638
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,791
If you look over here…

639
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,584
-Sir.
-Yes?

640
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,003
We need to go somewhere.

641
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,005
Where?

642
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,220
They won't see you without an appointment.

643
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,555
-Let's ask.
-What?

644
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,269
How may I help you?

645
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,355
I'm here to see Mr. Na Deok-jin
of Investment and Development.

646
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,898
-Have you called beforehand?
-No.

647
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,193
I'm afraid you can't meet him.

648
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,909
BILL OF INDICTMENT

649
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,538
Tell him he has a bill of indictment
for threatening and abetting an abduction.

650
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,837
When did you get that?

651
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,516
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

652
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,769
Let me see the bill. Let's read it.

653
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,577
BILL OF INDICTMENT

654
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,162
THREAT AND ABETTING AN ABDUCTION

655
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,501
It's empty.

656
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,838
I lied, so we could meet.

657
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,593
We've paid you enough already. Why…

658
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,472
-But why are you so clingy?
-We're not clingy.

659
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,307
We just want to correct what's wrong.

660
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,685
Sure. Then, feel free to sue or report me.

661
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,520
Do as you please.

662
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,814
Or demonstrate in front of the Blue House

663
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,941
-and shave your head.
-No.

664
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,944
I thought I'd do the same as you did.

665
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,824
We'll kidnap your family

666
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,743
and force you to cancel the contract.

667
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,414
Are you a die-hard fan of <i>The Godfather</i>?

668
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,208
Are you mimicking the Mafia

669
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,126
since you're from Italy?

670
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,593
I'm glad you asked.

671
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,679
If we were in Italy,

672
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,849
you would've become a fertilizer
for the vineyards.

673
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,063
You would have become some cheap wine
being sold on a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

674
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,610
I'm not here to negotiate but to warn you.

675
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,946
We're not going to take it anymore.

676
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:37,990
Okay.

677
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,586
Was that how you did things in Italy?

678
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,046
At times.

679
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,924
I loved what you said.

680
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,760
"Vineyard fertilizer.
Buy-one-get-one-free."

681
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,805
"Hey.

682
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,850
You're buy-two-get-one-free."

683
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,811
I should use it sometime.

684
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,109
Let's eat. It's on me.
Two meals for the price of one.

685
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,362
RESIGNATION LETTER

686
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,576
Some company must've given you an offer.

687
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,744
Law Firm Wusang? Wintis?

688
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,956
-Ko and Gu?
-No.

689
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,709
I just want to rest.

690
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,544
Don't sugarcoat it.

691
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,005
What's the real reason?

692
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:35,756
I just…

693
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sick of being your hound.

694
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,888
That's a bit harsh.

695
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,389
I'm sorry to break it to you,

696
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,726
but wherever you go,
you'll always be a hound on a leash.

697
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,894
Probably.

698
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:49,979
However,

699
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,441
my leash will probably be longer.

700
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,028
And they'll feed me better.

701
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,159
Goodbye, guys.

702
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,244
Where do you think you're going?

703
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,456
Hey, Ms. Choi. Hey!

704
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,300
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

705
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:33,022
Prosecutor or not, I'm going to
destroy all of you before I leave.

706
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,832
What's with the meeting?

707
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,878
This way, please.

708
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,468
You splurged, didn't you?

709
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,345
Isn't that Prosecutor Choi?

710
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,681
Sit down.

711
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,061
I'm sorry to gather you all so suddenly.

712
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,438
We have an important guest.

713
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,733
I'm sure you all know her.
It's Prosecutor Choi Myung-hee.

714
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,112
From this day on,

715
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,949
she will be a senior lawyer at Wusang.

716
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:31,455
Soon, she will represent us on my behalf.

717
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,049
I knew you'd be happy.

718
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:46,220
Wusang will be invincible.

719
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,139
Please say a word or two.

720
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,725
I have two things to say. Number one.

721
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,687
One who achieves small victories
will eventually achieve big ones.

722
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,064
Number two. I beg you.

723
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,359
Let's not work hard
if it can't be appreciated. That's all.

724
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,572
Clap, will you?

725
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,495
Look at her acting all tough
from the get-go.

726
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,124
She just got here.
How could she represent our law firm?

727
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,417
She's a mere rookie.

728
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,377
Well, she was the best prospector there.

729
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,131
Ms. Hong should be the one
to represent us.

730
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,675
She achieved the most out of all of us.

731
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,556
You're not consoling or bashing me.
What is this?

732
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,683
Bash you?

733
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,685
We're just upset by the unfair treatment.

734
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,147
But I can see you grinning.

735
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,028
She's so quick to notice.

736
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,280
How did she know we were happy?

737
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,867
I knew it ever since
he deducted the withholding taxes.

738
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,660
Gosh.

739
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,471
I get you,

740
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,847
but you don't have soul.

741
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,558
You look more like a patient
than a zombie.

742
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,477
I could do just as much.

743
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,022
Like this.

744
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,692
You're so good. I can do it too.

745
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:29,031
I'm a pretty zombie.

746
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,202
-Goodness, you're terrifying.
-Go away.

747
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,704
-That's not how you do it.
-Try that again, Larry.

748
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,456
Not like this. Do this.

749
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,668
That's it.

750
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,878
No, try harder. Put your back into it.

751
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,214
That's it.

752
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,268
-Goodness.
-Wait.

753
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,229
I heard some gagging noises.

754
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,565
What were you doing?

755
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,943
I was chosen to coach the zombies

756
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:10,114
for the upcoming <i>Train to Ulsan Part Two</i>.
I was practicing.

757
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,448
We were helping him out.

758
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,700
I see.

759
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,702
Yes.

760
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,745
Good luck.

761
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,041
Let's go.

762
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:22,918
Okay.

763
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,464
Darn it.

764
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,675
-How humiliating.
-Oh, no.

765
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,803
His cold gaze.

766
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,057
He probably saw the roof of my mouth.

767
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,561
What should I do?

768
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,106
What should I do?

769
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,197
Let us know if you need extras
for the movie.

770
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,364
I'll do my best.

771
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,909
Me, too. I'm serious.

772
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,744
-No, you can't.
-Please.

773
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,747
No, I need to ask them for permission.

774
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,878
From what I've seen of Babel E&C,

775
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,131
they forcibly evict the residents
one week after the notice.

776
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,966
Yes, they've always done that.

777
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,469
They demolish the non-residential areas

778
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,512
and instill fear
in the remaining residents.

779
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,349
It's downright illegal,
but Law Firm Wusang has their back.

780
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,228
Isn't there a law
that protects the tenants?

781
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,441
I heard they need to pay
a premium compensation to the tenants

782
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,027
and negotiate the demolition date
with an officer.

783
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,111
That's what I read.

784
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,698
You've studied a lot.

785
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,996
They were being too ridiculous
that I had to read up on it.

786
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,748
I see.

787
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,127
Those rules exist, but they force
the tenants out with a small sum.

788
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,755
People get hurt or die too.

789
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,842
They'll probably carry out
the eviction suit first.

790
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,094
We should get ready.

791
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,804
Isn't the biggest issue here

792
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,348
the forced illegal demolition?

793
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,474
Yes.

794
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,102
They'll make a move in a day or two.

795
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:05,729
But there's nothing we can do.

796
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,233
Gosh.

797
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,530
Here. Do you want one?

798
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,991
-No, thank you.
-Then, why…

799
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,665
Do you drink?

800
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,424
You've never <i>makgeolli</i> before?

801
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,843
-No.
-I see.

802
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,971
It only gives a mild hangover,
so drink up.

803
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,597
Here. Bottoms up.

804
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,808
Here you go.

805
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,113
I can finally taste it
now that I've had my second glass.

806
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,783
In that case, drink up.

807
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,327
Here you go.

808
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,915
Cheers.

809
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,686
By the way, should I congratulate you
for diving headfirst into hell?

810
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,232
I'm fighting against Babel
because I'm stupid.

811
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:33,984
But not you.

812
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,279
By the way,

813
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,618
are you also a public defender?

814
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,704
I am. For one person.

815
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,708
I truly pity her.

816
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,462
She was falsely charged with murder.

817
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,091
And yet, she accepted it

818
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,635
and made peace with her pancreatic cancer.

819
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,848
Why

820
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,310
would she do that?

821
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:15,484
She believes she's being punished
for abandoning her son in the past.

822
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,946
She says feeling guilty isn't enough.

823
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:23,242
There are people who readily accept
their punishment.

824
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,287
And there are those who are shameless
even after committing crimes.

825
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,206
In any case,

826
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,584
only the kindhearted and the weak suffer.

827
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,170
I know you won't get it.

828
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,132
For the past two days,

829
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,053
I experienced firsthand

830
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,514
how the weak suffered.

831
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,018
I couldn't do anything.

832
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,814
So I became even more furious.

833
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,026
Those who are truly weak endure
the feeling of helplessness and rage

834
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,821
until the day they die.

835
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,790
I have a question.

836
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,669
What's the story
behind your law firm's name?

837
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,009
I don't defend my clients.

838
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,761
I become their last straw, a <i>jipuragi</i>.

839
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:29,641
When they don't have anyone to lean on,

840
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,728
they can still grab onto me.

841
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,606
I am their last straw.

842
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,696
Excuse me.

843
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:46,700
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

844
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,039
Hello, I'm listening.

845
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,625
<i>Hello?</i>

846
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,926
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

847
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,970
Was that a prank call?

848
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,854
I heard this is how you pour drinks here.

849
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,110
You seem quite genuine today.

850
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,363
Or have I become dull?

851
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,992
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

852
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,412
You need to turn around and drink.

853
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,164
Yes.

854
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,629
Just turn halfway.

855
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,381
Halfway.

856
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,558
We've pretty much won
the Babel Pharmaceuticals case.

857
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,351
Ms. Hong just needs to finish up.

858
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,104
Babel E&C is the problem here.

859
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,773
We need to demolish a plaza
in Geumga-dong.

860
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,941
Brace yourselves.

861
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,985
Why do they need to brace themselves?

862
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,780
It's quite sly.

863
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,991
Demolishing it right away
would be illegal,

864
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,493
so we bring in heavy equipment
for a so-called cleanup

865
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,370
and accidentally damage the building.

866
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,205
The tenants move out in fear,

867
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,582
and Babel claims it's a mistake.

868
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,166
The building becomes vacant in a few days.

869
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,044
Legal or not, we'll get the job done

870
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,713
because they trust us.

871
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,509
Lawyers are better than prosecutors
at making people shit their pants.

872
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:30,345
Such assholes.

873
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,640
She says that all the time.

874
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,476
And…

875
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,563
Oh, dear.

876
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,568
Your dad is once again leading
the Development Opposition Committee.

877
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:48,071
What a fun life he's living.

878
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,285
Shouldn't we estimate the scale of damage?

879
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,747
Thankfully, it'll be smaller than
the redevelopment in Yucheon-dong.

880
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,374
I believe four people still died there.

881
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,834
That's not bad.

882
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,337
Twelve people died
during Yonghu-dong's redevelopment.

883
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,340
It's fine. They'll crawl out
when push comes to shove.

884
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,176
Right. Don't forget your dad.

885
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,517
Let's see.

886
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,360
I heard that they're demolishing it.

887
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,990
They're so cruel. There are people--

888
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,200
It's not cruel!

889
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,746
It wouldn't be so cruel
if they moved out willingly.

890
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,130
What's with those people?
How can they be so dense?

891
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,175
It's easier said than done.

892
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,223
Their lawyer is the one who's the worst.

893
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,937
If he's a lawyer,
he should be more levelheaded.

894
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,965
Hello.

895
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,008
Doesn't it feel like
your head's been split open?

896
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,428
Mine's already smashed.

897
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,056
Yes. I'm having a pretty bad hangover.

898
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,601
Come over. Let's eat something.

899
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,478
<i>I'll text you my address.</i>

900
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,604
But I…

901
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,693
<i>Come in.</i>

902
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,070
It's a mess, isn't it?

903
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,906
The soup just needs to boil,
so please sit down.

904
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,491
There's nothing worth looking at.

905
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,786
All right.

906
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,963
You must have another daughter.

907
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,590
What? No.

908
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,050
That's Cha-young.

909
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:14,968
What?

910
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,687
I see.

911
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,569
Hello, Chairman Jang.

912
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,240
They've informed me
that they're ready for the demolition.

913
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,535
We'll be ready by tomorrow as well.

914
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,329
Yes, sir.

915
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,332
Don't worry.

916
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,793
This is our job.

917
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:52,547
I believe they'll start working
around 11 p.m. tomorrow.

918
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,008
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

919
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,930
Cha-young!

920
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,849
-What is it this time?
-They're--

921
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,768
What? What is it?

922
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,937
Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

923
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,106
That's when they'll demolish the building.

924
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,402
I heard Mr. Han speaking
with that impudent chairman.

925
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,073
They're ready, and they'll do it tomorrow.

926
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,449
What?

927
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,791
How is it? Don't you feel so much better?

928
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,084
-Right?
-Yes.

929
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,586
I make the best--

930
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,713
Can you please pick up?

931
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,340
I called you more than 30 times.

932
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,675
You're so noisy.

933
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,677
What is it this time?

934
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,263
Why do you still have these hanging?

935
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,181
You're going to donate them?

936
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,518
Eat while you're here. Come.

937
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,773
There's a serious problem.

938
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,276
-This isn't a time to be eating.
-What is it?

939
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,865
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

940
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,449
See? You screen my calls.

941
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,660
-Why do you ignore my calls? Why?
-Sorry?

942
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,665
I see. One moment, please.

943
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,083
Hang on.

944
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,800
I'd like to tell you about what they did
to their test subjects.

945
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,635
So there were problems, weren't there?

946
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,096
Yes. I can't tell you the details
over the phone.

947
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,514
I'd like to meet soon.

948
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,516
Of course.

949
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,351
Go ahead.

950
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,604
All right.

951
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,857
I'll head over there right now. Goodbye.

952
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,198
Babel E&C is--

953
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,992
This is urgent. Speak with him, okay?

954
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,911
Dad! Mr. Hong!

955
01:01:58,757 --> 01:01:59,799
What is it?

956
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:10,727
They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.

957
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,730
Evacuate the tenants right now.

958
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,608
They say they'll avoid
the residential area,

959
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,985
but who knows what'll happen?

960
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,490
I've only met you three days ago,

961
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,533
but this is the first time
you seem worried.

962
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:31,122
I'm worried about none other than myself.

963
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,375
If my dad gets hurt during the demolition,

964
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,293
it'll do me no good.

965
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,756
Think about it.
What will my colleagues think of me?

966
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,424
I see.

967
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:50,183
What is this place? A crime scene?

968
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,189
Darn it. You're done, right?

969
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,566
Unbelievable.

970
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,736
I told him many times
not to pile up the dirty dishes.

971
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:19,879
MOTEL

972
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,521
Hello, Mr. Yu Min-chul.

973
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:02,380
<i>They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.</i>

974
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,674
<i>Evacuate the tenants right now.</i>

975
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,435
<i>How can I stop them?</i>

976
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,104
<i>How?</i>

977
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:23,693
<i>What?</i>

978
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,236
Tonight?

979
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,946
Yes, at 11 p.m.

980
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,782
How could you tell us now?

981
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,368
-You're unbelievable.
-When they come,

982
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:35,705
I could grab and nail them to the ground.

983
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,624
Since I know martial arts,

984
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,085
I'm afraid I might kill them.

985
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,336
Nail them, my foot.

986
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,380
We should evacuate. Do you want to die?

987
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:47,217
Goodness. Babel, those assholes.

988
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,177
I hope they all go under!

989
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,386
Is there a solution?

990
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,390
Mr. Hong is busily--

991
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,474
Busily doing what?

992
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,558
Tell us.

993
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,227
I didn't see him all day.

994
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:03,650
This is where we live and work.

995
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:08,363
If we evacuate,
we'll be leaving behind everything.

996
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:14,327
I bought all my utensils new last month.

997
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,537
Me too.

998
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,081
I got a loan two months ago
and bought a new piano.

999
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,416
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

1000
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,667
Mr. Cassano.

1001
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,087
Say something, will you?

1002
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,049
Goodness, that damn man.

1003
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,676
What the hell is he doing?

1004
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,012
Who cares? Let's go pack our things.

1005
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,808
I'll protest outside and distract them.

1006
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,269
What the hell are you doing?

1007
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:46,025
Sir, you don't have time
to be liking photos online.

1008
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,153
-What?
-What is he liking?

1009
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:53,032
Come up with a solution, will you?

1010
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,131
IMAGES MATCHING VINCENZO CASSANO
SEARCHED ON 13:11

1011
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,843
Isn't anyone in here?

1012
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,596
Hold on.

1013
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,389
Who locked the door?

1014
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,685
Damn it. Hey, open up.

1015
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:26,024
Vincenzo Cassano…

1016
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,526
Vincenzo Cassano.

1017
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:34,324
<i>O sole mio</i>

1018
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,244
-Pack everything!
-Goodness!

1019
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,000
Hey…

1020
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,050
<i>Is that true?</i>

1021
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,218
Yes.

1022
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,095
I called you yesterday,
but you weren't picking up.

1023
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,890
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

1024
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,308
What time is it?

1025
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,478
Let me think. What should I do?

1026
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,066
What should I do?

1027
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,738
ATTORNEY HONG CHA-YOUNG

1028
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,131
I'll call you back.

1029
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,094
Nothing is easy these days.

1030
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,681
Everything requires so much work.
It's such a headache.

1031
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:44,978
All notable paintings
have several layers of paint.

1032
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:49,107
But then again, it's our job
to paint over without leaving a trace.

1033
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,237
-When will I get to see the chairman?
-Right.

1034
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,406
In two days.

1035
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,660
He has great expectations for you.

1036
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,247
I need to see for myself how crazy he is.

1037
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,042
Sir.

1038
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,045
Why are you here?

1039
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:12,755
I have something urgent to report.

1040
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,049
What is it?

1041
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,885
I caught wind of something
at the Babel headquarters.

1042
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,430
One of the researchers
of Babel Pharmaceuticals

1043
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,016
ran away during the quarantine.

1044
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,392
What?

1045
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,893
Damn it.

1046
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,604
They've dropped a giant bomb on us.

1047
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,273
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1048
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,536
Shouldn't you go?

1049
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,330
There's nothing I can do.

1050
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:10,897
Where are you, Dad?

1051
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,900
Why are you still there?

1052
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,943
Don't worry. I won't die.

1053
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,821
Cut that nonsense and get out of there.

1054
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,575
I'm turning my phone off again.
You're distracting me.

1055
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,454
Dad!

1056
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,331
Oh, come on!

1057
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,541
Wait!

1058
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,223
The stress is killing me.

1059
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,936
-Hello, sir.
-Hey!

1060
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,020
Where are you?

1061
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,064
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

1062
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,950
Come over here.

1063
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,202
Okay.

1064
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:08,704
All right.

1065
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,540
Sir, we're ready.

1066
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,588
All right! Let's go!

1067
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:18,965
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1068

Come on.

1069
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,304
Damn it.

1070
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,379

These men love this party.

01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,674
They've been complimenting.

1082
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,342
Hello. Thank you for coming.

We still have a lot of time,
so please enjoy the party.

1085
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,646
Let's leave him here. Let's go.

1086
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,399
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

1087
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,608
We don't need him.

1088
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,235
Wait.

1089
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,617

01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,471
Excuse me for a second, sir.

1095
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,223
Hello, sir.

1096
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,976
He's the owner of the shop next door.

1097
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:04,977
I see.

1098
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,729
Hello. Thank you for coming.

1099
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,855
The spaghetti is good.

1100
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,149
-Please escort them.
-This way.

1101
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,696
<i>Have you grasped the core problem
of this lawsuit?</i>

1102
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,615
Drugs? Cartels? Do you think this is
some American TV show?

1103
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,784
Stupid idiot.

1104
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,119
Hey, it's Vincenzo!

1105
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,580
<i>They're not businessmen. They're monsters.</i>

1106
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,708
<i>They couldn't care less
about the lives of others.</i>

1107
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,086
Can you not represent
Babel Pharmaceuticals?

1108
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,964
<i>That will be the end of you, you brat.</i>

1109
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,340
<i>I will not cave in without a fight.</i>

1110
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,342
Why are you so reckless?

1111
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,137
For me, running away
isn't the coward's way out.

1112
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,723
<i>It's putting other people in danger.</i>

1113
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,474
<i>Don't try anything funny.</i>

1114
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:09,059
You'll be dead if anything happens to me.
