1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,269
You jerk.

2
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:21,026
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

3
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,944
If you take one more step…

4
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:28,033
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

5
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:29,409
Just stay still.

6
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,162
Everyone, stay still.

7
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:36,416
Babel E&amp;C bought this building
through an illegal means.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,210
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

9
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:39,419
Now!

10
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,507
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

11
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:47,427
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

12
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:53,141
This building belongs to me.

13
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:56,394
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

14
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:57,813
-What?
-What did he say?

15
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,064
He said…

16
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:05,487
È mio!

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,155
È mio!

18
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,995
Take your men and get lost.
Then, I'll help you back up.

19
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,372
I'll get lost. Help me up.

20
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,290
-What?
-I'll leave, so help me up.

21
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:19,584
-Promise me.
-Seriously. I promise.

22
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:20,752
Do I really need to?

23
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:22,671
Okay. I can't straighten my finger.

24
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:25,257
-This hurts. Oh, my finger.
-Stamp it.

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,758
You cruel bastard.

26
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:28,176
Come on. I stamped it.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,719
Help me up. Hurry.

28
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,930
Go on. Help him.

29
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:35,225
Bring me up! Hurry up!

30
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,810
Boss!

31
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,148
Be careful.

32
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,483
-Goodness!
-It hurts!

33
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,152
-Boss, are you okay?
-Hey!

34
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,154
Boss, are you all right?

35
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:49,364
Oh, no! You're bleeding!

36
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:54,578
This could leave a scar.

37
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,913
This could leave a scar. Damn it.

38
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,378
-Kill that bastard.
-Grab your weapons.

39
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:06,047
I know you're a lowlife punk,

40
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:09,467
but aren't you breaking your promise
way too soon?

41
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:11,553
Let's go!

42
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:17,350
Hey! Stop it! Stop right there.

43
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,227
-What?
-Seriously?

44
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,855
Mr. Park, you should leave.

45
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,273
There are reporters outside.

46
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,733
Reporters? Why?

47
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,776
How should I know?

48
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,486
All right.

49
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,489
-Let's quickly disperse.
-Leave.

50
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:32,991
-What?
-Get lost.

51
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:36,578
Hey. Hey!

52
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,289
Stay right there.

53
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,167
I'll hang you from this very plaza soon.

54
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,336
Damn it!

55
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,254
Damn it, this scar!

56
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,966
-Goodness.
-Those bastards.

57
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,885
What was that?

58
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,220
We should talk.

59
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,268
Gosh.

60
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,939
Didn't I tell you not to fool around?

61
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:06,024
I wasn't fooling around.

62
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:09,110
I told you Mr. Cho was threatened
to sign the contract.

63
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:11,529
"Threatened"? Gosh.

64
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,448
That was quite a stunt you put up there.

65
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:15,659
You guys are amazing.

66
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,035
Why are you so childish?

67
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,453
Why won't you…

68
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,831
Why won't he trust me?

69
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,835
Seeing how you're speaking Italian,
you must feel guilty.

70
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,545
Shut up!

71
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,589
It sounds like you're cursing.

72
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,301
Think about it.

73
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,513
Why would I still be here
if I sold this building?

74
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,765
I'd take the money and go abroad.

75
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,433
-That's true.
-Be quiet!

76
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:45,605
Go back to your country
and stop inconveniencing us.

77
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,525
Babel E&amp;C, Babel Pharmaceuticals,
and Law Firm Wusang

78
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,943
are all garbage.

79
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:51,528
Leave. All of you.

80
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,531
Somehow, I got caught in the crossfire.
Unbelievable.

81
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,324
I don't expect you to believe me.

82
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm going to get this building back.

83
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,835
That's impossible.

84
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:08,712
The contract has been signed already.

85
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,677
How may I help you?

86
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,178
I'm a reporter from HBN.

87
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:18,847
I'd like to meet with…

88
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:23,560
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.
He gave us the tip. Is he here?

89
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,562
He called you here?

90
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:32,652
Sir.

91
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:37,073
What a surprise.
You even called the reporters.

92
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,325
EPISODE 2

93
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:41,411
However, there's something
I just can't wrap my head around.

94
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:48,168
Why would you get worked up over this
even more so than your client?

95
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,878
The building was sold at a high price,

96
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,713
so you'll be getting a hefty sum.

97
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,592
Putting aside the money,
wouldn't this upset anyone?

98
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:56,509
Not at all.

99
00:04:56,593 --> 00:05:00,889
Lawyers don't usually involve themselves
in matters like these.

100
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,391
European lawyers are quite strict
about these things.

101
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,976
What are you trying to say?

102
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,189
My experience tells me
that there's more to this.

103
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:11,232
A reason enough to make them act this way.

104
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:12,400
So…

105
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,448
What could that be?

106
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:21,326
Beats me.

107
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:26,289
But it must be something
that's more valuable than the building.

108
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,478
I saw this coming.

109
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:50,939
Those show-offs in flashy suits

110
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:53,024
are all the same.

111
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,776
Six days is nowhere enough.

112
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:57,779
I ought to put him in a guillotine choke
for 11 days straight.

113
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,573
Can you please sit down and talk?

114
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:01,825
Sit down.

115
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:05,954
He robbed us blind, didn't he?

116
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,914
I said we shouldn't trust him

117
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:09,332
and his good looks!

118
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:11,126
I knew it when he badmouthed my food.

119
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,378
It's obvious that I'm older than him,

120
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,879
but he spoke casually to me.

121
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:18,424
This Booralro or Vincenzo guy
is more heinous than the building owner.

122
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:22,345
You're right. He totally deceived us.

123
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:25,181
Should I go teach him a lesson?

124
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:29,519
How about I slam that face of his
on the ground?

125
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,354
Should I fling him to the ground?

126
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:32,397
Gosh.

127
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,483
I get that you're upset,
but you shouldn't hurt his face.

128
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:38,903
You should stop high-fiving the ground
whenever you're drunk.

129
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:41,948
Why are we always the ones
to get robbed blind?

130
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:44,534
We're not that stupid.

131
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:46,494
But we're not that smart, either.

132
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,371
You still don't know the times table.

133
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:49,539
I can't believe you.

134
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:53,376
I even got a new stamp
to seal the agreement.

135
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:58,548
Aren't Italian men
supposed to be gentlemen?

136
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,136
Not at all. They slack off
and are terrific liars.

137
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,181
They distract people
with their hand gestures.

138
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:09,476
-What should we do?
-You can…

139
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:12,145
You can just move to another temple.

140
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:16,316
Not at all. We will stay by your side
until the end.

141
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,278
I'll need to verify whether
he has truly deceived us or not.

142
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,655
Look what happened.
What's the point of that?

143
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,408
We already lost our building.

144
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:28,369
He was the one who called the reporters.

145
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:30,580
What's his plan? Why is he confusing us?

146
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,499
I'll make a thorough evaluation

147
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,251
on whether he's on our side or not.

148
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,632
Higher.

149
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:45,470
Okay, get ready.

150
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,181
Good.

151
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:55,647
-Four. Turn your waist. One, two, three.
-That's it.

152
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,940
All right. Two.

153
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:59,400
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

154
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,239
Our dear Deputy Minister Lee Nam-su.

155
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,625
All right.

156
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,005
So…

157
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:25,009
Just say that you, Minister Park Dae-jin,

158
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:28,846
and President Kim Song-hyeon
of JT Investment…

159
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,558
The three of you had some sushi

160
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,811
at a restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.
That's all I need from you.

161
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,564
What kind of story will you concoct
with the reporters

162
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,691
this time around?

163
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:42,777
Gosh. That's hurtful to hear.

164
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:45,405
I'm here to protect you.

165
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:48,491
I'm not going to reveal this to the public
or call any reporters.

166
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:52,078
You're planning to use JT Investment
to get to the top.

167
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:54,914
-I can't let you do that.
-Sir.

168
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:56,749
Do you know what my specialty is?

169
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,212
I can turn the most heartfelt stories
into the most heinous ones.

170
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,256
Is that so?

171
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,927
You don't believe me.

172
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,181
Minister Kim Ui-pyeong from Cheongbaek-ri

173
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:16,352
who had 1.07 billion won in debt
and no house to his name.

174
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,606
Who do you think accused him

175
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,109
of illegally accumulating two billion won
and made him end up

176
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:26,154
-killing himself?
-Look here, Ms. Choi!

177
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,323
Sir, you see,

178
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:33,828
I'm the person who can find faults
in the most innocent people.

179
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:35,538
Wait and see.

180
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,957
I'm sorry, sir.

181
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,627
Don't say that.

182
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,298
I'm glad your family's safe.

183
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,177
The plaza…

184
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,765
The plaza building.

185
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:57,393
If Babel E&amp;C demolishes it,
they'll find out.

186
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,732
You have to demolish it before they do.

187
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,738
But there's more.

188
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,283
That secret room comes
with a special feature.

189
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:15,203
3 YEARS AGO

190
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,579
What is it?

191
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,290
It has to do
with the structure of the room.

192
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,919
The room will be touching
the building's columns and the beams

193
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:27,048
and will be equipped with
a device that amplifies impact.

194
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:31,177
When the room is put
under a considerable impact,

195
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,472
the impact will cause the columns
and the beams to crack,

196
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,141
and the building will collapse.

197
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:49,112
If anyone tries to break in
to steal the gold,

198
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:54,659
the building itself

199
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:57,412
will be their graveyard.

200
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:00,790
And there is one more important thing.

201
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,167
You must get rid of everyone

202
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:06,379
who has built that room
or is aware of its existence.

203
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,717
Except for Mr. Cho and me, of course.

204
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:19,892
For anyone apart from you
to get that gold,

205
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:21,978
the building…

206
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,983
will have to be demolished.

207
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,570
The family will gift you the blueprint

208
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:33,322
as proof of our friendship.

209
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:36,492
1 YEAR AGO

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,838
WANG SHAOLIN, A CHINESE TYCOON,
DIES OF CARDIAC ARREST AFTER A SWIM

211
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,228
Does his family know
about the secret room?

212
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,146
10 MONTHS AGO

213
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,274
No. It's just the three of us who know.

214
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,945
Given his nature,
I'm certain he didn't tell anyone.

215
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,284
Mr. Cho.

216
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,537
Care to make
some retirement money with me?

217
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,499
3 MONTHS AGO

218
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:31,464
Babel E&amp;C has begun purchasing
the shops and residences around the area.

219
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:35,218
They also contacted me. What should I do?

220
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,720
Tell them that you're going to rebuild it.

221
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:40,765
We only need two days
after the construction begins.

222
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,935
Two days to move the gold.

223
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:45,895
NANYAK TEMPLE

224
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,402
I need to kick them out
and demolish this building.

225
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,322
I have to retrieve the gold.

226
00:12:56,405 --> 00:13:00,076
When should I tell the workers to come?

227
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:03,204
Please tell your friend to come
three days later.

228
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,499
That'll do.

229
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,459
Okay. I got it.

230
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:11,671
Are you going to fix something in there?

231
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:15,216
Yes. We're going to fix the boiler.

232
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:19,095
By the way, why are you here?

233
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,224
I liked this text.

234
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:24,976
I see.

235
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:27,895
"Do not expect to get rich
through illegal means."

236
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:30,189
Yes, you shouldn't do that.

237
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:31,941
Sir.

238
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,068
"Don't be greedy for wealth or land.

239
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,486
Do what's right."

240
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,363
-Let's go inside.
-Thank you.

241
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:47,039
Praying on the cold floor

242
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,376
-gave me hemorrhoids.
-Oh, dear.

243
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:52,461
I know.

244
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,883
That sharp and heavy pain…

245
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:59,552
Let's install a boiler this weekend.

246
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:00,761
No!

247
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:12,315
I mean…

248
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,233
Why waste money

249
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,612
when they'll be demolishing
this place anyway?

250
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:20,406
I'll buy you an electric pad
that can cover this size

251
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:23,409
-and pay for the electricity.
-That's okay. Don't worry about it.

252
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:24,744
I said no!

253
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:26,454
Sir.

254
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,878
Please don't refuse my goodwill.

255
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:37,298
I'd like to show my appreciation
for you all.

256
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:46,223
He must've felt Buddha's presence
from beneath again.

257
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:47,350
I see.

258
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:53,189
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

259
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,649
-Gosh.
-Okay.

260
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,540
The witness of the recording
confessed to perjury.

261
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:13,501
Even if the second trial takes place,

262
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,544
it'll be dismissed
due to lack of evidence.

263
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,713
-It's over then.
-Yes.

264
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:19,715
My dad has no more cards up his sleeve.

265
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,260
Yu-chan must be getting old.

266
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,929
He's out of moves.

267
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:30,518
-Good luck wrapping things up.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:33,646
Cha-young!

269
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,398
You startled me! You…

270
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:38,025
Damn it. Gosh.

271
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:41,404
You have no class and no manners.

272
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,781
Look at you wearing sneakers at work.

273
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:47,618
Why did you pick him of all people?

274
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,162
It was you who picked me, sir.

275
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:52,248
I did?

276
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,293
I should quit drinking.

277
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,132
Cha-young.

278
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:02,633
Quiet down.

279
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:05,469
Cha-young. You see…

280
00:16:05,553 --> 00:16:06,762
What? What is it?

281
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:09,890
Babel Pharmaceutical's
Drug Development Division called.

282
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:12,643
Qua… What was it?

283
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,979
-Quarantine?
-Right! One of its researchers

284
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:16,897
who was quarantined went missing.

285
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:18,149
What?

286
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,153
The Italian Intelligence Service
sent this.

287
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:23,279
Okay.

288
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,364
DIRECTOR TAE JONG-GU

289
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,493
After their boss died, Vincenzo Cassano,

290
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:32,455
the successor in line,
was targeted by the mob.

291
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:33,497
I believe…

292
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,209
I believe he fled here
to avoid getting killed.

293
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:40,755
What does a member of the Mafia
coming to Korea

294
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,923
have to do with our security?

295
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,550
What do you mean?

296
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,927
The most wicked gang in the world
advanced into--

297
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,847
"Advanced"?
Is that what you think this is?

298
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,392
Then, if two of them flew in,
it might as well be an invasion.

299
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:57,104
What if Vincenzo creates
a new gang in Korea?

300
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,731
He needs money to do that.

301
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,567
How much could he have brought
before fleeing?

302
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,153
He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.

303
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,572
Why would a member of the Mafia
hide money here?

304
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:09,033
There are plenty of places
better suited for that.

305
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:11,160
Please authorize this mission first.

306
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,912
I'll get to the bottom of this.

307
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,830
You'd better not spend any of our money.

308
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,333
For every 10 won, I'll deduct 100,000 won.

309
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,001
-Sir!
-Enough!

310
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,464
What was that? Yes.
Go help the yakuza division.

311
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:26,675
A yakuza breaded himself
with a stab knife yesterday…

312
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,011
No. He stabbed the bread with a knife…

313
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:31,972
Damn it. I can't even say it right.

314
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:32,973
Get out!

315
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,061
But they're the Mafia.

316
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,105
Like the movie, The Godfather.

317
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:40,231
Hey.

318
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,582
SHINKWANG BANK
1,198,345 WON

319
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,251
This is enough.

320
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:05,464
Just you wait, Vincenzo Cassano.

321
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:08,926
I'll pay for the mission
out of my own pocket.

322
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:14,682
TOTAL

323
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:15,850
INTEREST ON LOAN

324
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,143
REMAINING BALANCE

325
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:21,730
It's okay.

326
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:26,360
It's all right. I can do it.

327
00:18:26,443 --> 00:18:30,364
O sole mio

328
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,324
REMAINING BALANCE

329
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:35,369
You said that you told the truth
for the victims of Babel.

330
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:37,705
-Was everything a lie?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

331
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,415
Why did you lie?

332
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:42,126
-I told you that you would regret it
-I'm sorry.

333
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,752
one day.

334
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,588
I felt guilty.

335
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,424
-You sold your conscience for money
-Any words to the victims?

336
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:49,925
and broke the hearts of the bereaved.

337
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,594
I'm sorry for causing confusion.

338
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:54,346
I'm truly sorry to everyone
that I've hurt. I'm sorry.

339
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,896
What are you doing?

340
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:03,939
Getting rid
of the Babel lawsuit documents.

341
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,733
It's really over now.

342
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,318
Don't be absurd.

343
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:09,153
-It's not over--
-Until it's over?

344
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,781
-But it is really over now.
-We still have hope.

345
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:14,575
Trials are full of twists and turns.

346
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,118
And they always work against us.

347
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:17,494
Maybe not this time around.

348
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,333
-God help us.
-Oh, God.

349
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,584
You little…

350
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,345
Back for more tricks, are you?

351
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:37,097
I have a favor.

352
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:41,143
Please share with me the documents
you have on Babel E&amp;C.

353
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:42,186
What for?

354
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:44,355
I see.

355
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:46,941
You want to study your enemy
before defeating them?

356
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:48,567
Gosh.

357
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,736
Are you still pulling this stunt?

358
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:52,071
Yes.

359
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:57,368
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

360
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,786
You should leave.

361
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,961
The one who helps out the losing team
in a war isn't an enemy but--

362
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,462
An ally. Right?

363
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:09,463
You little…

364
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,093
That ally…

365
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,915
Sir.

366
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,131
There are things that can only be verified
through trust.

367
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:55,968
If you want to win,

368
00:20:56,885 --> 00:21:00,347
give me a chance instead of doubting me.

369
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,608
-Ju-sung.
-Yes?

370
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,320
Hand him all the documents

371
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:17,948
-we have on Babel E&amp;C.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,585
It's been two days.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

373
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:31,670
Look at her.

374
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:33,547
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:35,966
Seriously.

376
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,555
I told you to keep a close eye
on all the newly employed researchers.

377
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:43,474
I didn't want them to complain,

378
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,601
so I got them to stay
at the chairman's villa.

379
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:49,021
If that researcher

380
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:51,356
talks nonsense, we'll lose this suit.

381
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,776
And It'll be the end
for that new drug as well!

382
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,736
I'm truly sorry.

383
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,947
Do the higher-ups know?

384
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,365
No, ma'am. They don't.

385
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,951
Let's keep it that way.

386
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:04,453
Don't you dare tell them.

387
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:08,707
Okay.

388
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,133
This is driving me nuts.

389
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:20,636
No matter how hard we cover it up,

390
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,679
one whistleblower will end everything.

391
00:22:24,264 --> 00:22:27,601
-What if they go to your dad?
-Gosh!

392
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:31,814
I didn't say it out loud
because I didn't want to jinx it.

393
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:35,442
Sorry, Cha-young.

394
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:39,154
They can go to the police,
the prosecution, or the reporters.

395
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,156
Just not my dad.

396
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,455
Seeing how we haven't heard anything,
I don't think they're there yet.

397
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,791
If they knew anything,

398
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,835
they wouldn't go to an incompetent lawyer.

399
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,340
Who is that?

400
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:00,300
-Chairman Jang Han-seo of Babel.
-What?

401
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,388
Hello, sir.

402
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:07,850
Who are you?

403
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,394
I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
from Law Firm Wusang,

404
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:11,812
in charge of the Babel lawsuit.

405
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:16,733
I heard about you.
Didn't she ask to borrow my villa?

406
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:20,445
That's right.
I had to because it was the safest place.

407
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:24,908
It's fine. I rarely go there.
Tell me if you need anything.

408
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:28,287
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

409
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:29,788
Yes, sir.

410
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:38,922
I get that he's a chairman, but how can he
talk down to us on our first encounter?

411
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:40,632
And he's young too.

412
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:44,761
Anyone who's rich and powerful

413
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,014
can do so even if they're younger than me.

414
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,767
-I see.
-Hold on.

415
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:55,147
Thanks to you, I have a bad feeling.

416
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:57,149
I'm going home.

417
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,610
Already?

418
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:05,157
Want some steak? I got paid yesterday.

419
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,618
No, thanks. I have somewhere to go.

420
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:12,998
She always leaves without me.

421
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,251
Cha-young! Your car's over there!

422
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,128
The other way!

423
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:26,011
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

424
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:37,147
BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS SUED
AFTER TEST SUBJECT DIES

425
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,192
Mr. Nam.

426
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,529
May I see the documents
regarding the lawsuit, please?

427
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:47,783
-Why?
-I'm just curious.

428
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:49,826
Well…

429
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:52,371
I need his permission.

430
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:53,997
Hand them over to him.

431
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:55,832
Every single one of them.

432
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,044
Yes, sir.

433
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,421
Here are your documents.

434
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:12,140
You did well dealing with Lee Nam-su.

435
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:13,725
Good work.

436
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:16,144
He was quick-witted,
so we could wrap it up quickly.

437
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:18,021
-Who's next?
-That's it for now.

438
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:22,109
He's going to hand it over
to Prosecutor Seo U-yeong.

439
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,652
Prosecutor Seo U-yeong?

440
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:27,364
Mr. Seo.

441
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:30,033
This isn't your nephew's specialty.

442
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:33,078
All the more reason to hire him.
That's how he'll learn.

443
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:37,833
Also, there's something you must do
right now.

444
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,005
It's about my colleague,
Chief Kim Won-u's scandal.

445
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,464
Can you wrap that up for us?

446
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:52,848
The sexually assaulted victim
testified against him.

447
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:55,684
Another woman who was at the scene
also testified,

448
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,980
and the footage of the villa was found,
which is more than enough evidence.

449
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:04,943
Exactly. That's why I want you
to touch it up, so it looks less serious.

450
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:07,738
This matter doesn't only pertain
to Mr. Kim.

451
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:11,074
The honor of our office is at stake.

452
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:13,827
Sir, let me pour you a glass.

453
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:23,920
Damn it.

454
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:29,551
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

455
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:35,766
How many times has it been just today?

456
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:43,690
How do I sound him out?

457
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:49,821
Cha-young, you can do it.

458
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:07,839
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

459
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:09,800
He's sleeping soundly.

460
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,927
I guess there's nothing going on.

461
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,975
BABEL E&amp;C, BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS

462
00:27:21,978 --> 00:27:23,188
What are you doing?

463
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,315
Why are you back?

464
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:30,112
-Answer me.
-Did you see my wallet?

465
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:31,780
I lost it.

466
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,323
It's not here.

467
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:35,534
I cleaned the entire office today.

468
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:40,580
Where could it be?

469
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,541
I can guarantee that it's not here.

470
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:50,340
Why is he reading these?

471
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:52,050
Because he wanted to.

472
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,302
"Know your enemy
if you want to beat them."

473
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:55,762
What?

474
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:57,514
Babel Group is…

475
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:02,686
Would you mind me being vulgar?

476
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:03,937
Knock yourself out.

477
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:07,482
They're assholes.

478
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:09,818
"Assholes"?

479
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,529
They do everything the yakuza
and the Mafia do.

480
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,197
Everyone knows that.

481
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:16,366
But some lawyers help them
stay out of jail.

482
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,952
Mr. "Vincenzo Quassano."

483
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:20,328
Why are you doing this?

484
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,247
They're really out of line.

485
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,458
They're just like the Mafia.

486
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,878
And Law Firm Wusang, their partner,
is no exception.

487
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,379
To be clear,

488
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:33,008
Law Firm Wusang is a parasite
that mooches off those assholes.

489
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,134
Correct.

490
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:37,095
Assholes like them should be made to pay.

491
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,265
"Pay". I like the sound of that.

492
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,059
They ought to.

493
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:45,771
You guys click very well.

494
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,106
How about you two start streaming online?

495
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,485
Call it, "Hong-Vin TV," or "Hong-Qua TV."

496
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:53,904
That sounds nice.

497
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:55,822
I should get going now.

498
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,741
I'll be glad to help
if you need anything else.

499
00:28:57,824 --> 00:29:00,118
-Do you have more?
-Yes, we do. We have plenty.

500
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,330
No, thank you. This will suffice.

501
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,831
Sir. Your tie.

502
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:07,125
Thank you.

503
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,960
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

504
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:13,590
Goodness, look at her.

505
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,137
Was this your plan B?

506
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,807
Provoking my dad to continue fighting
against Babel

507
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,142
while you make a profit off the lawsuit?

508
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:25,602
Am I right?

509
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:27,354
I'm going to eat. Please leave.

510
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:32,317
Unfortunately, we're closed for the day

511
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,902
since we ran out of ingredients.

512
00:29:35,153 --> 00:29:37,906
You can go to Yeongho Snack Bar.

513
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:41,076
They have the best tteokbokki
in this neighborhood.

514
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:55,423
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

515
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:57,884
Welcome.

516
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:02,389
I won't sell anything to you.

517
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,432
-But I want to eat.
-I said no food for you.

518
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:08,019
Then, I'll buy it.

519
00:30:12,107 --> 00:30:13,650
I never said you could sit there.

520
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:15,569
Do you not want to eat?

521
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:23,326
Sit down.

522
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:27,706
-What do you want?
-Take your pick.

523
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:29,332
Tteokbokki

524
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:32,752
Flour rice cakes, traditional gochujang,
and a bit of artificial--

525
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:33,670
Two servings of tteokbokki.

526
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:38,633
You're pretty basic.

527
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:39,759
"Basic"?

528
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:41,511
You know "asshole" but not "basic"?

529
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,681
It means "common."

530
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:48,894
Let's make this clear.

531
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:52,898
I have no reason to provoke your dad.
I'm preparing myself for war.

532
00:30:56,276 --> 00:30:58,320
Your enemy has tanks and armored vehicles.

533
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,530
What use would 200 stones be?

534
00:31:00,614 --> 00:31:02,073
Do you think that's all I have?

535
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:05,619
Yes. The weak usually resort to
throwing stones or butting heads

536
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:07,704
when they are out of options.

537
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:11,207
I didn't think of head-butting.

538
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:17,297
Go back to Italy and fight
against those you're used to.

539
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,633
This country doesn't suit you.

540
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:21,134
Why not?

541
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:25,138
In Italy, only the Mafia
perform such heinous deeds.

542
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,974
But everyone here runs
their own gangs and cartels.

543
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:30,894
The National Assembly, prosecution,
police, public offices, and companies.

544
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,103
All of them.

545
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:35,482
It doesn't matter who you're up against.

546
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,609
It'll be a grueling ordeal for you.

547
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:38,526
Why?

548
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,154
Because that's Korea.

549
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:47,953
-Thanks for the advice.
-Your tteokbokki is ready.

550
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,209
May I have a glass of water?

551
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,045
You can get it yourself.

552
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:59,798
That is a water filter dispenser.

553
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:09,557
-Let's eat.
-Thank…

554
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:20,485
Happiness isn't far away.

555
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:22,195
-Do you like it?
-Yes!

556
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,408
I'm home. I'm hungry.

557
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,966
What are you doing?

558
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,136
What?

559
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,096
Didn't I tell you not to smoke?

560
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,390
I didn't.
I was just standing next to them.

561
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:54,269
I told you I'd give you a good beating
if you lied.

562
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,105
Snap out of it! Don't hit your son!

563
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:00,608
If you don't want to die,
put your guard up.

564
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:02,944
Mom! Come on, it hurts.

565
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,863
One, two.

566
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:07,032
You little brat!

567
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:13,580
Does she have a black belt?

568
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:20,712
Goodness.

569
00:33:23,965 --> 00:33:25,383
Oh, dear.

570
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:36,770
You want me to cover for a filthy bastard
and take all the blame?

571
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:42,525
Let's go.

572
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:54,245
I'll destroy each and every
last one of you, you assholes.

573
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,919
Hello, there!

574
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,760
I'll just cut to the chase.

575
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:12,138
Ms. Choi. I mean, Myung-hee.

576
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:14,557
Hey.

577
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:18,561
Join my law firm. Okay?

578
00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:23,358
You impudent brat. Explain yourself.

579
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,819
Prosecutor General Hwang and Mr. Seo.

580
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:29,239
Everyone knows they're trying
to form a cartel of sorts

581
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,032
at the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

582
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:33,284
One that's impenetrable
by even the Reform Committee.

583
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,954
Do you think they'll let you in? No way!

584
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,832
They'll use and discard you
like they did today.

585
00:34:38,915 --> 00:34:40,416
Enough already.

586
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:44,796
Just drink up and stop nagging me.

587
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,256
I'm not nagging.

588
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:50,510
If you join us,

589
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:54,222
I'll let you bring down that prosecution.

590
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:55,557
Have you gone insane?

591
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:01,229
You know I'm helping out
Babel Group, right?

592
00:35:01,855 --> 00:35:04,691
They'll back us up no matter what.

593
00:35:04,774 --> 00:35:06,609
They are just a company.

594
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:10,071
In three years, they'll be
one of the twenty richest companies.

595
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,490
Their drugs are second to none.

596
00:35:12,574 --> 00:35:15,827
Also, their chairman has a few
loose screws and is easy to handle.

597
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:21,374
You must have a good reason
to be cleaning up after their messes.

598
00:35:21,457 --> 00:35:22,375
Exactly.

599
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:26,379
Even though I'm cleaning up their shit,

600
00:35:26,462 --> 00:35:27,589
I keep getting richer.

601
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,218
Unbelievable.

602
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:35,221
So you want us to act like their bidets?

603
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:37,515
I'll do all the trivial work.

604
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,976
You just need to leave them
a solid impression.

605
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:42,896
Have you been working
as a salesman instead?

606
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:45,857
Just choose me
like you choose your clothes.

607
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,484
I heard it takes you ten minutes
to shop for clothes.

608
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:52,280
The alcohol is getting the better of me.

609
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:56,659
Exactly how crazy is this chairman?

610
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:26,064
It's all my fault.

611
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:29,734
I should've kept an eye
on the researchers, but I failed.

612
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:31,736
I'll take care of it as soon as…

613
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:42,538
I'm sorry for the delay
in the Babel Tower construction.

614
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:44,582
There were issues with the building owner.

615
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,084
I'll also take care of…

616
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:54,592
I promise

617
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,303
to be more thorough from now on.

618
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:00,515
I promise I won't disappoint you again.

619
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,187
Please give me one more chance.

620
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:09,983
I promise I'll do better.

621
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,800
Look at me.

622
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,345
Don't tell me you've already run out
of ingredients.

623
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:21,888
No.

624
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:25,767
If it wasn't Italy,
where did you learn to cook?

625
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:29,812
Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province.

626
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,149
At a place called
Mom's Touch Cooking Academy.

627
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:35,860
"Mom's Touch"?

628
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,656
Serve me food until I can finally
get a taste of a mom's touch.

629
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,450
But I'm not a mom.

630
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:47,288
If not, then I'll have no choice
but to expose you.

631
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,207
-Sorry?
-Risotto allo zafferano.

632
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:58,758
Saffron risotto.

633
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,552
Okay. I'll get it ready.

634
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:46,514
It tastes like vomited baby food…

635
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:48,307
How should I put it?

636
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:51,144
Yes. And it's been mixed
in wine and broth.

637
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:57,942
You have a knack for making awful food.

638
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:12,790
If you look over here…

639
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:14,584
-Sir.
-Yes?

640
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:17,003
We need to go somewhere.

641
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,005
Where?

642
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:25,219
They won't see you without an appointment.

643
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:27,555
-Let's ask.
-What?

644
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,269
How may I help you?

645
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:35,354
I'm here to see Mr. Na Deok-jin
of Investment and Development.

646
00:40:35,438 --> 00:40:36,898
-Have you called beforehand?
-No.

647
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,193
I'm afraid you can't meet him.

648
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:47,909
BILL OF INDICTMENT

649
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:51,537
Tell him he has a bill of indictment
for threatening and abetting an abduction.

650
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:58,836
When did you get that?

651
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:11,516
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

652
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,769
Let me see the bill. Let's read it.

653
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:30,576
BILL OF INDICTMENT

654
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,161
THREAT AND ABETTING AN ABDUCTION

655
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,501
It's empty.

656
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:41,837
I lied, so we could meet.

657
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:46,592
We've paid you enough already. Why…

658
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:50,471
-But why are you so clingy?
-We're not clingy.

659
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:52,306
We just want to correct what's wrong.

660
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,685
Sure. Then, feel free to sue or report me.

661
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:57,520
Do as you please.

662
00:41:57,603 --> 00:41:59,814
Or demonstrate in front of the Blue House

663
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:01,941
-and shave your head.
-No.

664
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,944
I thought I'd do the same as you did.

665
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:09,824
We'll kidnap your family

666
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:11,742
and force you to cancel the contract.

667
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:16,414
Are you a die-hard fan of The Godfather?

668
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:18,207
Are you mimicking the Mafia

669
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,126
since you're from Italy?

670
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:28,593
I'm glad you asked.

671
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:31,679
If we were in Italy,

672
00:42:32,471 --> 00:42:34,849
you would've become a fertilizer
for the vineyards.

673
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,062
You would have become some cheap wine
being sold on a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

674
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:45,610
I'm not here to negotiate but to warn you.

675
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,945
We're not going to take it anymore.

676
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:50,990
Okay.

677
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,586
Was that how you did things in Italy?

678
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,046
At times.

679
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:07,923
I loved what you said.

680
00:43:08,758 --> 00:43:10,760
"Vineyard fertilizer.
Buy-one-get-one-free."

681
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:13,804
"Hey.

682
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:16,849
You're buy-two-get-one-free."

683
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:19,810
I should use it sometime.

684
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:26,108
Let's eat. It's on me.
Two meals for the price of one.

685
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:29,362
RESIGNATION LETTER

686
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,575
Some company must've given you an offer.

687
00:43:35,117 --> 00:43:36,744
Law Firm Wusang? Wintis?

688
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:39,955
-Ko and Gu?
-No.

689
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,708
I just want to rest.

690
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,543
Don't sugarcoat it.

691
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:47,004
What's the real reason?

692
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:48,756
I just…

693
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:52,760
I'm sick of being your hound.

694
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:54,887
That's a bit harsh.

695
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,389
I'm sorry to break it to you,

696
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:59,725
but wherever you go,
you'll always be a hound on a leash.

697
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:00,893
Probably.

698
00:44:02,103 --> 00:44:02,978
However,

699
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:06,440
my leash will probably be longer.

700
00:44:08,401 --> 00:44:10,027
And they'll feed me better.

701
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:16,158
Goodbye, guys.

702
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,244
Where do you think you're going?

703
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:21,455
Hey, Ms. Choi. Hey!

704
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,299
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

705
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:46,021
Prosecutor or not, I'm going to
destroy all of you before I leave.

706
00:45:03,205 --> 00:45:04,832
What's with the meeting?

707
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,878
This way, please.

708
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:15,468
You splurged, didn't you?

709
00:45:15,968 --> 00:45:17,344
Isn't that Prosecutor Choi?

710
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:19,680
Sit down.

711
00:45:22,808 --> 00:45:25,060
I'm sorry to gather you all so suddenly.

712
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,438
We have an important guest.

713
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:30,733
I'm sure you all know her.
It's Prosecutor Choi Myung-hee.

714
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:34,111
From this day on,

715
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:37,948
she will be a senior lawyer at Wusang.

716
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:44,455
Soon, she will represent us on my behalf.

717
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:55,049
I knew you'd be happy.

718
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:59,220
Wusang will be invincible.

719
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,138
Please say a word or two.

720
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,724
I have two things to say. Number one.

721
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:07,686
One who achieves small victories
will eventually achieve big ones.

722
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,064
Number two. I beg you.

723
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:13,359
Let's not work hard
if it can't be appreciated. That's all.

724
00:46:15,694 --> 00:46:17,571
Clap, will you?

725
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,495
Look at her acting all tough
from the get-go.

726
00:46:24,578 --> 00:46:28,123
She just got here.
How could she represent our law firm?

727
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:29,416
She's a mere rookie.

728
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,377
Well, she was the best prospector there.

729
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:35,130
Ms. Hong should be the one
to represent us.

730
00:46:35,714 --> 00:46:37,675
She achieved the most out of all of us.

731
00:46:41,303 --> 00:46:43,556
You're not consoling or bashing me.
What is this?

732
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:45,683
Bash you?

733
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:47,685
We're just upset by the unfair treatment.

734
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,146
But I can see you grinning.

735
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:57,027
She's so quick to notice.

736
00:46:57,528 --> 00:46:59,280
How did she know we were happy?

737
00:46:59,863 --> 00:47:02,866
I knew it ever since
he deducted the withholding taxes.

738
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,660
Gosh.

739
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:23,470
I get you,

740
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:24,847
but you don't have soul.

741
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,558
You look more like a patient
than a zombie.

742
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:29,476
I could do just as much.

743
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,022
Like this.

744
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:36,692
You're so good. I can do it too.

745
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:42,031
I'm a pretty zombie.

746
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:46,201
-Goodness, you're terrifying.
-Go away.

747
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:48,704
-That's not how you do it.
-Try that again, Larry.

748
00:47:48,787 --> 00:47:50,456
Not like this. Do this.

749
00:47:51,874 --> 00:47:53,667
That's it.

750
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,878
No, try harder. Put your back into it.

751
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:58,213
That's it.

752
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,267
-Goodness.
-Wait.

753
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:13,228
I heard some gagging noises.

754
00:48:14,313 --> 00:48:15,564
What were you doing?

755
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:18,942
I was chosen to coach the zombies

756
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:23,113
for the upcoming Train to Ulsan Part Two.
I was practicing.

757
00:48:23,197 --> 00:48:24,448
We were helping him out.

758
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:25,699
I see.

759
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:27,701
Yes.

760
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:29,745
Good luck.

761
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:34,041
Let's go.

762
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,918
Okay.

763
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:40,464
Darn it.

764
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:42,675
-How humiliating.
-Oh, no.

765
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:45,803
His cold gaze.

766
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,057
He probably saw the roof of my mouth.

767
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:53,560
What should I do?

768
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:57,106
What should I do?

769
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:04,196
Let us know if you need extras
for the movie.

770
00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:05,364
I'll do my best.

771
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,908
Me, too. I'm serious.

772
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:09,743
-No, you can't.
-Please.

773
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:12,746
No, I need to ask them for permission.

774
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:18,877
From what I've seen of Babel E&amp;C,

775
00:49:18,961 --> 00:49:22,131
they forcibly evict the residents
one week after the notice.

776
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:23,966
Yes, they've always done that.

777
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,468
They demolish the non-residential areas

778
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:28,512
and instill fear
in the remaining residents.

779
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:31,348
It's downright illegal,
but Law Firm Wusang has their back.

780
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:35,227
Isn't there a law
that protects the tenants?

781
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:40,441
I heard they need to pay
a premium compensation to the tenants

782
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:43,026
and negotiate the demolition date
with an officer.

783
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,111
That's what I read.

784
00:49:46,572 --> 00:49:47,698
You've studied a lot.

785
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:53,996
They were being too ridiculous
that I had to read up on it.

786
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:55,748
I see.

787
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,127
Those rules exist, but they force
the tenants out with a small sum.

788
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:02,755
People get hurt or die too.

789
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:06,842
They'll probably carry out
the eviction suit first.

790
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:08,093
We should get ready.

791
00:50:08,177 --> 00:50:09,803
Isn't the biggest issue here

792
00:50:10,804 --> 00:50:12,347
the forced illegal demolition?

793
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:13,474
Yes.

794
00:50:14,308 --> 00:50:16,101
They'll make a move in a day or two.

795
00:50:17,352 --> 00:50:18,729
But there's nothing we can do.

796
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:22,232
Gosh.

797
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:27,529
Here. Do you want one?

798
00:50:27,613 --> 00:50:29,990
-No, thank you.
-Then, why…

799
00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:37,664
Do you drink?

800
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:46,423
You've never makgeolli before?

801
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:48,842
-No.
-I see.

802
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:51,970
It only gives a mild hangover,
so drink up.

803
00:50:52,054 --> 00:50:53,597
Here. Bottoms up.

804
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,808
Here you go.

805
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,112
I can finally taste it
now that I've had my second glass.

806
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:12,783
In that case, drink up.

807
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:14,326
Here you go.

808
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:19,915
Cheers.

809
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,686
By the way, should I congratulate you
for diving headfirst into hell?

810
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:45,232
I'm fighting against Babel
because I'm stupid.

811
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:46,984
But not you.

812
00:51:49,278 --> 00:51:50,279
By the way,

813
00:51:52,364 --> 00:51:55,617
are you also a public defender?

814
00:51:56,493 --> 00:51:58,704
I am. For one person.

815
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:02,708
I truly pity her.

816
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,461
She was falsely charged with murder.

817
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:10,090
And yet, she accepted it

818
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:12,634
and made peace with her pancreatic cancer.

819
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:17,848
Why

820
00:52:19,057 --> 00:52:21,310
would she do that?

821
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:28,483
She believes she's being punished
for abandoning her son in the past.

822
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:31,945
She says feeling guilty isn't enough.

823
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:36,241
There are people who readily accept
their punishment.

824
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,287
And there are those who are shameless
even after committing crimes.

825
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:42,205
In any case,

826
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:45,584
only the kindhearted and the weak suffer.

827
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,170
I know you won't get it.

828
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,131
For the past two days,

829
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,053
I experienced firsthand

830
00:52:57,137 --> 00:52:58,513
how the weak suffered.

831
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:03,018
I couldn't do anything.

832
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:06,813
So I became even more furious.

833
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:11,026
Those who are truly weak endure
the feeling of helplessness and rage

834
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:13,820
until the day they die.

835
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:24,790
I have a question.

836
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,669
What's the story
behind your law firm's name?

837
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:35,008
I don't defend my clients.

838
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:37,761
I become their last straw, a jipuragi.

839
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:42,641
When they don't have anyone to lean on,

840
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:45,727
they can still grab onto me.

841
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,605
I am their last straw.

842
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:55,696
Excuse me.

843
00:53:57,864 --> 00:53:59,700
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

844
00:54:03,537 --> 00:54:05,038
Hello, I'm listening.

845
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,624
Hello?

846
00:54:13,547 --> 00:54:16,925
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

847
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,970
Was that a prank call?

848
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:28,854
I heard this is how you pour drinks here.

849
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,110
You seem quite genuine today.

850
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:37,362
Or have I become dull?

851
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:41,992
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

852
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,412
You need to turn around and drink.

853
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:47,164
Yes.

854
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:53,628
Just turn halfway.

855
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:55,380
Halfway.

856
00:55:03,388 --> 00:55:05,557
We've pretty much won
the Babel Pharmaceuticals case.

857
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,350
Ms. Hong just needs to finish up.

858
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:10,103
Babel E&amp;C is the problem here.

859
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:12,773
We need to demolish a plaza
in Geumga-dong.

860
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:13,940
Brace yourselves.

861
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:15,984
Why do they need to brace themselves?

862
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:19,780
It's quite sly.

863
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:21,990
Demolishing it right away
would be illegal,

864
00:55:22,074 --> 00:55:24,493
so we bring in heavy equipment
for a so-called cleanup

865
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:26,369
and accidentally damage the building.

866
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:28,205
The tenants move out in fear,

867
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:29,581
and Babel claims it's a mistake.

868
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:31,166
The building becomes vacant in a few days.

869
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:34,044
Legal or not, we'll get the job done

870
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:35,712
because they trust us.

871
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:40,509
Lawyers are better than prosecutors
at making people shit their pants.

872
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:43,345
Such assholes.

873
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:46,640
She says that all the time.

874
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:49,476
And…

875
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:52,562
Oh, dear.

876
00:55:54,356 --> 00:55:57,567
Your dad is once again leading
the Development Opposition Committee.

877
00:55:57,651 --> 00:56:01,071
What a fun life he's living.

878
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,284
Shouldn't we estimate the scale of damage?

879
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:09,746
Thankfully, it'll be smaller than
the redevelopment in Yucheon-dong.

880
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,374
I believe four people still died there.

881
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:13,834
That's not bad.

882
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,336
Twelve people died
during Yonghu-dong's redevelopment.

883
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,339
It's fine. They'll crawl out
when push comes to shove.

884
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:22,175
Right. Don't forget your dad.

885
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:30,517
Let's see.

886
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:39,359
I heard that they're demolishing it.

887
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:44,990
They're so cruel. There are people--

888
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:46,199
It's not cruel!

889
00:56:47,742 --> 00:56:50,745
It wouldn't be so cruel
if they moved out willingly.

890
00:56:56,293 --> 00:57:00,130
What's with those people?
How can they be so dense?

891
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:03,175
It's easier said than done.

892
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:09,222
Their lawyer is the one who's the worst.

893
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:14,936
If he's a lawyer,
he should be more levelheaded.

894
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:42,964
Hello.

895
00:57:43,048 --> 00:57:45,008
Doesn't it feel like
your head's been split open?

896
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:47,427
Mine's already smashed.

897
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:51,056
Yes. I'm having a pretty bad hangover.

898
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,601
Come over. Let's eat something.

899
00:57:54,684 --> 00:57:56,478
I'll text you my address.

900
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:57,604
But I…

901
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:02,692
Come in.

902
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,070
It's a mess, isn't it?

903
00:58:05,153 --> 00:58:07,906
The soup just needs to boil,
so please sit down.

904
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,491
There's nothing worth looking at.

905
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,786
All right.

906
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:22,963
You must have another daughter.

907
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:24,589
What? No.

908
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:26,049
That's Cha-young.

909
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:27,968
What?

910
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:38,687
I see.

911
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:45,569
Hello, Chairman Jang.

912
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:50,240
They've informed me
that they're ready for the demolition.

913
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,535
We'll be ready by tomorrow as well.

914
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:55,328
Yes, sir.

915
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,331
Don't worry.

916
00:58:58,415 --> 00:59:00,792
This is our job.

917
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:05,547
I believe they'll start working
around 11 p.m. tomorrow.

918
00:59:06,381 --> 00:59:08,008
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

919
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,929
Cha-young!

920
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:15,849
-What is it this time?
-They're--

921
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:17,767
What? What is it?

922
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:19,936
Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

923
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,106
That's when they'll demolish the building.

924
00:59:23,189 --> 00:59:27,402
I heard Mr. Han speaking
with that impudent chairman.

925
00:59:28,903 --> 00:59:31,072
They're ready, and they'll do it tomorrow.

926
00:59:31,156 --> 00:59:32,449
What?

927
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,790
How is it? Don't you feel so much better?

928
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:42,083
-Right?
-Yes.

929
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:44,586
I make the best--

930
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:46,713
Can you please pick up?

931
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:48,340
I called you more than 30 times.

932
00:59:48,423 --> 00:59:49,674
You're so noisy.

933
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:51,676
What is it this time?

934
00:59:52,177 --> 00:59:54,262
Why do you still have these hanging?

935
00:59:54,346 --> 00:59:56,181
You're going to donate them?

936
00:59:58,141 --> 00:59:59,517
Eat while you're here. Come.

937
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,773
There's a serious problem.

938
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:07,275
-This isn't a time to be eating.
-What is it?

939
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:12,864
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

940
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:14,449
See? You screen my calls.

941
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:16,660
-Why do you ignore my calls? Why?
-Sorry?

942
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:21,665
I see. One moment, please.

943
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,083
Hang on.

944
01:00:28,713 --> 01:00:31,800
I'd like to tell you about what they did
to their test subjects.

945
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:33,635
So there were problems, weren't there?

946
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:36,096
Yes. I can't tell you the details
over the phone.

947
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:37,514
I'd like to meet soon.

948
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:39,516
Of course.

949
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:41,351
Go ahead.

950
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:43,603
All right.

951
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:46,856
I'll head over there right now. Goodbye.

952
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:54,197
Babel E&amp;C is--

953
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,991
This is urgent. Speak with him, okay?

954
01:00:57,075 --> 01:00:58,910
Dad! Mr. Hong!

955
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:12,799
What is it?

956
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:23,727
They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.

957
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:26,730
Evacuate the tenants right now.

958
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:29,607
They say they'll avoid
the residential area,

959
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:31,985
but who knows what'll happen?

960
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:36,489
I've only met you three days ago,

961
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,533
but this is the first time
you seem worried.

962
01:01:39,284 --> 01:01:44,122
I'm worried about none other than myself.

963
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:46,374
If my dad gets hurt during the demolition,

964
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:48,293
it'll do me no good.

965
01:01:48,877 --> 01:01:52,756
Think about it.
What will my colleagues think of me?

966
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:54,424
I see.

967
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:03,183
What is this place? A crime scene?

968
01:02:07,145 --> 01:02:09,189
Darn it. You're done, right?

969
01:02:09,939 --> 01:02:11,566
Unbelievable.

970
01:02:11,649 --> 01:02:14,736
I told him many times
not to pile up the dirty dishes.

971
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,879
MOTEL

972
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,521
Hello, Mr. Yu Min-chul.

973
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:15,380
They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.

974
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:17,674
Evacuate the tenants right now.

975
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:28,434
How can I stop them?

976
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,104
How?

977
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:36,693
What?

978
01:03:37,235 --> 01:03:38,236
Tonight?

979
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,946
Yes, at 11 p.m.

980
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:41,781
How could you tell us now?

981
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:44,367
-You're unbelievable.
-When they come,

982
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:48,705
I could grab and nail them to the ground.

983
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:50,623
Since I know martial arts,

984
01:03:51,124 --> 01:03:53,084
I'm afraid I might kill them.

985
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,335
Nail them, my foot.

986
01:03:54,419 --> 01:03:56,379
We should evacuate. Do you want to die?

987
01:03:56,462 --> 01:04:00,216
Goodness. Babel, those assholes.

988
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,176
I hope they all go under!

989
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,386
Is there a solution?

990
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,389
Mr. Hong is busily--

991
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:07,473
Busily doing what?

992
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:08,558
Tell us.

993
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:10,226
I didn't see him all day.

994
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:16,649
This is where we live and work.

995
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,362
If we evacuate,
we'll be leaving behind everything.

996
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:27,327
I bought all my utensils new last month.

997
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:28,536
Me too.

998
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,080
I got a loan two months ago
and bought a new piano.

999
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:32,415
Mamma mia.

1000
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:33,666
Mr. Cassano.

1001
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:37,086
Say something, will you?

1002
01:04:38,796 --> 01:04:41,049
Goodness, that damn man.

1003
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:42,675
What the hell is he doing?

1004
01:04:42,759 --> 01:04:46,012
Who cares? Let's go pack our things.

1005
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:49,807
I'll protest outside and distract them.

1006
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:52,268
What the hell are you doing?

1007
01:04:54,479 --> 01:04:59,025
Sir, you don't have time
to be liking photos online.

1008
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:01,152
-What?
-What is he liking?

1009
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:06,032
Come up with a solution, will you?

1010
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:21,130
IMAGES MATCHING VINCENZO CASSANO
SEARCHED ON 13:11

1011
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:24,842
Isn't anyone in here?

1012
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,595
Hold on.

1013
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:29,389
Who locked the door?

1014
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:33,685
Damn it. Hey, open up.

1015
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,023
Vincenzo Cassano…

1016
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:41,526
Vincenzo Cassano.

1017
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:47,323
O sole mio

1018
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:51,244
-Pack everything!
-Goodness!

1019
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:57,000
Hey…

1020
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:05,049
Is that true?

1021
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:06,217
Yes.

1022
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:09,095
I called you yesterday,
but you weren't picking up.

1023
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:11,889
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

1024
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:13,307
What time is it?

1025
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:16,477
Let me think. What should I do?

1026
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:21,065
What should I do?

1027
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:26,738
ATTORNEY HONG CHA-YOUNG

1028
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,131
I'll call you back.

1029
01:06:47,467 --> 01:06:49,093
Nothing is easy these days.

1030
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:52,680
Everything requires so much work.
It's such a headache.

1031
01:06:52,764 --> 01:06:57,977
All notable paintings
have several layers of paint.

1032
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:02,106
But then again, it's our job
to paint over without leaving a trace.

1033
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:07,236
-When will I get to see the chairman?
-Right.

1034
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,405
In two days.

1035
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:13,659
He has great expectations for you.

1036
01:07:14,994 --> 01:07:17,246
I need to see for myself how crazy he is.

1037
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,042
Sir.

1038
01:07:23,002 --> 01:07:24,045
Why are you here?

1039
01:07:24,128 --> 01:07:25,755
I have something urgent to report.

1040
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:28,049
What is it?

1041
01:07:28,132 --> 01:07:30,885
I caught wind of something
at the Babel headquarters.

1042
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:33,429
One of the researchers
of Babel Pharmaceuticals

1043
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:36,015
ran away during the quarantine.

1044
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:37,391
What?

1045
01:07:37,475 --> 01:07:38,893
Damn it.

1046
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:41,604
They've dropped a giant bomb on us.

1047
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:43,272
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1048
01:07:55,535 --> 01:07:56,536
Shouldn't you go?

1049
01:07:56,619 --> 01:07:58,329
There's nothing I can do.

1050
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:23,896
Where are you, Dad?

1051
01:08:25,106 --> 01:08:26,899
Why are you still there?

1052
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:28,943
Don't worry. I won't die.

1053
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:31,821
Cut that nonsense and get out of there.

1054
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:35,575
I'm turning my phone off again.
You're distracting me.

1055
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:39,453
Dad!

1056
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:41,330
Oh, come on!

1057
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,541
Wait!

1058
01:08:56,596 --> 01:08:58,222
The stress is killing me.

1059
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,935
-Hello, sir.
-Hey!

1060
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:04,020
Where are you?

1061
01:09:04,103 --> 01:09:06,063
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

1062
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:16,949
Come over here.

1063
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:19,202
Okay.

1064
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:21,704
All right.

1065
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:23,539
Sir, we're ready.

1066
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:30,588
All right! Let's go!

1067
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:31,964
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1068
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:50,691
Come on.

1069
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:19,303
Damn it.

1070
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:53,379
What is this?

1071
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:56,424
TRADITIONAL SICILIAN WINE PARTY
FOR INSIDERS

1072
01:11:00,553 --> 01:11:01,846
What is this?

1073
01:11:07,018 --> 01:11:09,520
-What? What is that?
-A party?

1074
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:43,054
We're at the Traditional Sicilian
Wine Party for Insiders.

1075
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:44,889
I've finally arrived.

1076
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:47,558
Make sure to subscribe and like my video.

1077
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:07,953

-Cheers.

1078

Cheers.

1079
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:15,419
-Mr. Nam.
-Sir.

1080
01:12:15,503 --> 01:12:18,214
These men love this party.

1081
01:12:18,297 --> 01:12:19,673
They've been complimenting.

1082
01:12:19,757 --> 01:12:21,342
Hello. Thank you for coming.

1083
01:12:21,926 --> 01:12:24,095
-Cheers.
-How nice.

1084
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:26,639
We still have a lot of time,
so please enjoy the party.

1085
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,645
Let's leave him here. Let's go.

1086
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:59,398
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

1087
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:00,608
We don't need him.

1088
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:02,234
Wait.

1089
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:09,617
How about

1090
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:13,287
we have a party tonight?

TRADITIONAL SICILIAN WINE PARTY
FOR INSIDERS

1094
01:15:09,218 --> 01:15:11,470
Excuse me for a second, sir.

1095
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,223
Hello, sir.

1096
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:16,976
He's the owner of the shop next door.

1097
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:17,977
I see.

1098
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,728
Hello. Thank you for coming.

1099
01:15:19,812 --> 01:15:20,854
The spaghetti is good.

1100
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:23,148
-Please escort them.
-This way.

1101
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:51,695
Have you grasped the core problem
of this lawsuit?

1102
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:54,615
Drugs? Cartels? Do you think this is
some American TV show?

1103
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:56,784
Stupid idiot.

1104
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:58,118
Hey, it's Vincenzo!

1105
01:16:58,202 --> 01:17:00,579
They're not businessmen. They're monsters.

1106
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:03,707
They couldn't care less
about the lives of others.

1107
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:07,086
Can you not represent
Babel Pharmaceuticals?

1108
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:09,963
That will be the end of you, you brat.

1109
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:11,340
I will not cave in without a fight.

1110
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:13,342
Why are you so reckless?

1111
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,136
For me, running away
isn't the coward's way out.

1112
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,722
It's putting other people in danger.

1113
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:20,474
Don't try anything funny.

1114
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,059
You'll be dead if anything happens to me.
