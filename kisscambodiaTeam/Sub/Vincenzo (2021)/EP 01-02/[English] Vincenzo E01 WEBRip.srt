VINCENZO CASSANO

00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,718
CONSIGLIERE

7
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,679
A LEGAL ADVISER OR COUNSELOR
OF AN ITALIAN MAFIA'S BOSS

8
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,383
To Emilio's house.

9
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,801
Yes, Mr. Consigliere.

10
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,562
EPISODE 1

11
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,615
Why did you come here?

12
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,223
GRECCO VINEYARD

13
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,572
How can you do business
even on the day of your boss' funeral?

14
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
This is the last offer from my boss,
Fabio.

15
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,507
An offer from his grave? Not interested.

16
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,300
You can take it and leave.

17
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,725
Killing Union President Carlo
to take over the vineyard and the union

18
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,894
was a mistake on your part.

19
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,146
He was like

20
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,567
a brother to Fabio.

21
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,819
Whatever the offer is,
I won't be accepting it.

22
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,490
Does it sound like an offer to you?

23
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,038
This is Fabio's last act of mercy to a man

24
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,834
who killed his dear friend.

25
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,338
Are you here to make a deal…

26
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,008
or to threaten me?

27
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,013
If you sign this now,

28
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,807
there won't be any problems.

29
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,975
Get lost.

30
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,563
Go back to your country,
you arrogant yellow.

31
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,608
I fought fair and square to take over.

32
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,860
The Cassano family has no shares
in this place.

33
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,903
Get out of here.

34
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,797
You sure you won't regret it?

35
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,511
Regret?

36
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,598
The Lucino family is backing me up.

37
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,643
I'm not scared to go to war.

38
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,691
Regret is the most painful thing
you can experience in life.

39
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,194
Emilio.

40
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,574
I am here to give you a chance
to redeem yourself,

41
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,243
not to start a war.

42
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,371
Sure. Whatever.

43
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
<i>Arigatou.</i>

44
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,749
You uncivilized yellow.

45
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,475
Emilio.

46
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,773
You will pay

47
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,734
for disrespecting my people.

48
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,112
You neanderthal.

49
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,120
Vincenzo, did you curse at me?

50
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,163
What did you say to me?

51
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,219
Why are they spraying
the pesticides today?

52
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,682
We sprayed them last week.

53
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,689
Damn it! What…

54
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,736
Shit.

55
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,946
They're not spraying pesticides.

56
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,208
Oh, no! It's all burning!

57
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,959
Everything is burning!

58
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,378
Don't just stand there!

59
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,090
Move it! Now!

60
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,383
Hurry!

61
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,304
That asshole, Vincenzo!

62
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,722
I'll get my revenge!

63
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,558
I'll get back at everyone!
You and the Cassano family!

64
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,602
Hurry!

65
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,518
Father.

66
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,497
You could have done that
after the funeral.

67
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,709
It was his last order.

68
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,004
He told me to take care of it
as soon as possible.

69
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,631
Even so,

70
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,051
burning down the entire vineyard
was stupid.

71
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,847
He said I could use any means necessary
to get it done.

72
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,226
Right. My father always trusted
your decisions,

73
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,353
but never trusted mine.

74
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,651
Because you were always careless
when you took care of things.

75
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,072
You went against his word
that no matter what happens,

76
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,449
we do not harm women or children.

77
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,378
Vincenzo.

78
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,422
My friend.

79
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,507
My brother.

80
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,804
Now that I'm your boss,
I'd like to see you be more loyal.

81
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,888
Paolo.

82
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,682
My brother.

83
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,103
I am always ready
to show my loyalty to you…

84
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,859
as long as you deserve it.

85
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,103
Looking for me?

86
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,478
<i>Did you enjoy the party?</i>

87
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,271
Vincenzo.

88
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,401
<i>I can hear Payan barking.
You must be heading towards the door.</i>

89
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,530
How did you…

90
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,408
<i>Oh, right. Let me apologize in advance.</i>

91
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,994
<i>I know that it's your favorite car.</i>

92
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,628
<i>I didn't kill you
out of respect for Fabio.</i>

93
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,798
And this will be the last time.

94
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm leaving Italy
and will never come back.

95
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,895
Do not look for me.

96
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,950
The next time you try to find me,

97
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,162
the car will explode before you get off.

98
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,748
<i>Paolo.</i>

99
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,417
I knew you didn't deserve to be the boss.

100
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,823
LIST OF BUSINESSES IN GEUMGA PLAZA

101
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,515
GEUMGA PLAZA TO BE DEMOLISHED
DUE TO CONGLOMERATE'S TYRANNY

102
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,142
GEUMGA PLAZA

103
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,128
Ta-da!

104
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,673
Get your blood sugar up with this.

105
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,008
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE

106
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,719
I bought this from the most popular bakery
in Yeonnam-dong.

107
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,722
I'm good. Please go.

108
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,850
Eating this tasty snack

109
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,519
in the middle of a long day
is a form of happiness.

110
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,521
I'm happy enough already.

111
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,485
You're happy?

112
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,445
Didn't you sign up as a test subject

113
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,781
at a pharmaceutical
to pay back your student loan?

114
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,658
You didn't have any side effects,

115
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,410
but you were the only one
who blew the whistle.

116
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,246
-How can you be happy right now?
-I can.

117
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,248
I believe my action meant something.

118
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,459
You are fearless.

119
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,920
But…

120
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,758
will you still be happy
when Babel Pharmaceuticals sues you?

121
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,759
What?

122
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,804
They're livid right now.

123
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,182
They just ordered us
to destroy your life, Seon-ho.

124
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,065
No one really cares
about what happens to you.

125
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,901
Why? Because your sob story
won't make anyone sad.

126
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,319
It's not sad at all.

127
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,366
I'm the only one who actually
cares about your life, Seon-ho.

128
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,867
It's just me, Hong Cha-young.

129
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,956
Pull the cake topper.

130
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,214
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE

131
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,765
How much is that?

132
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,657
My goodness. What a mess.

133
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,669
-Sorry, Cha-young.
-Where are you manners?

134
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,213
If you were late,
you should've taken a taxi.

135
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,840
That's faster than a taxi.

136
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,425
Besides, that's the city's trend.

137
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,469
Just tell me why you're late.

138
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,764
Lawyer Yoon In-seo told me
to make 1,200 copies out of the blue.

139
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,725
Intern Jang Joon-woo.

140
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,186
Tell me the kind of person
I hate the most.

141
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,353
Robotic people.

142
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,731
Right.
People who work their ass off like robots,

143
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,066
but always fall short in the end.

144
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,737
I might be lacking,
but aren't I a good intern?

145
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,697
A lovely intern at that?

146
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,158
If you start wearing different ties,

147
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,410
I'll think about
whether to like you or not.

148
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,371
But Steve Jobs wore the same turtlenecks.

149
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,624
I prefer sophisticated men
to stubborn men.

150
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,963
COURTHOUSE

151
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,674
DAY 1 OF THE HEARING
FOR BABEL PHARMCEAUTICAL'S LAWSUIT

152
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,364
Claiming the victims died
from the side effects of the drug

153
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,782
is still preposterous.

154
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,576
The plaintiff is provoking the press
with unproven evidence.

155
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,663
The victims all passed away
from cardiac infarction

156
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
and had no prior conditions.

157
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,583
One of them had arrhythmia.
Another had pulmonary edema.

158
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,627
And another had low blood pressure.

159
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,673
She extracted these conditions
from the victims' old medical histories.

160
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,174
The paramedics on the scene

161
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,885
stated that they showed typical signs
of an overdose.

162
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,096
Paramedics aren't licensed doctors.

163
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,890
They only stated the external symptoms.

164
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,894
Your Honor, I have the recording-based
statement from one of the test subjects.

165
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,773
Babel coerced him
to make a false statement

166
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
to silence the others.

167
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,777
-This statement clearly states--
-Your Honor.

168
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,280
The test subject who made the statement

169
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,865
turned himself in for perjury an hour ago.

170
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,035
I submit the interrogation report
as evidence.

171
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,708
After perjuring himself,
the witness planned

172
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,961
to extort money from Babel Pharm
through the plaintiff's counsel.

173
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,879
But as he was conscience-stricken,

174
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,507
-he decided to turn himself in.
-Your Honor.

175
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,304
It's a one-sided statement. His perjury
charge hasn't been established.

176
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,389
The recording should
be admissible in court.

177
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,475
We will rule
once the witness' perjury charge

178
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,727
has been established.

179
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,564
The next hearing will be held
a week from today in this courtroom.

180
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,736
That is all.

181
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,704
Give me a cigarette.

182
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,707
-I quit two years ago.
-Just leave, then.

183
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,211
At least wash your hair
when you come to court.

184
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,633
I don't need that from you. Just go.

185
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,678
We could have just settled out of court.

186
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:53,432
How could you start this mess
when you weren't even sure you could win?

187
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,726
Start this mess?

188
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,522
-That's no way to talk to your father.
-I thought you disowned me.

189
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,483
Right.

190
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,486
No daughter of mine would
buy off a witness like that.

191
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,946
Do you find peace
when you criticize your daughter?

192
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,740
You and Babel deserve it.

193
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,241
You guys are like mafias.

194
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,580
How could you be so proud
of destroying the powerless?

195
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:21,585
Dad.

196
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,213
Can't you stop?

197
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,633
Even if you don't treat me
like your daughter,

198
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,178
I still worry so much about you.

199
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,764
I worry that this might be
taking a toll on you

200
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,683
physically and emotionally.

201
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,268
Dad.

202
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,690
If you stop, I'll help you.

203
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,194
I'm embarrassed to say this now,
but now that I'm older,

204
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,197
I realized that family comes first.

205
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,330
-Cha-young.
-Yes, Dad.

206
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,875
Why don't you quit being a lawyer
and start anew as an actor?

207
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,337
That way, you won't ruin
other people's lives.

208
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,592
You'll never beat me!

209
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,971
We'll find out when it ends.

210
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,099
Also, I've made up my mind.
I am really going to disown you.

211
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,350
How will you do that?

212
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,602
I'm sure I'll find a way.

213
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,438
Bye.

214
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,785
Excuse me.

215
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,204
I need to do an inspection.

216
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,376
WANTED
NAME: PARK JEONG-GUK

217
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,045
May I see your identification?

218
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,679
REPUBLICA ITALIANA
VINCENZO CASSANO

219
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,520
Gosh. You're Korean Italian.

220
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,856
I'm so sorry. Gosh, my bad.

221
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,777
The wanted man is Korean, you see.

222
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,196
Gosh, I'm sorry.

223
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,700
Oh, my. You have such a cool name.

224
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,786
"Vincen Zo"?

225
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,871
Which Zo clan are you from?

226
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,048
-Give me back my passport.
-Okay.

227
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,889
Yes. Mr. Cho. I got here safely.

228
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,600
I see.

229
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,936
See you there, then.

230
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,855
It will take about an hour and a half.

231
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,524
Okay.

232
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,194
Come on. How can they cancel
when I just got here?

233
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,865
Excuse me. Are you looking for a taxi?

234
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes.

235
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,829
I drive a limousine.

236
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,456
My appointment just got canceled,
so I am available.

237
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,582
Where are you headed?

238
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,544
Geumga-dong, Seoul.

239
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,922
Really? Then, I promise to
give you a comfortable ride.

240
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,507
-I'm good.
-I'm good, too.

241
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,467
Please get in. All right.

242
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,346
Gosh, you're so handsome.

243
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,283
Did you enjoy your trip?

244
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,827
Where did you go?

245
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,704
I'd prefer not to talk.

246
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,539
Okay. I apologize.

247
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,671
Turn on the news instead.

248
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,214
Okay.

249
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,427
<i>…was apprehended by the police.</i>

250
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,888
<i>In several fishing villages,
Korea Coast Guard…</i>

251
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,098
<i>I must finish everything in a month.</i>

252
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,226
<i>Then I'll leave for Malta right away.</i>

253
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,606
<i>There have been many reports of crimes
against foreigners at our airport.</i>

254
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,942
<i>According to the police, they pretend
to be taxi drivers at the airport,</i>

255
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,445
<i>offer drinks after spiking them
with sleeping pills,</i>

256
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,948
<i>-and steal their valuables. Especially…</i>
-Gosh, these assholes.

257
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,077
How could they when Bong Joon-ho
and BTS worked so hard for our image?

258
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,246
Scumbags like them
are ruining our reputation.

259
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:27,956
Don't you agree?

260
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,667
<i>Based on the victim's statement
about the stolen valuables,</i>

261
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,921
<i>-A month from now, I'll be…
-the police are investigating if there are</i>

262
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,672
<i>any accomplices.</i>

263
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,258
<i>…drinking a cold beer</i>

264
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,261
<i>on Xlendi Bay.</i>

265
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,682
The in-flight meal must've been salty.

266
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,935
He chugged the whole bottle.

267
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,074
Mr. An.

268
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,160
They caught Agent Wang when he was tailing
them in Incheon and cut his arm off.

269
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,578
What? Where is he now?

270
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,621
Can they reattach it?

271
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,206
Damn it.

272
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,252
Ma'am, ten minutes ago, Masato of
the Kawaguchi Gang stabbed himself

273
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,547
with a bread knife at a bakery in Busan
when our agents surrounded him.

274
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,258
What? With a bread knife?

275
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,301
Gosh, that's really long.

276
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,637
-Call for a helicopter and move out.
-Okay.

277
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,099
So what? Do you have the details?

278
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,767
How the hell did he get here?

279
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,581
He's…

280
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,251
He's a consigliere to the mafia.

281
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,336
He's in Korea?

282
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,053
When he came to Korea five years ago,
he was just an ordinary lawyer.

283
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,682
But now, he's no longer a small fry.
He's the key member of the mafia.

284
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,893
He came back to Korea as a consigliere.

285
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,274
Hey, Mr. An.

286
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,987
Why would they come all the way to Korea?
To achieve what?

287
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,989
There's a lot here in Korea.

288
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,907
We're a global target now.

289
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,452
Then, perhaps,
he just came here on a holiday

290
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,829
to have bulgogi, <i>dongdongju,
makgeolli</i>, and <i>pajeon</i>.

291
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,205
We should welcome him.

292
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,083
Sir, this isn't something
you should take lightly.

293
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,627
-The consigliere is a mafia's--
-What about it?

294
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,881
What the heck is that supposed to be?

295
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,216
It's like you're trying to get scolded.

296
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,926
We have to track him, sir!

297
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,138
The Italian mafia are a heinous bunch.

298
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,806
Just let him be.

299
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,100
Don't you dare launch some operation.

300
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,852
-But he's the consigliere--
-Why you…

301
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,165
Ms. Hong, I heard
you scored a big one today.

302
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,917
Congratulations, Ms. Hong.

303
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
You are indeed my role model.

304
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,352
<i>Yes, I did it again today</i>

305
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,020
<i>Go, Hong Cha-young</i>

306
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,772
<i>You're so cool, Cha-young</i>

307
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,900
<i>I am so cool</i>

308
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,360
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

309
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:50,075
<i>Hong Cha-young, Hong Cha,
Hong Cha, Hong Cha-young</i>

310
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,870
I should install blinds here.

311
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,205
Everyone can see through.

312
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,961
Come on, you should've gone easy on him.
He's your dad.

313
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,173
He's not my dad.
He's the counsel for the plaintiff.

314
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,053
Your dad still goes by his nickname
the Tosa among the alumni.

315
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,181
That's why he always takes things too far,
not knowing when to stop.

316
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,434
I'll end this at the next hearing.

317
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:16,852
Yes. That's it.

318
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,773
A competent lawyer can end things
before things get out of hand.

319
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,738
I should've quashed this
when he filed the petition. I'm sorry.

320
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,781
It's okay.

321
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,537
You should get off work early today
and have some fun.

322
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,746
Oh, right.

323
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,541
Check your bank account.

324
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,210
It's a bonus.

325
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,299
You don't have to give me a bonus.

326
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,927
You are already treating me so well here.

327
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,139
Hold on.

328
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,392
Gosh, I'm so touched.

329
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,480
It's fine. Just take it
and spend it all today.

330
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,441
Gosh, Cha-young.

331
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,902
<i>Cha-young, Cha-young, Hong Cha-young</i>

332
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,904
I'm so moved. I'm serious.

333
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,534
Did he deduct taxes again?

334
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,120
Come on.

335
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,416
His meals must've been salty.

336
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,336
I didn't even ask him to drink it.
He just drank it on his own.

337
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,630
Hey, didn't I tell you?

338
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,591
When I saw him at the airport,
I knew he was loaded.

339
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,510
Gosh, this is a designer bag, too.

340
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,719
Wait. What's this?

341
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,641
This must be over 4,000 dollars.

342
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,146
-Holy shit.
-Hey.

343
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,439
Look at his watch.

344
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,443
If this is authentic,
it'll cost over 100 million won.

345
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,153
Hey. It can't be a knockoff, right?

346
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,075
-Gosh, no way.
-Right? Right.

347
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,201
Look at his style.

348
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,745
He'd never wear a fake watch.

349
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,038
-Hey.
-Look at this.

350
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,873
-He even smells good, too.
-Really?

351
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,959
Find his cologne, too.

352
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,170
You're up.

353
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,716
Who are you guys?

354
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,426
Us?

355
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,554
We are what you think we are.

356
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,682
Seriously?

357
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,684
Gosh, that sounded so cool.

358
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,395
-I told you you were talented.
-Drop the beat.

359
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,206
50,000 WON

360
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,772
I swear I'm going to catch
you assholes and kill you!

361
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,149
I swear to God I will!

362
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,819
Stupid Korea.

363
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,822
Stupid Korea!

364
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,866
Be quiet!

365
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,743
I told you to be quiet!

366
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,494
Shit.

367
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,664
Damn it.

368
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,000
Shut up!

369
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,346
Damn it.

370
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,142
Damn it!

371
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,103
50,000 WON

372
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:01,076
Damn Korea! Damn it! Damn you, Korea!

373
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,036
You're dead!

374
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,246
Damn it!

375
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,668
Damn it!

376
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,213
Look over there.

377
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,299
He seems like a nice person
now that I get a closer look.

378
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,134
-He's so handsome.
-He is.

379
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,678
-He seems nice.
-Yes.

380
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,638
She only likes handsome guys.

381
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,473
-Seriously.
-Gosh.

382
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,686
Here.

383
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,979
Like this. Go ahead.

384
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,361
-It looks like he was beat up.
-Really?

385
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,906
-He's sure is handsome.
-That's all you care about.

CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
THE ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW

388
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,776
<i>My goal is</i>

389
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,947
<i>tearing down this building.</i>

390
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,366
What do you need advice with?

5 YEARS AGO, MILAN
CASSANO FAMILY'S STUDY

392
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,163
My friend, Fabio, told me

393
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,667
that you knew a safe way to hide my gold.

394
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,670
He said his old friend, Fabio, told him

395
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,924
that you would tell him
how to safely hide his gold.

396
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:43,762
I want to hide my gold in Korea,
not China.

397
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:50,018
And it must be kept safe to the point
that no one can steal it.

398
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,479
He wants to hide it in Korea.

399
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,815
And he wants it to be safe to the point
that no one can steal it.

400
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,947
<i>There is this method our family uses
which has been passed down for 50 years.</i>

401
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,867
<i>Buy an old building in Korea.</i>

402
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,036
<i>Buy the building under my friend,</i>

403
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,414
<i>Mr. Cho's name
so you don't raise any suspicions.</i>

404
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:16,169
<i>And then, make one of the lots
look like either a shop or a company.</i>

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

406
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,549
<i>And hire technicians</i>

407
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,511
<i>to create a secret room in the basement
to store your gold.</i>

408
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:33,269
<i>To avoid getting caught,
transport the gold little by little.</i>

409
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,649
<i>To open the secret room,</i>

410
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,486
<i>the biometric system that recognizes
only you should be utilized.</i>

411
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,907
<i>It must only recognize you.
Not even your family or friends.</i>

412
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,381
<i>But there's more.</i>

413
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,550
<i>That secret room</i>

414
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,761
<i>comes with a special feature.</i>

415
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,096
Sir.

416
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,224
-Mr. Cho, have you been well?
-Yes.

417
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,562
What on earth happened to you?

418
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,106
It's nothing.

419
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,527
What about my residence?

420
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,862
I heard you were coming,
so I had it cleaned.

421
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,532
And I also put away your items
and clothes from Italy.

422
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,784
-Let's get going now.
-Okay.

423
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,121
How are things going?

424
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,622
As you read it in the file,

425
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,125
the Development Opposition Committee
has been formed.

426
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,836
I already told them that
I wouldn't sell off the building.

427
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,212
But they won't believe me.

428
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,338
Oh, right.

429
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,550
Babel E&C bought
all the shops around the plaza.

430
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,304
Any other pressure from Babel E&C?

431
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,723
Nothing, other than the team leader
of Investment and Development

432
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,600
coming here daily to make an offer.

433
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:21,878
Sir.

434
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,385
The bathroom…

435
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,304
Damn it.

436
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,827
I already set up the bed
and blankets for you.

437
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,539
And I will schedule a meeting
with the tenants tomorrow.

438
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,960
Okay. Sure.

439
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,673
Once this project is done,

440
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,300
are you interested in staying in Korea?

441
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,430
No.

442
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,474
I see.

443
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,104
I put your new cell phone, cash,
and the things you asked for

444
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,689
in the bedroom.

445
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,357
Okay.

446
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,153
What's that?

447
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:33,449
Oh, the previous tenants put them up.

448
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,327
Should I get them off?

449
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,414
That's fine. I won't be here long.

450
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,919
Gosh, that's a lot.

451
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,463
<i>-Really?
-Yes.</i>

JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

453
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:53,094
I definitely saw a man with
the building owner at the entrance.

454
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,512
So I followed them.

455
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,100
But it looks like he even rented out
a housing unit upstairs from us.

456
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,393
-A housing unit?
-Yes.

457
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,354
When you saw him,
what's the vibe you got from him?

458
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,527
He kind of gave off an eerie vibe.

459
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,988
What was that movie called?

460
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,116
He looked like a handsome movie villain.

461
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,370
Did you know?

462
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,915
Handsome villains are
scarier and more brutal.

463
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,130
That must be why people
are scared of me. Goodness.

464
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,467
People aren't scared of you, Mr. Lee.

465
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,763
Should I go scare him
and get some information?

466
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,389
Like who he is and why he's here.

467
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,851
Mr. Nam, come closer. Come.

468
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,189
I'll grab his throat and twist it to
the side. Then, he'll start talking.

469
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,231
-Name?
-Nam Ju-sung.

470
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,399
-Where are you from?
-Wangsimni.

471
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,234
-Favorite food?
-<i>Tteokbokki</i>.

472
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,529
-Let go of his throat now.
-Okay.

473
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,489
Okay. You're good.

474
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,074
Tell the rest of the tenants.

475
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,116
-Hurry.
-Okay.

476
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,041
Most of the existing tenants moved out.

477
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,126
We have some tenants left
on the third floor.

478
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,461
Why is that?

479
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,422
The lawyer in the Opposition Committee
is on the third floor.

480
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,549
So that must have played a part in this.

481
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,548
The tenants in this building
are very cautious of me.

482
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,052
This is interesting.

483
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,555
DRY CLEANING

484
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,861
-Well…
-Gosh.

485
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,825
-It's an Italian restaurant.
-Yes.

486
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,711
Well, this is the usual routine.

487
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,843
This is a dancing studio.

488
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,055
What's wrong with him? Is he sick?

489
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,313
He's definitely sick.

490
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,857
Don't eat it, then.

491
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,650
Give me that.

492
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,111
You're basically telling me
my food is awful!

493
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,738
It's just fishy.

494
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,826
Your good looks can't save your ass.

495
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,913
I'm dirt-poor and have no connections!
That's everything I've got!

496
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,250
Stop it!

497
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,795
-I tap out.
-What are you looking at?

498
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,303
I like fishy food!

YEONGHO SNACK BAR

500
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,519
Save me!

501
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,980
-My goodness.
-You brat!

502
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,192
How could you only get 18 points
on your Korean test? Seriously?

503
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,276
Why you…

504
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,655
-I did my best.
-Are you a foreigner?

505
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,949
Are you not from here?
Are you from the States?

506
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,411
Get your guard up. Do it, you brat.

507
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,080
Keep your guard up, you punk.

508
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,713
Please save me. She's going to kill me.

509
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,007
You don't deserve to be saved.

510
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,217
Mom, it really hurts.

511
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,678
-Mom.
-You're a disgrace to this town.

512
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,471
I didn't give birth to an idiot.

513
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,973
They must be insane.

514
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,808
-Yes. This is supposed to hurt!
-What?

515
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,727
-You punk.
-Mom, come on!

516
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,354
You brat.

00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,158
Well…

519
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,578
Let's go to the basement
where the secret room is.

520
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,498
The business that used to be there
went under,

521
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,709
so I picked a more stable tenant.

522
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,918
Are you sure about that?

523
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,379
They are well-mannered.

So, the tenants…

526
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,303
It's a temple.

-Yes. Hello, sir.
-Hello.

532
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,619
I have joined
the Development Opposition Committee.

533
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,580
I plan to protect our temple.

534
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:04,340
All right. He felt a strong presence
of Buddha from beneath the temple.

535
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,050
-He's been fasting.
-"From beneath"?

536
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,427
-No.
-What about it?

537
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,595
-He's fasting.
-Yes.

538
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,181
He's just fasting. He's not eating.

539
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,519
I don't know who you are,

540
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,648
but you should clean your outfit
before you clean out your mind.

541
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:33,828
Gosh.

542
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,255
I want to get these dry cleaned.

543
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:49,218
BEST LAUNDROMAT

544
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,808
This is a very rare suit
you can't find in Korea.

545
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,476
The material is different, too.

546
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,062
It's a vintage brand label.

547
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,316
No, you're not getting it.
It's custom tailored in Italy

548
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,235
-by Booralro--
-As in "Testicles"?

549
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,407
Stop lying. Everyone says their suit
is expensive when they come here.

550
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,910
I'm serious. This was a limited edition
of Booralro's fall line.

551
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,581
What nasty name is "Testicles"?

552
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,499
I can tell this is cheap.

553
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,171
I'm from unit 606.
I want them by tomorrow.

554
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,257
You should've come yesterday then.
I can't finish them by tomorrow.

555
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,240
I heard that you came
with the building owner.

556
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,618
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

557
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,287
I'm the CEO and the senior lawyer
of Jipuragi Law Firm

558
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,915
and the chairman of
the Development Opposition Committee.

559
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm Lawyer Hong Yu-chan.

560
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,128
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

561
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,213
I see.

562
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,049
Nice to meet you.

563
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,801
I'm Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

564
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,261
-What?
-Is "Vin" his last name?

565
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,305
-Right.
-Is he Chinese?

566
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,765
-He might be.
-What did he say?

567
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,183
I don't know. What was that?

568
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,101
Just treat my name as an English name.

569
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,437
Vincenzo Cassano.

570
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,357
-It was Casanova. Casanova.
-That was English.

571
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,525
-Vincenzo Casanova?
-Right.

572
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,694
You must not be licensed
to practice law here.

573
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,072
No. I'm from Italy.

574
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,992
Mr. Baek, you've been to Italy.

575
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,619
-Yes, that's right.
-Right?

576
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,872
He studied to be a chef in Milan, Italy.

577
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:46,001
Then, you two must have
a lot to talk about.

578
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:50,005
We'll talk when an occasion
organically arises. We'll talk then.

579
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,632
Where in Milan did you stay?

580
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,135
Well, I was in Milan, Italy.

581
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,639
I stayed in the heart of Milan.

582
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,765
Uffizi?

583
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,850
Uffizi.

584
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,856
Nice to meet you.

585
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,066
I'll stop by later.

586
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,903
Okay.

587
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,699
I guess he understood it. What did he say?

588
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,785
If you're licensed in Italy,

589
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,788
you can't practice law here
other than give advice.

590
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,083
That's correct. I'm not here
to practice law here, anyway.

591
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,044
-I simply came to offer some advice.
-Is that so?

592
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,298
The owner told us
he wouldn't sell the building.

593
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,633
But we don't trust him.

594
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,760
We're different, Mr. Hong.

595
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,013
Don't say stuff like that.

596
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,473
Who would turn down a big payout
from a conglomerate?

597
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,687
We will tell you the details
at the meeting tomorrow afternoon.

598
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,030
Vincenzo Cassano.

599
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,423
What's wrong with the water?

600
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,345
Damn it.

601
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,435
Good.

602
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,275
Damn it.

603
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,944
There's no hot water?

604
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,114
Damn it.

605
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,369
There it is.

606
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,122
It's hot!

607
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,090
Are you kidding me?

608
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,890
What's wrong with the hot water?

609
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,267
Look at me.

610
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,355
It's so hot.

611
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,650
So hot!

612
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,612
Hot!

613
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,066
Come on.

614
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,675
Gosh.

615
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,874
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
CHEONGJU WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

616
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,925
Defense, make your argument.

617
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,968
The defense rests.

618
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,639
Prosecution, question the defendant.

619
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,141
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja

620
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,310
was often criticized
by Chairman Hwang Deok-bae

621
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,439
and his family for her improper behaviors
as a housekeeper.

622
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,443
On the day of the incident, when
he said she didn't do her job properly,

623
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,154
she was livid and assaulted him
which led to his death.

624
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,114
The defense rests.

625
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,659
Your Honor,

626
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,454
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja
had abandoned her own child in the past.

627
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,832
I'm submitting her affidavit
of voluntary relinquishment

628
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,960
of parental rights
to an orphanage in Incheon.

629
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,639
As she is a coldblooded mother
who even abandoned her own child,

630
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,600
it's highly likely that she does not value
other people's lives.

631
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,686
This proves the validity--

632
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,229
That's irrelevant to this case.

633
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,774
You're my lawyer. Say something.

634
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,235
I was sexually harassed.

635
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,737
His whole family is lying!

636
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,198
Don't say anything.
This will work against you.

637
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,955
Chairman Hwang sexually harassed
his previous housekeepers.

638
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,332
He harassed every woman
that came to work for him.

639
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,292
Defendant.

640
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,502
If you speak without permission again,

641
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,504
you will be escorted out.

642
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,927
Suit yourselves.

643
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:33,098
<i>You've already made your ruling.</i>

644
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,691
HONG YU-CHAN OF JIPURAGI LAW FIRM
APPOINTED AS THE NEW LAWYER

645
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,192
RETRIAL REFUSED BY THE INMATE

LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

647
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,583
…APPOINTED AS THE NEW LAWYER

648
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,808
<i>The statement given by the test subject
who blew the whistle</i>

649
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,935
<i>on the risks
of Babel Pharm's clinical trials,</i>

650
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,938
<i>turned out to be false
which deeply impacted the lawsuit.</i>

651
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,816
<i>Lee had been a participant
in the clinical trial for RDU-90,</i>

652
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,861
<i>a new drug developed
by Babel Pharmaceuticals.</i>

653
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,113
-Hey, look at that lady.
<i>-He planned to extort…</i>

654
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,157
<i>-money from the company.</i>
-Is she mad?

00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,534
-<i>His intention</i>

<i>was exposed at the hearing.</i>

657
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,954
Goodness, look at her swinging her hip.

658
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:41,083
<i>-Their new drug, RDU-90, shows…</i>
-Does she not have a washing machine?

659
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,876
Why is she dancing here?

660
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,588
This is a therapeutic place for me.
So what?

661
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,007
<i>…the market is expected to face some heat.</i>

662
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,176
I heard everything, you punks.

663
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:56,640
How dare you sexually harass a woman
in a public place?

664
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,935
Do you want the Ministry of Justice
to lock you up? You rascals.

665
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:02,854
Give me that.

666
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,940
Give me your phone now.

667
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,737
My gosh. Look at this. What…

668
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,364
I should smack you.

669
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,908
Should I send you to prison for this?

670
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:19,413
What's wrong
with a little dancing, you punks?

671
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,373
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

672
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:23,875
You stay here.

673
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,963
Sit down.

674
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,091
I'm not done with you yet.
I have one more bag of blankets to wash.

675
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,308
TI DIAMO IL

676
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:45,522
<i>You're my sun
How beautiful you are</i>

677
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,149
You are beautiful.

678
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,567
You're so handsome.

679
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,361
<i>I love</i>

680
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,121
Welcome.

681
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,749
What's your best dish?

682
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,835
Well, that would be my porcini dish.

683
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,963
It's truffle porcini spaghetti.

684
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,884
Everything on your menu sounds delicious.

685
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,637
I'll have that.

686
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,306
What?

687
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,724
Yes.

688
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:04,935
It tastes like you took this out
from a trash can.

689
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,271
But I'm glad…

690
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,358
that you removed the maggots.

691
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,656
So you studied in Uffizi, Milan?

692
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,617
Yes, in Uffizi.

693
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,286
I see.

694
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,583
But Uffizi is in Florence, not Milan.

695
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,502
What?

696
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,505
I…

697
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,594
A con artist.

698
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,686
-He learned to cook at Uffizi Gallery?
-Excuse me.

699
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,770
I…

700
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:52,357
Come again.

CHEONGJU WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

702
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:08,707
You're out.

703
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,198
The look on your face tells me
you're losing again.

704
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:46,119
Did you become a psychic?
How can you tell?

705
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,665
It's been five years
since I first met you.

706
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,585
I can tell just by looking at you.

707
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,255
Has it been that long?

708
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,218
You're being treated, right?

709
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:02,969
Thanks to you.

710
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,974
To be less of a burden to you,
I should die soon.

711
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:11,770
Gosh. Come on. Don't say stuff like that.

712
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,438
Hearing that drains my energy.

713
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,196
You don't have to visit me
every month now.

714
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,074
People might think
that you're my secret husband.

715
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,575
You can tell them that I am.

716
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,287
It will be nice for Cha-young
to have a mom.

717
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,164
Gosh. Goodness.

718
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,672
Anyway, Ms. Oh,

719
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,384
-for one last time--
-Don't even bring up the retrial.

720
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,470
I really don't need it.

721
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,141
Just leave me be.

722
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:57,065
I've done a lot of bad things in life.

723
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,121
Did you have a nice trip?

724
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,872
Yes.

725
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:16,126
The team leader from Babel's Investment
and Development is on his way.

726
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,460
I'll go and meet him.

727
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,753
Where should we meet?

728
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,548
There's a cafe across the street.

729
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,882
How about my office?

730
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,012
It concerns our plaza.

731
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,556
Wouldn't it be better to do it
in my office?

732
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,397
How many times must I repeat myself?

733
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,567
My client will demolish the building
and build a new one.

734
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,445
And the previous tenants
will have their lots back.

735
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,866
All right.

736
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,161
This is our last offer.

737
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,997
It's a much better offer
from two days ago.

738
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,875
It's the best we can do.

739
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,188
Do you not understand me?

740
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:19,731
I hear you just fine.

741
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,399
You know what?

742
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,194
I wanted to wrap things up nicely.

743
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,031
If you keep this up, things will get ugly.

744
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,535
I'm here on behalf of Babel E&C.

745
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,748
If you keep rejecting our offer,
you'll regret it later.

746
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,212
-Are you threatening me?
-Just a little?

747
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,215
Don't ever threaten me again.

748
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,969
It's my first and last advice to you.

749
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,638
What?

750
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,848
-No one is here yet?
-No.

751
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,725
Did you eat?

752
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,268
-Hey.
-Gosh.

753
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,355
-Hey, do you have more? What is it?
-Gosh, what?

754
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,941
Mr. Tak, take off your shoes
when you come in.

755
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,484
Sorry about that. Are you upset?

756
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,361
-You always forget that.
-Sorry.

757
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,990
Mr. Lee, do you have
a wet rag attached to your feet?

758
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:14,702
Either wash your feet
or put on some socks.

759
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:15,703
Sorry.

760
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,873
My sweat glands are clustered
on the bottoms of my feet.

761
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,708
-It's an illness.
-Come on.

762
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,673
Everyone, please don't touch the glass
when you open the door.

763
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,843
Do you know how hard it is to wipe this?
There's a handle here.

764
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,349
Gosh, my mirror.

765
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,810
Sorry.

766
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:42,188
I closed the curtains for a reason.

767
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,942
All right. So is everyone here?

768
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,163
As tenants, we want your promise.

769
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,042
That's why we plan to draw up
an agreement by tomorrow.

770
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,587
And you can sign it
by the end of this week.

771
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,798
I know what you said yesterday,
but are you really a lawyer in Italy?

772
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,217
Yes.

773
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,053
Then how will you handle it
when you don't know our law?

774
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,806
I don't think
my legal qualification matters here.

775
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,808
Our promise to you and your signatures do.

776
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:22,395
I will guarantee that you will have
your lots back once I rebuild this place.

777
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,563
You promise, right?

778
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,901
We never lie.

779
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,360
What do you think?

780
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:34,574
Well, they seem very genuine.
Why don't we trust them?

781
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:39,913
I'm also going to trust you,
Mr. Vincenzo Casanova.

782
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,749
Yes. Me, too, Mr. Casanova.

783
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,670
Let me inform you in advance.

784
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,468
I know martial arts.

785
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,721
If you are deceiving us,

786
01:06:56,804 --> 01:07:00,850
I'm going to put you in a guillotine choke
for six days straight.

787
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:05,146
Don't do stuff like that. No one cares.
You're embarrassing and so tacky.

788
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,648
Let's sum it up.

789
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,025
Who agrees to trust them?

790
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:16,115
My gosh. That annoying Vincenzo.
This doesn't feel right.

791
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,743
We have no choice.

792
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,120
Right. Damn it.

793
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:24,207
This is driving me crazy. Darn it.

794
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,043
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt
and go with the flow.

795
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,052
Merciful Buddha.

796
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,773
Mr. Hong.

797
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,776
The tenants have nothing
but your word to go on.

798
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,737
But I find this unfortunate

799
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,448
because it looks like
you're toying with us.

800
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,161
Is it that hard for you to trust me?

801
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,417
I pretended to trust you earlier
to assure the other tenants,

802
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:12,797
but I never trust people like you.

803
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,472
I am a lawyer,

804
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,683
and so are you.

805
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,853
But we clearly have different jobs.

806
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,480
You represent money,

807
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,274
but I represent people.

808
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,031
I also represent people.

809
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,365
Oh, yes.

810
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,451
Rich people.

811
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:47,206
I know Babel E&C will buy this building
so I prepared myself for everything.

812
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,542
So don't pretend
to be a mediator in front of me.

813
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,461
Just proceed with your plan.

814
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,403
Where's everyone?

815
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:19,989
Honey.

816
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,741
Ju-yeong.

817
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,451
My goodness!

818
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,203
Honey!

819
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,287
Ju-yeong!

820
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:29,707
-Who are you people?
-We don't have time to chitchat.

821
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:34,545
Ju-yeong.

Stamp your seal on it.

825
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,436
I have a show to catch on TV.

01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,698
I'm good.

835
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,826
What do you mean?

836
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,038
I'm not interested.

837
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,586
I'm so sick of him.

01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,517
Of course, sir.

841
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,811
-Gosh, that's a no-brainer.
-Come over here.

842
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,233
Yes.

843
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,277
Okay. I got it.

844
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,157
Check your bank account. It's over.

845
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,451
Hey, let's go.

846
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,577
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

847
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,870
Gosh, let's go.

848
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,506
It says that by nature of clinical trials…

849
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:42,840
Hello, Ms. Hong.

850
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:47,553
Who are you to barge into my office?
That's some nasty manner you have.

851
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,806
What's this?

852
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,265
Oh, that?

853
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,519
I mailed that to remove you
from my family registry.

854
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,105
You can't do that anymore.

855
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,691
The family registration system
was abolished ages ago.

856
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:01,818
You're a lawyer.

857
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,695
I can still try, can't I?

858
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,197
-Hey.
-Yes.

859
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,281
This one, too.

860
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:10,660
And look at this. This is ridiculous.

861
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,371
"The petitioner rejects
the following words

862
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,666
and any similar words from the recipient.
The following words are,

01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,919
<i>appa, abuji,</i> papa, daddy,
<i>otosang, bàba,</i> and <i>père</i>."

864
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,588
This is just outright ridiculous.

865
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,550
It's so immature.

866
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,929
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

867
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,639
I'm talking here.

01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,266

01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:43,025
You Korean. Damn you. Get out of my sight!

872
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,527
Damn it.

873
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,571
Yes.

874
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,073
What happened to my suit?

875
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,742
It's because your suit
was made from cheap fabric.

876
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:54,412
-It doesn't happen to good fabric.
-Cheap?

877
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,372
-Do you know how much this is?
-How much?

878
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,749
This is a limited edition
from Booralro's line…

879
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,795
There's no point in talking to him.

880
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,758
By the way, you have a nice build.

881
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:10,636
You know? You still look cool
with that tight suit.

882
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,971
This might catch on.

883
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,682
Did you do this on purpose?

884
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,894
What are you talking about?
I'm the laundry master.

885
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,812
Then you shouldn't have messed up!

886
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,277
You will have to pay

887
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,280
for what you did to my suit.

888
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,615
You will.

889
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:39,707
<i>Tenants of Geumga Plaza,
come out of the building now.</i>

890
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,959
Someone's looking for me.
Pay before you go.

891
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,796
Damn it.

892
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:52,887
Yes, Mr. Cho.

893
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,098
My wife and daughter were
taken hostage. I had no choice.

894
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,517
I'm sorry.

895
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,687
I'll fix this no matter what.

896
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,606
Yes. I will…

897
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,071
Mr. Cho.

898
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,659
Mr. Cho. Mr. Cho? Mr. Cho!

899
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:18,954
Fine. I can overlook everything
you wrote here. I can live with that.

900
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,207
But this one. Look.

901
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,670
"All the photos that the recipient
took with the petitioner as a minor and

902
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:28,673
photos that remind the recipient
of the petitioner as the parent

903
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,842
will be donated for the exhibition,
Geumga-dong's History,

904
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,553
held at the Sangcheon District Office
for public interest."

905
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,348
Who are you to donate my photos?

906
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,809
They're the epitome
of my embarrassing past!

907
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,102
It's up to me.

908
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,770
I raised you.

909
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:46,273
And does that give you the right
to abandon me? This is embarrassing!

910
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:47,566
"Embarrassing"?

911
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,403
It's because what you do
is less than human!

912
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,033
You're a lawyer. How could you not
have a sense of duty or justice?

913
01:14:56,117 --> 01:15:00,079
Your sense of duty just makes you
the nosiest lawyer in the world!

914
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:04,250
And your sense of justice is just
groundless hostility against the rich!

915
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,711
This is called mechanical justice!

916
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:07,878
"Mechanical justice"?

917
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,964
Then is following money
"rational justice"?

918
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,092
Yes. Money is justice in Korea.

919
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,468
And power means justice.

920
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,303
Then, keep living your life like that!

921
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,473
But do not show your face around me. Okay?

922
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,309
Okay. Let's cut off all ties!

923
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,894
-Yes. Let's do that.
-Don't.

924
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:25,604
Let's never call each other.

925
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,523
-I won't.
-Don't you dare call me!

926
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,649
-I won't.
-Mr. Hong!

927
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:29,692
Never call me!

928
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,901
Mr. Hong.

929
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,698
You have to come outside now.

930
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,452
GEUMGA PLAZA

931
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,664
Hello.

932
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,501
My gosh. You're a bunch of lazy bums.

933
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,212
Why haven't you put up the signs?

934
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,173
Do it now.

935
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,341
Aren't you cold?

936
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,635
Let's go.

937
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,970
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

938
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,267
NOTICE

939
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,894
SELLER: CHO YEONG-UN,
BUYER: BABEL E&C

940
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,228
-What happened?
-What?

941
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:07,980
-But he promised.
-What happened?

942
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,273
What do we do, then?

943
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,858
-Put it up. Just do it.
-Okay.

944
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,276
Cover up the sign.

945
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,196
Hello, sir.

946
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,702
Nice to meet you.

947
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,370
I'm Park Seok-do, the CEO of Ant Company

948
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,874
and the chairman of the Development
Committee for Babel Tower.

949
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,545
What kind of company is that?

950
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,714
It's a shady company
that performs dirty jobs

951
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,300
like high interest loans
and beating people up.

952
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,343
I see.

953
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:41,096
Oh, right. As of today,
this building belongs to Babel E&C.

954
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:44,517
Starting today,
the Compensation Team will visit you.

955
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,102
Let's handle this peacefully.

956
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,313
I knew it. Damn it.

957
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:52,024
This was their plan. But what?
They'll let us move back in?

958
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:55,444
That lousy Vincenzo or whatever.
I should've shrunk his suit even more.

959
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,779
-Where is he?
-Right.

960
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:00,366
If any of the tenants give us a hard time,

961
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:05,746
one of these uncompromising men
will tire you out physically and mentally.

962
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,789
Hey.

963
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,916
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

964
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,501
-Why?
-Who are you?

965
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,258
-You can't do this.
-Why not?

966
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,929
-Are you okay?
-You startled me.

967
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:22,930
I thought I hit you.

968
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,895
You can't block the path to the restroom.

969
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:34,066
-What about the people who need to go?
-You got me excited for a second.

970
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,901
Goodness.

971
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,529
-Guys, step aside. Gosh. It's urgent.
-Okay.

972
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,990
I don't want him to do his business here.
Hurry.

973
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,450
-Go. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

974
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:48,080
My goodness, that idiot.
He's so embarrassing.

975
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,373
Leave now.

976
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:53,043
You're violating the law
by threatening us like this.

977
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:56,505
Why don't you stop already?
We will compensate you handsomely.

978
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,215
You say you'll compensate us,

979
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,426
but you'll just beat us up
and kick us out.

980
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:04,054
This is a good occasion.
Why are you ruining the mood?

981
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:05,431
-Gosh.
-Hey.

982
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:08,767
Who are you?

983
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,312
I'm his only daughter.

984
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:14,106
And I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
of Law Firm Wusang.

985
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,735
-You're not my daughter.
-Come on. Be quiet.

986
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,532
-What is a lawyer from Wusang doing here?
-It's none of your business.

987
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,286
This isn't the way
to go about your business.

988
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,914
Don't you know the era we live in?

989
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:32,249
It's not like we're in
some '90s gangster movie!

990
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,500
Hey, miss.

991
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:37,171
Do you want to get beaten up
like the movies from the '90s?

992
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,299
-My goodness.
-Hey!

993
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,933
If you touch me again,

994
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,810
I'll make you pay for what you did!

995
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:55,189
Sure. Okay. Let's see how much money
I have to pay to settle with you!

996
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,399
Stop!

997
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:26,387
What did he say?

998
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,933
Where's my tape measure?

999
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,315
Do you also need to use the bathroom?

1000
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,401
Is it urgent?

1001
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,027
Go ahead. Go on.

1002
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,821
-Go.
-Let's talk.

1003
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,698
Who the heck are you?

1004
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,117
Vincenzo Cassano.

1005
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,413
I represent the owner of Geumga Plaza,
Cho Yeong-un.

1006
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,331
"Vinchenzo Quassano"?

1007
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:55,708
This is ridiculous.

1008
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,335
There's no talking your way out of this.

1009
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,300
Hey, hold on.

1010
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,097
Goodness.

1011
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,851
I'm not that curious, but I'll listen.

1012
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,150
So what is it?

1013
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,781
-Sir!
-Sir!

1014
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,787
-My nose is bleeding!
-A nosebleed?

1015
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,498
Gosh. Come on. Seriously.

1016
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,542
You jerk.

1017
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,340
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

1018
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,259
If you take one more step…

1019
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,265
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

1020
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,641
Just stay still.

1021
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:56,602
Everyone, stay still.

1022
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,109
Given the height of the building,
you won't die.

1023
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,694
You'll just break your leg.

1024
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,408
But if you're unlucky and fall head-first,

1025
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:16,580
I will be the last person
you see from this world.

1026
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:17,664
Right?

1027
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,334
Shouldn't we stop him?

1028
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,920
He said he won't die. Leave him.

1029
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:26,173
Pull me up now, you asshole. Pull me up!

1030
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:32,012
Babel E&C bought this building
through illegal means.

1031
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:36,975
And I will not forgive their atrocity.

1032
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,394
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

1033
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,729
Now!

1034
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,733
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

1035
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:48,612
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

1036
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,993
This building belongs to me.

1037
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,122
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

1038
01:21:58,205 --> 01:21:59,581
-What?
-What did he say?

1039
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,916
He said…

1040
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,755
<i>È mio!</i>

1041
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,274
SPECIAL THANKS TO JIN SUN-KYU,
LEE HEE-JUN, JEONG SOON-WON

1042
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,135
<i>I don't expect you to believe me.</i>

1043
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,052
<i>"Threatened"?</i>

1044
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,596
Are you still pulling that stunt of yours?

1045
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,308
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

1046
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,643
<i>My experience tells me
that there's more to this.</i>

1047
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:04,271
<i>A reason enough to make them act this way.</i>

1048
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,815
<i>He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.</i>

1049
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,860
<i>Aren't we the best in the country
when it comes to playing dirty?</i>

1050
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,738
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

1051
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,365
-Assholes like them should be made to pay.
-"Assholes"?

1052
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:17,284
Cha-young! Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

1053
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,496
<i>Legal or not, we'll get the job done.</i>
