1
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:34,662
My goal is

2
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:39,292
to tear down this building.

3
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:09,781
72 HOURS AGO, ROME, ITALY

4
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,918
CONSIGLIERE OF THE CASSANO FAMILY

5
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,963
VINCENZO CASSANO

6
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:09,674
CONSIGLIERE

7
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,635
A LEGAL ADVISER OR COUNSELOR
OF AN ITALIAN MAFIA'S BOSS

8
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:49,338
To Emilio's house.

9
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:50,756
Yes, Mr. Consigliere.

10
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,517
EPISODE 1

11
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:54,570
Why did you come here?

12
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,178
GRECCO VINEYARD

13
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:35,528
How can you do business
even on the day of your boss' funeral?

14
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,293
This is the last offer from my boss,
Fabio.

15
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:53,462
An offer from his grave? Not interested.

16
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,256
You can take it and leave.

17
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,681
Killing Union President Carlo
to take over the vineyard and the union

18
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:05,850
was a mistake on your part.

19
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,102
He was like

20
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,522
a brother to Fabio.

21
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:13,774
Whatever the offer is,
I won't be accepting it.

22
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,446
Does it sound like an offer to you?

23
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,994
This is Fabio's last act of mercy to a man

24
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,789
who killed his dear friend.

25
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,294
Are you here to make a deal…

26
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,963
or to threaten me?

27
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,968
If you sign this now,

28
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:43,763
there won't be any problems.

29
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:44,930
Get lost.

30
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:49,518
Go back to your country,
you arrogant yellow.

31
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:52,563
I fought fair and square to take over.

32
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:54,815
The Cassano family has no shares
in this place.

33
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,859
Get out of here.

34
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:15,753
You sure you won't regret it?

35
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:21,467
Regret?

36
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,553
The Lucino family is backing me up.

37
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,598
I'm not scared to go to war.

38
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:34,647
Regret is the most painful thing
you can experience in life.

39
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,149
Emilio.

40
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:42,530
I am here to give you a chance
to redeem yourself,

41
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,199
not to start a war.

42
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,326
Sure. Whatever.

43
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,536
Arigatou.

44
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,704
You uncivilized yellow.

45
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:08,431
Emilio.

46
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,728
You will pay

47
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:17,690
for disrespecting my people.

48
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,067
You neanderthal.

49
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,075
Vincenzo, did you curse at me?

50
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,119
What did you say to me?

51
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:44,175
Why are they spraying
the pesticides today?

52
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:48,637
We sprayed them last week.

53
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,644
Damn it! What…

54
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,691
Shit.

55
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,902
They're not spraying pesticides.

56
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,163
Oh, no! It's all burning!

57
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:57,915
Everything is burning!

58
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,334
Don't just stand there!

59
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,045
Move it! Now!

60
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:05,339
Hurry!

61
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,260
That asshole, Vincenzo!

62
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:10,678
I'll get my revenge!

63
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:13,514
I'll get back at everyone!
You and the Cassano family!

64
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:15,558
Hurry!

65
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,474
Father.

66
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,452
You could have done that
after the funeral.

67
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,665
It was his last order.

68
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,960
He told me to take care of it
as soon as possible.

69
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,586
Even so,

70
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,006
burning down the entire vineyard
was stupid.

71
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,803
He said I could use any means necessary
to get it done.

72
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,181
Right. My father always trusted
your decisions,

73
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:03,308
but never trusted mine.

74
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:09,606
Because you were always careless
when you took care of things.

75
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:14,027
You went against his word
that no matter what happens,

76
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:16,405
we do not harm women or children.

77
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,333
Vincenzo.

78
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,377
My friend.

79
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,463
My brother.

80
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:37,759
Now that I'm your boss,
I'd like to see you be more loyal.

81
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:38,844
Paolo.

82
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:40,637
My brother.

83
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,058
I am always ready
to show my loyalty to you…

84
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,814
as long as you deserve it.

85
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,058
Looking for me?

86
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,433
Did you enjoy the party?

87
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,226
Vincenzo.

88
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,357
I can hear Payan barking.
You must be heading towards the door.

89
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:42,486
How did you…

90
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,364
Oh, right. Let me apologize in advance.

91
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,950
I know that it's your favorite car.

92
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:56,583
I didn't kill you
out of respect for Fabio.

93
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,754
And this will be the last time.

94
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:08,971
I'm leaving Italy
and will never come back.

95
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:13,850
Do not look for me.

96
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:26,905
The next time you try to find me,

97
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,118
the car will explode before you get off.

98
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:33,704
Paolo.

99
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:36,373
I knew you didn't deserve to be the boss.

100
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,778
LIST OF BUSINESSES IN GEUMGA PLAZA

101
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:32,471
GEUMGA PLAZA TO BE DEMOLISHED
DUE TO CONGLOMERATE'S TYRANNY

102
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:34,097
GEUMGA PLAZA

103
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:02,084
Ta-da!

104
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,629
Get your blood sugar up with this.

105
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:06,963
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE

106
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,674
I bought this from the most popular bakery
in Yeonnam-dong.

107
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,677
I'm good. Please go.

108
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:15,806
Eating this tasty snack

109
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:18,475
in the middle of a long day
is a form of happiness.

110
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:20,477
I'm happy enough already.

111
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:25,440
You're happy?

112
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:27,400
Didn't you sign up as a test subject

113
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:29,736
at a pharmaceutical
to pay back your student loan?

114
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,613
You didn't have any side effects,

115
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,366
but you were the only one
who blew the whistle.

116
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:37,202
-How can you be happy right now?
-I can.

117
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,204
I believe my action meant something.

118
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,414
You are fearless.

119
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,875
But…

120
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,713
will you still be happy
when Babel Pharmaceuticals sues you?

121
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:49,714
What?

122
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,759
They're livid right now.

123
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:56,138
They just ordered us
to destroy your life, Seon-ho.

124
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:04,020
No one really cares
about what happens to you.

125
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,857
Why? Because your sob story
won't make anyone sad.

126
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,275
It's not sad at all.

127
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:13,321
I'm the only one who actually
cares about your life, Seon-ho.

128
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:14,823
It's just me, Hong Cha-young.

129
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:19,911
Pull the cake topper.

130
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:28,170
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE

131
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,721
How much is that?

132
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:54,613
My goodness. What a mess.

133
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,625
-Sorry, Cha-young.
-Where are you manners?

134
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,169
If you were late,
you should've taken a taxi.

135
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:10,795
That's faster than a taxi.

136
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,380
Besides, that's the city's trend.

137
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:14,424
Just tell me why you're late.

138
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:18,720
Lawyer Yoon In-seo told me
to make 1,200 copies out of the blue.

139
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:20,680
Intern Jang Joon-woo.

140
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:23,141
Tell me the kind of person
I hate the most.

141
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:24,309
Robotic people.

142
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:26,686
Right.
People who work their ass off like robots,

143
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,022
but always fall short in the end.

144
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,692
I might be lacking,
but aren't I a good intern?

145
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,653
A lovely intern at that?

146
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,113
If you start wearing different ties,

147
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,366
I'll think about
whether to like you or not.

148
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,327
But Steve Jobs wore the same turtlenecks.

149
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,579
I prefer sophisticated men
to stubborn men.

150
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,919
COURTHOUSE

151
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:53,630
DAY 1 OF THE HEARING
FOR BABEL PHARMCEAUTICAL'S LAWSUIT

152
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:16,319
Claiming the victims died
from the side effects of the drug

153
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:17,737
is still preposterous.

154
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:20,532
The plaintiff is provoking the press
with unproven evidence.

155
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:23,618
The victims all passed away
from cardiac infarction

156
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:24,703
and had no prior conditions.

157
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:27,539
One of them had arrhythmia.
Another had pulmonary edema.

158
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,582
And another had low blood pressure.

159
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,628
She extracted these conditions
from the victims' old medical histories.

160
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:35,130
The paramedics on the scene

161
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:37,841
stated that they showed typical signs
of an overdose.

162
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:40,051
Paramedics aren't licensed doctors.

163
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,846
They only stated the external symptoms.

164
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:46,850
Your Honor, I have the recording-based
statement from one of the test subjects.

165
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:50,729
Babel coerced him
to make a false statement

166
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,147
to silence the others.

167
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,733
-This statement clearly states--
-Your Honor.

168
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,235
The test subject who made the statement

169
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,821
turned himself in for perjury an hour ago.

170
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:02,991
I submit the interrogation report
as evidence.

171
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:08,663
After perjuring himself,
the witness planned

172
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,916
to extort money from Babel Pharm
through the plaintiff's counsel.

173
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,835
But as he was conscience-stricken,

174
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,463
-he decided to turn himself in.
-Your Honor.

175
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:21,259
It's a one-sided statement. His perjury
charge hasn't been established.

176
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,344
The recording should
be admissible in court.

177
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:26,431
We will rule
once the witness' perjury charge

178
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:27,682
has been established.

179
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,519
The next hearing will be held
a week from today in this courtroom.

180
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:36,691
That is all.

181
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:46,659
Give me a cigarette.

182
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,662
-I quit two years ago.
-Just leave, then.

183
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:54,167
At least wash your hair
when you come to court.

184
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:58,588
I don't need that from you. Just go.

185
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,634
We could have just settled out of court.

186
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:06,387
How could you start this mess
when you weren't even sure you could win?

187
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:08,681
Start this mess?

188
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:13,478
-That's no way to talk to your father.
-I thought you disowned me.

189
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:15,438
Right.

190
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:18,441
No daughter of mine would
buy off a witness like that.

191
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,902
Do you find peace
when you criticize your daughter?

192
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,695
You and Babel deserve it.

193
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,197
You guys are like mafias.

194
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:29,536
How could you be so proud
of destroying the powerless?

195
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:34,541
Dad.

196
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,168
Can't you stop?

197
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:40,588
Even if you don't treat me
like your daughter,

198
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:44,134
I still worry so much about you.

199
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:46,719
I worry that this might be
taking a toll on you

200
00:23:46,803 --> 00:23:48,638
physically and emotionally.

201
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:51,224
Dad.

202
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:55,645
If you stop, I'll help you.

203
00:23:56,396 --> 00:24:00,150
I'm embarrassed to say this now,
but now that I'm older,

204
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:03,153
I realized that family comes first.

205
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:11,286
-Cha-young.
-Yes, Dad.

206
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,831
Why don't you quit being a lawyer
and start anew as an actor?

207
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,293
That way, you won't ruin
other people's lives.

208
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,548
You'll never beat me!

209
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,926
We'll find out when it ends.

210
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,054
Also, I've made up my mind.
I am really going to disown you.

211
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,306
How will you do that?

212
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:33,558
I'm sure I'll find a way.

213
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:35,393
Bye.

214
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:49,741
Excuse me.

215
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:52,160
I need to do an inspection.

216
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:57,332
WANTED
NAME: PARK JEONG-GUK

217
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:00,001
May I see your identification?

218
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,635
REPUBLICA ITALIANA
VINCENZO CASSANO

219
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:16,476
Gosh. You're Korean Italian.

220
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,811
I'm so sorry. Gosh, my bad.

221
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:22,732
The wanted man is Korean, you see.

222
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,151
Gosh, I'm sorry.

223
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:29,656
Oh, my. You have such a cool name.

224
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:31,741
"Vincen Zo"?

225
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:33,826
Which Zo clan are you from?

226
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:44,003
-Give me back my passport.
-Okay.

227
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,844
Yes. Mr. Cho. I got here safely.

228
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:54,555
I see.

229
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,891
See you there, then.

230
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,811
It will take about an hour and a half.

231
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,479
Okay.

232
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,149
Come on. How can they cancel
when I just got here?

233
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,821
Excuse me. Are you looking for a taxi?

234
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:11,656
Yes.

235
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:14,784
I drive a limousine.

236
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,412
My appointment just got canceled,
so I am available.

237
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:18,538
Where are you headed?

238
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,499
Geumga-dong, Seoul.

239
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,877
Really? Then, I promise to
give you a comfortable ride.

240
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,462
-I'm good.
-I'm good, too.

241
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:28,423
Please get in. All right.

242
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,302
Gosh, you're so handsome.

243
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:52,238
Did you enjoy your trip?

244
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:54,782
Where did you go?

245
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,659
I'd prefer not to talk.

246
00:26:56,743 --> 00:26:58,494
Okay. I apologize.

247
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:05,626
Turn on the news instead.

248
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,170
Okay.

249
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,382
…was apprehended by the police.

250
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,843
In several fishing villages,
Korea Coast Guard…

251
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:16,054
I must finish everything in a month.

252
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,182
Then I'll leave for Malta right away.

253
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:23,561
There have been many reports of crimes
against foreigners at our airport.

254
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:26,898
According to the police, they pretend
to be taxi drivers at the airport,

255
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,400
offer drinks after spiking them
with sleeping pills,

256
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:32,904
-and steal their valuables. Especially…
-Gosh, these assholes.

257
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:37,033
How could they when Bong Joon-ho
and BTS worked so hard for our image?

258
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:39,202
Scumbags like them
are ruining our reputation.

259
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:40,912
Don't you agree?

260
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:43,623
Based on the victim's statement
about the stolen valuables,

261
00:27:43,706 --> 00:27:46,876
-A month from now, I'll be…
-the police are investigating if there are

262
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,628
any accomplices.

263
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:51,214
…drinking a cold beer

264
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:54,217
on Xlendi Bay.

265
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,638
The in-flight meal must've been salty.

266
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:00,890
He chugged the whole bottle.

267
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:15,029
Mr. An.

268
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:18,116
They caught Agent Wang when he was tailing
them in Incheon and cut his arm off.

269
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,534
What? Where is he now?

270
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:20,576
Can they reattach it?

271
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,161
Damn it.

272
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:27,208
Ma'am, ten minutes ago, Masato of
the Kawaguchi Gang stabbed himself

273
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,503
with a bread knife at a bakery in Busan
when our agents surrounded him.

274
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,213
What? With a bread knife?

275
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,257
Gosh, that's really long.

276
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:36,592
-Call for a helicopter and move out.
-Okay.

277
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:40,054
So what? Do you have the details?

278
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:41,723
How the hell did he get here?

279
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,537
He's…

280
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:07,206
He's a consigliere to the mafia.

281
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,292
He's in Korea?

282
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:18,009
When he came to Korea five years ago,
he was just an ordinary lawyer.

283
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:21,637
But now, he's no longer a small fry.
He's the key member of the mafia.

284
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:24,849
He came back to Korea as a consigliere.

285
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:30,229
Hey, Mr. An.

286
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:34,942
Why would they come all the way to Korea?
To achieve what?

287
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:36,944
There's a lot here in Korea.

288
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,863
We're a global target now.

289
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,407
Then, perhaps,
he just came here on a holiday

290
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:43,785
to have bulgogi, dongdongju,
makgeolli, and pajeon.

291
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,161
We should welcome him.

292
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,039
Sir, this isn't something
you should take lightly.

293
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:50,583
-The consigliere is a mafia's--
-What about it?

294
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,836
What the heck is that supposed to be?

295
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,172
It's like you're trying to get scolded.

296
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,882
We have to track him, sir!

297
00:29:58,716 --> 00:30:01,093
The Italian mafia are a heinous bunch.

298
00:30:01,177 --> 00:30:02,762
Just let him be.

299
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,056
Don't you dare launch some operation.

300
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,808
-But he's the consigliere--
-Why you…

301
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:28,120
Ms. Hong, I heard
you scored a big one today.

302
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,872
Congratulations, Ms. Hong.

303
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:31,916
You are indeed my role model.

304
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:48,307
Yes, I did it again today

305
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:49,976
Go, Hong Cha-young

306
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:51,727
You're so cool, Cha-young

307
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:54,856
I am so cool

308
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,315
Yes, yes, yes

309
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:03,030
Hong Cha-young, Hong Cha,
Hong Cha, Hong Cha-young

310
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:06,826
I should install blinds here.

311
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,160
Everyone can see through.

312
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:13,916
Come on, you should've gone easy on him.
He's your dad.

313
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:18,129
He's not my dad.
He's the counsel for the plaintiff.

314
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:23,009
Your dad still goes by his nickname
the Tosa among the alumni.

315
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:26,137
That's why he always takes things too far,
not knowing when to stop.

316
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:28,389
I'll end this at the next hearing.

317
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,807
Yes. That's it.

318
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,729
A competent lawyer can end things
before things get out of hand.

319
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,694
I should've quashed this
when he filed the petition. I'm sorry.

320
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:42,737
It's okay.

321
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:48,492
You should get off work early today
and have some fun.

322
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:49,702
Oh, right.

323
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,496
Check your bank account.

324
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,166
It's a bonus.

325
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,254
You don't have to give me a bonus.

326
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,883
You are already treating me so well here.

327
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,094
Hold on.

328
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,348
Gosh, I'm so touched.

329
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,436
It's fine. Just take it
and spend it all today.

330
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,396
Gosh, Cha-young.

331
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,857
Cha-young, Cha-young, Hong Cha-young

332
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,859
I'm so moved. I'm serious.

333
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:27,490
Did he deduct taxes again?

334
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,076
Come on.

335
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,372
His meals must've been salty.

336
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:37,291
I didn't even ask him to drink it.
He just drank it on his own.

337
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:39,585
Hey, didn't I tell you?

338
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:42,546
When I saw him at the airport,
I knew he was loaded.

339
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,465
Gosh, this is a designer bag, too.

340
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:45,675
Wait. What's this?

341
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:50,596
This must be over 4,000 dollars.

342
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:56,102
-Holy shit.
-Hey.

343
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:57,395
Look at his watch.

344
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,399
If this is authentic,
it'll cost over 100 million won.

345
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,109
Hey. It can't be a knockoff, right?

346
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,030
-Gosh, no way.
-Right? Right.

347
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:09,156
Look at his style.

348
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,701
He'd never wear a fake watch.

349
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:12,994
-Hey.
-Look at this.

350
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,829
-He even smells good, too.
-Really?

351
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:16,914
Find his cologne, too.

352
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,126
You're up.

353
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:24,672
Who are you guys?

354
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,382
Us?

355
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,509
We are what you think we are.

356
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:31,637
Seriously?

357
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:33,639
Gosh, that sounded so cool.

358
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,350
-I told you you were talented.
-Drop the beat.

359
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,162
50,000 WON

360
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,728
I swear I'm going to catch
you assholes and kill you!

361
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,104
I swear to God I will!

362
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,775
Stupid Korea.

363
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,778
Stupid Korea!

364
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:30,821
Be quiet!

365
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:32,698
I told you to be quiet!

366
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,450
Shit.

367
00:34:36,452 --> 00:34:37,620
Damn it.

368
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:39,955
Shut up!

369
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,301
Damn it.

370
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:57,098
Damn it!

371
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:00,059
50,000 WON

372
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:14,031
Damn Korea! Damn it! Damn you, Korea!

373
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:15,991
You're dead!

374
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,202
Damn it!

375
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,624
Damn it!

376
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,168
Look over there.

377
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:29,255
He seems like a nice person
now that I get a closer look.

378
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,090
-He's so handsome.
-He is.

379
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,633
-He seems nice.
-Yes.

380
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,593
She only likes handsome guys.

381
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:36,428
-Seriously.
-Gosh.

382
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,641
Here.

383
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,935
Like this. Go ahead.

384
00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:49,316
-It looks like he was beat up.
-Really?

385
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,862
-He's sure is handsome.
-That's all you care about.

386
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:20,764
GEUMGA PLAZA

387
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:26,812
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
THE ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW

388
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:29,732
My goal is

389
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:33,903
tearing down this building.

390
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,322
What do you need advice with?

391
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:38,365
5 YEARS AGO, MILAN
CASSANO FAMILY'S STUDY

392
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:41,118
My friend, Fabio, told me

393
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:45,623
that you knew a safe way to hide my gold.

394
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,626
He said his old friend, Fabio, told him

395
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,880
that you would tell him
how to safely hide his gold.

396
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,717
I want to hide my gold in Korea,
not China.

397
00:36:57,635 --> 00:37:02,973
And it must be kept safe to the point
that no one can steal it.

398
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:05,434
He wants to hide it in Korea.

399
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,771
And he wants it to be safe to the point
that no one can steal it.

400
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:15,903
There is this method our family uses
which has been passed down for 50 years.

401
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,822
Buy an old building in Korea.

402
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,991
Buy the building under my friend,

403
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:24,370
Mr. Cho's name
so you don't raise any suspicions.

404
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:29,124
And then, make one of the lots
look like either a shop or a company.

405
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,042
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

406
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,505
And hire technicians

407
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:37,466
to create a secret room in the basement
to store your gold.

408
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:46,225
To avoid getting caught,
transport the gold little by little.

409
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,604
To open the secret room,

410
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:54,441
the biometric system that recognizes
only you should be utilized.

411
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,862
It must only recognize you.
Not even your family or friends.

412
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:14,336
But there's more.

413
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,505
That secret room

414
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,717
comes with a special feature.

415
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,051
Sir.

416
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,179
-Mr. Cho, have you been well?
-Yes.

417
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:28,517
What on earth happened to you?

418
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,061
It's nothing.

419
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,482
What about my residence?

420
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:37,818
I heard you were coming,
so I had it cleaned.

421
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,487
And I also put away your items
and clothes from Italy.

422
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,740
-Let's get going now.
-Okay.

423
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,076
How are things going?

424
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,578
As you read it in the file,

425
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,080
the Development Opposition Committee
has been formed.

426
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:52,791
I already told them that
I wouldn't sell off the building.

427
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,168
But they won't believe me.

428
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,294
Oh, right.

429
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:58,505
Babel E&amp;C bought
all the shops around the plaza.

430
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:02,259
Any other pressure from Babel E&amp;C?

431
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:04,678
Nothing, other than the team leader
of Investment and Development

432
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:06,555
coming here daily to make an offer.

433
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:34,833
Sir.

434
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,341
The bathroom…

435
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:44,259
Damn it.

436
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,783
I already set up the bed
and blankets for you.

437
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:11,495
And I will schedule a meeting
with the tenants tomorrow.

438
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:14,915
Okay. Sure.

439
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,628
Once this project is done,

440
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:22,256
are you interested in staying in Korea?

441
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,386
No.

442
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:29,430
I see.

443
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:34,059
I put your new cell phone, cash,
and the things you asked for

444
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,644
in the bedroom.

445
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,312
Okay.

446
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,109
What's that?

447
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:46,405
Oh, the previous tenants put them up.

448
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:49,283
Should I get them off?

449
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,369
That's fine. I won't be here long.

450
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:57,875
Gosh, that's a lot.

451
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,419
-Really?
-Yes.

452
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:01,420
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

453
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:06,049
I definitely saw a man with
the building owner at the entrance.

454
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,468
So I followed them.

455
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,055
But it looks like he even rented out
a housing unit upstairs from us.

456
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,348
-A housing unit?
-Yes.

457
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:16,310
When you saw him,
what's the vibe you got from him?

458
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:22,483
He kind of gave off an eerie vibe.

459
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,943
What was that movie called?

460
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,071
He looked like a handsome movie villain.

461
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,326
Did you know?

462
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,871
Handsome villains are
scarier and more brutal.

463
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,085
That must be why people
are scared of me. Goodness.

464
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:45,422
People aren't scared of you, Mr. Lee.

465
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,718
Should I go scare him
and get some information?

466
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,345
Like who he is and why he's here.

467
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,806
Mr. Nam, come closer. Come.

468
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:59,144
I'll grab his throat and twist it to
the side. Then, he'll start talking.

469
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:00,187
-Name?
-Nam Ju-sung.

470
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,355
-Where are you from?
-Wangsimni.

471
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,190
-Favorite food?
-Tteokbokki.

472
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:06,485
-Let go of his throat now.
-Okay.

473
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:07,444
Okay. You're good.

474
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,029
Tell the rest of the tenants.

475
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,072
-Hurry.
-Okay.

476
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,996
Most of the existing tenants moved out.

477
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,082
We have some tenants left
on the third floor.

478
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:21,416
Why is that?

479
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,378
The lawyer in the Opposition Committee
is on the third floor.

480
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,505
So that must have played a part in this.

481
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,503
The tenants in this building
are very cautious of me.

482
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,008
This is interesting.

483
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,510
DRY CLEANING

484
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,816
-Well…
-Gosh.

485
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,780
-It's an Italian restaurant.
-Yes.

486
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:44,666
Well, this is the usual routine.

487
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:51,798
This is a dancing studio.

488
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:56,011
What's wrong with him? Is he sick?

489
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:03,268
He's definitely sick.

490
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:05,812
Don't eat it, then.

491
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,606
Give me that.

492
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:10,067
You're basically telling me
my food is awful!

493
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,693
It's just fishy.

494
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,782
Your good looks can't save your ass.

495
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,868
I'm dirt-poor and have no connections!
That's everything I've got!

496
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:24,206
Stop it!

497
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,751
-I tap out.
-What are you looking at?

498
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:35,258
I like fishy food!

499
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,140
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

500
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:43,475
Save me!

501
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:45,936
-My goodness.
-You brat!

502
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,147
How could you only get 18 points
on your Korean test? Seriously?

503
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,232
Why you…

504
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:53,610
-I did my best.
-Are you a foreigner?

505
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:55,904
Are you not from here?
Are you from the States?

506
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:00,367
Get your guard up. Do it, you brat.

507
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,035
Keep your guard up, you punk.

508
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,669
Please save me. She's going to kill me.

509
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:12,963
You don't deserve to be saved.

510
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:14,172
Mom, it really hurts.

511
00:45:14,256 --> 00:45:16,633
-Mom.
-You're a disgrace to this town.

512
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,427
I didn't give birth to an idiot.

513
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,928
They must be insane.

514
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:21,763
-Yes. This is supposed to hurt!
-What?

515
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,683
-You punk.
-Mom, come on!

516
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:26,309
You brat.

517
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,854
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

518
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:39,114
Well…

519
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,534
Let's go to the basement
where the secret room is.

520
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:45,454
The business that used to be there
went under,

521
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:47,664
so I picked a more stable tenant.

522
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:48,874
Are you sure about that?

523
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,334
They are well-mannered.

524
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:55,297
NANYAK TEMPLE

525
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,341
So, the tenants…

526
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,259
It's a temple.

527
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:04,890
NANYAK TEMPLE

528
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,108
That monk is sitting on

529
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:17,903
15 tons of gold.

530
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,859
You are the owner of the building.

531
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:01,404
-Yes. Hello, sir.
-Hello.

532
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:04,574
I have joined
the Development Opposition Committee.

533
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:07,536
I plan to protect our temple.

534
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:17,295
All right. He felt a strong presence
of Buddha from beneath the temple.

535
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,005
-He's been fasting.
-"From beneath"?

536
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,383
-No.
-What about it?

537
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:22,551
-He's fasting.
-Yes.

538
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:25,136
He's just fasting. He's not eating.

539
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,474
I don't know who you are,

540
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:33,603
but you should clean your outfit
before you clean out your mind.

541
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,783
Gosh.

542
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,210
I want to get these dry cleaned.

543
00:47:58,461 --> 00:48:02,173
BEST LAUNDROMAT

544
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:08,763
This is a very rare suit
you can't find in Korea.

545
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,432
The material is different, too.

546
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,018
It's a vintage brand label.

547
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:17,272
No, you're not getting it.
It's custom tailored in Italy

548
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:19,190
-by Booralro--
-As in "Testicles"?

549
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:24,362
Stop lying. Everyone says their suit
is expensive when they come here.

550
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:27,866
I'm serious. This was a limited edition
of Booralro's fall line.

551
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:31,536
What nasty name is "Testicles"?

552
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:33,455
I can tell this is cheap.

553
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,126
I'm from unit 606.
I want them by tomorrow.

554
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:41,212
You should've come yesterday then.
I can't finish them by tomorrow.

555
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,196
I heard that you came
with the building owner.

556
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:08,573
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

557
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:11,242
I'm the CEO and the senior lawyer
of Jipuragi Law Firm

558
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:13,870
and the chairman of
the Development Opposition Committee.

559
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:15,955
I'm Lawyer Hong Yu-chan.

560
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,084
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

561
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,168
I see.

562
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,004
Nice to meet you.

563
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,757
I'm Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

564
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,217
-What?
-Is "Vin" his last name?

565
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,260
-Right.
-Is he Chinese?

566
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:30,720
-He might be.
-What did he say?

567
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:32,138
I don't know. What was that?

568
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,057
Just treat my name as an English name.

569
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:36,393
Vincenzo Cassano.

570
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:39,312
-It was Casanova. Casanova.
-That was English.

571
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,481
-Vincenzo Casanova?
-Right.

572
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:43,650
You must not be licensed
to practice law here.

573
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:46,027
No. I'm from Italy.

574
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:49,948
Mr. Baek, you've been to Italy.

575
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:51,574
-Yes, that's right.
-Right?

576
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:54,828
He studied to be a chef in Milan, Italy.

577
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:58,957
Then, you two must have
a lot to talk about.

578
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:02,961
We'll talk when an occasion
organically arises. We'll talk then.

579
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,587
Where in Milan did you stay?

580
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,091
Well, I was in Milan, Italy.

581
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:11,594
I stayed in the heart of Milan.

582
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:12,721
Uffizi?

583
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:14,806
Uffizi.

584
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:20,812
Nice to meet you.

585
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:22,021
I'll stop by later.

586
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:25,859
Okay.

587
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:29,654
I guess he understood it. What did he say?

588
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:32,741
If you're licensed in Italy,

589
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:35,744
you can't practice law here
other than give advice.

590
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:39,038
That's correct. I'm not here
to practice law here, anyway.

591
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:42,000
-I simply came to offer some advice.
-Is that so?

592
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,253
The owner told us
he wouldn't sell the building.

593
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:47,589
But we don't trust him.

594
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:49,716
We're different, Mr. Hong.

595
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:51,968
Don't say stuff like that.

596
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:54,429
Who would turn down a big payout
from a conglomerate?

597
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:59,642
We will tell you the details
at the meeting tomorrow afternoon.

598
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:08,985
Vincenzo Cassano.

599
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:27,378
What's wrong with the water?

600
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,300
Damn it.

601
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:39,390
Good.

602
00:51:45,104 --> 00:51:46,231
Damn it.

603
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:48,900
There's no hot water?

604
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,070
Damn it.

605
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:56,324
There it is.

606
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:00,078
It's hot!

607
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:09,045
Are you kidding me?

608
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,846
What's wrong with the hot water?

609
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,223
Look at me.

610
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:24,310
It's so hot.

611
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:27,605
So hot!

612
00:52:30,608 --> 00:52:31,568
Hot!

613
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:09,022
Come on.

614
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:34,631
Gosh.

615
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,829
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
CHEONGJU WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

616
00:54:13,419 --> 00:54:15,880
Defense, make your argument.

617
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:17,924
The defense rests.

618
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:21,594
Prosecution, question the defendant.

619
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:24,097
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja

620
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,265
was often criticized
by Chairman Hwang Deok-bae

621
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:30,395
and his family for her improper behaviors
as a housekeeper.

622
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:34,399
On the day of the incident, when
he said she didn't do her job properly,

623
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:37,110
she was livid and assaulted him
which led to his death.

624
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:39,070
The defense rests.

625
00:54:40,154 --> 00:54:41,614
Your Honor,

626
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:45,410
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja
had abandoned her own child in the past.

627
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,788
I'm submitting her affidavit
of voluntary relinquishment

628
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:50,915
of parental rights
to an orphanage in Incheon.

629
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:03,594
As she is a coldblooded mother
who even abandoned her own child,

630
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:06,556
it's highly likely that she does not value
other people's lives.

631
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,641
This proves the validity--

632
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,184
That's irrelevant to this case.

633
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:13,730
You're my lawyer. Say something.

634
00:55:14,355 --> 00:55:16,190
I was sexually harassed.

635
00:55:16,274 --> 00:55:18,693
His whole family is lying!

636
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:21,154
Don't say anything.
This will work against you.

637
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:27,910
Chairman Hwang sexually harassed
his previous housekeepers.

638
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:30,288
He harassed every woman
that came to work for him.

639
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:31,247
Defendant.

640
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,458
If you speak without permission again,

641
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:35,460
you will be escorted out.

642
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:41,883
Suit yourselves.

643
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:46,054
You've already made your ruling.

644
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:55,646
HONG YU-CHAN OF JIPURAGI LAW FIRM
APPOINTED AS THE NEW LAWYER

645
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,148
RETRIAL REFUSED BY THE INMATE

646
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,912
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

647
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:12,538
…APPOINTED AS THE NEW LAWYER

648
00:56:26,511 --> 00:56:29,764
The statement given by the test subject
who blew the whistle

649
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:31,891
on the risks
of Babel Pharm's clinical trials,

650
00:56:31,974 --> 00:56:34,894
turned out to be false
which deeply impacted the lawsuit.

651
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:37,772
Lee had been a participant
in the clinical trial for RDU-90,

652
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:40,817
a new drug developed
by Babel Pharmaceuticals.

653
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,069
-Hey, look at that lady.
-He planned to extort…

654
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:45,113
-money from the company.
-Is she mad?

655
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:47,490
-His intention
-Does she think she's Jun Ji-hyun?

656
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:48,908
was exposed at the hearing.

657
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:50,910
Goodness, look at her swinging her hip.

658
00:56:50,993 --> 00:56:54,038
-Their new drug, RDU-90, shows…
-Does she not have a washing machine?

659
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:55,832
Why is she dancing here?

660
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:59,544
This is a therapeutic place for me.
So what?

661
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,963
…the market is expected to face some heat.

662
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:04,132
I heard everything, you punks.

663
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:09,595
How dare you sexually harass a woman
in a public place?

664
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:12,890
Do you want the Ministry of Justice
to lock you up? You rascals.

665
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,810
Give me that.

666
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:17,895
Give me your phone now.

667
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,693
My gosh. Look at this. What…

668
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:25,319
I should smack you.

669
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:27,864
Should I send you to prison for this?

670
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:32,368
What's wrong
with a little dancing, you punks?

671
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,328
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

672
00:57:35,913 --> 00:57:36,831
You stay here.

673
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:40,918
Sit down.

674
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:44,046
I'm not done with you yet.
I have one more bag of blankets to wash.

675
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:53,264
TI DIAMO IL

676
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:58,478
You're my sun
How beautiful you are

677
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:00,104
You are beautiful.

678
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:01,522
You're so handsome.

679
00:58:02,523 --> 00:58:04,317
I love

680
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:14,076
Welcome.

681
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,704
What's your best dish?

682
00:58:16,787 --> 00:58:19,790
Well, that would be my porcini dish.

683
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:22,919
It's truffle porcini spaghetti.

684
00:58:23,002 --> 00:58:26,839
Everything on your menu sounds delicious.

685
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:30,593
I'll have that.

686
00:58:30,676 --> 00:58:32,261
What?

687
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:33,679
Yes.

688
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:17,890
It tastes like you took this out
from a trash can.

689
00:59:20,184 --> 00:59:21,227
But I'm glad…

690
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,313
that you removed the maggots.

691
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:30,611
So you studied in Uffizi, Milan?

692
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:33,573
Yes, in Uffizi.

693
00:59:35,366 --> 00:59:36,242
I see.

694
00:59:38,035 --> 00:59:41,539
But Uffizi is in Florence, not Milan.

695
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,457
What?

696
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:46,460
I…

697
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:52,550
A con artist.

698
00:59:57,722 --> 01:00:00,641
-He learned to cook at Uffizi Gallery?
-Excuse me.

699
01:00:00,725 --> 01:00:01,726
I…

700
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:05,313
Come again.

701
01:00:05,396 --> 01:00:10,359
CHEONGJU WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

702
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:21,662
You're out.

703
01:00:50,941 --> 01:00:54,153
The look on your face tells me
you're losing again.

704
01:00:55,863 --> 01:00:59,075
Did you become a psychic?
How can you tell?

705
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:03,621
It's been five years
since I first met you.

706
01:01:04,413 --> 01:01:06,540
I can tell just by looking at you.

707
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:10,211
Has it been that long?

708
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,173
You're being treated, right?

709
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:15,925
Thanks to you.

710
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:20,930
To be less of a burden to you,
I should die soon.

711
01:01:21,013 --> 01:01:24,725
Gosh. Come on. Don't say stuff like that.

712
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:26,394
Hearing that drains my energy.

713
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:34,151
You don't have to visit me
every month now.

714
01:01:34,235 --> 01:01:37,029
People might think
that you're my secret husband.

715
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:38,531
You can tell them that I am.

716
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:42,243
It will be nice for Cha-young
to have a mom.

717
01:01:42,326 --> 01:01:44,120
Gosh. Goodness.

718
01:01:50,501 --> 01:01:51,627
Anyway, Ms. Oh,

719
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,339
-for one last time--
-Don't even bring up the retrial.

720
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:58,426
I really don't need it.

721
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:03,097
Just leave me be.

722
01:02:05,224 --> 01:02:10,020
I've done a lot of bad things in life.

723
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,076
Did you have a nice trip?

724
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:25,828
Yes.

725
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:29,081
The team leader from Babel's Investment
and Development is on his way.

726
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:30,416
I'll go and meet him.

727
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:31,709
Where should we meet?

728
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,503
There's a cafe across the street.

729
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:35,838
How about my office?

730
01:02:38,716 --> 01:02:39,967
It concerns our plaza.

731
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,511
Wouldn't it be better to do it
in my office?

732
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,352
How many times must I repeat myself?

733
01:02:50,936 --> 01:02:53,522
My client will demolish the building
and build a new one.

734
01:02:54,023 --> 01:02:56,400
And the previous tenants
will have their lots back.

735
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:00,821
All right.

736
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:04,116
This is our last offer.

737
01:03:04,825 --> 01:03:06,952
It's a much better offer
from two days ago.

738
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:09,830
It's the best we can do.

739
01:03:29,892 --> 01:03:31,143
Do you not understand me?

740
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:32,686
I hear you just fine.

741
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:34,355
You know what?

742
01:03:34,939 --> 01:03:37,149
I wanted to wrap things up nicely.

743
01:03:38,776 --> 01:03:40,986
If you keep this up, things will get ugly.

744
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:45,491
I'm here on behalf of Babel E&amp;C.

745
01:03:46,575 --> 01:03:49,703
If you keep rejecting our offer,
you'll regret it later.

746
01:03:52,581 --> 01:03:55,167
-Are you threatening me?
-Just a little?

747
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:58,170
Don't ever threaten me again.

748
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:02,925
It's my first and last advice to you.

749
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:04,593
What?

750
01:04:05,219 --> 01:04:06,804
-No one is here yet?
-No.

751
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:08,681
Did you eat?

752
01:04:08,764 --> 01:04:10,224
-Hey.
-Gosh.

753
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:13,310
-Hey, do you have more? What is it?
-Gosh, what?

754
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:15,896
Mr. Tak, take off your shoes
when you come in.

755
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,439
Sorry about that. Are you upset?

756
01:04:17,523 --> 01:04:19,316
-You always forget that.
-Sorry.

757
01:04:21,193 --> 01:04:23,946
Mr. Lee, do you have
a wet rag attached to your feet?

758
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:27,658
Either wash your feet
or put on some socks.

759
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:28,659
Sorry.

760
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:31,829
My sweat glands are clustered
on the bottoms of my feet.

761
01:04:32,413 --> 01:04:33,664
-It's an illness.
-Come on.

762
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:39,628
Everyone, please don't touch the glass
when you open the door.

763
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:42,798
Do you know how hard it is to wipe this?
There's a handle here.

764
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,305
Gosh, my mirror.

765
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:51,765
Sorry.

766
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:55,144
I closed the curtains for a reason.

767
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:58,898
All right. So is everyone here?

768
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,118
As tenants, we want your promise.

769
01:05:12,995 --> 01:05:15,998
That's why we plan to draw up
an agreement by tomorrow.

770
01:05:16,582 --> 01:05:18,542
And you can sign it
by the end of this week.

771
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:21,754
I know what you said yesterday,
but are you really a lawyer in Italy?

772
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:24,173
Yes.

773
01:05:24,256 --> 01:05:27,009
Then how will you handle it
when you don't know our law?

774
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:29,762
I don't think
my legal qualification matters here.

775
01:05:29,845 --> 01:05:31,764
Our promise to you and your signatures do.

776
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:35,351
I will guarantee that you will have
your lots back once I rebuild this place.

777
01:05:35,434 --> 01:05:36,518
You promise, right?

778
01:05:38,646 --> 01:05:40,856
We never lie.

779
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,316
What do you think?

780
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:47,529
Well, they seem very genuine.
Why don't we trust them?

781
01:05:47,613 --> 01:05:52,868
I'm also going to trust you,
Mr. Vincenzo Casanova.

782
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:55,704
Yes. Me, too, Mr. Casanova.

783
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:00,626
Let me inform you in advance.

784
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,423
I know martial arts.

785
01:06:07,216 --> 01:06:09,677
If you are deceiving us,

786
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,806
I'm going to put you in a guillotine choke
for six days straight.

787
01:06:14,431 --> 01:06:18,102
Don't do stuff like that. No one cares.
You're embarrassing and so tacky.

788
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:19,603
Let's sum it up.

789
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:21,981
Who agrees to trust them?

790
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:29,071
My gosh. That annoying Vincenzo.
This doesn't feel right.

791
01:06:29,905 --> 01:06:31,699
We have no choice.

792
01:06:32,324 --> 01:06:34,076
Right. Damn it.

793
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,162
This is driving me crazy. Darn it.

794
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:39,999
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt
and go with the flow.

795
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:49,008
Merciful Buddha.

796
01:07:00,686 --> 01:07:01,729
Mr. Hong.

797
01:07:01,812 --> 01:07:04,732
The tenants have nothing
but your word to go on.

798
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,693
But I find this unfortunate

799
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:10,404
because it looks like
you're toying with us.

800
01:07:12,823 --> 01:07:15,117
Is it that hard for you to trust me?

801
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:20,372
I pretended to trust you earlier
to assure the other tenants,

802
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:25,753
but I never trust people like you.

803
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,428
I am a lawyer,

804
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,638
and so are you.

805
01:07:38,182 --> 01:07:39,808
But we clearly have different jobs.

806
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,436
You represent money,

807
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:44,229
but I represent people.

808
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:50,986
I also represent people.

809
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,321
Oh, yes.

810
01:07:52,988 --> 01:07:54,406
Rich people.

811
01:07:56,116 --> 01:08:00,162
I know Babel E&amp;C will buy this building
so I prepared myself for everything.

812
01:08:00,245 --> 01:08:02,498
So don't pretend
to be a mediator in front of me.

813
01:08:02,581 --> 01:08:04,416
Just proceed with your plan.

814
01:08:29,274 --> 01:08:30,359
Where's everyone?

815
01:08:32,027 --> 01:08:32,945
Honey.

816
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,696
Ju-yeong.

817
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,406
My goodness!

818
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:38,158
Honey!

819
01:08:38,242 --> 01:08:39,243
Ju-yeong!

820
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,663
-Who are you people?
-We don't have time to chitchat.

821
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:47,501
Ju-yeong.

01:08:56,343 --> 01:08:57,719

-You…

824
01:08:58,887 --> 01:09:00,180
Stamp your seal on it.

825
01:09:01,598 --> 01:09:03,392
I have a show to catch on TV.

01:09:55,444 --> 01:09:56,653
I'm good.

835
01:09:58,488 --> 01:09:59,781
What do you mean?

836
01:10:03,035 --> 01:10:03,994
I'm not interested.

837
01:10:08,248 --> 01:10:09,541
I'm so sick of him.

01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,473
Of course, sir.

841
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:26,767
-Gosh, that's a no-brainer.
-Come over here.

842
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:32,189
Yes.

843
01:10:33,023 --> 01:10:34,233
Okay. I got it.

844
01:10:36,902 --> 01:10:39,112
Check your bank account. It's over.

845
01:10:40,072 --> 01:10:41,406
Hey, let's go.

846
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,532
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

847
01:10:42,616 --> 01:10:43,825
Gosh, let's go.

848
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:54,461
It says that by nature of clinical trials…

849
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:55,796
Hello, Ms. Hong.

850
01:10:57,297 --> 01:11:00,509
Who are you to barge into my office?
That's some nasty manner you have.

851
01:11:01,343 --> 01:11:02,761
What's this?

852
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:04,221
Oh, that?

853
01:11:05,013 --> 01:11:07,474
I mailed that to remove you
from my family registry.

854
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:11,061
You can't do that anymore.

855
01:11:11,144 --> 01:11:13,647
The family registration system
was abolished ages ago.

856
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:14,773
You're a lawyer.

857
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:17,651
I can still try, can't I?

858
01:11:17,734 --> 01:11:19,152
-Hey.
-Yes.

859
01:11:19,236 --> 01:11:20,237
This one, too.

860
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,615
And look at this. This is ridiculous.

861
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:26,326
"The petitioner rejects
the following words

862
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:29,621
and any similar words from the recipient.
The following words are,

863
01:11:29,705 --> 01:11:32,874
appa, abuji, papa, daddy,
otosang, bàba, and père."

864
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,544
This is just outright ridiculous.

865
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:38,505
It's so immature.

866
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:42,884
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

867
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:44,594
I'm talking here.

868
01:11:44,678 --> 01:11:46,221

871
01:11:52,519 --> 01:11:55,981
You Korean. Damn you. Get out of my sight!

872
01:11:56,064 --> 01:11:57,482
Damn it.

873
01:11:58,358 --> 01:11:59,526
Yes.

874
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,029
What happened to my suit?

875
01:12:02,112 --> 01:12:04,698
It's because your suit
was made from cheap fabric.

876
01:12:04,781 --> 01:12:07,367
-It doesn't happen to good fabric.
-Cheap?

877
01:12:07,451 --> 01:12:09,328
-Do you know how much this is?
-How much?

878
01:12:09,411 --> 01:12:11,705
This is a limited edition
from Booralro's line…

879
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:15,751
There's no point in talking to him.

880
01:12:17,878 --> 01:12:20,714
By the way, you have a nice build.

881
01:12:20,797 --> 01:12:23,592
You know? You still look cool
with that tight suit.

882
01:12:23,675 --> 01:12:24,926
This might catch on.

883
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:27,637
Did you do this on purpose?

884
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:30,849
What are you talking about?
I'm the laundry master.

885
01:12:30,932 --> 01:12:32,768
Then you shouldn't have messed up!

886
01:12:37,731 --> 01:12:39,232
You will have to pay

887
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:42,235
for what you did to my suit.

888
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:43,570
You will.

889
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,662
Tenants of Geumga Plaza,
come out of the building now.

890
01:12:52,746 --> 01:12:54,915
Someone's looking for me.
Pay before you go.

891
01:12:57,376 --> 01:12:58,752
Damn it.

892
01:13:04,758 --> 01:13:05,842
Yes, Mr. Cho.

893
01:13:06,468 --> 01:13:09,054
My wife and daughter were
taken hostage. I had no choice.

894
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:11,473
I'm sorry.

895
01:13:12,265 --> 01:13:14,643
I'll fix this no matter what.

896
01:13:15,352 --> 01:13:16,561
Yes. I will…

897
01:13:22,025 --> 01:13:23,026
Mr. Cho.

898
01:13:24,236 --> 01:13:27,614
Mr. Cho. Mr. Cho? Mr. Cho!

899
01:13:27,697 --> 01:13:31,910
Fine. I can overlook everything
you wrote here. I can live with that.

900
01:13:32,411 --> 01:13:34,162
But this one. Look.

901
01:13:34,913 --> 01:13:38,625
"All the photos that the recipient
took with the petitioner as a minor and

902
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,628
photos that remind the recipient
of the petitioner as the parent

903
01:13:41,711 --> 01:13:44,798
will be donated for the exhibition,
Geumga-dong's History,

904
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:47,509
held at the Sangcheon District Office
for public interest."

905
01:13:48,135 --> 01:13:50,303
Who are you to donate my photos?

906
01:13:50,387 --> 01:13:52,764
They're the epitome
of my embarrassing past!

907
01:13:52,848 --> 01:13:54,057
It's up to me.

908
01:13:54,141 --> 01:13:55,725
I raised you.

909
01:13:55,809 --> 01:13:59,229
And does that give you the right
to abandon me? This is embarrassing!

910
01:13:59,312 --> 01:14:00,522
"Embarrassing"?

911
01:14:01,106 --> 01:14:03,358
It's because what you do
is less than human!

912
01:14:04,276 --> 01:14:08,989
You're a lawyer. How could you not
have a sense of duty or justice?

913
01:14:09,072 --> 01:14:13,034
Your sense of duty just makes you
the nosiest lawyer in the world!

914
01:14:13,118 --> 01:14:17,205
And your sense of justice is just
groundless hostility against the rich!

915
01:14:17,289 --> 01:14:19,666
This is called mechanical justice!

916
01:14:19,749 --> 01:14:20,834
"Mechanical justice"?

917
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:22,919
Then is following money
"rational justice"?

918
01:14:23,003 --> 01:14:26,047
Yes. Money is justice in Korea.

919
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:27,424
And power means justice.

920
01:14:27,507 --> 01:14:29,259
Then, keep living your life like that!

921
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,429
But do not show your face around me. Okay?

922
01:14:32,512 --> 01:14:35,265
Okay. Let's cut off all ties!

923
01:14:35,348 --> 01:14:36,850
-Yes. Let's do that.
-Don't.

924
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:38,560
Let's never call each other.

925
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:40,479
-I won't.
-Don't you dare call me!

926
01:14:40,562 --> 01:14:41,605
-I won't.
-Mr. Hong!

927
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:42,647
Never call me!

928
01:14:42,731 --> 01:14:43,857
Mr. Hong.

929
01:14:45,567 --> 01:14:48,653
You have to come outside now.

930
01:14:49,488 --> 01:14:52,407
GEUMGA PLAZA

931
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:56,620
Hello.

932
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:00,457
My gosh. You're a bunch of lazy bums.

933
01:15:01,291 --> 01:15:03,168
Why haven't you put up the signs?

934
01:15:04,044 --> 01:15:05,128
Do it now.

935
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:07,297
Aren't you cold?

936
01:15:08,465 --> 01:15:09,591
Let's go.

937
01:15:09,674 --> 01:15:10,926
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

938
01:15:15,096 --> 01:15:16,223
NOTICE

939
01:15:16,306 --> 01:15:17,849
SELLER: CHO YEONG-UN,
BUYER: BABEL E&amp;C

940
01:15:17,933 --> 01:15:19,184
-What happened?
-What?

941
01:15:19,267 --> 01:15:20,936
-But he promised.
-What happened?

942
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:22,229
What do we do, then?

943
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:23,813
-Put it up. Just do it.
-Okay.

944
01:15:23,897 --> 01:15:25,232
Cover up the sign.

945
01:15:26,775 --> 01:15:28,151
Hello, sir.

946
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,658
Nice to meet you.

947
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:36,326
I'm Park Seok-do, the CEO of Ant Company

948
01:15:36,409 --> 01:15:39,829
and the chairman of the Development
Committee for Babel Tower.

949
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:44,501
What kind of company is that?

950
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:46,670
It's a shady company
that performs dirty jobs

951
01:15:46,753 --> 01:15:49,256
like high interest loans
and beating people up.

952
01:15:49,339 --> 01:15:50,298
I see.

953
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:54,052
Oh, right. As of today,
this building belongs to Babel E&amp;C.

954
01:15:54,135 --> 01:15:57,472
Starting today,
the Compensation Team will visit you.

955
01:15:57,556 --> 01:16:00,058
Let's handle this peacefully.

956
01:16:00,141 --> 01:16:02,269
I knew it. Damn it.

957
01:16:02,352 --> 01:16:04,980
This was their plan. But what?
They'll let us move back in?

958
01:16:05,063 --> 01:16:08,400
That lousy Vincenzo or whatever.
I should've shrunk his suit even more.

959
01:16:08,483 --> 01:16:09,734
-Where is he?
-Right.

960
01:16:09,818 --> 01:16:13,321
If any of the tenants give us a hard time,

961
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:18,702
one of these uncompromising men
will tire you out physically and mentally.

962
01:16:18,785 --> 01:16:19,744
Hey.

963
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:21,871
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

964
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:23,456
-Why?
-Who are you?

965
01:16:27,794 --> 01:16:30,213
-You can't do this.
-Why not?

966
01:16:32,841 --> 01:16:34,884
-Are you okay?
-You startled me.

967
01:16:34,968 --> 01:16:35,885
I thought I hit you.

968
01:16:40,348 --> 01:16:42,851
You can't block the path to the restroom.

969
01:16:43,685 --> 01:16:47,022
-What about the people who need to go?
-You got me excited for a second.

970
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:48,857
Goodness.

971
01:16:49,524 --> 01:16:51,484
-Guys, step aside. Gosh. It's urgent.
-Okay.

972
01:16:51,568 --> 01:16:53,945
I don't want him to do his business here.
Hurry.

973
01:16:54,029 --> 01:16:56,406
-Go. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

974
01:16:57,866 --> 01:17:01,036
My goodness, that idiot.
He's so embarrassing.

975
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:02,329
Leave now.

976
01:17:02,412 --> 01:17:05,999
You're violating the law
by threatening us like this.

977
01:17:06,082 --> 01:17:09,461
Why don't you stop already?
We will compensate you handsomely.

978
01:17:09,544 --> 01:17:11,171
You say you'll compensate us,

979
01:17:11,254 --> 01:17:13,381
but you'll just beat us up
and kick us out.

980
01:17:13,465 --> 01:17:17,010
This is a good occasion.
Why are you ruining the mood?

981
01:17:17,093 --> 01:17:18,386
-Gosh.
-Hey.

982
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:21,723
Who are you?

983
01:17:21,806 --> 01:17:24,267
I'm his only daughter.

984
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,062
And I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
of Law Firm Wusang.

985
01:17:27,896 --> 01:17:30,690
-You're not my daughter.
-Come on. Be quiet.

986
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:36,488
-What is a lawyer from Wusang doing here?
-It's none of your business.

987
01:17:37,656 --> 01:17:40,241
This isn't the way
to go about your business.

988
01:17:40,325 --> 01:17:42,869
Don't you know the era we live in?

989
01:17:42,952 --> 01:17:45,205
It's not like we're in
some '90s gangster movie!

990
01:17:45,288 --> 01:17:46,456
Hey, miss.

991
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:50,126
Do you want to get beaten up
like the movies from the '90s?

992
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:53,254
-My goodness.
-Hey!

993
01:17:59,594 --> 01:18:01,888
If you touch me again,

994
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:04,766
I'll make you pay for what you did!

995
01:18:04,849 --> 01:18:08,144
Sure. Okay. Let's see how much money
I have to pay to settle with you!

996
01:18:08,228 --> 01:18:10,355
Stop!

997
01:18:38,174 --> 01:18:39,342
What did he say?

998
01:18:42,095 --> 01:18:43,888
Where's my tape measure?

999
01:18:49,394 --> 01:18:51,271
Do you also need to use the bathroom?

1000
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:53,356
Is it urgent?

1001
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,983
Go ahead. Go on.

1002
01:18:55,066 --> 01:18:56,776
-Go.
-Let's talk.

1003
01:18:57,277 --> 01:18:58,653
Who the heck are you?

1004
01:18:58,737 --> 01:19:01,072
Vincenzo Cassano.

1005
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,368
I represent the owner of Geumga Plaza,
Cho Yeong-un.

1006
01:19:05,452 --> 01:19:07,287
"Vinchenzo Quassano"?

1007
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,663
This is ridiculous.

1008
01:19:08,747 --> 01:19:11,291
There's no talking your way out of this.

1009
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,256
Hey, hold on.

1010
01:19:21,968 --> 01:19:23,052
Goodness.

1011
01:19:24,304 --> 01:19:26,806
I'm not that curious, but I'll listen.

1012
01:19:32,854 --> 01:19:34,105
So what is it?

1013
01:19:39,736 --> 01:19:40,737
-Sir!
-Sir!

1014
01:19:44,407 --> 01:19:46,743
-My nose is bleeding!
-A nosebleed?

1015
01:19:46,826 --> 01:19:49,454
Gosh. Come on. Seriously.

1016
01:19:50,163 --> 01:19:51,498
You jerk.

1017
01:19:56,294 --> 01:19:58,296
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

1018
01:19:58,379 --> 01:20:00,215
If you take one more step…

1019
01:20:03,676 --> 01:20:06,221
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

1020
01:20:06,304 --> 01:20:07,597
Just stay still.

1021
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,557
Everyone, stay still.

1022
01:20:14,771 --> 01:20:17,065
Given the height of the building,
you won't die.

1023
01:20:17,148 --> 01:20:18,650
You'll just break your leg.

1024
01:20:21,653 --> 01:20:24,364
But if you're unlucky and fall head-first,

1025
01:20:25,824 --> 01:20:29,536
I will be the last person
you see from this world.

1026
01:20:29,619 --> 01:20:30,620
Right?

1027
01:20:31,704 --> 01:20:33,289
Shouldn't we stop him?

1028
01:20:33,373 --> 01:20:35,875
He said he won't die. Leave him.

1029
01:20:37,043 --> 01:20:39,128
Pull me up now, you asshole. Pull me up!

1030
01:20:41,214 --> 01:20:44,968
Babel E&amp;C bought this building
through illegal means.

1031
01:20:46,135 --> 01:20:49,931
And I will not forgive their atrocity.

1032
01:20:50,723 --> 01:20:52,350
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

1033
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:53,685
Now!

1034
01:20:55,019 --> 01:20:57,689
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

1035
01:20:58,731 --> 01:21:01,568
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

1036
01:21:04,237 --> 01:21:07,949
This building belongs to me.

1037
01:21:09,075 --> 01:21:11,077
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

1038
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,537
-What?
-What did he say?

1039
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:13,872
He said…

1040
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:19,711
È mio!

1041
01:21:36,269 --> 01:21:38,229
SPECIAL THANKS TO JIN SUN-KYU,
LEE HEE-JUN, JEONG SOON-WON

1042
01:22:04,255 --> 01:22:06,090
I don't expect you to believe me.

1043
01:22:06,174 --> 01:22:07,008
"Threatened"?

1044
01:22:07,091 --> 01:22:08,551
Are you still pulling that stunt of yours?

1045
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:12,263
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

1046
01:22:12,347 --> 01:22:14,599
My experience tells me
that there's more to this.

1047
01:22:14,682 --> 01:22:17,226
A reason enough to make them act this way.

1048
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:19,771
He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.

1049
01:22:19,854 --> 01:22:22,815
Aren't we the best in the country
when it comes to playing dirty?

1050
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:25,693
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

1051
01:22:25,777 --> 01:22:28,321
-Assholes like them should be made to pay.
-"Assholes"?

1052
01:22:28,404 --> 01:22:30,239
Cha-young! Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

1053
01:22:30,323 --> 01:22:33,451
Legal or not, we'll get the job done.

1054
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,453
We have to stop them no matter what.

1055
01:22:35,536 --> 01:22:36,996
Hey!

1056
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,123
I thought I'd do the same as you did.
