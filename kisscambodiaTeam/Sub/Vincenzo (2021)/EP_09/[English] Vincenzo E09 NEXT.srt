1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,229
Are you saying the Babel Group
and the prosecution have colluded?

2
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:19,024
-What kinds of deeds?
-Please elaborate.

3
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:23,528
Write to us if you have any questions.

4
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:26,865
If you ask any more questions,
I'll regard that as a form of assault.

5
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:28,283
Please make way. Let's go.

6
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,493
Mr. Han.

7
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:22,963
Joon-woo.

8
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:28,426
Why do you keep going easy on them?
We can just get rid of them.

9
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,637
-I never went easy on them.
-Pardon?

10
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,099
I never went easy on them.

11
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,893
They got us because they are smart.

12
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,270
Then…

13
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:42,232
Then, shouldn't we
have gotten rid of them sooner?

14
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:44,651
Why would I get rid of
such good partners so soon?

15
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:45,944
"Partners"?

16
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:50,282
They are my sparring partners
who make me stronger.

17
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,911
The day I get rid of Vincenzo

18
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:57,539
will be the day when I've defeated him.

19
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:02,752
We wasted such a great opportunity.

20
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:03,712
EPISODE 9

21
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:07,257
The investment agreement
almost went up in smoke.

22
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,427
Be happy we paid the bank president
back for what they did to Ms. Oh.

23
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,137
We're even now. It's not so bad.

24
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,139
Bullseye.

25
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:19,853
Oh, right. I'm visiting Ms. Oh tomorrow.
Do you want to come with me?

26
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:23,940
I'll check my schedule.

27
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:29,654
Gosh. Single points. Why can't I get that?

28
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:33,033
At this point, there's something
we must direct our attention to.

29
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:34,784
The real boss of Babel, right?

30
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:37,287
I thought he might show himself
if things went south,

31
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,955
but they bounced back again.

32
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,583
Evil bounces back faster than good.

33
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,710
And every time they do,
they become stronger.

34
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:47,130
What should we use
to draw out the real boss?

35
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,884
They're bound to leave traces
even if they're invisible.

36
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:52,594
That's our chance.

37
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:57,682
From now on, we'll call Babel's boss
"Babo" for short.

38
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:01,019
I like it. Babo.

39
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,283
<i>If she has a family, you should tell them
as soon as possible.</i>

40
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,745
Those with a history of cancer must
pay special attention to their health.

41
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,746
This is unfortunate.

42
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,957
Did she have cancer in the past?

43
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,377
Yes. She had lung cancer before.

44
00:03:27,963 --> 00:03:29,172
When was that?

45
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,969
She was diagnosed with lung cancer
in January of 1993.

46
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,096
It was Stage Three lung cancer.

47
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:39,474
But it says it was completely cured
four years later without surgery.

48
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,228
<i>Stage Three cancer being cured
without surgery?</i>

49
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,146
<i>It's like a miracle.</i>

50
00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:00,412
<i>She was diagnosed with lung cancer
in January of 1993,</i>

51
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,333
<i>and she left me at the orphanage
in May of 1993.</i>

52
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:09,087
<i>Did she really abandon me
because she was sick?</i>

53
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:12,090
<i>Because she thought she might die on me?</i>

54
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,701
No one is here today.

55
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:40,660
Yes.

56
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,996
They give up so easily.

57
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,112
I get the feeling that it's over there.

58
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,990
That's the most deserted place
in our building.

59
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:20,283
Right.

60
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:23,119
Are you here to rob the safe?

61
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,496
Why bring a stethoscope?

62
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,081
I couldn't come empty-handed.

63
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,665
Doesn't this look cool?

64
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,335
First, let's find the gold bars.

65
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:42,055
Gosh, they're trying so hard.

66
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,519
By the way, the monks aren't here.

67
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,689
I guess they are
true believers of Buddhism.

68
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:53,983
TAROT READING AND FORTUNE TELLING

69
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:03,660
Sir.

70
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,539
Are you sure we can find gold
with the dowsing rods?

71
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:11,292
Like water, gold also has chi.

72
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:14,921
We can detect the gold's chi
with these dowsing rods.

73
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:15,922
I see.

74
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:21,970
By the way, I wonder if it's okay
for us to chase worldly things like this.

75
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:23,972
Chase worldly things?

76
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,933
Even if we find gold,
we will not take it ourselves.

77
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,560
You know that.

78
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:32,772
Right. We decided to donate all of
the money for children with rare diseases.

79
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:35,817
We are not chasing after money.

80
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,111
We are trying to practice
Buddha's generosity.

81
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,362
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:42,407
Sir!

83
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,201
What is it?

84
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,500
I stepped on the Death card.

85
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,170
Get lost, you Western <i>maguni</i>!

86
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,464
MAGUNI, EVIL INCARNATE IN BUDDHISM

87
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,011
Oh, my God!

88
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,696
Again!

89
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:37,837
Go.

90
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,842
Go away.

91
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:45,220
Go away. Get out of here.

92
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:49,182
Please.

93
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,850
Please, go away.

94
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,944
Get lost! Get away from here!

95
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:07,575
You really are stubborn, aren't you?

96
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,536
You just like this spot, don't you?

97
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,663
Okay. Fine.

98
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:14,749
Just don't coo when I'm sleeping. Got it?

99
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't.

100
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,132
From now on, your name is

101
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:26,302
Inzaghi.

102
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,264
Hey, Inzaghi. Don't coo. Okay?

103
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:53,037
Hello, sir.

104
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,092
<i>Director Gil Jong-moon?</i>

105
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:08,970
Yes. After breaking the contract with us,

106
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,306
he requested the prosecution
for protection.

107
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,516
What's he scheming with the prosecution?

108
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,936
We haven't found that out yet.

109
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,693
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

110
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,989
It's Prosecutor Jung In-kuk
of the Namdongbu Prosecution Service.

111
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:30,366
-You'll be safe here.
<i>-Jung In-kuk?</i>

112
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,826
<i>His name sounds familiar.</i>

113
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:36,205
<i>He targeted and investigated Babel
when your father was the chairman.</i>

114
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,582
So he's a headache, right?

115
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:40,043
Yes. He doesn't listen to anyone

116
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,836
including the chief prosecutor.

117
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,090
It's like his ears are made of iron,
so his nickname is Iron Ears.

118
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,136
He was transferred to Mokpo
but he came back last week.

119
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,097
Damn it.

120
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,440
This is Jang Joon-woo speaking.

121
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:05,902
<i>This is Gil Jong-moon.</i>

122
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:07,820
Mr. Gil.

123
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,198
Come on, don't do this to us.

124
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,283
I need to make a few demands.

125
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,994
Just name anything. I'll give it to you.

126
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,288
First, don't kill me.

127
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:19,791
I never tried to kill you.

128
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,250
<i>You'll try soon enough.</i>

129
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,419
I'm the only one who knows who you are.

130
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:28,049
Okay.

131
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,843
I just have to promise
not to kill you, right?

132
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:35,348
And wire 30 million US dollars
to the account of my choice.

133
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,975
Once I get the money,
I'll leave without saying a word.

134
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:39,727
And if you don't give me the money,

135
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,814
I will tell the prosecutor
who you really are and what you did…

136
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,275
to your father.

137
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,903
Gosh. I got it.

138
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:51,531
The account number…

139
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,868
No, text me the account number.

140
00:10:55,952 --> 00:11:00,456
And it will take a few days to launder
30 million dollars before I wire it.

141
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm sure you know that.

142
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:06,045
Yes, Mr. Gil. I'll be in touch.

143
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,590
He asked for 30 million dollars?

144
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:12,135
Gosh, that asshole.

145
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:33,865
Don't you want any?

146
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,826
Why are you eating burnt food?
It's not good for you.

147
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:38,786
This much is fine.

148
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,581
Here.

149
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:43,249
Have the part that's not burnt.

150
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,339
I bet it's good.

151
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,221
As long as I don't have the burnt parts,
this should be fine.

152
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,726
I printed the document.

153
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:04,061
-Nice. Thank you.
-Thanks.

154
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,523
This is the file the police have
on Jang Han-seok,

155
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,150
Jang Han-seo's older brother.

156
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,360
His American name is Henry Jang.

157
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,242
"Babo."

158
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,120
What?

159
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:24,040
Does this mean
that Jang Han-seo's brother is Babo?

160
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,042
We're not sure about that.

161
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,002
We're looking into his family first.

162
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,672
Since he left for the states 15 years ago,

163
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,216
he hasn't come back to Korea.

164
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,635
He became an artist
after majoring in arts.

165
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:37,428
We don't know where he is now.

166
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:39,096
Gosh. What a free spirit.

167
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,891
He must have no interest in the company.

168
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,019
When did the former chairman,
Jang Guk-han, die?

169
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,062
Two years ago.

170
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,523
That means he didn't even come
to his dad's funeral.

171
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:50,274
He didn't attend his dad's funeral?

172
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:52,401
What an awful son.

173
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:56,030
Oh, no! We can't have sweet potatoes
while working on an important case.

174
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:58,032
It'll bring a roadblock to our plan.

175
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,078
Isn't that a superstition?

176
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:05,665
I made sure not to have seaweed soup
whenever I had important exams.

177
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,416
Thanks to that, I passed every exam.

178
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,585
But Wusang and Babel are the ones

179
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,296
who have messed up their plan,
aren't they?

180
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,714
I don't care about them.

181
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:15,967
Gosh, this doesn't feel right.
I'll stop eating.

182
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,892
I'm going to see Ms. Oh now.

183
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:36,112
Don't forget we have a meeting
with the victims' families later.

184
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,447
Oh, I almost forgot. See you later.

185
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,620
Oh, right.

186
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:46,914
About Ms. Oh…

187
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,792
I ran a background check on her,

188
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,753
but she doesn't have
any family members to call.

189
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,841
Things would have been so much better
if she had a child.

190
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,927
No. Even if she did, they wouldn't go.
So many kids are undutiful.

191
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:02,805
Seriously. There's no point raising kids.

192
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:04,891
They deserve to be punished.

193
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,560
You don't want it?

194
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,772
I'll have it then.

195
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,611
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

196
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,613
Do you have to make such a mess?

197
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:21,741
Wipe your mouth.

198
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:23,200
Thank you so much.

199
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,786
You're such a messy eater.

200
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,415
I'm sorry I'm not as tidy as you are.

201
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:34,045
I'm glad to hear that. They deserved it.

202
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,257
Thank you so much.

203
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:40,259
It was all Mr. Cassano.

204
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:42,303
I just helped him a bit.

205
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:45,806
Thanks to you,

206
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:51,187
things are turning out
so much better for me.

207
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,899
And Mr. Cassano is paying
for this room, too.

208
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,611
Oh, no. I feel horrible.

209
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:04,033
I feel so ashamed to stay here any longer.

210
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,580
Hello, doctor.

211
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:11,165
Hello, Ms. Oh.

212
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,002
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

213
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,838
I heard you didn't want to be
medicated overnight.

214
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:19,465
Well…

215
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:23,803
I feel nauseous when I have them.

216
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,430
I've managed fine without them.

217
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:28,349
Then do as you want and--

218
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:30,226
How could you say that?

219
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,733
Is this a resort?
She shouldn't be doing as she wants.

220
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:41,237
That's not what I meant.

221
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,824
Besides, shouldn't you check yourself
if the patient is having

222
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,993
her meal or not?

223
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:50,329
Look. She didn't touch her food.

224
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:51,622
I was getting to that.

225
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,584
Look at these awful side dishes.

226
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:59,005
Do you expect her to eat them?
Would you eat them?

227
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,257
I'm not a nutritionist,
so that's not my area.

228
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,175
Right. You're a doctor.

229
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,637
How can you not prescribe pain meds
just because the patient said no?

230
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:09,140
-That was my--
-Don't say anything, Ms. Oh.

231
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,144
We've held back from medicating her

232
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:14,729
because of the side effects.

233
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,605
Look at her! She needs her meds now!

234
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:18,566
That's enough. Stop it.

235
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,276
Why are you getting all worked up?

236
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,902
Ms. Oh.

237
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,405
Why are you even here at the hospital?

238
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:25,531
Why?

239
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:27,992
Don't be stubborn
and do what the doctors tell you.

240
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:29,952
Okay.

241
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:32,913
Mr. Cassano.

242
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,959
I'm sorry. Sorry.

243
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:43,632
Please be understanding.

244
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,010
He has a lot on his plate these days.

245
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:48,095
That was quite scary,

246
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:55,686
but strangely enough, it felt nice.

247
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:03,460
Sir, I had meetings with the presidents of
Dongil and Taesan Banks this morning.

248
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,722
Both of them won't invest in Babel.

249
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:09,141
Even when Shinkwang Bank
is investing in Babel?

250
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,936
It's because of what Hong Cha-young
said to the reporters yesterday.

251
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,272
<i>They lost their faith in Babel.</i>

252
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:18,275
I warned you about this.
If we got rid of Vincenzo

253
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,651
and Hong Cha-young--

254
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:22,571
I'm saying this because I'm on your side!

255
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,781
Don't raise your voice at me.

256
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:28,368
You're scaring me.

257
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:33,040
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Tell you what.

258
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:36,168
I'll set up a meeting with
the Namdongbu office tonight.

259
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,586
Don't be late.

260
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:39,213
Okay.

261
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,181
He didn't even bat an eye
when he killed Dad. Why hesitate now?

262
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,648
Get me Mr. Lee from the Strategy Division.

263
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,779
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

264
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:07,032
Gosh, it looks so good.

265
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,367
Thank you.

266
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:11,995
We made a reservation
at a Chinese restaurant in a hotel,

267
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,331
but Mr. Nam changed the restaurant.

268
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:17,459
This restaurant is the real deal.
You have to try this.

269
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,378
The food here is so good.

270
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:24,007
They should keep this place a secret.

271
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:30,764
My gosh. This is so good!

272
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,976
It's like I'm in heaven right now.

273
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,437
How should I put it?
It tastes like tomato pasta.

274
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:39,856
It's the taste of Mr. Cassano's hometown.

275
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:41,567
Right.

276
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,070
We should have done this sooner.
We're sorry that it took this long.

277
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:47,114
That's okay.

278
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:52,494
By the way, I heard that there was
a small commotion last week.

279
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:53,912
Yes.

280
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:56,623
The shareholders of Babel Pharmaceuticals

281
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:02,713
came to our meeting and caused a scene
blaming us for the stock price going down.

282
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:06,383
Luckily, they just cursed at us and left.

283
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:09,886
They're such sociopaths.

284
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,347
They don't care about people
who were wronged.

285
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:15,934
"I'm sick of it. Stop it.
Stop using your late family."

286
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:18,604
We're used to hearing that now.

287
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:20,439
You can't get used to that.

288
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:23,650
Call me when you've been mistreated.
I'll help you right away.

289
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,737
Thank you.

290
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:31,825
Try the food. It's really good.

291
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:38,081
I should have invited you sooner,
but things have been hectic.

292
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,960
I bet. Your company is a mess right now.

293
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,838
Yes. I made some mistakes.

294
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:54,222
Anyway, I hope we will have
a fruitful partnership.

295
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,975
I think you are mistaken.

296
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,145
We are not your partners.
We are doing this under a contract.

297
00:20:00,228 --> 00:20:03,231
I'm saying our interests must align
for this to last long.

298
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:04,441
Mr. Seo, please.

299
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:08,612
I believe I've given you enough
to guarantee that.

300
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,531
But that doesn't give you the right
to walk all over us.

301
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:13,617
If you disrespect us in any way,

302
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:16,828
we can charge you whenever we want.
Are we clear?

303
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,917
Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

304
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:27,047
Now that we're on the same boat,
why don't you give us words of blessing?

305
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,008
Gosh, Myung-hee. You acted
as if you could never be bought off,

306
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:32,052
but you're like a saleswoman now.

307
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,553
That suits you.

308
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:40,268
I think today is such a historical day.

309
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,020
Right? Don't you agree?

310
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,525
We'll have to see if this historical day
will bring us glory

311
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,068
or humiliation.

312
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,698
I will stay humble and do my best.

313
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,075
I appreciate your help.

314
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:58,995
Don't do your best.
That makes me uncomfortable.

315
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:03,667
Okay.

316
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:08,004
Mr. Hwang, may I pour you a drink?

317
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,676
<i>I think I could be as old as your uncle.</i>

318
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,220
<i>-I can get this with one hand, right?
-Yes. Of course.</i>

319
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,180
MARIONETTE

320
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,474
<i>Pour one for him, too.</i>

321
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,560
<i>-Of course.</i>
-What's up with these geezers?

322
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:24,646
<i>-Allow me to pour you a drink.</i>
-They don't know their place.

323
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:30,318
<i>Do you enjoy drinking often?</i>

324
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,991
Get home safely, Mr. Hwang, Mr. Seo.

325
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:39,202
Thanks. And talk to Myung-hee,
your saleswoman,

326
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:41,913
if you need anything.

327
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:43,999
Let me know through her.

328
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:45,250
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

329
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,752
Okay. Do a good job. Let's go.

330
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:50,589
-Good night.
-Good night.

331
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:00,891
Let's have an after-party. Follow my car.

332
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:02,559
Pardon?

333
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:05,103
What does he want?

334
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:09,566
I don't know. Well, he told us
to follow him, so we should.

335
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,650
Let's go.

336
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:15,238
You know, Myung-hee

337
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:18,074
is a saleswoman of Seocho-dong now.

338
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:21,328
So we just need to keep her
under our thumb.

339
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:24,206
She was better off
when she was working for us.

340
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:27,167
-Gosh. Right.
-But that bitch didn't know that.

341
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,919
-Hey!
-Hey.

342
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,254
-Hey. Are you crazy?
-What is this?

343
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:32,756
Can't you drive properly?

344
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,633
-I'm sorry.
-Who are they?

345
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:36,051
What?

346
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:38,970
-Who are they? Hey, what's going on?
-What?

347
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:41,598
-What?
-Hey. Damn it.

348
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,476
Let go of me.

349
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,312
Who the hell are you?

350
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:48,563
Who the heck are you?

351
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:51,441
-Do you think who we are?
-Hey.

352
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:20,512
Are those bastards…

353
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:21,972
Are they thieves?

354
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:24,933
I bet Mr. Cassano has a lot of valuables.

355
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:26,977
Keep an eye on them.

356
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,687
I'll go and get the master key.

357
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,771
By myself?

358
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:32,983
Be careful.

359
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,460
I do not want to hurt you.

360
00:23:53,336 --> 00:23:54,546
So just leave.

361
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:57,799
Gosh, look at these thieves.

362
00:23:57,882 --> 00:23:59,718
How dare you steal from people?

363
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:02,637
You should make an honest living. Okay?

364
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:07,642
-Honey.
-How dare you push my wife?

365
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:08,810
Yeon-jin.

366
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:11,479
I don't think I can hold back anymore.

367
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:14,649
I will only use 10 percent of my powers.

368
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:15,650
No, honey!

369
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:31,166
Please help me.

370
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:34,085
Did you think I'd beg for my life?

371
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:37,672
Come on. You've exposed my ears.

372
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:43,136
You scumbag. All right. Here it goes.

373
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:51,311
You know what? I'll stretch
my hip today. It's been a while.

374
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:55,273
Clean…

375
00:24:58,109 --> 00:24:59,027
and jerk.

376
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:06,868
You still got it, Yeon-jin.

377
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:11,665
-Look at these punks. How dare you…
-What?

378
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,211
-Honey.
-Honey.

379
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:19,464
-Yes. I got him.
-I got him!

380
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:21,966
My goodness.

381
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:25,553
We should meet again
when the weather warms up.

382
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:27,180
We should go on a picnic.

383
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:33,019
Actually, the four of us decided
to go on a trip to Jindo next week.

384
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:35,480
That's a great destination.

385
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:38,483
When you're there, send me a bottle
of matrimony vine wine.

386
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:41,027
Sure.

387
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:43,530
-Have a safe trip.
-Have a fun trip.

388
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:44,572
Thanks.

389
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:47,701
Mr. Cassano.

390
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:51,663
Thank you so much.

391
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:55,250
Gosh.

392
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:05,385
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

393
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:11,307
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

394
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:13,101
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

395
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:16,312
-Mr. Nam!
-Gosh.

396
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,898
-Gosh. Get in here, Mr. Nam.
-Okay.

397
00:26:18,982 --> 00:26:20,567
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

398
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,444
-Thank you.
-Sure.

399
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,903
-Bye.
-Okay.

400
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,197
-Bye.
-Thank you.

401
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:27,991
-Safe travels.
-Okay.

402
00:26:31,828 --> 00:26:35,707
I hope the victims' families
will only have happiness in their lives.

403
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,961
I also hope that, but they won't be able
to forget the pain that easily.

404
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,297
That's true.

405
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,175
I just hope happiness can mask the pain.

406
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:48,928
You should go in.

407
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,266
Thank you for driving me home.

408
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,769
I just dropped you off
on my way to buy wine.

409
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:58,646
But there's a big wine shop
across Geumga Plaza.

410
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:01,399
They don't have the wine I want.

411
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,651
So I'm going to the shop near here.

412
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:06,279
-It's probably closed by now.
-I can go tomorrow then.

413
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:11,117
Good night.

414
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:39,354
Hold on.

415
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:42,899
Wait. There are so many tools
you can choose from. Why a hammer?

416
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:47,695
Maybe you don't know this,
but I'm a blackbelt.

417
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,156
Third-degree in taekwondo,
second in jiu-jitsu and in hapkido.

418
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,407
A total of eight degrees!

419
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,409
It's seven.

420
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:56,371
Right. Seven. Three, two, and two. Seven!

421
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:59,749
So if you come at me,
you won't stand a chance!

422
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,209
Don't come near me!

423
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:03,336
No, don't come near me!

424
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,134
Hey! My gosh!

425
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:11,344
Don't come near me.

426
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:14,973
Hey, we have a problem.

427
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:22,856
-What is it?
-Damn it.

428
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:25,650
It's me.

429
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:42,000
What's that?

430
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,127
Go and scratch your back. Over there.

431
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:51,176
I mean, if you were trying to tail us,
you shouldn't have made it so obvious.

432
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:53,469
You weren't trying, were you?

433
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,930
-Let's go.
-Okay.

434
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,312
My goodness.

435
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,106
02K 0416

436
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:13,865
02K 0416

437
00:29:27,837 --> 00:29:28,671
Are you okay?

438
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:39,891
Those bastards…

439
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:43,102
Wait. No. Don't go after them.

440
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:44,646
I'm scared to be alone.

441
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,606
We have to find out who sent them.

442
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,399
It's obvious who sent them.

443
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,490
What's wrong with me?

444
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:57,283
I should've had more chicken.

445
00:29:58,117 --> 00:29:59,410
My legs feel like jelly.

446
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,294
Mr. Hwang?

447
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:12,548
-Hey, Jang.
-Yes, that's me.

448
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:15,760
Do you know what you're doing right now?

449
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:20,848
You've kidnapped two high-ranking
prosecutors. You know what that means?

450
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:24,394
You shouldn't have
treated me like that earlier.

451
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,522
You took me for a pushover
since I was being nice.

452
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:29,232
Mr. Jang…

453
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:32,235
Did Chairman Jang Joon-woo
sign off on this?

454
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:36,698
Yes. He told me to shake them up,
so they can come to their senses.

455
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:37,615
Okay.

456
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:43,371
You're making a huge mistake right now.

457
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,168
It's you who made a huge mistake.

458
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:52,505
You took my money,

459
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:54,507
so you should know to respect and obey me.

460
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,801
Hey! Do you want me to teach you a lesson?

461
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:59,095
How dare you pull
this amateur stunt on us?

462
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:03,099
Expect your company to be destroyed
starting tomorrow.

463
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:05,018
Myung-hee, untie me now. My arms hurt.

464
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:07,395
-Seung-hyuk, untie me now!
-Okay.

465
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:09,605
-Do it now!
-Gosh, be quiet, will you?

466
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:12,317
Why are you such crybabies?

467
00:31:33,546 --> 00:31:34,756
And who the hell is this?

468
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:12,919
Please spare me!

469
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,212
Sir.

470
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:17,215
Please spare me, sir!

471
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,138
Is he dead?

472
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:25,390
I guess he is.

473
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,988
I won't kill you first.

474
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,450
Who do you think is next?

475
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:49,914
Your son in Italy
who is terrible at football!

476
00:32:50,832 --> 00:32:54,127
Sir! I was too arrogant!

477
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,754
Please forgive me. I was wrong!

478
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:59,006
Sir, you have my respect!

479
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,342
I'm begging you. Please.

480
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,428
I'm showing my respect to you.

481
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:07,598
I respect you. Please don't kill my son.
Please don't kill him.

482
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:10,226
Please don't kill him. Please.

483
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:19,986
See that? You should've listened…

484
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,156
when you had the chance.

485
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:46,888
You should have given us a heads-up.

486
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:50,808
Isn't this nice?

487
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:53,561
With all due respect, sir,

488
00:33:54,228 --> 00:33:56,355
this could be a huge problem later on.

489
00:33:56,439 --> 00:34:00,485
Nothing's a problem for me
as long as I don't feel like shit.

490
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:07,909
Why won't it come off?

491
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,292
I'll change things to the way it once was
starting today.

492
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:21,005
And I'll show them
what they're up against.

493
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:23,841
I'll do as you say, sir.

494
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:26,802
I'll do my best, too.

495
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,096
Yes.

496
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,644
Gosh, Han-seo.

497
00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:39,148
I want you to fatten up
the security around yourself.

498
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:41,734
You're my Achilles heel.

499
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:45,613
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

500
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:10,388
I'm sure it's either Babel or Wusang.

501
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,015
Who do you think gave the orders?

502
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:16,060
It's someone who was working alone.

503
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:17,979
It was rushed and sloppy.

504
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:19,772
Who on earth would want…

505
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,317
Do they think
everything will go away if I die?

506
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:27,238
I don't think killing you was their goal.
It must've been to maim you.

507
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:28,781
What?

508
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,033
He had a hammer.

509
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:35,705
If they wanted to kill you, they would've
strangled you or stabbed your stomach.

510
00:35:35,788 --> 00:35:37,373
-Or--
-Stop it.

511
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:42,795
Stay somewhere else tonight.

512
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,756
The window is broken,
and you can't rest here.

513
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:50,011
Okay. I'll stay with a friend.

514
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,306
Okay. That would be better.

515
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:06,819
What is it?

516
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:09,788
Call them.

517
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:26,714
No.

518
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,009
No?

519
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,303
Not a chance.

520
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,566
<i>The person you have dialed
cannot come to the phone right now.</i>

521
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,943
<i>Please, call again later.</i>

522
00:36:56,285 --> 00:36:59,664
<i>I have late-night service at church today.</i>

523
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:01,582
Damn it.

524
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:04,377
It's been 30 minutes.
You still haven't found anyone?

525
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:09,590
I guess everyone is busy.

526
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,134
Or they still don't want
to associate with you.

527
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:14,994
I can just sleep at a hotel.

528
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:17,807
Won't you be scared alone?

529
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:22,169
"Scared"? My gosh. I don't believe this.

530
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:24,880
Do you think I'm going to start
seeing and hearing things?

531
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:26,882
From what I saw earlier, you may.

532
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:32,013
I was scared
because I was startled earlier.

533
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:35,975
But my mind is as strong as iron now.

534
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:50,156
I know today was a tough day.

535
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:52,116
Thanks.

536
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:24,231
Call me if anything happens.

537
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:41,457
Don't worry about me.

538
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:15,157
<i>Hello and welcome.</i>

539
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:36,262
Gosh.

540
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,307
Why are they giving me that weird look?

541
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,066
Excuse me.

542
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:52,445
That's my room. What are you doing?

543
00:39:54,196 --> 00:39:55,990
They said the lock wasn't working.

544
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:59,744
You almost slept with an unlocked door.

545
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,090
Ma'am, it's done!

546
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,885
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

547
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,971
We went into your home
without your permission.

548
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:22,683
You don't have to apologize.
I should thank you.

549
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:25,853
They didn't look like ordinary thieves.

550
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:28,397
I think they were waiting for you.

551
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,859
I had no idea that they had a gas pistol.

552
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,738
-It was quite strong.
<i>-My hunch is that they were hitmen.</i>

553
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:39,325
<i>I am certain that he is in danger.</i>

554
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:43,704
Do you think Babel or Park Seok-do
sent them?

555
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:47,291
No way. If they did,
they would have sent professionals.

556
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:49,752
Seeing how Mr. Lee could chase them away,

557
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:51,295
they must be just petty thieves.

558
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:53,255
They were professionals.

559
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:56,759
I could feel it the moment I grabbed them.

560
00:40:58,761 --> 00:41:00,429
They were definitely pros.

561
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,224
Anyway, thank you.

562
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:06,602
I doubt they'll come back.
Get some rest now.

563
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:08,395
-Wait.
-Okay.

564
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:14,527
Have these. They're really tasty.

565
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,946
-No. I'm good.
-Please take it. It's our gift.

566
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:19,073
-They're really good.
-Okay.

567
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:20,699
Okay.

568
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:24,286
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

569
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,830
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

570
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:27,998
Bye.

571
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,377
-What is it? What happened?
-I can't see.

572
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,797
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

573
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,132
-I'm fine.
-Be careful.

574
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,634
You know what?

575
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:42,513
Those bastards could've passed out
on the street.

576
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:44,223
I'm sure I've hit the vital points…

577
00:43:01,342 --> 00:43:02,176
Hey, Inzaghi.

578
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,180
Take your friend and go.

579
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:09,266
Get your friend and get out!

580
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:12,186
Inzaghi!

581
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:15,064
You…

582
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:28,577
Why is it so fast?

583
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:30,704
Damn it.

584
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,522
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

585
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:58,440
And it's so cold.

586
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:03,195
Okay? I'll come in.

587
00:44:05,948 --> 00:44:07,616
It's so warm in here!

588
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:12,204
My feet are itchy.

589
00:44:18,335 --> 00:44:19,878
Let me crash here tonight.

590
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:24,174
Do you have to wear that to sleep?

591
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:29,722
Booralro made this
on the 80th anniversary of their…

592
00:44:29,805 --> 00:44:31,557
-Are you cooking <i>ramyeon</i>?
-Yes.

593
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,313
I didn't know you eat <i>ramyeon</i>.

594
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,817
Well, Ms. Jang gave them to me.

595
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:44,987
Want some? Should I cook two servings?

596
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:48,031
No, I'm good.

597
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:51,368
My face will get puffy from indigestion.

598
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:54,621
Sure.

599
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:16,310
Generally speaking, a single serving
of Korean <i>ramyeon</i> is pretty small.

600
00:45:16,393 --> 00:45:19,396
They should pass a law to
standardize and regulate the portion.

601
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,653
-It'll never happen, right?
-Won't your face get puffy?

602
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,238
I can exercise before I sleep.

603
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:30,282
Didn't you eat a lot at dinner earlier?

604
00:45:30,365 --> 00:45:33,702
I got hungry really quickly
after that traumatizing incident.

605
00:45:33,786 --> 00:45:37,080
I see. Sure. Of course.

606
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:40,542
By the way,
I didn't eat that much earlier.

607
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:42,294
Maybe I was wrong.

608
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:44,630
I'll get the blankets for you.

609
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,258
You're not going to eat?

610
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,762
If we were in Italy, you would have been…

611
00:45:54,848 --> 00:45:56,725
Go ahead. You can finish it.

612
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:08,403
Are you sleeping here?

613
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:13,492
I feel awful.

614
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:16,286
I have to sleep on the floor,
and you, on the sofa.

615
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,789
Oh, my! How scandalous!

616
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:21,333
The two of us here? Together?

617
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,293
But there's a bedroom.

618
00:46:31,885 --> 00:46:32,719
Go ahead.

619
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:39,059
You're so naughty.

620
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,106
My goodness. Oh, no!

621
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,069
Are they chickens or what?

622
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:54,283
Let me crash here just for the night.

623
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:57,244
You can stay here until you feel safe.

624
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:01,039
No. I'll go back as soon
as the house gets fixed.

625
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,668
My eyes won't survive this place.

626
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:07,212
How tacky.

627
00:47:09,423 --> 00:47:11,049
The previous tenant put it up.

628
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:18,140
Don't forget to replace the <i>ramyeon</i>
you had before you go.

629
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:21,768
Don't worry. I'll buy you a whole box.

630
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:30,944
Can I ask you two more questions?

631
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,779
It's about the Mafia.

632
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:37,492
Just two questions.

633
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:41,330
Are Mafia bosses really scary
like they say?

634
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,333
Are they brutal and heartless?

635
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:46,209
It depends on the boss.

636
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:51,089
The boss I served
was a reasonable businessman.

637
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:53,508
He must have been a nice man.

638
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:57,346
Yes. To me, he was like a father.

639
00:47:59,306 --> 00:48:00,599
Here's my next question.

640
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:05,896
The other day, you said that
people get killed like they do in movies

641
00:48:06,396 --> 00:48:10,901
and that the Mafia believes you have to
pay the price for your actions.

642
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:12,778
Right.

643
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:19,493
Then, have you ever done it yourself?

644
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:24,456
Are you asking me if I've killed a person?

645
00:48:30,504 --> 00:48:31,463
No.

646
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:34,007
I'm a lawyer.

647
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:35,717
Right?

648
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,388
Right. I was just wondering.

649
00:48:44,226 --> 00:48:47,896
Even if you did work for the Mafia,
there's no way you would kill people.

650
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:53,110
Will you cut ties with me
if I've killed anyone before?

651
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:56,363
It's not that. If you did,

652
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:01,410
it'd feel like you're someone

653
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:03,704
from a very distant world.

654
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:07,416
Like someone

655
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:11,670
trapped on a mural
or in a faded newspaper.

656
00:49:13,422 --> 00:49:15,966
And if anyone thought of me that way,

657
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:18,635
I would be a bit sad.

658
00:49:19,845 --> 00:49:20,971
But…

659
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,059
I want to live that kind of life,
away from other people.

660
00:49:30,188 --> 00:49:31,023
Why?

661
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:33,775
I know.

662
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:37,696
It's because you don't want
to be hurt by others, right?

663
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:45,078
No. Because a lot of people try
to borrow money from me.

664
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:51,710
I was expecting some fancy answer.

665
00:49:53,128 --> 00:49:55,797
But that was such a down-to-earth answer.

666
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:59,134
No more questions now. Go to sleep.

667
00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:02,929
Fine.

668
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:20,757
You know Prosecutor Seo Ung-ho, right?
Chief Prosecutor Hwang's right-hand man.

669
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:25,220
He died last night while driving under
the influence and fell off the mountain.

670
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:26,847
PROSECUTOR SEO UNG-HO DEAD FROM DUI

671
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,599
This is probably connected to
what happened last night.

672
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:30,851
No.

673
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:34,020
It looks meticulously planned.
It wasn't sloppy at all.

674
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:42,571
From the looks of things,
more people might get hurt.

675
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:46,867
When are you coming back?

676
00:51:48,034 --> 00:51:49,661
I see. Okay. Bye.

677
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:55,208
Is someone coming?

678
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,337
I sent someone to Italy
to look into Vincenzo.

679
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:01,840
I see. Did they find anything?

680
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:03,967
I'll find out once he comes back.

681
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,427
I see.

682
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,609
I must have startled you last night.

683
00:52:23,612 --> 00:52:25,697
No. I learned a lot from you again.

684
00:52:26,615 --> 00:52:27,657
Okay.

685
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:34,247
Starting today,
everything must go perfectly.

686
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:37,292
You got more bodyguards, right?

687
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,669
Yes. I have two teams
in case someone tails me.

688
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:45,842
Well, sir…

689
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:51,556
I have something to tell you.

690
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,144
It seems like
you did something wrong again.

691
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:09,324
Who told you to do something like that?

692
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:11,785
I'm sorry.

693
00:53:11,868 --> 00:53:14,120
I just wanted to lift
some of your burdens.

694
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:17,874
I only did it out of my loyalty for you.
Please, you have to believe me.

695
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:20,835
Don't you be giving me excuses.

696
00:53:21,419 --> 00:53:23,546
That just makes your mistake stand out.

697
00:54:16,057 --> 00:54:17,517
<i>Why are you video calling me?</i>

698
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,436
-Because I missed you.
<i>-Really?</i>

699
00:54:20,895 --> 00:54:22,230
<i>Go ahead. Admire me.</i>

700
00:54:23,815 --> 00:54:25,150
Aren't you at work yet?

701
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:28,737
I'm about to.
Anyway, you don't call me much lately.

702
00:54:29,612 --> 00:54:30,697
By the way,

703
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:34,117
are you at your house?

704
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:36,578
The house looks different.

705
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:41,624
<i>Good morning.</i>

706
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:46,379
Is that Mr. Cassano's house?
Why are you there?

707
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:48,798
-I slept here last night.
-<i>What?</i>

708
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:50,884
I have to go to work.
I'll talk to you later.

709
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:52,177
Cha-young…

710
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:04,481
Mr. Cassano.

711
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:10,320
Right here.

712
00:55:12,072 --> 00:55:13,239
Hello.

713
00:55:18,953 --> 00:55:21,206
You're in danger right now, aren't you?

714
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,874
I can see right through that.

715
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,834
Pardon?

716
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:26,628
This is…

717
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:30,215
This is my number.

718
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:32,717
Feel free to call me
when you find yourself in danger.

719
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:37,389
Or you can simply text, "Help me."
That will work, too.

720
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,600
Okay.

721
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,604
YOUR HELPER, AN GI-SEOK

722
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:58,284
I'm sure you may have already realized,

723
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:02,705
but I'm not just a kitchen assistant.

724
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:05,792
And let's leave it at that.

725
00:56:09,754 --> 00:56:11,089
Act natural.

726
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,216
Act natural.

727
00:56:17,637 --> 00:56:18,972
Are you…

728
00:56:27,939 --> 00:56:29,816
BABEL GROUP

729
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:58,136
PEOPLE AROUND CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEO

730
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:04,392
Gosh, he's ridiculous.

731
00:57:04,476 --> 00:57:06,478
Does he think he's the President?

732
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:09,063
I'm sure Babo instructed him
to strengthen security

733
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:10,523
in case he gets followed.

734
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:14,611
He's protecting his most vulnerable area.

735
00:57:14,694 --> 00:57:17,614
Then, we won't be able to go after
Jang Han-seo for the answer.

736
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:20,700
Who on earth is Babo? Damn it.

737
00:57:21,326 --> 00:57:22,368
Ms. Hong.

738
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:24,496
I just found out.

739
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:28,249
Director Gil of Haemun Medical Center
is under protection of the prosecution.

740
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,043
He asked them to protect him? Why?

741
00:57:30,126 --> 00:57:32,128
I don't know. No one knows why.

742
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:36,132
He must be trying to cut a deal.
A big one at that.

743
00:57:36,216 --> 00:57:38,718
-Who's the prosecutor in charge?
-Jung In-kuk.

744
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:42,555
Whatever it is,
I'm sure Babel is involved.

745
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:45,558
I'll try to get some intel
from Prosecutor Jung now.

746
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:54,609
Yes, Mr. Cho.

747
00:57:55,944 --> 00:57:56,861
Yes.

748
00:58:00,698 --> 00:58:03,243
-Thank you for going to Shanghai for this.
-No problem.

749
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:06,871
Fortunately, the data on
Wang Shaolin's irises was still there.

750
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:08,623
And our hackers were quick too.

751
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:13,253
We figured out the most difficult part.

752
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:17,549
Yes. Now we just need to open the door
after removing the slabs to the entrance.

753
00:58:17,632 --> 00:58:19,968
Will there be any problems
when we remove the slabs?

754
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:24,430
No. They are thin and designed
to be removed easily.

755
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:27,809
That's good. Let's get started then.

756
00:58:28,393 --> 00:58:31,604
But to do that, we must
relocate Nanyak Temple first.

757
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:43,992
NANYAK TEMPLE

758
00:58:46,786 --> 00:58:47,954
Hello.

759
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,747
Hello.

760
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:54,961
Ms. Seo has converted to Buddhism.

761
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:56,963
I see.

762
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:13,104
I will go now.

763
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:14,063
Okay.

764
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:21,404
Bye.

765
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,132
Why are you asking only us to move out?

766
00:59:42,342 --> 00:59:43,843
I'm worried about the others too,

767
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:46,721
but I'm especially worried
you might be in danger.

768
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:49,015
But we are okay here.

769
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:54,395
I can help relocate your temple
to a place with clean air outside Seoul.

770
00:59:54,479 --> 00:59:58,024
You have enlightened us
with courage and insight.

771
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:00,401
Whatever happens,

772
01:00:00,485 --> 01:00:03,947
we will protect our temple and the plaza.

773
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,501
Have some sweet potatoes.

774
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:51,285
<i>He wants the monks to move out.</i>

775
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,706
<i>Then, does that mean…</i>

776
01:00:59,544 --> 01:01:00,795
No matter how you put it,

777
01:01:01,713 --> 01:01:05,550
Jang Joon-woo crossed the line outright.

778
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:10,138
We already crossed the line.
It's better to go all the way.

779
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:11,264
Myung-hee.

780
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:15,768
Ms. Choi.

781
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:18,312
This could put us in danger, too.

782
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:20,690
We already crossed over
to the dark side long ago.

783
01:01:20,773 --> 01:01:22,859
Why are you suddenly worried about that?

784
01:01:22,942 --> 01:01:24,485
Exactly.

785
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,491
Sir.

786
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:33,703
I've been working so hard.

787
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:37,081
Gosh.

788
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:41,085
I must've scared you
a lot yesterday, boss.

789
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:42,378
No. That's not it.

790
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:47,300
It's just that my respect for you
has increased a lot.

791
01:01:47,383 --> 01:01:50,219
There's something I need from
Chief Prosecutor Hwang right now.

792
01:01:53,264 --> 01:01:55,266
-Can you relay the message?
-I will.

793
01:02:06,486 --> 01:02:08,905
TAESAN BANK

794
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:16,037
PROSECUTION SERVICE

795
01:02:24,712 --> 01:02:28,466
Su-nam, did you check the box?
There might be useful stuff in there.

796
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:30,676
Always check
before you throw them out. Gosh.

797
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,429
HAIR SALON

798
01:02:33,513 --> 01:02:35,807
Let's just hire some people.

799
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:36,891
Mr. Park.

800
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:39,477
We should do something cool.
What are we doing here?

801
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,771
Why are you looking at me like that?

802
01:02:41,854 --> 01:02:43,815
You should be grateful that you're alive.

803
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:46,234
Besides, we must tighten our belts
and save money!

804
01:02:46,317 --> 01:02:49,487
We almost lost everything.
All we have left are some slush funds.

805
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,072
You're unbelievable.

806
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:54,325
Gosh, I'm hungry. You could order
some <i>jjajangmyeon </i>for us.

807
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:56,702
Hey, boil some water.
I'll go buy some noodles.

808
01:02:58,037 --> 01:03:00,998
What's all this?
Are you opening a shop here?

809
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:02,875
What are you guys doing here?

810
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,919
You have to recycle these properly.

811
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:06,337
-What?
-Hey.

812
01:03:08,214 --> 01:03:11,801
I won't fight with you guys. I closed down
my company. I'm not a thug anymore.

813
01:03:11,884 --> 01:03:14,887
As if we'd believe you.
Get out of here now.

814
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:18,683
Gosh. We're running
a different business here.

815
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:21,102
-A travel agency.
-A travel agency?

816
01:03:21,185 --> 01:03:22,478
At a time like this?

817
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:25,273
Is it a travel agency that
sends people to the afterlife?

818
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:27,942
No. A real travel agency.

819
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,656
What kind of name is that?
"Bye Bye Balloon"?

820
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:36,617
Are you even paying rent here?

821
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:39,537
-Pay the fee for the association.
-You don't own this building.

822
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,914
Let me use this unit.
Mind your own business.

823
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:44,667
Hey, Chalk. What are you doing here?

824
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,670
-Are you here to dye your hair?
-Come on.

825
01:03:48,713 --> 01:03:50,756
Oh, my goodness. Who is that?

826
01:03:53,426 --> 01:03:55,636
Mind your own business, everyone.

827
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,722
She startled me. Enough about them.

828
01:03:58,347 --> 01:03:59,432
Let's talk.

829
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:01,184
-She's new.
-Let's talk for a second.

830
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,019
Come here. I need to talk to you.

831
01:04:04,437 --> 01:04:06,397
-Hi.
-They are here.

832
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,690
-You're here.
-Hey.

833
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:11,652
Gi-seok, can you give us some privacy?

834
01:04:11,736 --> 01:04:12,862
I know everything.

835
01:04:13,446 --> 01:04:16,199
He's like a family to me now.

836
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:17,825
I told him everything.

837
01:04:18,784 --> 01:04:21,078
Damn it. That's one more person.

838
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,208
Gi-seok, didn't you see the monks

839
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,418
looking for the gold?

840
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,300
Well, now that we're all on the same page,

841
01:04:34,383 --> 01:04:37,428
let's not try to fool each other.
We're neighbors. What is this?

842
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:38,930
We're all trying to find it.

843
01:04:39,013 --> 01:04:41,724
It looked like you were
trying the hardest.

844
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:44,185
You know what?
We should all look for it together.

845
01:04:44,268 --> 01:04:47,688
Yes. We'll put it in writing that
we'll divide it equally whoever finds it.

846
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:50,858
Shouldn't the person who finds it
get a bigger cut?

847
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:52,985
That will just complicate things.

848
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,820
Let's divide it equally.

849
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:58,032
Come to think of it, it is unfair.

850
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:03,162
Then, should we ask the lawyers
about the best way to divide it?

851
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:06,249
Then, more people
will know about the gold.

852
01:05:06,332 --> 01:05:08,042
There's Ms. Hong, Mr. Cassano…

853
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:10,336
What was his name again?
The paralegal guy.

854
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:11,796
Chaesin.

855
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:14,173
I'm sorry.

856
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:16,008
Gosh. What should we do, then?

857
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:19,679
All right. Enough.
Let's take our time on it.

858
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:23,975
From now on, let's be strategic
and look for it all together.

859
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:29,522
No backstabbing, okay?

860
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:31,649
<i>Meanwhile,
the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office</i>

861
01:05:31,732 --> 01:05:33,943
<i>announced that they arrested
the bank presidents</i>

862
01:05:34,026 --> 01:05:36,737
<i>and are questioning them now.</i>

863
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:39,365
<i>However, they haven't disclosed
the details</i>

864
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:42,285
<i>of the banks' violations
of the Capital Markets Act.</i>

865
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:44,662
<i>Any relevant witnesses will be summoned…</i>

866
01:05:44,745 --> 01:05:46,914
Isn't this too obvious?

867
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:49,125
Prosecutor Seo's death
and the raid on the two banks.

868
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:51,085
<i>…to uncover corrupt
activities at the banks…</i>

869
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:54,297
It's clear now that Babel killed him
to threaten the Chief Prosecutor.

870
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,675
That must be why they're taking action
against these banks.

871
01:05:58,217 --> 01:06:02,430
I get the feeling these two banks
will invest a lot of money in Babel.

872
01:06:09,186 --> 01:06:10,813
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk is calling me.

873
01:06:10,896 --> 01:06:12,440
I knew you could do it.

874
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:16,694
Hello, Mr. Jung. This is Hong Cha-young.

875
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:18,863
Yes.

876
01:06:18,946 --> 01:06:22,408
I see. I contacted you
because I had a few questions.

877
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:24,160
Yes. When are you available?

878
01:06:24,243 --> 01:06:27,496
GIL JONG-MOON

879
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,416
I really enjoyed following your lawsuit.

880
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,626
Thank you for going up against Babel.

881
01:06:34,003 --> 01:06:35,421
But our effort was in vain.

882
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:37,298
It looks like they're bouncing back.

883
01:06:37,381 --> 01:06:39,133
They've always done that.

884
01:06:39,216 --> 01:06:41,510
But we must bring them down for good
this time.

885
01:06:41,594 --> 01:06:46,432
Could you tell us
about Director Gil's demands?

886
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:49,226
He wanted immunity
and permission to leave the country.

887
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:52,188
I believe he's planning to flee abroad
with a new identity.

888
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:53,939
And what about his statement?

889
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:56,984
He only told me it was about a collusion
between Babel and Haemun.

890
01:06:57,985 --> 01:06:59,737
He's trying to make a deal with Babel.

891
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,113
You're right.

892
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:04,408
I think he's stalling for time,
so he can set something up.

893
01:07:05,034 --> 01:07:06,077
Mr. Jung.

894
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,372
What will you do if there's a real boss
behind Jang Han-seo?

895
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:10,956
A real boss?

896
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:14,418
-Who is that?
-We don't know that yet.

897
01:07:15,002 --> 01:07:17,880
But we are certain that
Jang isn't the real boss.

898
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:23,469
Then, is that what he meant by…

899
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:29,600
Do you know how Jang Guk-han died?

900
01:07:29,683 --> 01:07:31,936
Is there something I don't know about?

901
01:07:38,859 --> 01:07:40,027
No.

902
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,864
I'll tell you everything later.

903
01:07:43,948 --> 01:07:46,158
Gosh. Those scumbags.

904
01:07:46,867 --> 01:07:50,121
They are unbelievable. They should've
shown respect at his last moment.

905
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:53,124
This is why being born into
a respectable family matters.

906
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:55,167
Gosh, those jerks.

907
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:57,294
Are you sure he used plurals?

908
01:07:57,378 --> 01:07:59,755
"Scumbags" and "jerks."

909
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:03,050
Yes. I'm sure of it.

910
01:08:03,134 --> 01:08:06,595
Perhaps, both of his sons
could have been there at his deathbed.

911
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:10,558
That means Director Gil knows who it is.

912
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:12,518
"Babo"?

913
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:16,605
We call Babel's real boss Babo for short.

914
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:22,361
Did Director Gil call anyone
from the safe house?

915
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:26,449
He did make an untraceable call.
It was to a burner phone.

916
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:28,284
Given the circumstances,

917
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:30,327
the owner of the burner phone
must be Babo.

918
01:08:33,205 --> 01:08:34,290
Mr. Jung.

919
01:08:34,832 --> 01:08:38,878
Do you think we can launch
an operation to get information?

920
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:44,675
Are you talking about sting operations?

921
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:48,471
Yes. Something like that.
It's like putting on a play or a show.

922
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:53,142
No. I've always played by the book so far.

923
01:08:54,435 --> 01:08:57,146
Can you look at this
from a different point of view?

924
01:08:57,688 --> 01:09:00,107
I will not allow deception
in my investigation.

925
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:02,151
I'm sorry.

926
01:09:08,449 --> 01:09:10,910
Your appetizer,
sugar-glazed deep-fried sweet potatoes.

927
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:32,806
Mr. Jung, have some water.

928
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,808
I'm good. Please eat.

929
01:10:03,254 --> 01:10:04,713
What's wrong?

930
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:09,176
It's nothing.

931
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,263
What's the problem?

932
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:17,226
I got something that
could make you proud of me.

933
01:11:25,461 --> 01:11:27,755
We'll get a huge investment
sometime next week.

934
01:11:28,339 --> 01:11:29,423
First,

935
01:11:29,506 --> 01:11:33,010
we'll resume the production of
Babel Pharmaceuticals' RDU-90.

936
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:36,972
We'll triple the import of
the raw materials to boost the production.

937
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:41,477
Triple the security level
of our warehouses immediately.

938
01:11:42,269 --> 01:11:46,774
"Dongil and Taesan banks to make
large investments into the Babel Group"?

939
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:49,860
You were right, Mr. Cassano.

940
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:52,571
Evil does recover quickly.

941
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:55,866
That darned RDU-90 will end up
hitting the market.

942
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,452
My father worked so hard to stop it.

943
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:09,922
I guess the victims' families
are going on that trip today.

944
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:14,551
<i>We're leaving for our trip now.</i>

945
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:17,012
We probably shouldn't tell them

946
01:12:17,096 --> 01:12:19,431
about the tabloid, right?

947
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:21,350
Let's tell them once they come back.

948
01:12:23,602 --> 01:12:24,561
PROSECUTOR JUNG IN-KUK

949
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,567
Yes, Mr. Jung.

950
01:12:31,068 --> 01:12:34,405
<i>I think Director Gil is going with Babel.</i>

951
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:36,782
He started to deny the charges one by one.

952
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:39,785
<i>To be honest, we were expecting this.</i>

953
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:42,121
Speaking of which…

954
01:12:44,623 --> 01:12:47,626
Does your offer to launch
a sting operation still stand?

955
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,296
Yes. Our specialty is to design operations
that leave no traces.

956
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:54,633
Let's do it tonight.

957
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:57,594
I'm going against my principles for this.

958
01:13:07,479 --> 01:13:10,441
Okay. We'll call you as soon
as we've made the preparations.

959
01:13:11,108 --> 01:13:12,067
<i>Okay.</i>

960
01:13:14,903 --> 01:13:17,072
Well, this one is easy.

961
01:13:17,156 --> 01:13:19,992
Here's our plan A. We'll pretend
to be hitmen from Babel

962
01:13:20,075 --> 01:13:21,994
and make him say who Babo is.

963
01:13:22,077 --> 01:13:23,078
Plan B.

964
01:13:23,162 --> 01:13:26,665
Punch him in the face
and get his confession.

965
01:13:31,128 --> 01:13:32,337
Let's go with plan A.

966
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:45,017
Didn't Mr. Jung say that
there would be cops in plain clothes?

967
01:13:46,435 --> 01:13:48,479
Right. It's past our go time.

968
01:13:49,062 --> 01:13:50,606
Let's go to the entrance.

969
01:14:04,495 --> 01:14:05,746
Excuse us.

970
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:26,058
What happened here?

971
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:31,563
He's dead.

972
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:33,816
Director Gil…

973
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:36,068
Where's Director Gil?

974
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:14,189
They beat us to it.

975
01:15:26,326 --> 01:15:27,244
Mr. Cassano.

976
01:15:42,593 --> 01:15:45,012
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Hong.</i>

977
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:49,391
<i>All of us couldn't handle
the sadness of losing our families</i>

978
01:15:49,474 --> 01:15:51,602
<i>and the anger we felt today.</i>

979
01:15:53,228 --> 01:15:56,857
<i>So we are going to do
something very foolish.</i>

980
01:15:59,192 --> 01:16:02,738
<i>I hope you can be understanding.</i>

981
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:50,859
<i>This isn't about justice.</i>

982
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,112
<i>This is about the principle
that I've lived by.</i>

983
01:20:54,196 --> 01:20:56,489
<i>I'll let you break that promise.</i>

984
01:20:56,573 --> 01:21:01,661
God enjoys making people suffer
while remaining hidden someplace.

985
01:21:01,745 --> 01:21:04,414
<i>-That's why this is so fun.
-How do we find the killer?</i>

986
01:21:05,749 --> 01:21:06,666
<i>If we can't find them,</i>

987
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,043
-<i>we'll make them come to us.</i>
-Wait!

988
01:21:08,126 --> 01:21:11,630
So he's one of the best consiglieres
in Italy?

989
01:21:11,713 --> 01:21:13,924
<i>They know your true identity?</i>

990
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:16,343
I'll have to kill him. Or he'll kill us.

991
01:21:16,426 --> 01:21:18,094
<i>Something bad might happen.</i>

992
01:21:18,178 --> 01:21:20,889
<i>I know who it is.
The real boss behind Babel.</i>

993
01:21:22,641 --> 01:21:27,646
