1
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,115
Damn it.

2
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,048
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

3
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,968
You're under arrest
for the murder of Mr. Oh Jeong-bae.

4
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,110
Hands up,

5
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,862
or I'll fire.

6
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,118
I didn't do it.

7
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,622
Mr. Oh sent us a text that you
abducted him and brought him here.

8
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,043
When you find yourself trapped in a swamp…

9
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,254
Stay still.

10
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,591
You're under arrest
for abduction and murder.

11
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,804
…you must get out of it
before you hit the bottom.

12
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,845
Gosh, that hurts.

13
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,224
Hold on. You bumped into me.
Be more careful…

14
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,268
Wait.

15
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,313
You don't live here.

16
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,900
Where are you going?

17
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,444
Who are you?

18
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,488
Answer me.

19
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,949
Who are you?

20
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,537
Gosh. Where do you think you're going?

21
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,791
Damn, you give me no choice.

22
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,585
Fine.

23
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,212
It's been a while.

24
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,130
All right.

25
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,049
BEST LAUNDROMAT

26
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,551
Jeez. What was that noise? A flat tire?

27
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,637
Gosh. What is it?

28
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,389
Let's go.

29
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,308
-Is something wrong?
-Let's go. Hurry!

30
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,643
Yes!

31
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,072
Running away?

32
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,283
You're still totally fine.

33
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:44,951
Come on.

34
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,787
Is it time for some jujitsu?

35
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,913
Fine, come at me.

36
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,416
Jujitsu it is.

37
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,300
I got you. I got you, you little rat.

38
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,220
Don't hit my face.

39
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,849
Keep doing that and I'll go mad.

40
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,393
Stop! That's enough.

41
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,186
Boss!

42
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,440
Did you get my beer?

43
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,482
Yes.

44
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,694
I got bottled beer, your favorite.

45
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,655
Then you should make use of it.

46
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,960
EPISODE 16

47
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,337
Shouldn't you go farther?

48
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,796
I'll see what's going on.

49
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,551
Can I borrow your phone?

50
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,635
Sure.

51
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,221
Here you go.

52
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,358
It was a setup, wasn't it?

53
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,945
It seems like Babel found out
I was controlling Mr. Oh.

54
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,864
Do you have a plan?

55
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,200
I need to prove my innocence.

56
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,869
I have to find the person who lured me.

57
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,162
"Lured" you?

58
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,831
-Gosh.
-I got hit again.

59
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,708
-My goodness.
-You startled me.

60
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,210
How could you?

61
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,878
You startled me even more.

62
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,464
You see…

63
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,425
I found a suspicious man and caught him.

64
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,261
You can pay me and take him immediately.

65
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,100
Are you listening, Mr. Cassano?

66
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,355
Look here.

67
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,483
There are more than 50 missed calls.

68
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,693
MISSED CALLS

69
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,821
He must've had an accomplice.

70
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,657
What are you glaring at?

71
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,993
You killed the CEO
of Daechang Daily, didn't you?

72
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,246
Who made you do it?

73
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,290
Didn't I…

74
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,211
tell you not to hit me in the face?

75
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,880
How many more times
do I need to hit you to make you talk?

76
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,135
By the way, how did you know it was him?

77
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,012
Goodness. I'm Park Seok-do.

78
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,140
Geumga-dong's nutria.

79
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,227
A superb hunting instinct
and a tenacious will to survive.

80
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,981
But nutrias are being wiped out.

81
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,692
You get paid 20,000 won
for every nutria you kill.

82
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,446
You're being too harsh again.
You cold woman.

83
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,492
Okay.

84
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,661
Call me as soon as you get him.

85
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,589
He must've gotten help
from someone outside the building.

86
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,008
Your turn.

87
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,011
I've asked the police to put out an APB.

88
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,388
Get back in the game and get him quick!

89
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,271
Things are only getting
more complicated, right?

90
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,401
It's because you worry
about others too much.

91
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,195
You're too nosy.

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,742
I guess you are Korean after all.

93
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,039
You see,

94
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,251
I used to be in a gang myself,
although I eventually mended my ways.

95
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,295
Why?

96
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,840
Why else?

97
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,676
I realized I was useless
in the eyes of the world.

98
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,641
Goodness.

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,935
Do me a favor.

100
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,564
Leaving the past behind
and becoming a new person…

101
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,107
Forget all that.

102
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,152
Do what you do best.

103
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,988
That's what you can do to help the world.

104
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,800
Are you having a picnic?

105
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,134
Why are you all here?

106
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,053
My goodness.

107
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,641
Is this the man who lured you?

108
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
He won't tell us who was behind it.

109
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,986
Let's go talk in the car.

110
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,576
Go easy on him, okay?

111
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,120
He needs his jaw to eat.

112
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,705
Wait, why my car?

113
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,332
I washed it yesterday. Go cover the seats.

114
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,668
Okay. Hold on!

115
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,384
So I twisted his neck right away.

116
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,389
He's still alive, right?

117
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,185
He told me where his accomplice is.
I'll get going.

118
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,437
I'll come with you.

119
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,481
-Me too.
-Me three.

120
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,774
Me four.

121
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,780
This isn't some back-alley dog fight.
I need to prove my innocence.

122
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,240
Let us all go together.

123
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,576
The more, the better.

124
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,119
-Let's go.
-I mean…

125
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,454
Hey, go clean the seats.

126
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,290
By the way, Mr. Cassano.

127
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,420
Once this is all over,
shouldn't you repay me in some way?

128
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,755
I'm the one who caught him.

129
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,882
What do you want?

130
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,052
Can you grant me a wish?

131
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,721
What's your wish?

132
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,307
I'll tell you tomorrow. Tomorrow.

133
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,146
Stop him. It's dangerous.

134
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,361
Where are we going, by the way?

135
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,737
Goodness.

136
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,700
He's growing on me.

137
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,914
Open the door!

138
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,458
Hey!

139
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,877
Gosh, these punks.

140
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,798
Here I am, Geumga-dong's nutria.

141
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,633
Do as we say from now on.

142
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,804
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

143
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,390
They don't seem to recognize
their predator.

144
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,062
How dare they? I'll teach them a lesson.

145
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,147
Hold on. Move out of the way.

146
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,109
-Gosh.
-Let me hit him once.

147
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,487
By the way, he does look like
a nutria, doesn't he?

148
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,738
Well done, nutria!

149
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,076
Be careful! Oh, my.

150
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,245
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

151
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,381
These three are the real culprits
in the murder of Mr. Oh Jeong-bae.

152
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,759
We'll summarize what happened
for you, so listen carefully.

153
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,677
Attention.

154
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,599
Someone had ordered these men

155
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,977
to wait for Mr. Oh to get off work.

156
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:13,023
They struck him with a blunt object
to kill him in front of his office.

157
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,567
After they killed him,

158
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,612
they removed his body from the building
without anyone knowing.

159
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,530
And…

160
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,537
DAECHANG DAILY

161
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,000
they brought the body to Geumga Plaza
and moved it to the rooftop.

162
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,256
They made a false report
to the police to frame me.

163
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,224
And they lured me to the rooftop
of the central building.

164
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,488
When I arrived,

165
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,824
they dropped Mr. Oh's body to the ground.

166
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,912
Can you prove they're the culprits?

167
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,207
This van right here
belongs to these bastards.

168
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,751
You'll find the cart
they used to move the body,

169
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,671
the weapons they used,
and Oh's bloodstains in the van.

170
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,174
This is from the dash cam in the van.

171
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,761
You'll be able to see where they've been

172
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,846
in detail.

173
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,016
We'll keep a copy of the dashcam footage

174
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,270
just in case.

175
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,282
So Vincenzo hasn't been caught yet?

176
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,369
I don't know. The cops haven't called yet,

177
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,537
and they won't pick up.

178
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,831
Can I help you?

179
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,708
Yes, please.

180
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,710
We're looking for Mr. Park Do-hun.

181
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,254
Park Do-hun… Mr. Park?

182
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,506
That's me.

183
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,924
-Right.
-Mr. Park Do-hun.

184
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,553
You're under arrest for
aiding and abetting Oh Jeong-bae's murder.

185
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,056
-What?
-I'll take your coffee.

186
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,185
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

187
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,605
Hold on. This is a misunderstanding.

188
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,233
Mr. Han. Ms. Choi.

189
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,902
-Ms. Choi.
-Come with us.

190
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,323
-Mr. Han.
-Mr. Han.

191
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,043
BYEBYE BALLOON TRAVEL

192
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,855
Very nice.

193
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,151
I cleared my name thanks to you.

194
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,616
So what's your wish?

195
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,329
It's about our flyers.

196
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,498
Can you do it for us?

197
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,418
-Do what?
-Can you be our model?

198
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,086
What are you saying?

199
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,880
Our model.

200
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,636
I don't know why, but you somehow give off
this trustworthy vibe.

201
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,054
Forget it. I'll just pay you.

202
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,639
Please be our model.

203
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,433
Without my help, you'd be
locked up in jail by now.

204
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,935
I said no. I'll leave this here.

205
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,770
No! Wait!

206
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,314
You promised to grant him a wish.

207
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,232
-Are you going back on your word?
-No.

208
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,484
I paid him instead. Move.

209
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,905
You're one heartless capitalist monster.

210
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,118
-Good.
-What? Give me that.

211
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,912
-Delete it.
-Okay. Good.

212
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,455
-Give it here.
-You're too close.

213
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,498
Take a half step back.

214
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,041
A half step back. There you go.

215
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,877
Very good. That looks really nice.

216
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,920
-Give me that.
-Good.

217
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,088
I'll hang you off the balcony.

218
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,589
Put your hand on your tie.

219
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,674
Delete it.

220
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,008
Can you look up a little?

221
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,718
-Give me that.
-There you go.

222
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,178
Damn it. Give me that now!

223
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,346
Perfect.

224
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,641
Give me that now. Stop it.

225
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,609
Why is this so hard?

226
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,736
You said you set up a trap.

227
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,865
How come he hasn't fallen for it once?

228
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,494
I can see why he used to be
an ace member of the Mafia.

229
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,788
He's as elusive as a ghost.

230
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,124
He's not to be trifled with.
He's invincible.

231
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,502
Yes. Vincenzo Cassano.
What could be his secret--

232
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,099
Can we trust the lawyer who got arrested?

233
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,310
Yes.

234
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,021
I made sure he understood.

235
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,982
Why do you look so unhappy?

236
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,570
It's not like that.
I was thinking of something else.

237
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,238
I'm sorry, sir.

238
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,243
I transferred the case
to the Namdongbu office.

239
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,328
It'll be fine.

240
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,123
-Han-seo.
-Yes?

241
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,875
We need to go somewhere.

242
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,169
What? Okay.

243
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,883
Did you see how I dodged it?

244
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,009
I'm so…

245
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,392
Myung-hee.

246
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,856
Wusang isn't some contract killing agency.

247
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,109
At this rate, everyone will be
arrested for ordering murders.

248
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,652
This is why

249
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,323
we should have succeeded the first time.

250
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,908
Gosh.

251
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,579
Shouldn't you try to stop Mr. Jang?

252
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,706
This has gone too far.

253
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,832
Are you blaming me?

254
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,793
We're a law firm.

255
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,253
There are limits to what we can do.

256
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,506
Did you bring me here
to adhere to the limits?

257
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,134
Didn't you want us to be Babel's bidet?

258
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,344
Damn it!

259
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,305
Still, this is just not right!

260
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,768
Jang Han-seok is a total psychopath.

261
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,063
-Jeez.
-Han Seung-hyuk!

262
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,610
I know you're frustrated,
but you should know who your enemies are!

263
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,762
I don't think I'll ever forget this aroma
wherever I go.

264
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,474
You've finally learned to appreciate
instant coffee.

265
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,358
You knew Jang Han-seok would kill
Mr. Oh, didn't you?

266
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,568
To some extent.

267
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,946
Since Mr. Oh washed
Han-seok's dirty linen in public.

268
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,451
So you already had
the big picture in your mind.

269
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,415
We should get going.

270
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,007
I'll carry your bag.

271
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,300
Thanks.

272
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,138
You look gorgeous today.

273
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,516
You look even more beautiful
with makeup on.

274
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,310
Right?

275
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,936
Yes.

276
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,567
Where do you want to go first?

277
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,239
I want to have my portrait taken.

278
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,752
I have no portrait to use
at my funeral later.

279
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,045
One, two…

280
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,505
One more.

281
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,133
Relax. One, two…

282
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,553
Put on a little smile. One, two…

283
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,806
One last time. Put on a bigger smile.

284
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,601
There you go. One, two…

285
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,939
Great. Well done.

286
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,357
Hold on.

287
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,446
Please take one more with us.

288
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,531
Sure, go ahead.

289
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,243
Stand straight.

290
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,411
Look at the camera.

291
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,748
Good. One, two.

292
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,127
Relax a bit. Okay. One, two.

293
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,256
We're done.

294
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,091
-Thank you. Oh, wait.
-Sure.

295
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,135
Your outfits match pretty well.

296
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,429
-You should take a photo together.
-I'm fine…

297
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,139
Hang on. Come over here.

298
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,768
Wait. Why don't you sit here?
Yes, sit here.

299
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,186
Just one photo.

300
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,731
Put your arm around her shoulders.

301
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,110
Like this. Stick closer together.

302
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,612
That's nice. Just one photo, okay?

303
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,282
Yes, just like that!

304
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,783
All right, look over here.

305
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,702
Great. One, two.

306
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,040
Okay, look here. One, two.

307
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,376
You two look so nice together.

308
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,420
One more. One, two.

309
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,965
That's great. One, two.

310
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,170
The weather is really nice today.

311
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,713
You're right.

312
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,853
I need to make
an urgent business call now.

313
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,940
Take good care of her.

314
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,321
Drink this if you get thirsty.

315
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,615
Thank you.

316
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,828
I'll see you later.

317
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,641
I haven't taken a walk in a long time.

318
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,311
I thought I'd die

319
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,815
without being able to enjoy such luxury.

320
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,319
This isn't a luxury. It's just a walk.

321
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,782
This is

322
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,370
the happiest moment of my life.

323
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,502
Just tell me
whenever you want to go for a walk.

324
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,547
I will. Thank you.

325
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,258
Receive your treatment

326
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,885
and hang in there until the retrial.

327
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,975
I've never had

328
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,770
so much energy before in my life.

329
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,569
Never?

330
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,324
No.

331
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,079
Not since

332
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,332
I sent my beloved son away.

333
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,964
He was my everything.

334
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,010
What hope could I have

335
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,430
after losing everything?

336
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,644
Then why didn't you look for him?

337
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,937
I did.

338
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,359
I looked for him for several years.

339
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,906
But I couldn't find him.

340
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,284
I was too late.

341
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,665
You can still look for him now.

342
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,754
I can't face him now.

343
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,885
I'd only be a burden to him like this.

344
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,639
Don't think like that.

345
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,768
I'm sure your son wouldn't.

346
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,355
Do you think so?

347
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,522
Yes.

348
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,736
I'm sure your son

349
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,782
has been waiting for you his entire life.

350
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,536
And I'm sure

351
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,623
your son…

352
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,418
tried to grow up strong

353
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,172
so he wouldn't be ashamed

354
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,884
when he met his mother someday.

355
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,141
That doesn't matter.

356
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,312
No matter how he's grown up,

357
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,983
he's still my son.

358
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,656
What mothers cherish their entire lives

359
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,243
are the beautiful smiles

360
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,288
their children give them.

361
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,835
"Ju-hyeong."

362
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,170
When I called him,

363
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,258
he'd look at me with this smile.

364
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,014
There's something

365
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,309
I want to tell him if I meet him again.

366
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,857
"I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise

367
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,986
that I'd come for you soon.

368
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,074
There hasn't been a single day

369
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,246
that I haven't thought about you."

370
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,749
I want to tell him that.

371
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,330
There's something
I just can't wrap my head around.

372
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,458
How did Oh Jeong-bae

373
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,087
find out about all your dirty laundry?

374
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,383
He was someone who'd use secrets
to cut a deal as soon as he obtained them.

375
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,926
You're right.

376
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,887
He wasn't someone
who'd keep any secrets to himself.

377
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,308
Then that means
he learned about it recently.

378
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,436
If Vincenzo was the one who told him…

379
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,648
Vincenzo may be using the Guillotine file.

380
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,817
Then he wasn't keeping it in that room.

381
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,485
If that really is the case,

382
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,489
He could stir up the entire nation.

383
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,869
Then we'll have to use
the most effective method.

384
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,164
If I can't have it,

385
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,418
I'll make sure no one ever gets it.

386
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,928
Sir.

387
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,596
Yes?

388
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,975
Why did you want to come here?

389
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,312
To cherish Geumga Plaza
as a historical building.

390
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,940
What do you mean?

391
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,365
I just recorded a piece of history.

392
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,629
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

393
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,883
I came for a gas safety check.

394
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,678
Did the other inspector quit?

395
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,515
She took a few days off
since her daughter's giving birth.

396
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,061
Oh, right. So she's giving birth already.

397
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,399
Business must be slow
because of the demolition and everything.

398
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,779
Right, but we should hang in there.

399
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,990
-Oh, the gas pipe is over there.
-Right.

400
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,909
-Thank you.
-No problem.

401
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,537
All right.

402
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,795
Get some rest.

403
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,299
You'll be able to get
a good night's sleep today, right?

404
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,927
Of course, I'm sure I will.

405
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,308
Get some rest, then.

406
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,396
Wait.

407
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,076
Thank you.

408
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,789
Stay healthy, okay?

409
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,708
Please keep an eye on her.

410
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,834
Yes, sir.

411
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,674
-Who is that?
-A guard.

412
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,929
Just in case Shinkwang Bank tries
to harass her about the retrial.

413
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,140
Right, Hwang Min-seong
made a fuss last time.

414
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,603
Mr. Cassano.

415
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,318
You two looked really nice together today.

416
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,573
You looked like mother and son.

417
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,744
Later, when you're ready,

418
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,455
you should call her Mom.

419
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,143
What's this?

420
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,771
Oh, my gosh! Is this real?

421
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,315
Then are you really
going to become parents?

422
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,609
Oh, my gosh. Congratulations!

423
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,652
My gosh!

424
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,654
I think I'm going to cry.

425
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,701
Finally, after making such a fuss
about not having a child.

426
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:22,667
Yes. These days, I've become confident
that I'll be able to be a good father.

427
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,089
Things won't be easy, but we'll
try our best and raise our child well.

428
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,258
-I hope they'll grow up well.
-Of course.

429
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,886
You're both strong,
so I'm sure your child will be healthy.

430
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,472
Shouldn't we have a drink to celebrate?

431
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,268
Everyone, gather at Arno.
I'll treat you all to a delicious meal.

432
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,186
-Nice!
-Yes!

433
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,188
Is there good news?

434
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,275
The pawnshop owners are having a baby!

435
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,113
Congratulations!

436
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,323
I can't believe it. Congratulations.

437
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,994
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, Mr. Cassano.

438
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,581
We're going to have a party
at Toto's restaurant.

439
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,082
-You should come too.
-Sure.

440
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,251
We should celebrate such a happy occasion.

441
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,004
You're coming too, right?

442
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,840
I don't think he'll come.

443
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,889
I'll join you, too.

444
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,143
-Yes!
-Nice!

445
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,227
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

446
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,938
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

447
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,150
-I'm so happy for you.
-Thank you.

448
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,486
-No way.
-All right!

449
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,946
Que sera, que sera

450
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,326
-Que sera, que sera
-Que sera, que sera

451
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,329
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

452
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,081
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

453
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,248
I heard that in Korea,

454
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,834
you can have someone
to do things for you at gatherings.

455
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,628
-A black knight.
-A black knight.

456
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,630
Right, a black knight. Seok-do?

457
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,840
-Go!
-Go!

458
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,928
This is crazy!

459
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,805
He seems pretty drunk.

460
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,015
GEUMGA PLAZA

461
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,445
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

462
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,423
Happy birthday to you

463
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,176
Happy birthday to you

464
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,180
Happy birthday, my baby

465
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,766
Happy birthday to you

466
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,594
Here.

467
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,804
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

468
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,639
-Eat up.
-Aren't you drinking too much?

469
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,725
Do you hear the sirens?

470
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,018
-What?
-What?

471
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,811
-Is there a fire?
-I drank too much.

472
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,063
-What?
-Where could it be?

473
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,815
Sirens?

474
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,526
Hey, wait.

475
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,445
-Wait up.
-What's going on?

476
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,946
-What is it?
-Stay here.

477
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,700
-Is this the smell of gas?
-What?

478
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,619
-Oh, my.
-I can smell gas.

479
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,164
We received a report about a gas leak.
You should all evacuate.

480
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,625
-What?
-We have to evacuate?

481
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,460
-Oh, my gosh.
-Honey.

482
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,128
-A gas leak?
-We have to go.

483
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,047
-Let's go.
-Come on. Let's go.

484
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,174
I think it's over here!

485
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,177
-Hurry. Let's go.
-A gas leak?

486
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,720
Come on, let's go.

487
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,431
-Hurry.
-You guys go ahead first.

488
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,017
-Hurry.
-Mr. Cassano!

489
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,728
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

490
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,691
It's dangerous here.

491
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,370
The gas pipe was cut.

492
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,997
-Someone cut the pipe?
-Yes.

493
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,459
Sir, you shouldn't be here!

494
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,836
Get out of here!

495
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,507
But what's this?

496
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,218
It looks like it's working.

497
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,021
Hey!

498
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,738
Thank you.

499
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,782
It's pretty sharp.

500
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,285
It has to be her.

501
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,329
The woman who came for a gas safety check.

502
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,374
We'll tell that to the police
and find her.

503
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,752
If it weren't for you,
it would've been a disaster.

504
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,879
I never heard of such watches.

505
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,007
There's no question who did this.

506
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,677
Babel, those jerks. They're even trying
to make gas explosions now?

507
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,431
They blew up their own vacation home
to kill their researchers.

508
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,351
What would've happened to our baby
if it really exploded?

509
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,685
It's all right.

510
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,189
But who reported it?

511
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,608
-Was it you?
-What? No.

512
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,695
None of you reported it?

513
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,989
It seems so.

514
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,659
We were all drinking.

515
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,508
Don't dodge this.

516
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,385
I won't.

517
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,864
I'm sorry.

518
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,077
I didn't expect the firefighters
to be dispatched.

519
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,206
Can't even blow up one building?

520
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,458
Why? I don't get it.

521
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,836
It was just about to explode,

522
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,838
but 911…

523
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,174
Right. 911.

524
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,177
I'll think of another reckless way
to take care of it.

525
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,304
-Are you saying I was reckless?
-Yes…

526
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,765
I mean, no.

527
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,350
Who is it?

528
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,398
I have something urgent to report.

529
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,066
Hey. Get out.

530
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,984
Yes, sir.

531
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,921
HANJU SACRED HEART HOSPITAL

532
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,307
So we finally found

533
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,019
what Vincenzo cares about the most.

534
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,284
Everything in this building
could've turned to ashes.

535
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,041
I wonder who reported it, though.

536
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,562
Sir, I'd like some luwak coffee today.

537
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,190
It was such a hassle to brew it,
so I sold it online.

538
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,151
Why would you?
Don't you know how rare it is?

539
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,448
What's with your clothes?
It's as if you live in the '80s Koreatown.

540
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,830
I disguised myself in case
someone recognized me on the way here.

541
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,217
What?

542
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,053
Oh, this?

543
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,890
I actually came here
to tell you guys about this.

544
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,269
Let me tell you.

545
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,692
This is a battle scar
that I got for saving your lives.

546
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,737
What do you mean?

547
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,075
Yesterday, when this building
was about to blow up.

548
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,829
Who do you think reported it?

549
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:16,802
You see, my brother ordered me
to blow up this building.

550
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,430
And I made him think I was going to do so.

551
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:23,142
Then I called 911 at the right time.

552
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,768
It was really dangerous.

553
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,354
Are we supposed to thank you or something?

554
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,483
Of course, you should.

555
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:36,155
You could've been buried alive,
but I saved all of you.

556
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,671
My brother and Wusang know that

557
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,133
there's gold and the Guillotine file here.
You know that, right?

558
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,053
That's probably why he wanted
to blow this place up.

559
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,055
He won't stop here.

560
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,140
He could even launch a missile.

561
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,278
Don't you think this is enough for you
to do me that favor?

562
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,821
I've done enough, haven't I?

563
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,288
Fine, I'll do it.

564
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,376
We'll discuss the details later.

565
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,424
Organize them in an alphabetical order.

566
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,634
Alphabetical?

567
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,848
Second from the top.

568
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,154
First, we should set up gas detectors

569
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,156
and a security system.

570
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,783
You never know

571
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,202
what that psychopath might do next.

572
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,664
He won't have many chances left.

573
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,583
Things are going to turn biblical soon.

574
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,587
The Tower of Babel will finally collapse.

575
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,297
In addition,

576
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,593
I'll make sure everyone who tried to
build it will be punished.

577
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,265
But we're not God.

578
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,518
God will punish them.

579
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,270
We'll just deliver them to Him.

580
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,650
Villains know best how to deliver
the likes of them to God.

581
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,823
Tell me the details.

582
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:54,960
Translation.

583
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,676
"Catch a big fish with a small fish."

584
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,143
SEOUL NAMDONGBU DETENTION CENTER

585
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,620
You're Kang Ho-chul, right?

586
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,038
Who the hell are you?

587
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,582
Manners, you son of a bitch.

588
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,960
Are you refusing to obey me
now that you're out of jail?

589
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,804
-Run!
-Run! Hurry!

590
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,097
Damn it!

591
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,520
Right.

592
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,688
Hello, ma'am

593
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,732
Get in, you bastard.

594
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,251
It's still chilly,
so don't stay out for too long.

595
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,545
-I'll come back later.
-Okay.

596
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,323
Here you go.

597
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,577
Thank you.

598
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,830
Your son is extremely handsome.

599
00:47:59,084 --> 00:47:59,918
He is.

600
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,552
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REPORT

601
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,262
BABEL TOWER PROJECT PROGRESS

602
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,317
-Mr. Cassano, where are you going?
-Mr. Nam.

603
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,915
You must be elated to have finally
met him again after a long time.

604
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,250
Of course.

605
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,716
I'm sorry for yapping away
when we've just met.

606
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,467
How embarrassing.

607
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,430
Don't be.
Your story made my heart feel warm.

608
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,310
I envy you.

609
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,898
My parents and I never took photos.

610
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,483
Really?

611
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,570
My father never liked taking photos.

612
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,405
Oh, dear.

613
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,159
With such a handsome son like you?

614
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,870
He didn't love me

615
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,999
as much as you love your son.

616
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,464
Is your son precious to you?

617
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,091
Of course.

618
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:58,013
I'd give up my life for him.

619
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,978
I hope you regain your health.

620
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,606
Thank you.

621
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,401
And thank you so much
for chatting with me.

622
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:29,085
Make sure to make me feel
ecstatic tonight.

623
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,881
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Yes, sir.

624
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,466
ATTORNEY CHOI MYUNG-HEE

625
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,052
I promise to bring you good news.

626
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:50,774
You seem to be in a great mood.
Did you go somewhere nice?

627
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,110
That's none of your business. What's this?

628
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,323
Oh, this? You don't look too great
these days.

629
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,575
Your ears look humongous as well.

630
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,328
This is for your health.

631
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,455
After all you've done?

632
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,834
Also, my ears were always huge.

633
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,627
Really?

634
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,011
Wait. One pill is enough.

635
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,280
Are you really not going to tell me
where you've been?

636
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,836
Damn it. You could've told me
in return for the supplements.

637
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,392
BUNGEOPPANG

638
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:19,946
Yes?

639
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,908
-Where are you?
-I'm buying some bungeoppang.

640
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,492
Custard cream for me, then.

641
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,039
I'm visiting the hospital.

642
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,749
Why?

643
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,254
There's something I didn't tell her.

644
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,964
Good thinking.

645
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,636
Go to her and call her "Mother."

646
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,512
And give her a hug.

647
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,099
See you later.

648
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,768
See you.

649

45TH JUDICIAL TRAINEES'
GRADUATION CEREMONY

650
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,162
Here you go.

651
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,997
-How much is it?
-That'll be 3,000 won.

652
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,416
-Here you go.
-Okay.

653
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,834
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

654
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,441
I was told to move Ms. Oh Gyeong-ja
to another room.

655
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,051
What's going on?

656
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,881
-Move aside!
-Coming through!

657
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,969
-What happened?
-Really?

658
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,055
-Are you serious?
-It happened in the room.

659
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,681
It happened inside the room?

660
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,017
-It happened here?
-It's terrifying.

661
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,125
Ms. Hong.

662
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,337
Someone broke into the room
and murdered Ms. Oh.

663
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,298
One of the nurses…

664
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,706
He's definitely not a staff here.

665
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,167
I'll call the police.

666
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,129
Please send this footage to my phone.

667
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,047
Okay.

668
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,396
I have a favor to ask you.

669
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,775
Please stay by her side

670
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,319
until I come back.

671
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,447
I will.

672
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,493
Make sure you catch him.

673
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:05,953
No.

674
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,998
Make him pay.

675
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,366
The facial recognition result is out.

676
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,451
CRIMINAL RECORD

677
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,328
He had committed assault and murder
and was recently released.

678
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:34,000
He was charged with attempted murder
but was acquitted during the first trial.

679
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:39,464
I'll send you his photo
and his registered address.

680
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,550
-Thank you.
-Is there anything else I can do?

681
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,555
I may need you to track someone later.
I'll call you then.

682
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,645
Who is it?

683
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,358
Who is it?

684
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,321
What the hell?

685
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,037
Who the hell are you?

686
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,078
Do you know who the woman you killed was?

687
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,375
No, I don't.

688
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,212
She was my mother.

689
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,387
Who gave the order?

690
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,973
No one.

691
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,435
After I was released,
I had a drink with a friend.

692
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,022
Then I got upset and…

693
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,732
So…

694
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,612
you just killed someone at random?

695
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,280
Yes.

696
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,202
Do try to be understanding of me.

697
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,874
After all, you killed my mother.

698
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,186
Who gave the order?

699
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,479
It's the truth.

700
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,690
I was in a bad mood…

701
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,197
All right.

702
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,701
Let's drink ourselves to death tonight.

703
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,787
Why are you in such a great mood today?

704
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,706
Because I killed Vincenzo's mother.

705
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,962
The one he was finally reunited with
after 30 years.

706
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,130
What?

707
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,341
He must be devastated, right?

708
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,013
Were you aware of this?

709
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,475
What's wrong?

710
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,978
Are you scared that I killed his mom?

711
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:04,937
No, sir.

712
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,774
I'm just worried
it might worsen the current situation.

713
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,694
I feel the same way.

714
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,197
No good can come out of provoking him.

715
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:21,120
Since you joined hands,
you must share the same feelings too.

716
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,080
"Joined hands"?

717
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,332
What are you trying to say?

718
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,459
Hey, Ms. Choi.

719
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,795
How dare you talk so impudently?

720
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,424
I'm not being impudent.
I'm just stating a fact.

721
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,595
That's not true.

722
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,599
He was just lending me a hand
because I lacked so much.

723
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:45,019
You've been meeting each other
a bit too often for "just lending a hand."

724
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,604
-Damn it.
-What?

725
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,982
Have you been watching me?

726
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:51,776
Wait. Then me too?

727
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:54,236
How could you keep tabs on your allies?

728
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,075
It's because you weren't
acting like our allies.

729
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,451
That's why we did it.

730
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:03,287
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to?

731
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,997
Show some respect!

732
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,247
What is this about?

733
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,792
Non-members cannot enter.

734
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,255
Hey.

735
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,301
You must be out of your mind
because of my brother

736
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:23,886
when you're a mere lawyer.

737
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,140
Maybe.

738
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,519
But I can still see through
your lousy plan to betray the chairman.

739
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,938
Ms. Choi!

740
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,483
Watch what you say.

741
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:41,362
He's still our client nonetheless!

742
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:45,449
Seung-hyuk, you of all people
should have been more careful.

743
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,202
How dare you betray the chairman's trust?

744
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,705
What did I do?

745
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,627
How could you frame me like this?

746
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,213
Frame, my ass.

747
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:04,218
You should've known better. How could you?

748
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,936
Do I look like a pawn now that you've
gained some wealth and power?

749
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,897
If it wasn't for me,

750
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,859
you'd still be Mr. Seo's gopher
back at the Namdongbu Office!

751
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,112
-"Gopher"?
-That's right.

752
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,490
Do you want to die?

753
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,077
I'm your senior! Show some respect!

754
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:35,416
Sir, I don't know what she told you,

755
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:37,835
but it isn't true…

756
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:00,482
Who is that?

757
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,152
Help me.

758
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,762
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON JIN-KI

759
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:45,337
