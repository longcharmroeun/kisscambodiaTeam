1
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,243
Who is that?

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,913
Help me.

3
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,574
Killing my mother

4
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,037
wasn't just evil. It was utterly foolish.

5
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,793
I knew that you killed countless people
and even tried to kill me.

6
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,465
But do you know why I didn't kill you?

7
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,514
Because it was a hassle.

8
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,107
I had a job to do.

9
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,319
So if I'd killed you,

10
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,030
it would've inconvenienced me a lot.

11
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,702
Killing these small flies wouldn't,
though.

12
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,999
Anyway…

13
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,378
You have to die now.

14
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,923
-No. Please.
-Why? No.

15
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,303
Don't be scared.

16
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,514
It won't be today.

17
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,314
You see, I've got a principle.

18
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,320
"A painless death is a blessing."

19
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,577
I will give you two things.

20
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,832
A humiliation worse than death,

21
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,583
and…

22
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,213
a slow death, where you'll experience it

23
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,801
every step of the way.

24
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,983
You can take care of that garbage.

25
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,986
And don't even think about
pinning it on me.

26
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,155
If you do, people will find out…

27
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,325
who put him up to it.

28
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,559
I should give you a preview.

29
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,209
Mr. Jang!

30
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,169
Mr. Jang!

31
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,463
-Mr. Jang!
-Sir!

32
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,091
Oh, no. Call 911.

33
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,550
-Call 911.
-Call an ambulance.

34
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,480
We will take her now.

35
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,157
Wait.

36
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,923
Mom.

37
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,557
Mom.

38
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,666
Mom.

39
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,886
Mom!

40
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,521
DECEASED, OH GYEONG-JA

41
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,329
{\an8}EPISODE 17

42
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,123
{\an8}Her son came back after 30 years,

43
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,003
{\an8}but what came out of it was her death.

44
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,301
{\an8}If I hadn't shown up,

45
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,472
{\an8}she would have lived longer.

46
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,772
{\an8}In the end, I'm living in hell.

47
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,152
{\an8}The hell that is regret.

48
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,655
{\an8}No.

49
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,700
{\an8}It was brief,

50
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,789
{\an8}but you gave your mother
eternal happiness.

51
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,087
{\an8}And your mother did
the same for you as well.

52
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,176
Once you're done hurting, you'll know.

53
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,804
But what pains me the most…

54
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,684
is that I already miss her.

55
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,813
I miss my mother.

56
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,081
<i>Ms. Hong.</i>

57
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,167
<i>Once I'm gone,</i>

58
00:13:55,793 --> 00:14:01,590
<i>please give this scarf
to my son, Ju-hyeong, for me.</i>

59
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,638
<i>The only thing
this foolish mother could give my poor son</i>

60
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:13,310
<i>is this simple scarf,
which is quite embarrassing.</i>

61
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,272
<i>And…</i>

62
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>please tell him this for me.</i>

63
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,237
<i>"Ju-hyeong,</i>

64
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,532
<i>you were a blessing</i>

65
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
<i>and happiness to me.</i>

66
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,331
{\an8}<i>You were the reason
why I carried on living.</i>

67
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,838
<i>Ever since the moment
I could feel your movement in my stomach,</i>

68
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,216
<i>there hasn't been</i>

69
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,346
<i>a single second that I did not love you.</i>

70
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,725
<i>I'm sorry</i>

71
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,812
<i>that I couldn't show you
how much I love you</i>

72
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,024
<i>by your side.</i>

73
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,028
<i>My baby…</i>

74
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,114
<i>My Ju-hyeong…</i>

75
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,950
<i>I love you.</i>

76
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,870
<i>I love you to pieces.</i>

77
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,167
<i>I'm grateful that you're my son,</i>

78
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,753
<i>and I'm sorry for everything."</i>

79
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,050
<i>Please take good care of Ju-hyeong.</i>

80
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,802
<i>Thank you.</i>

81
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,531
Go and get my doctor right now.

82
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,075
Right now!

83
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,253
Get me discharged now.

84
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,882
That will take a while to heal.
You should stay here for now.

85
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,846
Ms. Choi.

86
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,599
Go and kill Vincenzo right now.

87
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,560
I don't care if you have to hire
100 or 200 men.

88
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,354
Kill him by any means necessary.

89
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,398
I don't care how much it costs.

90
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:23,899
Okay?

91
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,777
Please calm down.
Treating your wound takes priority.

92
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,612
I told you I don't need treatments!

93
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,618
You don't have to tell me.
I will make sure to kill Vincenzo.

94
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,289
But right now, you must think
about Babel first.

95
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,509
Okay…

96
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,053
but don't just kill him.

97
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,017
We'll make him suffer
like he plans to do with us.

98
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,643
Of course.

99
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,722
<i>Ju-hyeong.</i>

100
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,808
<i>Ju-hyeong.</i>

101
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,202
Why don't we just kill Jang Han-seok
and Choi Myung-hee and call it a day?

102
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,247
This isn't for revenge.
I'm playing a game of chess.

103
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,584
I'm going to move my pawn today.

104
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,547
All right, then.
Everything is almost ready.

105
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,803

{\an8}CLOSED TEMPORARILY

112
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,357
Mr. Cassano.

113
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,142
We're closing our businesses
for the time being.

114
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,688
We want to help you bring down Babel
in earnest.

115
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,733
We want us to work together
as a team from now on.

116
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,568
To tell you the truth,

117
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,488
I can be quite scary when I'm angry.

118
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,948
I'll help, too.

119
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,826
The whole plaza decided to help you,

120
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,287
so please let us.

121
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,374
We'll be on standby.
Let us know if you need anything.

122
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,378
I'm still in my first trimester,
so I can move around without a problem.

123
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,379
I can help too.

124
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,881
You know that I used to work in the field.

125
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,508
Use me whenever you want.

126
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,553
All this time,

127
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,681
we thought we were weak.

128
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,225
But we weren't weak.

129
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,229
We just didn't try to be strong.

130
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,567
We're going to give it our all now.

131
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,281
Let us fight with you.

132
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,992
Mr. Cassano.

133
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,286
We are all

134
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,997
a part of the Cassano Family.

135
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,872
Vincenzo Cassano!

136
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,668
Vincenzo Cassano!

137
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,310
Why don't you rest at home today?
We'll take care of things.

138
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,563
I should be there.
It's the last day of feeding.

139
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,452
It's just a few locals from Sangcheon-gu.
You don't have to go.

140
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,956
Right. We will take care of
the agreements ourselves.

141
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,415
Why are you so chatty today?

142
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,750
I said I'm going.

143
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,462
Right. I told you he was coming.

144
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,262
Did your mom's funeral go well?

145
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,557
It's Vincenzo.

146
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,892
Yes, thanks to you.

147
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,853
Is your hearing okay?

148
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,647
Yes, thanks to your excellent aim.

149
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,024
By the way,

150
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,736
am I going to die today?

151
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,323
There's one more step before that.

152
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,409
<i>I don't remember.</i>

153
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,706
I shot your ear,
but your brain must have been damaged.

154
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,625
A humiliation worse than death.

155
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,754
To give you that, I'm playing a game
of chess with you starting today.

156
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,259
And I'll get rid of your pieces
one by one.

157
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,097
Imagine being left all alone
on the chessboard.

158
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,019
Isn't that embarrassing and scary?

159
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,188
<i>No.</i>

160
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,190
I don't plan on losing in this chess game.

161
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,526
Unfortunately, you already started losing.

162
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,326
Defeat begins

163
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,162
with one's fear.

164
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,710
Sir, what did Vincenzo say?

165
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,338
Go and ship the miniature.

166
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,049
Okay.

167
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,556
I doubt he just called to say hello.

168
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,268
Right. What if there's another trap?

169
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,978
Gosh. No.

170
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,273
No way. He can't be setting traps
all the time.

171
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,733
-Come on.
-Right.

172
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,402
What did I do to this valuable thing?

173
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,821
Ms. Choi, help us move…

174
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,989
Gosh.

175
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,869
-How can we move it?
-We should push it.

176
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,413
-Unplug it first.
-Unplug it?

177
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,998
We wouldn't be
that much help to him anyway.

178
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,666
That doesn't matter.

179
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,544
It's fine as long as he knows
how serious we are.

180
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,089
Let's think about
how else we can help him.

181
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,761
What's wrong?

182
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,433
What's with the credit card?

183
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,061
Mr. Cassano gave us his credit card
for the well-being of the family.

184
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,730
"Family"?

185
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,566
Let's go to a department store.

186
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,692
What for?

187
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,196
To buy a team uniform
for the Cassano Family.

188
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,706
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REPORT

189
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,500
BABEL TOWER PROJECT PROGRESS

190
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,007
The approval process for Babel Tower
is ridiculous no matter how I look at it.

191
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,511
It's not just ridiculous.

192
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,472
It's nothing more than a doodle on a wall.

193
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,977
Once Mr. Nam is done
looking over the Guillotine file,

194
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,687
we'll find more ridiculous stuff.

195
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,940
Since we'll be bringing the tower down,

196
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,860
it'll be much better
to bury more trash under it.

197
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,571
Hello, everyone.

198
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,198
-Hello. See you soon.
-Hello.

199
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,533
Sir. Yes.

200
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,493
Let's see.

201
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,166
Secretaries can stay
in the waiting area downstairs.

202
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,125
What's this?

203
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,752
Only the VIPs can enter.

204
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,795
We weren't informed.

205
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,130
-Let's call them.
-Come on.

206
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,425
-This is ridiculous.
-Let's go downstairs for now.

207
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,968
-Please step aside.
-Step aside.

208
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,229
CONGRATULATIONS ON MOVING IN,
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

209
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,907
Everyone, stay calm and man your posts.

210
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,283
Don't let anyone in.

211
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,161
Yes, Mr. Consigliere.

212
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,457
You cannot go here.

213
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,459
-Please go down.
-We're sorry.

214
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,053
All right.

215
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,014
Hello, my dear guests from Sangcheon-gu.

216
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,475
We appreciate your patience.

217
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,771
I will be the host of today's event.

218
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,899
I am Babel's helper,
Vice Chairman Jang Han-seo.

219
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,947
Finally, today…

220
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,993
we'll be giving out the present
we've promised you.

221
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,703
It's…

222
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,083
your chance to win units at our tower!

223
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,632
That's right.

224
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,218
All right. Sir.

225
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,060
I'm Jang Han-seok.

226
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,896
For Babel Tower to be built,

227
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,774
the help
from the head of our district office,

228
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,069
-the police chief,
-Yes.

229
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,697
Assemblyman Kim…

230
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,866
I'm Kim Uk-hyeon.

231
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,912
…and other VIP guests from Sangcheon-gu
were absolutely necessary.

232
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,791
And of course,
Babel ought to return the favor.

233
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,502
-Enjoy yourselves tonight.
-I forgot to ask.

234
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,588
-I hope you win a unit.
-Will we get a lot?

235
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,256
-Shut up.
-Congratulations.

236
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:29,095
All right. Let the party begin now!

237
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,044
This is for the 92nd floor of Building A.

238
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,129
And the floor goes to…

239
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,925
Congratulations, Mr. Kim Uk-hyeon.

240
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,302
-I did it!
-Gosh.

241
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,971
<i>I won!</i>

242
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,182
<i>-Gosh.
-He's loving it.</i>

243
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,934
These men are unbelievable.

244
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,186
<i>-Don't be so disappointed.</i>
-They're shameless.

245
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,648
<i>-It's the penthouse at Building B.</i>
-How could they be so shameless?

246
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,776
People can't control their greed.

247
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,694
-Only thing bigger than greed…
<i>-It overlooks Han River,</i>

248
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,488
<i>-a park, and the city.</i>
-is just bigger greed.

249
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,406
<i>It has the perfect view.</i>

250
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,908
<i>Yes, Ms. District Chief.</i>

251
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,869
Tax exemption on construction!

252
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,080
Tax exemption on construction? My gosh!

253
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,207
-Police Chief.
-I'll dispatch more men

254
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,335
-when you demolish the plaza.
-More cops for demolition!

255
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,253
That's pretty big. Anyone else?

256
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,380
Ms. District Chief.

257
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,717
All the private businesses
related to Sangcheon-gu

258
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,428
will have to do business with Babel Group.

259
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,014
-Sold! Yes!
-I won?

260
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,395
The penthouse goes to the District Chief!

261
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,897
-This way. My gosh.
-Goodness.

262
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,525
Good for you. I'm so jealous.

263
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,696
Hold on. How may I help you?

264
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,000
<i>All right. He's the last winner
of today's event.</i>

265
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,251
It's the 52nd floor.

266
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,671
Congratulations, Mr. Ham Seung-un.

267
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,591
Congratulations.

268
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,511
You seem so happy.

269
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,098
We have given out all the units now.

270
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,185
We will now cut the cake
to celebrate our event today.

271
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,062
District Chief, Mr. Kim,

272
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,940
and the police chief,
please come forward now.

273
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,318
Who's that?

274
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,457
What is it?

275
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,584
You can't come in here.

276
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,211
Hey!

277
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,964
-Hey, you…
-Who is that?

278
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,090
What's going on?

279
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,551
This is a bomb!

280
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,304
A bomb?

281
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,347
I'm being threatened now.

282
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,019
Ms. Choi, you must help me.

283
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,230
-Do you know him?
-No.

284
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,774
I don't know him.

285
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,901
How dare you!

286
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,653
If you scream

287
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,031
or try to run away,

288
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,241
this bomb will go off.

289
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,661
-Everyone, don't move.
-Wait!

290
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,372
Who the heck put you up to this?

291
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,665
I don't know, either.

292
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,376
I was abducted and have been getting
instructions via text.

293
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,003
And…

294
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,928
What's that?

295
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,057
-What?
-What is that?

296
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,602
There's a bomb here.

297
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,065
-That must be the bomb.
-My gosh.

298
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,691
I'm just doing as instructed.

299
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,028
You must do as I tell you to from now on

300
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,738
if you want to stop this bomb.

301
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,127
That's a nice start.

302
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,226
He's ready.

303
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,729
Make them believe that it's a real bomb.

304
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,939
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

305
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,943
After this,

306
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,695
you guys will be free.

307
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,113
Yes, sir.

308
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,615
Make Choi Myung-hee pay
for humiliating you guys

309
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,325
when you worked for her.

310
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,954
Oh, right. After the party,
I'll pay you right away.

311
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,290
Leave Korea by the end of today.

312
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,087
Everyone here

313
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,924
must annul the agreement you signed
with the Babel Group

314
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,844
and cut all ties
with Chairman Jang Han-seok.

315
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,512
Swear it on your knees.

316
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,056
What? We have to kneel?

317
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,809
Vincenzo?

318
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,522
Hey, you! You are trying
to fool us, aren't you?

319
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,232
There's no bomb! This is Korea!

320
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,234
Now! The bomb can go off any minute.

321
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,362
Something looks off.

322
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,616
Right. Yes. That's right. That looks fake.

323
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,118
I think they're just portable chargers.

324
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,995
If this is one of your fake stunts,

325
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,955
you'd better stop it now!

326
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,999
For those of you who refuse to believe me,

327
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,710
I will show you this.

328
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,463
In five seconds,

329
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,509
the miniature model
of Babel Tower will explode.

330
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,428
-What?
-What's he talking about?

331
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,765
Five!

332
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,185
Four!

333
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,688
Three!

334
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,690
Two!

335
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,734
One!

336
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,468
-Help!
-Open up!

337
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,303
-Open the door.
-Open it.

338
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,554
-Help!
-Help!

339
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,431
-Open it now!
-Help!

340
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,183
-Open the door.
-Open it now.

341
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,029
Is he really dead?

342
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,201
Remember what I told you?

343
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,536
That when it was time,

344
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,498
I would let you throw the hunting dogs
that killed your dad

345
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,501
to the lion's den.

346
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,755
I was going to let you push the button,

347
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,466
but I figured I should do it.

348
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,388
I see.

349
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,327
Did you change your mind?

350
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,158
No, I didn't.

351
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,163
They should pay for what they did.

352
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,120
RESTRICTED NUMBER

353
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,748
<i>The bomb in the cake
can wipe out the entire room.</i>

354
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,417
-What?
-What's going on?

355
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,668
-What?
-Oh, no.

356
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,253
-What should we do?
-Look.

357
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,921
-What?
-Open the door now.

358
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,676
What? I didn't get one.

359
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,388
-What's this about?
-The bomb…

360
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,848
It can wipe out the room!

361
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,683
Wait.

362
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,226
Sir.

363
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,270
I think that's a real bomb.

364
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,112
<i>For your information,
I've been recording you from the start.</i>

365
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,924
SEND TEXT MESSAGE

366
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,389
DO AS THE DEAD MAN SAID RIGHT NOW

367
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,726
MESSAGE SENT

368
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,977
RESTRICTED NUMBER

369
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,564
<i>Do as the dead man said right now.</i>

370
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,028
<i>Find your agreement,</i>

371
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,114
<i>chew it, and swallow it.</i>

372
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,201
<i>And after identifying yourself,</i>

373
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,703
<i>swear on your knees.</i>

374
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,580
-The agreement!
-Where is the agreement?

375
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,748
The agreement…

376
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,092
Spit it out. Gosh, come on!

377
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,261
I, the Chief of Sangcheon Police Station

378
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,265
-will cut ties with Babel Group.
-Hey. I need my agreement.

379
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,683
I swear it to God!

380
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,644
I, Assemblyman Kim Uk-hyeon,

381
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,315
will cut ties with Babel Group. I swear.

382
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,071
Be quiet!

383
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,907
You be quiet!

384
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,492
Do you want us all to die?

385
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,333
<i>I, the head of Sangcheon-gu
district office,</i>

386
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:29,088
<i>swear to cut all ties with Babel Group!</i>

387
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,217
It'll be easy to nullify
the approval of Babel Tower now.

388
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,524
I swear!

389
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,073
The timer stopped! It stopped!

390
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,284
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

391
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,326
Hey.

392
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,957
<i>Good job.</i>

393
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,083
<i>Use your influence</i>

394
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:10,296
<i>to make it seem as
the party today never happened.</i>

395
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,006
<i>You may all leave.</i>

396
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,259
Let's get out.
We must get out of here now!

397
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,431
-Let's go.
-I'm leaving now.

398
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,349
-Hurry up!
-Move!

399
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,560
-Hurry.
-Let's get out of here now.

400
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,478
-We should get out now.
-Hurry up.

401
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,273
Sir, this cake… The bomb…

402
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,109
I think something bad is going to happen.

403
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,819
Shut up.

404
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,575
The timer!

405
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,452
The timer is back on.

406
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,371
-The timer.
-Mr. Jang!

407
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,500
The timer!

408
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,527
Thanks.

409
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,077
We won even without moving our bishop.

410
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,458
Getting what we wanted
was easier than I thought.

411
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,002
The second party

412
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,089
will be much grander
and crazier than this.

413
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,928
I'll handle the second party.

414
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,574
-He's out.
-That's him, right? Okay.

415
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,620
Sir!

416
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,748
Hello. Salute.

417
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,417
Mr. Han.

418
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,627
What brings you here this early?

419
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,879
I wanted to see you, sir.

420
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,048
I hope he's doing well.

421
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,928
His approval ratings went up,
so he's in a good mood.

422
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,347
Well, you are the kingmaker.

423
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,308
He must feel
as if he has an entire army by his side.

424
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,520
You came to see me after a long time
just to flatter me?

425
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,815
Seriously. What's this about?

426
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,442
Well…

427
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,778
would it be possible to meet with him?

428
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,322
Why?

429
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,117
There's something
I would like to talk to him about.

430
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,453
Why don't we meet after the election?

431
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,663
We can't be too careful
before the election.

432
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,292
It's regarding the Guillotine file.

433
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,174
-Ms. Choi!
-Jeez!

434
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,469
Stay here.

435
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,055
You scared me.

436
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,143
You punk.
Where have you been all this time?

437
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,021
I'm sorry.
I should have come to see you sooner.

438
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,650
Have you and Hwang-gyu
been working for Vincenzo

439
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,110
after betraying me?

440
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,653
We were in a bit of a situation.

441
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,864
I'm sorry.

442
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,074
Please forgive me.

443
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,202
I can't believe this jerk.

444
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,871
How dare you come here
after what you've done?

445
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,749
I was out of my mind, ma'am.

446
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,000
Please help me.

447
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,543
You have to help me.

448
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,045
Get up.

449
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,838
People are watching. Get up.

450
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,138
You and I need to have a very long talk.

451
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,726
If you want to live,
you better tell me everything.

452
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,186
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,023
Get in. Let's go get a drink.

454
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,500
-Ms. Hong?
-Where?

455
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,586
Come on.

456
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,719
Darn it.

457
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,100
You come here.

458
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,686
You're not good at hockey.

459
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,983
The tip I gave you was useful, right?

460
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,902
You were able to ruin the party
thanks to me.

461
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,780
It wasn't bad.

462
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,491
Gosh. Can't you just give me credit
when I deserve it?

463
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,410
What should I do next?

464
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,872
There might be a shift
in the power dynamic at Babel.

465
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,624
What change?

466
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,836
Power is bound to shift after a big loss.

467
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,630
When that happens, tell me.

468
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,631
We'll meet here.

469
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,842
Sure. I can do that.

470
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,429
Let me ask you one thing.

471
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,641
You won't kill me, right?

472
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,900
I know. I know you won't,
but I just feel anxious for some reason.

473
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,902
As long as you don't

474
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,779
drop honorifics.

475
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,784
I'm not even wearing my helmet.
How could you do that?

476
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,745
How could you do that, sir?

477
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,288
You scared me, sir.

478
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,707
Have you been studying?

479
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,919
My eyes are killing me these days
because I read so many books, sir.

480
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,467
Your best source of protection
isn't a gun or a sword.

481
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,137
It's your brain. Don't forget that.

482
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,556
Bye.

483
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,017
Wait.

484
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,810
Wait.

485
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,201
What is it?

486
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,538
What?

487
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,250
What did you say?

488
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,129
Thank you, sir.

489
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,177
You made me realize
what an idiot I had been.

490
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,190
Gosh.

491
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,861
Vincenzo.

492
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,198
Thank you.

493
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,094
My gosh. You are hurt badly.

494
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,013
Spare me.

495
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,141
What did you say?

496
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,977
Spare me.

497
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,190
Do you still think I'm a pushover?

498
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,000
Bury him.

499
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,966
GEUMGA PLAZA

500
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,893
Now, you should all go out and fight.

501
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,061
Can you teach us how?

502
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,023
We're not that knowledgeable in that area.

503
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,360
First of all, you must use
your enemy's weaknesses as weapons.

504
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,112
You must be brazen.

505
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,697
Forget about manners.

506
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,034
Treat them as if they killed your parents

507
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,077
and as if you'd never see them again.

508
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,498
Never back down from your demands.

509
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,086
Don't let their social status
intimidate you.

510
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,588
Be strong

511
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,758
and act like you're their equal.

512
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,968
BLUE SKY, SANGCHEON

513
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,438
Are you a goat or what,
munching on a piece of paper?

514
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,190
Why are you doing this to me?

515
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,317
You know the on-site inspection

516
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,945
for the construction of Babel Tower
had issues, right?

517
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,822
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REEXAMINATION

518
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,948
You should reevaluate.

519
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,199
And based on that,

520
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,868
you must reexamine
the approval process as well.

521
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,038
<i>I, the Chief of Sangcheon Police Station</i>

522
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,999
<i>-will cut ties with Babel Group.</i>
-It wasn't some speech contest.

523
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,043
Didn't your throat bleed afterwards?

524
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,878
{\an8}What is it that you want?

525
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,797
{\an8}Firstly…

526
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,967
dispatch cops around Geumga Plaza
around the clock

527
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,468
and reinforce security.

528
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,678
Secondly…

529
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:24,224
give the tenants of Geumga Plaza
Courageous Citizen Awards.

530
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,646
<i>I won!</i>

531
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,940
<i>He's loving it!</i>

532
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,026
What do you want me to do?

533
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,865
Nullify all the redevelopment plans
around Geumga Plaza.

534
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,534
Get all the bribes you took
from Babel Group

535
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,369
and donate it to Geumga Orphanage

536
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,832
unless you want to be humiliated.

537
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,710
GO, GO, BABEL TOWER HELPERS

538
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,550
"Babel Tower Helpers"?

539
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,887
What kind of name is that
for a group of lowlife thugs?

540
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,763
It sounds like a name for a yogurt.

541
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,268
You'll end up in a freezer next time,
you assholes.

542
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,357
Remember my face.

543
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,568
I'm Geumga-dong's nutria.

544
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,623
What?

545
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,834
They say they are reexamining
the approval process.

546
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,670
What is Wusang doing now?

547
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,546
Darn it.

548
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,258
I just gave them hell,
so they'll come up with a plan.

549
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,929
-Sit down.
-Okay.

550
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,353
When I was shot in the ear,

551
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,398
the moment you shot me
flashed through my head.

552
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,071
Why are you bringing that up?

553
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,782
I'm just saying I'm glad to be alive.

554
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,540
Remember what I told you?

555
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,625
It's just us two now.

556
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,419
We're brothers.

557
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,177
A long time ago,
your mother asked me for a favor.

558
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,805
She asked me to be nice to you

559
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,349
and look after you

560
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,561
even if I don't give you anything.

561
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,438
She did?

562
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:18,815
Yes.

563
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,401
But you're pretty smart now.

564
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,695
I want to give you something.

565
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,405
No.

566
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,992
No, sir.

567
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,994
I'm happy as it is.

568
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,912
Babel Bio.

569
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,123
Take over and launch it.

570
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,376
You wanted to run a subsidiary.

571
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:46,801
Sir, I'm not cut out to do
such an important job.

572
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,055
And Babel Bio… Gosh, no.

573
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,599
-This makes no sense.
-Try it, you punk.

574
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,185
If you do a good job,

575
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,271
I'll leave Babel Pharmaceuticals
or Chemicals to you.

576
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,149
If you insist…

577
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,235
I will do my best.

578
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,823
Come here.

579
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,583
Be an innovative entrepreneur
like Elizabeth Holmes.

580
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,545
I'll back you up.

581
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,261
Yes, sir. I will do my best. Thank you.

582
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,556
Do a good job.

583
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,446
CANDIDATE 3, PARK SEUNG-JUN

584
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,536
{\an8}LEADER OF THE NEW ERA, PARK SEUNG-JUN!

585
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,039
I said there's no problem.

586
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,125
Yes. Just proceed with that.

587
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,669
God, this jerk.

588
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,089
-It's been a while, Mr. Han.
-Hello, sir!

589
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,217
Gosh, "sir"? Don't be so formal.

590
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,929
So Wusang is doing well, right?

591
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,599
Gosh, I'm a nobody, but you
even remember my firm. Thank you.

592
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,102
-Sit down.
-Okay.

593
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:23,565
You danced tango by yourself
at the company dinner party.

594
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,024
You sang "Dead Drunk," right?

595
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,944
How can I forget such a quirky junior?

596
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,197
My gosh. I must have been
out of my mind. I did that again?

597
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,575
Oh, no. I'm so embarrassed.

598
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,703
Anyway, tell me about the Guillotine file.

599
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,038
-What's that about?
-Okay.

600
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,751
It's been a crazy couple of weeks, sir.

601
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,298
Mr. Cassano. Ms. Hong.

602
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,592
I analyzed

603
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,720
everything related to Babel
from the Guillotine file.

604
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:57,348
Do you know the keyword
that comes up the most?

605
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,892
Bribery or sex scandals?

606
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,269
-Wrong.
-It's got to be real estate.

607
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,354
-How did you know?
-We're in Korea.

608
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,399
That's right. To be precise, it's IUDC.

609
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,109
"IUDC"?

610
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,861
What's IUDC?

611
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,614
"Innovative Urban
Development Corporation."

612
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,533
They develop and provide real estate
for building new cities.

613
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,659
You get it, right?

614
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,495
NAME: PARK SEUNG-JUN
SPECIALTY: REAL-ESTATE

615
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,582
As expected, the main industry
of the Korean cartels is real estate.

616
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,751
IUDC is involved in every process.

617
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,921
Babel and IUDC were already
in on it together.

618
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,507
The insiders and the people
who colluded with them

619
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,134
must've made a fortune
by buying land around Babel Tower.

620
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,555
You know, the forerunner of
the presidential election, Park Seung-jun?

621
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,099
He acquired some land around the plaza

622
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,519
using certain loopholes five years ago.

623
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,522
His brother-in-law is the head of IUDC.

624
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,898
-His brother-in-law?
-Yes.

625
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,443
Maybe we shouldn't have opened
the Guillotine file.

626
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,237
It's the root of our frustration.

627
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,280
We keep finding more corruption…

628
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,741
when Babel is our only target.

629
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,457
Where are you going?

630
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,211
It's about time
that we deal with our greed.

631
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,046
I'll be back.

632
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,842
Mr. Cassano. What now?

633
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,267
Let me get this straight.

634
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:27,605
The Guillotine File and 1,5 trillion won's
worth of gold bars are buried

635
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,274
underneath the Babel Tower?

636
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,525
Yes, sir.

637
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,444
And an Italian Mafia lawyer
has control over it?

638
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,904
Yes. That's right.

639
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,078
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

640
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,955
Is this a plot for a cartoon?

641
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,665
Well…

642
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,877
it's been confirmed that
his information is somewhat credible.

643
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,256
I see.

644
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,717
Be it politics or life,

645
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,845
there's no such thing as too much drama.

646
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,390
All of these matters
are very serious, sir.

647
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,850
The Babel Tower…

648
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,561
The Guillotine file…

649
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,062
Everything…

650
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,819
Every one of them

651
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,992
is like a sword that's aimed at my neck.

652
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,247
Sir.

653
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:30,793
I will be your unbreakable shield.

654
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,258
What should I do

655
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,511
to have to use that shield?

656
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,639
Sir…

657
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,815
I'm sorry to ask you this again,

658
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,443
but you have to move.
I'll find you another place.

659
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,154
What is this about now?

660
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,573
You were lucky the other day.

661
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,160
If there's another explosion,
it'll be dangerous to stay here.

662
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,330
So I urge you to move as soon as possible.

663
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,291
Jeokha and I will follow
the words of Buddha

664
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,627
and stay here as we have been.

665
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,510
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

666
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,263
I've wanted to ask you a question.

667
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,516
Go ahead.

668
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,488
NANYAK TEMPLE

669
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,505
Are you sure you'll be able to
build Babel Tower?

670
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,425
I heard that they are reexamining it now.

671
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:04,011
From my experience, it will be difficult
to build a tower there

672
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,848
with hiccups like this.

673
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:11,185
The media are already starting
to suspect something is going on.

674
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,103
Everyone.

675
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,481
It's a minor error with the document.
It's nothing.

676
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,569
Wusang will take care of it in a few days.

677
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,865
Why don't we all have a drink now?

678
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,410
And it's nothing big,
but check the present I prepared for you.

679
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,454
Gosh.

680
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,497
Come on, everyone.

681
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,668
I'm sure you know how this works. Come on.

682
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,757
Those annoying bastards.

683
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,550
Can't we just get rid of them?

684
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,553
We cannot lose the people
who were at the meeting today.

685
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,433
Keep reassuring them.

686
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:54,729
They might not be my bishops,
but they'll make good pawns.

687
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:06,324
Gosh, you're amazing.
You're making a chess analogy.

688
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,492
That's so cool.

689
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:11,662
Where are you?

690
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,956
Everyone left, right?

691
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,502
I'm bringing a guest with me.

692
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,170
A guest?

693
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,058
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

694
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,101
Hello, sir.

695
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:37,563
I'm Hong Cha-young.

696
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,067
Oh, my. I've also heard a lot about you.

697
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,612
Hello, sir. Nice to meet you.
I'm the paralegal here.

698
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,155
I see. Hi.

699
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,704
<i>Mr. An, we need to talk.</i>

700
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,290
So…

701
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,835
Excuse me.

702
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,590
You have the Guillotine file?

703
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,177
Ms. Hong, Mr. Nam, you, and I
are the only people who know about it.

704
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,220
Don't tell a soul.

705
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,472
Then, we should head over to my agency--

706
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,432
No. Not yet.

707
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,102
We have a job to do with this file.

708
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,104
Right.

709
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,023
We can destroy everyone with the file.

710
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,567
That's right.

711
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,402
-You trust me, right?
-Totally.

712
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:28,406
Then, let me use the Guillotine file
the way I see fit.

713
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,616
After I'm done, I'll hand it over to you.

714
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,493
I think I know how you'll use it.

715
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,453
I trust you, Mr. Consigliere.

716
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,538
Thank you.

717
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,875
But I have a favor to ask.

718
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,835
Go ahead.

719
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:41,752
<i>Hey!</i>

720
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,756
So let me get this straight.
The Guillotine file is

721
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,718
locked in the basement of Geumga Plaza?

722
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,889
And Vincenzo Cassano is the only person
who can take it out?

723
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,891
-Yes.
-You punk.

724
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,643
You have been working

725
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,730
with Vincenzo Cassano for a reason!

726
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,944
I will give you the Guillotine file soon.

727
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,487
-Okay.
-Then, use the file

728
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,741
to beat Directors Kim Hui-won
and Park Jae-beom and become

729
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,242
the president of our agency.

730
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,952
-The president?
-Yes.

731
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,793
Hui-won. Jae-beom.

732
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:30,801
So tell me. What should I do to help?

733
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,471
All right.

734
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,097
The best floors at Babel Tower.

735
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,100
I'll start with
the 120th and 121st floors.

736
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,312
What is it?

737
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:45,024
<i>First, infiltrate Babel Group
and find their dirty laundry.</i>

738
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,861
<i>To take out the Guillotine file safely,
we must bring down Babel.</i>

739
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,863
I'm sorry I'm late.

740
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,865
I had an urgent meeting.

741
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,202
I'm Director Tae Jong-gu of
the International Organized Crime Bureau

742
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,995
at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

743
01:05:58,579 --> 01:05:59,872
<i>And secondly,</i>

744
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:04,001
<i>make sure no one comes after Mr. Cassano.</i>

745
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,217
Well, about Vincenzo Cassano…

746
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,639
You should never go after him.

747
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,726
-Pardon?
-He fled to Korea

748
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,980
with evidence of corruption
pertaining to not only Italian,

749
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,898
but also British and French politicians.

750
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,859
I didn't know he was that important.

751
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:29,944
He is.

752
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,864
He set up a system
that makes the evidence spread

753
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,033
all over the dark web when he dies.

754
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,078
And if an international scandal breaks
because of us,

755
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,541
our government will have to
take responsibility.

756
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,574
They are having a blast.

757
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,534
Their cheeks must hurt smiling like that.

758
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:21,871
Look at that gold toad.
I bet it doesn't even cost much.

759
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,126
I wore a spy cam
to the first meeting as well,

760
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,794
but it didn't record anything.

761
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,130
Gi-seok did a bad job
explaining how to use it.

762
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,090
Mr. Tae confused "on" with "off."

763
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,514
Anyway, thanks to you, I think
I might be taking up a bigger position.

764
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,895
Actually, I didn't do much.
He deserves more credit.

765
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,202
Hello, sir.

766
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,120
What? Yeong-un?

767
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,082
What are you doing here?

768
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,416
Well, to answer that,

769
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,877
it'd be a long story.

770
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,462
Right? I knew it.

771
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:14,882
Mr. Cho here is one of our agents, right?

772
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,718
I knew it. He looked familiar.

773
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,346
You should catch up with your colleagues.

774
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,139
Which year did you join?

775
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,518
No. Gi-seok started working
before you did.

776
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,104
-You look so young.
-Attention.

777
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:29,772
-At ease.
-Gosh.

778
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,524
"Gosh"? Focus.

779
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,609
That's enough.

780
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,487
How…

781
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:39,448
That makes no sense, Mr. Kim.

782
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,910
So…

783
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:47,039
Mr. Han will be the chief prosecutor
of Namdongbu Prosecution Service?

784
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,627
And Ms. Choi will just be
the CEO of Wusang?

785
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,504
You might not know this about me,

786
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:57,424
but I was in the Investigative Division
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

787
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,094
You got kicked out
because you always lost!

788
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:01,053
I did?

789
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,016
And about the Italian Mafia lawyer.

790
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,019
Don't go after him.

791
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,397
He's much bigger than you think.

792
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,649
He's on an international scale.

793
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,531
We just met, but you're quite bossy.

794
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,242
Don't butt in our business.

795
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:28,789
Mr. Park is being generous,
giving you a second chance.

796
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,583
I don't need his generosity.

797
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:35,171
For a boy who poisoned
his own father to death,

798
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,089
you sure talk back a lot.

799
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,385
What?

800
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,970
You didn't think I'd know?

801
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,726
And one more thing.

802
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:52,104
I think it'll be better if Han-seok
takes a break for the time being

803
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:56,650
and Han-seo runs the company again.

804
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:58,110
What?

805
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,779
You mean me?

806
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,615
Sir.

807
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:08,495
I know that this is coming from Mr. Park,

808
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,539
but you cannot tell a private company--

809
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,626
Choi Myung-hee. Jang Han-seok.

810
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,462
Don't you want a smooth transition

811
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,256
with the new administration?

812
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:26,388
And you, Myung-hee.
If you talk back to me again,

813
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:31,268
I'll take it that you're challenging
a presidential candidate

814
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,188
with an approval rating of 38,7 percent.

815
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,073
Congratulations, Chairman Jang.

816
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,701
-One more time.
-Chairman Jang.

817
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:53,707
Am I really the chairman again?

818
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,170
Do you know how hard I worked
to make this happen?

819
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,047
Mr. Han…

820
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,048
No.

821
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,634
Seung-hyuk.

822
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,053
Gosh. I'm the Chief Prosecutor now.

823
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:07,513
Chief Prosecutor Han.

824
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:15,020
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.
I cannot believe this is happening.

825
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,689
What was his name?

826
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:17,606
Jang Joon-woo?

827
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,775
-Vincenzo.
-Vincenzo.

828
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,070
The Interpol will come to arrest him
within 24 hours.

829
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,448
The Interpol?

830
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,409
-The International police.
-I know that.

831
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,493
Right.

832
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,829
You know…

833
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:36,000
I called the boss of the Cassano Family
and set a trap.

834
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:41,005
I asked him to find a crime
that we could frame Vincenzo with.

835
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,382
And I reported it to the Interpol.

836
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,638
Gosh.

837
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,016
Stop it.

838
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,059
Why didn't I think of that?

839
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:58,314
Let's get rid of the person who is
most likely to obtain the Guillotine file.

840
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:02,568
And you, my dear chairman,
will demolish Geumga Plaza

841
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,778
and obtain the Guillotine file.

842
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,407
But what if Vincenzo comes back
after some time?

843
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,618
No. Gosh. That's impossible.

844
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:16,582
Now, you can just focus on leading Babel.

845
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:20,502
I, the chief prosecutor,
will back you up on other things.

846
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,214
Jang Han-seok…

847
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,686
<i>Let's see</i>

848
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,731
<i>Who comes out on top</i>

849
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,888
INAUGURATION OF CHIEF PROSECUTOR
HAN SEUNG-HYUK

850
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,192
Please say a few words
as the new chief prosecutor.

851
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:29,780
I am infinitely honored to have the chance
to serve the people of our country.

852
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:34,535
<i>As the guardian of the Constitution
and democracy,</i>

853
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,372
<i>I will dedicate my life
so that the principle of justice</i>

854
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,208
{\an8}<i>can be the driving force
of our legal system.</i>

855
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,086
{\an8}<i>How do you plan to clear up
suspicion about</i>

856
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,130
{\an8}<i>-colluding with Babel?</i>
-Just like that?

857
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,507
How did he become
the chief prosecutor overnight?

858
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,510
Jang Han-seok doesn't have
enough influence to make that happen.

859
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,679
They must've used someone much higher up

860
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,806
to ward off our attacks.

861
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:57,975
<i>-Yes. I am</i>
-Then, could it be…

862
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:01,395
<i>well-aware of the public's mistrust
and concerns.</i>

863
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:05,232
Then why didn't Jang Han-seo
report this to us? This is huge.

864
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:07,276
Right. He's slacking off already.

865
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,947
He's not slacking off just yet.

866
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:17,870
Go ahead.

867
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,080
We need to talk. It's urgent.

868
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,461
They're being led to area A.

869
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:42,686
POLICE

870
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,504
What do you need to discuss?

871
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,595
This is driving me crazy.

872
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,047
You see…

873
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,008
Something's been bothering me.

874
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,014
What is it? Tell me.

875
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,109
I wish I didn't have to make
so many choices in life.

876
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,829
It's been fun.

877
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,082
But this is…

878
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,256
where our fun ends.

879
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,247
You're just like your brother.

880
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,958
I didn't expect much from you anyway.

881
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,003
A gun?

882
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,923
Don't shoot. I have a gun, too.

883
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:18,759
Your betrayal means

884
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,512
that you've accomplished your goal.

885
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,979
If either of us starts shooting,
we might both die.

886
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,899
So let's both lower our guns. Okay?

887
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,068
I don't plan on doing that.

888
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,155
Actually, my gun isn't loaded. It's empty.

889
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,074
I see.

890
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,368
Shoot your head first then.

891
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,745
No. I said it's empty.

892
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:50,040
I'm pointing it at you to scare you.

893
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:56,046
Shoot first.

894
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,557
Vincenzo Cassano.

895
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,943
We're from the Interpol.

896
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,321
We came here to arrest you
and repatriate you.

897
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:25,117
Drop your gun, Vincenzo Cassano.

898
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,300
