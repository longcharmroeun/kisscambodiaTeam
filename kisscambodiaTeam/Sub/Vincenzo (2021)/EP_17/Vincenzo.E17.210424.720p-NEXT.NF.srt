1
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:23,243
Who is that?

2
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,913
Help me.

3
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:25,574
Killing my mother

4
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:30,037
wasn't just evil. It was utterly foolish.

5
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,793
I knew that you killed countless people
and even tried to kill me.

6
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:41,465
But do you know why I didn't kill you?

7
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:49,514
Because it was a hassle.

8
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:59,107
I had a job to do.

9
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,319
So if I'd killed you,

10
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:05,030
it would've inconvenienced me a lot.

11
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:10,702
Killing these small flies wouldn't,
though.

12
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:15,999
Anyway…

13
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:19,378
You have to die now.

14
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:22,923
-No. Please.
-Why? No.

15
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,303
Don't be scared.

16
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:30,514
It won't be today.

17
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:39,314
You see, I've got a principle.

18
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,320
"A painless death is a blessing."

19
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,577
I will give you two things.

20
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:56,832
A humiliation worse than death,

21
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,583
and…

22
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,213
a slow death, where you'll experience it

23
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,801
every step of the way.

24
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,983
You can take care of that garbage.

25
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,986
And don't even think about
pinning it on me.

26
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,155
If you do, people will find out…

27
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,325
who put him up to it.

28
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,559
I should give you a preview.

29
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,209
Mr. Jang!

30
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,169
Mr. Jang!

31
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:26,463
-Mr. Jang!
-Sir!

32
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,091
Oh, no. Call 911.

33
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,550
-Call 911.
-Call an ambulance.

34
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,480
We will take her now.

35
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:17,157
Wait.

36
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:14,923
Mom.

37
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:23,557
Mom.

38
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:49,666
Mom.

39
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:01,886
Mom!

40
00:10:31,684 --> 00:10:34,521
DECEASED, OH GYEONG-JA

41
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,329
EPISODE 17

42
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,123
Her son came back after 30 years,

43
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:59,003
but what came out of it was her death.

44
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,301
If I hadn't shown up,

45
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,472
she would have lived longer.

46
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:17,772
In the end, I'm living in hell.

47
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,152
The hell that is regret.

48
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:25,655
No.

49
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:28,700
It was brief,

50
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:34,789
but you gave your mother
eternal happiness.

51
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,087
And your mother did
the same for you as well.

52
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,176
Once you're done hurting, you'll know.

53
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:49,804
But what pains me the most…

54
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,684
is that I already miss her.

55
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:58,813
I miss my mother.

56
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,081
Ms. Hong.

57
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,167
Once I'm gone,

58
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:07,590
please give this scarf
to my son, Ju-hyeong, for me.

59
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:13,638
The only thing
this foolish mother could give my poor son

60
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:19,310
is this simple scarf,
which is quite embarrassing.

61
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,272
And…

62
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,067
please tell him this for me.

63
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,237
"Ju-hyeong,

64
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,532
you were a blessing

65
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:34,993
and happiness to me.

66
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:40,331
You were the reason
why I carried on living.

67
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,838
Ever since the moment
I could feel your movement in my stomach,

68
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,216
there hasn't been

69
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:55,346
a single second that I did not love you.

70
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:58,725
I'm sorry

71
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:02,812
that I couldn't show you
how much I love you

72
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,024
by your side.

73
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:10,028
My baby…

74
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:13,114
My Ju-hyeong…

75
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:15,950
I love you.

76
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:18,870
I love you to pieces.

77
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:24,167
I'm grateful that you're my son,

78
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:26,753
and I'm sorry for everything."

79
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:32,050
Please take good care of Ju-hyeong.

80
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,802
Thank you.

81
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:55,531
Go and get my doctor right now.

82
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,075
Right now!

83
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:09,253
Get me discharged now.

84
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:12,882
That will take a while to heal.
You should stay here for now.

85
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:18,846
Ms. Choi.

86
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,599
Go and kill Vincenzo right now.

87
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,560
I don't care if you have to hire
100 or 200 men.

88
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,354
Kill him by any means necessary.

89
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,398
I don't care how much it costs.

90
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,899
Okay?

91
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,777
Please calm down.
Treating your wound takes priority.

92
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,612
I told you I don't need treatments!

93
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,618
You don't have to tell me.
I will make sure to kill Vincenzo.

94
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,289
But right now, you must think
about Babel first.

95
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:56,509
Okay…

96
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:59,053
but don't just kill him.

97
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,017
We'll make him suffer
like he plans to do with us.

98
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:05,643
Of course.

99
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:42,722
Ju-hyeong.

100
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,808
Ju-hyeong.

101
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:28,202
Why don't we just kill Jang Han-seok
and Choi Myung-hee and call it a day?

102
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:31,247
This isn't for revenge.
I'm playing a game of chess.

103
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,584
I'm going to move my pawn today.

104
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:39,547
All right, then.
Everything is almost ready.

105
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,803

112
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:39,357
Mr. Cassano.

113
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:15,142
We're closing our businesses
for the time being.

114
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:18,688
We want to help you bring down Babel
in earnest.

115
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:22,733
We want us to work together
as a team from now on.

116
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:24,568
To tell you the truth,

117
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:27,488
I can be quite scary when I'm angry.

118
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:28,948
I'll help, too.

119
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,826
The whole plaza decided to help you,

120
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:34,287
so please let us.

121
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,374
We'll be on standby.
Let us know if you need anything.

122
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:42,378
I'm still in my first trimester,
so I can move around without a problem.

123
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:43,379
I can help too.

124
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,881
You know that I used to work in the field.

125
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,508
Use me whenever you want.

126
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,553
All this time,

127
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,681
we thought we were weak.

128
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,225
But we weren't weak.

129
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,229
We just didn't try to be strong.

130
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:04,567
We're going to give it our all now.

131
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,281
Let us fight with you.

132
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:12,992
Mr. Cassano.

133
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,286
We are all

134
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:17,997
a part of the Cassano Family.

135
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,872
Vincenzo Cassano!

136
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:04,668
Vincenzo Cassano!

137
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:21,310
Why don't you rest at home today?
We'll take care of things.

138
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:24,563
I should be there.
It's the last day of feeding.

139
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:38,452
It's just a few locals from Sangcheon-gu.
You don't have to go.

140
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:41,956
Right. We will take care of
the agreements ourselves.

141
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,415
Why are you so chatty today?

142
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,750
I said I'm going.

143
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:48,462
Right. I told you he was coming.

144
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:56,262
Did your mom's funeral go well?

145
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:59,557
It's Vincenzo.

146
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,892
Yes, thanks to you.

147
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:03,853
Is your hearing okay?

148
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,647
Yes, thanks to your excellent aim.

149
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,024
By the way,

150
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,736
am I going to die today?

151
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:16,323
There's one more step before that.

152
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:18,409
I don't remember.

153
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:23,706
I shot your ear,
but your brain must have been damaged.

154
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,625
A humiliation worse than death.

155
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,754
To give you that, I'm playing a game
of chess with you starting today.

156
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:35,259
And I'll get rid of your pieces
one by one.

157
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:40,097
Imagine being left all alone
on the chessboard.

158
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,019
Isn't that embarrassing and scary?

159
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:47,188
No.

160
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:49,190
I don't plan on losing in this chess game.

161
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,526
Unfortunately, you already started losing.

162
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:00,326
Defeat begins

163
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:03,162
with one's fear.

164
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,710
Sir, what did Vincenzo say?

165
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:12,338
Go and ship the miniature.

166
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:15,049
Okay.

167
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:22,556
I doubt he just called to say hello.

168
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,268
Right. What if there's another trap?

169
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:27,978
Gosh. No.

170
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:31,273
No way. He can't be setting traps
all the time.

171
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:32,733
-Come on.
-Right.

172
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,402
What did I do to this valuable thing?

173
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:37,821
Ms. Choi, help us move…

174
00:24:37,905 --> 00:24:38,989
Gosh.

175
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:43,869
-How can we move it?
-We should push it.

176
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,413
-Unplug it first.
-Unplug it?

177
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:28,998
We wouldn't be
that much help to him anyway.

178
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,666
That doesn't matter.

179
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,544
It's fine as long as he knows
how serious we are.

180
00:25:33,627 --> 00:25:37,089
Let's think about
how else we can help him.

181
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:42,761
What's wrong?

182
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,433
What's with the credit card?

183
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:51,061
Mr. Cassano gave us his credit card
for the well-being of the family.

184
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:52,730
"Family"?

185
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:55,566
Let's go to a department store.

186
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:56,692
What for?

187
00:25:58,485 --> 00:26:01,196
To buy a team uniform
for the Cassano Family.

188
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:52,706
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REPORT

189
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,500
BABEL TOWER PROJECT PROGRESS

190
00:26:58,504 --> 00:27:02,007
The approval process for Babel Tower
is ridiculous no matter how I look at it.

191
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,511
It's not just ridiculous.

192
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:08,472
It's nothing more than a doodle on a wall.

193
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:13,977
Once Mr. Nam is done
looking over the Guillotine file,

194
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,687
we'll find more ridiculous stuff.

195
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:17,940
Since we'll be bringing the tower down,

196
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,860
it'll be much better
to bury more trash under it.

197
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:05,571
Hello, everyone.

198
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,198
-Hello. See you soon.
-Hello.

199
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:09,533
Sir. Yes.

200
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:11,493
Let's see.

201
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:17,166
Secretaries can stay
in the waiting area downstairs.

202
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:18,125
What's this?

203
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,752
Only the VIPs can enter.

204
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:21,795
We weren't informed.

205
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,130
-Let's call them.
-Come on.

206
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,425
-This is ridiculous.
-Let's go downstairs for now.

207
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:27,968
-Please step aside.
-Step aside.

208
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:39,229
CONGRATULATIONS ON MOVING IN,
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

209
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,907
Everyone, stay calm and man your posts.

210
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,283
Don't let anyone in.

211
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:54,161
Yes, Mr. Consigliere.

212
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,457
You cannot go here.

213
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,459
-Please go down.
-We're sorry.

214
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:11,053
All right.

215
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:14,014
Hello, my dear guests from Sangcheon-gu.

216
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,475
We appreciate your patience.

217
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:20,771
I will be the host of today's event.

218
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:23,899
I am Babel's helper,
Vice Chairman Jang Han-seo.

219
00:29:28,153 --> 00:29:29,947
Finally, today…

220
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:34,993
we'll be giving out the present
we've promised you.

221
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:36,703
It's…

222
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:41,083
your chance to win units at our tower!

223
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:48,632
That's right.

224
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:51,218
All right. Sir.

225
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:00,060
I'm Jang Han-seok.

226
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,896
For Babel Tower to be built,

227
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,774
the help
from the head of our district office,

228
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:09,069
-the police chief,
-Yes.

229
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,697
Assemblyman Kim…

230
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:13,866
I'm Kim Uk-hyeon.

231
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:18,912
…and other VIP guests from Sangcheon-gu
were absolutely necessary.

232
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:22,791
And of course,
Babel ought to return the favor.

233
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,502
-Enjoy yourselves tonight.
-I forgot to ask.

234
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:27,588
-I hope you win a unit.
-Will we get a lot?

235
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,256
-Shut up.
-Congratulations.

236
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:35,095
All right. Let the party begin now!

237
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,044
This is for the 92nd floor of Building A.

238
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:09,129
And the floor goes to…

239
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:12,925
Congratulations, Mr. Kim Uk-hyeon.

240
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,302
-I did it!
-Gosh.

241
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:17,971
I won!

242
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:20,182
-Gosh.
-He's loving it.

243
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:21,934
These men are unbelievable.

244
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,186
-Don't be so disappointed.
-They're shameless.

245
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,648
-It's the penthouse at Building B.
-How could they be so shameless?

246
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,776
People can't control their greed.

247
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,694
-Only thing bigger than greed…
-It overlooks Han River,

248
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,488
-a park, and the city.
-is just bigger greed.

249
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,406
It has the perfect view.

250
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,908
Yes, Ms. District Chief.

251
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:40,869
Tax exemption on construction!

252
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:43,080
Tax exemption on construction? My gosh!

253
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:45,207
-Police Chief.
-I'll dispatch more men

254
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,335
-when you demolish the plaza.
-More cops for demolition!

255
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,253
That's pretty big. Anyone else?

256
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:51,380
Ms. District Chief.

257
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:55,717
All the private businesses
related to Sangcheon-gu

258
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,428
will have to do business with Babel Group.

259
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:01,014
-Sold! Yes!
-I won?

260
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:06,395
The penthouse goes to the District Chief!

261
00:32:06,478 --> 00:32:08,897
-This way. My gosh.
-Goodness.

262
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:11,525
Good for you. I'm so jealous.

263
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:15,696
Hold on. How may I help you?

264
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,000
All right. He's the last winner
of today's event.

265
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,251
It's the 52nd floor.

266
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:32,671
Congratulations, Mr. Ham Seung-un.

267
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,591
Congratulations.

268
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:39,511
You seem so happy.

269
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:43,098
We have given out all the units now.

270
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:47,185
We will now cut the cake
to celebrate our event today.

271
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:49,062
District Chief, Mr. Kim,

272
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:51,940
and the police chief,
please come forward now.

273
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:55,318
Who's that?

274
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,457
What is it?

275
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,584
You can't come in here.

276
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:13,211
Hey!

277
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,964
-Hey, you…
-Who is that?

278
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:17,090
What's going on?

279
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:19,551
This is a bomb!

280
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:22,304
A bomb?

281
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:24,347
I'm being threatened now.

282
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:29,019
Ms. Choi, you must help me.

283
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:32,230
-Do you know him?
-No.

284
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:33,774
I don't know him.

285
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:35,901
How dare you!

286
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:38,653
If you scream

287
00:33:39,196 --> 00:33:41,031
or try to run away,

288
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:43,241
this bomb will go off.

289
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:46,661
-Everyone, don't move.
-Wait!

290
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:49,372
Who the heck put you up to this?

291
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:50,665
I don't know, either.

292
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:53,376
I was abducted and have been getting
instructions via text.

293
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:55,003
And…

294
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:02,928
What's that?

295
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,057
-What?
-What is that?

296
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:10,602
There's a bomb here.

297
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:15,065
-That must be the bomb.
-My gosh.

298
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:16,691
I'm just doing as instructed.

299
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:20,028
You must do as I tell you to from now on

300
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:21,738
if you want to stop this bomb.

301
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,127
That's a nice start.

302
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,226
He's ready.

303
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:54,729
Make them believe that it's a real bomb.

304
00:34:54,813 --> 00:34:55,939
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

305
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:59,943
After this,

306
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:01,695
you guys will be free.

307
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,113
Yes, sir.

308
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:05,615
Make Choi Myung-hee pay
for humiliating you guys

309
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,325
when you worked for her.

310
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:10,954
Oh, right. After the party,
I'll pay you right away.

311
00:35:11,788 --> 00:35:13,290
Leave Korea by the end of today.

312
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,087
Everyone here

313
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:22,924
must annul the agreement you signed
with the Babel Group

314
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:25,844
and cut all ties
with Chairman Jang Han-seok.

315
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,512
Swear it on your knees.

316
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:30,056
What? We have to kneel?

317
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:32,809
Vincenzo?

318
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:37,522
Hey, you! You are trying
to fool us, aren't you?

319
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:39,232
There's no bomb! This is Korea!

320
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:41,234
Now! The bomb can go off any minute.

321
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:44,362
Something looks off.

322
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,616
Right. Yes. That's right. That looks fake.

323
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:50,118
I think they're just portable chargers.

324
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:51,995
If this is one of your fake stunts,

325
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:53,955
you'd better stop it now!

326
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,999
For those of you who refuse to believe me,

327
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,710
I will show you this.

328
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:01,463
In five seconds,

329
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:06,509
the miniature model
of Babel Tower will explode.

330
00:36:06,593 --> 00:36:08,428
-What?
-What's he talking about?

331
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:11,765
Five!

332
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,185
Four!

333
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:18,688
Three!

334
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:20,690
Two!

335
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:22,734
One!

336
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,468
-Help!
-Open up!

337
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:50,303
-Open the door.
-Open it.

338
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:51,554
-Help!
-Help!

339
00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:53,431
-Open it now!
-Help!

340
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:55,183
-Open the door.
-Open it now.

341
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:08,029
Is he really dead?

342
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:13,201
Remember what I told you?

343
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:14,536
That when it was time,

344
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,498
I would let you throw the hunting dogs
that killed your dad

345
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,501
to the lion's den.

346
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,755
I was going to let you push the button,

347
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:28,466
but I figured I should do it.

348
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,388
I see.

349
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,327
Did you change your mind?

350
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:35,158
No, I didn't.

351
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:40,163
They should pay for what they did.

352
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,120
RESTRICTED NUMBER

353
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:23,748
The bomb in the cake
can wipe out the entire room.

354
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:25,417
-What?
-What's going on?

355
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,668
-What?
-Oh, no.

356
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:28,253
-What should we do?
-Look.

357
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:29,921
-What?
-Open the door now.

358
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,676
What? I didn't get one.

359
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:38,388
-What's this about?
-The bomb…

360
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:39,848
It can wipe out the room!

361
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:41,683
Wait.

362
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:43,226
Sir.

363
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:45,270
I think that's a real bomb.

364
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:54,112
For your information,
I've been recording you from the start.

365
00:40:13,798 --> 00:40:14,924
SEND TEXT MESSAGE

366
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,389
DO AS THE DEAD MAN SAID RIGHT NOW

367
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,726
MESSAGE SENT

368
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:25,977
RESTRICTED NUMBER

369
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,564
Do as the dead man said right now.

370
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,028
Find your agreement,

371
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:38,114
chew it, and swallow it.

372
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:41,201
And after identifying yourself,

373
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:43,703
swear on your knees.

374
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:45,580
-The agreement!
-Where is the agreement?

375
00:40:45,663 --> 00:40:46,748
The agreement…

376
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,092
Spit it out. Gosh, come on!

377
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:00,261
I, the Chief of Sangcheon Police Station

378
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:04,265
-will cut ties with Babel Group.
-Hey. I need my agreement.

379
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:05,683
I swear it to God!

380
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,644
I, Assemblyman Kim Uk-hyeon,

381
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:12,315
will cut ties with Babel Group. I swear.

382
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:18,071
Be quiet!

383
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:20,907
You be quiet!

384
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,492
Do you want us all to die?

385
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,333
I, the head of Sangcheon-gu
district office,

386
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:35,088
swear to cut all ties with Babel Group!

387
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,217
It'll be easy to nullify
the approval of Babel Tower now.

388
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,524
I swear!

389
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:02,073
The timer stopped! It stopped!

390
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:04,284
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

391
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:05,326
Hey.

392
00:42:09,455 --> 00:42:10,957
Good job.

393
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,083
Use your influence

394
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:16,296
to make it seem as
the party today never happened.

395
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,006
You may all leave.

396
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,259
Let's get out.
We must get out of here now!

397
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:26,431
-Let's go.
-I'm leaving now.

398
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:28,349
-Hurry up!
-Move!

399
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:30,560
-Hurry.
-Let's get out of here now.

400
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:32,478
-We should get out now.
-Hurry up.

401
00:42:32,562 --> 00:42:35,273
Sir, this cake… The bomb…

402
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:38,109
I think something bad is going to happen.

403
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,819
Shut up.

404
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:45,575
The timer!

405
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:47,452
The timer is back on.

406
00:42:47,535 --> 00:42:50,371
-The timer.
-Mr. Jang!

407
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:54,500
The timer!

408
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:21,527
Thanks.

409
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:29,077
We won even without moving our bishop.

410
00:43:33,164 --> 00:43:35,458
Getting what we wanted
was easier than I thought.

411
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:38,002
The second party

412
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:41,089
will be much grander
and crazier than this.

413
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:46,928
I'll handle the second party.

414
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:08,574
-He's out.
-That's him, right? Okay.

415
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:12,620
Sir!

416
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:15,748
Hello. Salute.

417
00:44:16,374 --> 00:44:17,417
Mr. Han.

418
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:19,627
What brings you here this early?

419
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,879
I wanted to see you, sir.

420
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:24,048
I hope he's doing well.

421
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:28,928
His approval ratings went up,
so he's in a good mood.

422
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:31,347
Well, you are the kingmaker.

423
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:34,308
He must feel
as if he has an entire army by his side.

424
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:37,520
You came to see me after a long time
just to flatter me?

425
00:44:38,771 --> 00:44:40,815
Seriously. What's this about?

426
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:42,442
Well…

427
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:45,778
would it be possible to meet with him?

428
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:48,322
Why?

429
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:51,117
There's something
I would like to talk to him about.

430
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,453
Why don't we meet after the election?

431
00:44:53,536 --> 00:44:55,663
We can't be too careful
before the election.

432
00:44:57,206 --> 00:44:59,292
It's regarding the Guillotine file.

433
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,174
-Ms. Choi!
-Jeez!

434
00:45:08,134 --> 00:45:09,469
Stay here.

435
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,055
You scared me.

436
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:17,143
You punk.
Where have you been all this time?

437
00:45:17,226 --> 00:45:20,021
I'm sorry.
I should have come to see you sooner.

438
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:24,650
Have you and Hwang-gyu
been working for Vincenzo

439
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:26,110
after betraying me?

440
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:27,653
We were in a bit of a situation.

441
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,864
I'm sorry.

442
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:32,074
Please forgive me.

443
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:34,202
I can't believe this jerk.

444
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,871
How dare you come here
after what you've done?

445
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:39,749
I was out of my mind, ma'am.

446
00:45:39,832 --> 00:45:41,000
Please help me.

447
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,543
You have to help me.

448
00:45:42,627 --> 00:45:44,045
Get up.

449
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:45,838
People are watching. Get up.

450
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:54,138
You and I need to have a very long talk.

451
00:45:55,181 --> 00:45:58,726
If you want to live,
you better tell me everything.

452
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,186
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:04,023
Get in. Let's go get a drink.

454
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,500
-Ms. Hong?
-Where?

455
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,586
Come on.

456
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,719
Darn it.

457
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,100
You come here.

458
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:41,686
You're not good at hockey.

459
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,983
The tip I gave you was useful, right?

460
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,902
You were able to ruin the party
thanks to me.

461
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:52,780
It wasn't bad.

462
00:46:52,863 --> 00:46:55,491
Gosh. Can't you just give me credit
when I deserve it?

463
00:46:56,242 --> 00:46:57,410
What should I do next?

464
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:01,872
There might be a shift
in the power dynamic at Babel.

465
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,624
What change?

466
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,836
Power is bound to shift after a big loss.

467
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,630
When that happens, tell me.

468
00:47:09,714 --> 00:47:10,631
We'll meet here.

469
00:47:11,549 --> 00:47:12,842
Sure. I can do that.

470
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:16,429
Let me ask you one thing.

471
00:47:18,848 --> 00:47:20,641
You won't kill me, right?

472
00:47:26,355 --> 00:47:29,900
I know. I know you won't,
but I just feel anxious for some reason.

473
00:47:30,901 --> 00:47:31,902
As long as you don't

474
00:47:32,862 --> 00:47:33,779
drop honorifics.

475
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,784
I'm not even wearing my helmet.
How could you do that?

476
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:40,745
How could you do that, sir?

477
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:42,288
You scared me, sir.

478
00:47:43,623 --> 00:47:44,707
Have you been studying?

479
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:48,919
My eyes are killing me these days
because I read so many books, sir.

480
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:54,467
Your best source of protection
isn't a gun or a sword.

481
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:58,137
It's your brain. Don't forget that.

482
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,556
Bye.

483
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:03,017
Wait.

484
00:48:03,768 --> 00:48:04,810
Wait.

485
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:20,201
What is it?

486
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:24,538
What?

487
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:28,250
What did you say?

488
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:32,129
Thank you, sir.

489
00:48:35,758 --> 00:48:38,177
You made me realize
what an idiot I had been.

490
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:51,190
Gosh.

491
00:48:54,443 --> 00:48:55,861
Vincenzo.

492
00:48:58,072 --> 00:48:59,198
Thank you.

493
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,094
My gosh. You are hurt badly.

494
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,013
Spare me.

495
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:25,141
What did you say?

496
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:27,977
Spare me.

497
00:49:31,105 --> 00:49:33,190
Do you still think I'm a pushover?

498
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:51,000
Bury him.

499
00:49:56,213 --> 00:49:58,966
GEUMGA PLAZA

500
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:08,893
Now, you should all go out and fight.

501
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:11,061
Can you teach us how?

502
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:14,023
We're not that knowledgeable in that area.

503
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,360
First of all, you must use
your enemy's weaknesses as weapons.

504
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:20,112
You must be brazen.

505
00:50:20,196 --> 00:50:21,697
Forget about manners.

506
00:50:22,948 --> 00:50:25,034
Treat them as if they killed your parents

507
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:27,077
and as if you'd never see them again.

508
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:30,498
Never back down from your demands.

509
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,086
Don't let their social status
intimidate you.

510
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,588
Be strong

511
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,758
and act like you're their equal.

512
00:50:41,258 --> 00:50:42,968
BLUE SKY, SANGCHEON

513
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:54,438
Are you a goat or what,
munching on a piece of paper?

514
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:56,190
Why are you doing this to me?

515
00:50:56,273 --> 00:50:58,317
You know the on-site inspection

516
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,945
for the construction of Babel Tower
had issues, right?

517
00:51:01,654 --> 00:51:02,822
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REEXAMINATION

518
00:51:02,905 --> 00:51:03,948
You should reevaluate.

519
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:05,199
And based on that,

520
00:51:05,282 --> 00:51:07,868
you must reexamine
the approval process as well.

521
00:51:08,452 --> 00:51:11,038
I, the Chief of Sangcheon Police Station

522
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:13,999
-will cut ties with Babel Group.
-It wasn't some speech contest.

523
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:16,043
Didn't your throat bleed afterwards?

524
00:51:16,126 --> 00:51:17,878
What is it that you want?

525
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:19,797
Firstly…

526
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,967
dispatch cops around Geumga Plaza
around the clock

527
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,468
and reinforce security.

528
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:25,678
Secondly…

529
00:51:26,345 --> 00:51:30,224
give the tenants of Geumga Plaza
Courageous Citizen Awards.

530
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:35,646
I won!

531
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,940
He's loving it!

532
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:41,026
What do you want me to do?

533
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:45,865
Nullify all the redevelopment plans
around Geumga Plaza.

534
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:48,534
Get all the bribes you took
from Babel Group

535
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:50,369
and donate it to Geumga Orphanage

536
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:54,832
unless you want to be humiliated.

537
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,710
GO, GO, BABEL TOWER HELPERS

538
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:04,550
"Babel Tower Helpers"?

539
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:07,887
What kind of name is that
for a group of lowlife thugs?

540
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,763
It sounds like a name for a yogurt.

541
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:14,268
You'll end up in a freezer next time,
you assholes.

542
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:20,357
Remember my face.

543
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,568
I'm Geumga-dong's nutria.

544
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,623
What?

545
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:20,834
They say they are reexamining
the approval process.

546
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:22,670
What is Wusang doing now?

547
00:53:23,295 --> 00:53:24,546
Darn it.

548
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,258
I just gave them hell,
so they'll come up with a plan.

549
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,929
-Sit down.
-Okay.

550
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,353
When I was shot in the ear,

551
00:53:40,062 --> 00:53:42,398
the moment you shot me
flashed through my head.

552
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:49,071
Why are you bringing that up?

553
00:53:49,947 --> 00:53:51,782
I'm just saying I'm glad to be alive.

554
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,540
Remember what I told you?

555
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:01,625
It's just us two now.

556
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:03,419
We're brothers.

557
00:54:08,674 --> 00:54:12,177
A long time ago,
your mother asked me for a favor.

558
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:14,805
She asked me to be nice to you

559
00:54:15,431 --> 00:54:17,349
and look after you

560
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:20,561
even if I don't give you anything.

561
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:22,438
She did?

562
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:24,815
Yes.

563
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:27,401
But you're pretty smart now.

564
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,695
I want to give you something.

565
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:31,405
No.

566
00:54:33,615 --> 00:54:34,992
No, sir.

567
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:36,994
I'm happy as it is.

568
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:38,912
Babel Bio.

569
00:54:39,663 --> 00:54:41,123
Take over and launch it.

570
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,376
You wanted to run a subsidiary.

571
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:52,801
Sir, I'm not cut out to do
such an important job.

572
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:56,055
And Babel Bio… Gosh, no.

573
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:58,599
-This makes no sense.
-Try it, you punk.

574
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:01,185
If you do a good job,

575
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:04,271
I'll leave Babel Pharmaceuticals
or Chemicals to you.

576
00:55:06,023 --> 00:55:07,149
If you insist…

577
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:10,235
I will do my best.

578
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:14,823
Come here.

579
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,583
Be an innovative entrepreneur
like Elizabeth Holmes.

580
00:55:27,252 --> 00:55:28,545
I'll back you up.

581
00:55:32,508 --> 00:55:36,261
Yes, sir. I will do my best. Thank you.

582
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:39,556
Do a good job.

583
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:54,446
CANDIDATE 3, PARK SEUNG-JUN

584
00:55:57,741 --> 00:56:00,536
LEADER OF THE NEW ERA, PARK SEUNG-JUN!

585
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,039
I said there's no problem.

586
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:06,125
Yes. Just proceed with that.

587
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,669
God, this jerk.

588
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:12,089
-It's been a while, Mr. Han.
-Hello, sir!

589
00:56:12,714 --> 00:56:15,217
Gosh, "sir"? Don't be so formal.

590
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,929
So Wusang is doing well, right?

591
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:22,599
Gosh, I'm a nobody, but you
even remember my firm. Thank you.

592
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:25,102
-Sit down.
-Okay.

593
00:56:25,185 --> 00:56:29,565
You danced tango by yourself
at the company dinner party.

594
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:31,024
You sang "Dead Drunk," right?

595
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:33,944
How can I forget such a quirky junior?

596
00:56:34,027 --> 00:56:37,197
My gosh. I must have been
out of my mind. I did that again?

597
00:56:37,281 --> 00:56:39,575
Oh, no. I'm so embarrassed.

598
00:56:39,658 --> 00:56:42,703
Anyway, tell me about the Guillotine file.

599
00:56:42,786 --> 00:56:45,038
-What's that about?
-Okay.

600
00:56:46,206 --> 00:56:49,751
It's been a crazy couple of weeks, sir.

601
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,298
Mr. Cassano. Ms. Hong.

602
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:56,592
I analyzed

603
00:56:56,675 --> 00:56:59,720
everything related to Babel
from the Guillotine file.

604
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:03,348
Do you know the keyword
that comes up the most?

605
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:04,892
Bribery or sex scandals?

606
00:57:04,975 --> 00:57:07,269
-Wrong.
-It's got to be real estate.

607
00:57:07,352 --> 00:57:09,354
-How did you know?
-We're in Korea.

608
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:12,399
That's right. To be precise, it's IUDC.

609
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:14,109
"IUDC"?

610
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:15,861
What's IUDC?

611
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:18,614
"Innovative Urban
Development Corporation."

612
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:21,533
They develop and provide real estate
for building new cities.

613
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:22,659
You get it, right?

614
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,495
NAME: PARK SEUNG-JUN
SPECIALTY: REAL-ESTATE

615
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:28,582
As expected, the main industry
of the Korean cartels is real estate.

616
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:30,751
IUDC is involved in every process.

617
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:33,921
Babel and IUDC were already
in on it together.

618
00:57:34,004 --> 00:57:36,507
The insiders and the people
who colluded with them

619
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,134
must've made a fortune
by buying land around Babel Tower.

620
00:57:39,718 --> 00:57:43,555
You know, the forerunner of
the presidential election, Park Seung-jun?

621
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,099
He acquired some land around the plaza

622
00:57:46,183 --> 00:57:48,519
using certain loopholes five years ago.

623
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,522
His brother-in-law is the head of IUDC.

624
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:52,898
-His brother-in-law?
-Yes.

625
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,443
Maybe we shouldn't have opened
the Guillotine file.

626
00:57:56,527 --> 00:57:58,237
It's the root of our frustration.

627
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,280
We keep finding more corruption…

628
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:02,741
when Babel is our only target.

629
00:58:08,956 --> 00:58:10,457
Where are you going?

630
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,211
It's about time
that we deal with our greed.

631
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:16,046
I'll be back.

632
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:20,842
Mr. Cassano. What now?

633
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:28,267
Let me get this straight.

634
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:33,605
The Guillotine File and 1.5 trillion won's
worth of gold bars are buried

635
00:58:33,689 --> 00:58:35,274
underneath the Babel Tower?

636
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:36,525
Yes, sir.

637
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:39,444
And an Italian Mafia lawyer
has control over it?

638
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:40,904
Yes. That's right.

639
00:58:46,034 --> 00:58:48,078
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

640
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:49,955
Is this a plot for a cartoon?

641
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:51,665
Well…

642
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:55,877
it's been confirmed that
his information is somewhat credible.

643
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,256
I see.

644
00:59:00,215 --> 00:59:01,717
Be it politics or life,

645
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:04,845
there's no such thing as too much drama.

646
00:59:04,928 --> 00:59:08,390
All of these matters
are very serious, sir.

647
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:09,850
The Babel Tower…

648
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:12,561
The Guillotine file…

649
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:14,062
Everything…

650
00:59:19,026 --> 00:59:20,819
Every one of them

651
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,992
is like a sword that's aimed at my neck.

652
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,247
Sir.

653
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:36,793
I will be your unbreakable shield.

654
00:59:41,506 --> 00:59:43,258
What should I do

655
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:46,511
to have to use that shield?

656
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:48,639
Sir…

657
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:58,815
I'm sorry to ask you this again,

658
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:01,443
but you have to move.
I'll find you another place.

659
01:00:01,526 --> 01:00:04,154
What is this about now?

660
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,573
You were lucky the other day.

661
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:10,160
If there's another explosion,
it'll be dangerous to stay here.

662
01:00:10,243 --> 01:00:13,330
So I urge you to move as soon as possible.

663
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:16,291
Jeokha and I will follow
the words of Buddha

664
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:18,627
and stay here as we have been.

665
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:26,510
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

666
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:30,263
I've wanted to ask you a question.

667
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:32,516
Go ahead.

668
01:00:44,903 --> 01:00:46,488
NANYAK TEMPLE

669
01:01:01,086 --> 01:01:03,505
Are you sure you'll be able to
build Babel Tower?

670
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:06,425
I heard that they are reexamining it now.

671
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:10,011
From my experience, it will be difficult
to build a tower there

672
01:01:11,054 --> 01:01:12,848
with hiccups like this.

673
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:17,185
The media are already starting
to suspect something is going on.

674
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:18,103
Everyone.

675
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:21,481
It's a minor error with the document.
It's nothing.

676
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:25,569
Wusang will take care of it in a few days.

677
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,865
Why don't we all have a drink now?

678
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:33,410
And it's nothing big,
but check the present I prepared for you.

679
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:35,454
Gosh.

680
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:37,497
Come on, everyone.

681
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:41,668
I'm sure you know how this works. Come on.

682
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:46,757
Those annoying bastards.

683
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,550
Can't we just get rid of them?

684
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:51,553
We cannot lose the people
who were at the meeting today.

685
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,433
Keep reassuring them.

686
01:01:56,516 --> 01:02:00,729
They might not be my bishops,
but they'll make good pawns.

687
01:02:08,153 --> 01:02:12,324
Gosh, you're amazing.
You're making a chess analogy.

688
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:13,492
That's so cool.

689
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:17,662
Where are you?

690
01:02:18,413 --> 01:02:19,956
Everyone left, right?

691
01:02:20,957 --> 01:02:23,502
I'm bringing a guest with me.

692
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:25,170
A guest?

693
01:02:35,138 --> 01:02:38,058
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

694
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:40,101
Hello, sir.

695
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:43,563
I'm Hong Cha-young.

696
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:47,067
Oh, my. I've also heard a lot about you.

697
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:50,612
Hello, sir. Nice to meet you.
I'm the paralegal here.

698
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:52,155
I see. Hi.

699
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,704
Mr. An, we need to talk.

700
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,290
So…

701
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:04,835
Excuse me.

702
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:10,590
You have the Guillotine file?

703
01:03:10,674 --> 01:03:14,177
Ms. Hong, Mr. Nam, you, and I
are the only people who know about it.

704
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:15,220
Don't tell a soul.

705
01:03:15,303 --> 01:03:17,472
Then, we should head over to my agency--

706
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:19,432
No. Not yet.

707
01:03:20,392 --> 01:03:22,102
We have a job to do with this file.

708
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,104
Right.

709
01:03:24,813 --> 01:03:27,023
We can destroy everyone with the file.

710
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:28,567
That's right.

711
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,402
-You trust me, right?
-Totally.

712
01:03:30,485 --> 01:03:34,406
Then, let me use the Guillotine file
the way I see fit.

713
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:36,616
After I'm done, I'll hand it over to you.

714
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,493
I think I know how you'll use it.

715
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:40,453
I trust you, Mr. Consigliere.

716
01:03:40,537 --> 01:03:41,538
Thank you.

717
01:03:43,456 --> 01:03:44,875
But I have a favor to ask.

718
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,835
Go ahead.

719
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:47,752
Hey!

720
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:51,756
So let me get this straight.
The Guillotine file is

721
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,718
locked in the basement of Geumga Plaza?

722
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:58,889
And Vincenzo Cassano is the only person
who can take it out?

723
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:00,891
-Yes.
-You punk.

724
01:04:02,058 --> 01:04:03,643
You have been working

725
01:04:04,352 --> 01:04:06,730
with Vincenzo Cassano for a reason!

726
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,944
I will give you the Guillotine file soon.

727
01:04:13,028 --> 01:04:14,487
-Okay.
-Then, use the file

728
01:04:14,571 --> 01:04:17,741
to beat Directors Kim Hui-won
and Park Jae-beom and become

729
01:04:17,824 --> 01:04:19,242
the president of our agency.

730
01:04:19,326 --> 01:04:20,952
-The president?
-Yes.

731
01:04:25,874 --> 01:04:28,793
Hui-won. Jae-beom.

732
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:36,801
So tell me. What should I do to help?

733
01:04:38,386 --> 01:04:39,471
All right.

734
01:04:39,554 --> 01:04:41,097
The best floors at Babel Tower.

735
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:44,100
I'll start with
the 120th and 121st floors.

736
01:04:46,478 --> 01:04:47,312
What is it?

737
01:04:47,395 --> 01:04:51,024
First, infiltrate Babel Group
and find their dirty laundry.

738
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:54,861
To take out the Guillotine file safely,
we must bring down Babel.

739
01:04:54,945 --> 01:04:56,863
I'm sorry I'm late.

740
01:04:56,947 --> 01:04:58,865
I had an urgent meeting.

741
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:02,202
I'm Director Tae Jong-gu of
the International Organized Crime Bureau

742
01:05:02,285 --> 01:05:03,995
at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

743
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:05,872
And secondly,

744
01:05:05,956 --> 01:05:10,001
make sure no one comes after Mr. Cassano.

745
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:17,217
Well, about Vincenzo Cassano…

746
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:22,639
You should never go after him.

747
01:05:24,015 --> 01:05:26,726
-Pardon?
-He fled to Korea

748
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:29,980
with evidence of corruption
pertaining to not only Italian,

749
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:31,898
but also British and French politicians.

750
01:05:31,982 --> 01:05:34,859
I didn't know he was that important.

751
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:35,944
He is.

752
01:05:36,861 --> 01:05:39,864
He set up a system
that makes the evidence spread

753
01:05:39,948 --> 01:05:42,033
all over the dark web when he dies.

754
01:05:42,617 --> 01:05:45,078
And if an international scandal breaks
because of us,

755
01:05:45,996 --> 01:05:49,541
our government will have to
take responsibility.

756
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,574
They are having a blast.

757
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:24,534
Their cheeks must hurt smiling like that.

758
01:06:24,617 --> 01:06:27,871
Look at that gold toad.
I bet it doesn't even cost much.

759
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:33,126
I wore a spy cam
to the first meeting as well,

760
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:34,794
but it didn't record anything.

761
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:37,130
Gi-seok did a bad job
explaining how to use it.

762
01:06:37,213 --> 01:06:39,090
Mr. Tae confused "on" with "off."

763
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:46,514
Anyway, thanks to you, I think
I might be taking up a bigger position.

764
01:06:48,058 --> 01:06:51,895
Actually, I didn't do much.
He deserves more credit.

765
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:07,202
Hello, sir.

766
01:07:07,285 --> 01:07:09,120
What? Yeong-un?

767
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:12,082
What are you doing here?

768
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:13,416
Well, to answer that,

769
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,877
it'd be a long story.

770
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,462
Right? I knew it.

771
01:07:17,545 --> 01:07:20,882
Mr. Cho here is one of our agents, right?

772
01:07:21,674 --> 01:07:23,718
I knew it. He looked familiar.

773
01:07:24,469 --> 01:07:26,346
You should catch up with your colleagues.

774
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:28,139
Which year did you join?

775
01:07:29,432 --> 01:07:31,518
No. Gi-seok started working
before you did.

776
01:07:32,477 --> 01:07:34,104
-You look so young.
-Attention.

777
01:07:34,729 --> 01:07:35,772
-At ease.
-Gosh.

778
01:07:35,855 --> 01:07:37,524
"Gosh"? Focus.

779
01:07:38,608 --> 01:07:39,609
That's enough.

780
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:42,487
How…

781
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:45,448
That makes no sense, Mr. Kim.

782
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,910
So…

783
01:07:49,536 --> 01:07:53,039
Mr. Han will be the chief prosecutor
of Namdongbu Prosecution Service?

784
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:57,627
And Ms. Choi will just be
the CEO of Wusang?

785
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,504
You might not know this about me,

786
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:03,424
but I was in the Investigative Division
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

787
01:08:04,092 --> 01:08:06,094
You got kicked out
because you always lost!

788
01:08:06,177 --> 01:08:07,053
I did?

789
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:12,016
And about the Italian Mafia lawyer.

790
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:15,019
Don't go after him.

791
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:17,397
He's much bigger than you think.

792
01:08:17,981 --> 01:08:19,649
He's on an international scale.

793
01:08:24,821 --> 01:08:26,531
We just met, but you're quite bossy.

794
01:08:27,824 --> 01:08:29,242
Don't butt in our business.

795
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:34,789
Mr. Park is being generous,
giving you a second chance.

796
01:08:34,873 --> 01:08:36,583
I don't need his generosity.

797
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:41,171
For a boy who poisoned
his own father to death,

798
01:08:41,254 --> 01:08:43,089
you sure talk back a lot.

799
01:08:46,176 --> 01:08:47,385
What?

800
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:48,970
You didn't think I'd know?

801
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:54,726
And one more thing.

802
01:08:54,809 --> 01:08:58,104
I think it'll be better if Han-seok
takes a break for the time being

803
01:08:58,771 --> 01:09:02,650
and Han-seo runs the company again.

804
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:04,110
What?

805
01:09:04,777 --> 01:09:06,779
You mean me?

806
01:09:07,614 --> 01:09:08,615
Sir.

807
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:14,495
I know that this is coming from Mr. Park,

808
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:16,539
but you cannot tell a private company--

809
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:19,626
Choi Myung-hee. Jang Han-seok.

810
01:09:20,418 --> 01:09:22,462
Don't you want a smooth transition

811
01:09:23,254 --> 01:09:25,256
with the new administration?

812
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:32,388
And you, Myung-hee.
If you talk back to me again,

813
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:37,268
I'll take it that you're challenging
a presidential candidate

814
01:09:37,936 --> 01:09:40,188
with an approval rating of 38.7 percent.

815
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:50,073
Congratulations, Chairman Jang.

816
01:09:51,908 --> 01:09:53,701
-One more time.
-Chairman Jang.

817
01:09:57,121 --> 01:09:59,707
Am I really the chairman again?

818
01:10:01,334 --> 01:10:04,170
Do you know how hard I worked
to make this happen?

819
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:06,047
Mr. Han…

820
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,048
No.

821
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:09,634
Seung-hyuk.

822
01:10:10,218 --> 01:10:12,053
Gosh. I'm the Chief Prosecutor now.

823
01:10:12,136 --> 01:10:13,513
Chief Prosecutor Han.

824
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:21,020
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.
I cannot believe this is happening.

825
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:22,689
What was his name?

826
01:10:22,772 --> 01:10:23,606
Jang Joon-woo?

827
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,775
-Vincenzo.
-Vincenzo.

828
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:29,070
The Interpol will come to arrest him
within 24 hours.

829
01:10:31,322 --> 01:10:32,448
The Interpol?

830
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:34,409
-The International police.
-I know that.

831
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:35,493
Right.

832
01:10:36,619 --> 01:10:37,829
You know…

833
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:42,000
I called the boss of the Cassano Family
and set a trap.

834
01:10:43,668 --> 01:10:47,005
I asked him to find a crime
that we could frame Vincenzo with.

835
01:10:47,088 --> 01:10:49,382
And I reported it to the Interpol.

836
01:10:54,554 --> 01:10:55,638
Gosh.

837
01:10:57,098 --> 01:10:58,016
Stop it.

838
01:10:58,099 --> 01:11:00,059
Why didn't I think of that?

839
01:11:00,143 --> 01:11:04,314
Let's get rid of the person who is
most likely to obtain the Guillotine file.

840
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:08,568
And you, my dear chairman,
will demolish Geumga Plaza

841
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:10,778
and obtain the Guillotine file.

842
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:14,407
But what if Vincenzo comes back
after some time?

843
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:17,618
No. Gosh. That's impossible.

844
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:22,582
Now, you can just focus on leading Babel.

845
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:26,502
I, the chief prosecutor,
will back you up on other things.

846
01:11:29,088 --> 01:11:30,214
Jang Han-seok…

847
01:11:41,184 --> 01:11:43,686
Let's see

848
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,731
Who comes out on top

849
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:18,888
INAUGURATION OF CHIEF PROSECUTOR
HAN SEUNG-HYUK

850
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:31,192
Please say a few words
as the new chief prosecutor.

851
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:35,780
I am infinitely honored to have the chance
to serve the people of our country.

852
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:40,535
As the guardian of the Constitution
and democracy,

853
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:44,372
I will dedicate my life
so that the principle of justice

854
01:12:44,872 --> 01:12:47,208
can be the driving force
of our legal system.

855
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:50,086
How do you plan to clear up
suspicion about

856
01:12:50,169 --> 01:12:52,130
-colluding with Babel?
-Just like that?

857
01:12:52,213 --> 01:12:54,507
How did he become
the chief prosecutor overnight?

858
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:57,510
Jang Han-seok doesn't have
enough influence to make that happen.

859
01:12:57,593 --> 01:12:59,679
They must've used someone much higher up

860
01:13:00,263 --> 01:13:01,806
to ward off our attacks.

861
01:13:01,889 --> 01:13:03,975
-Yes. I am
-Then, could it be…

862
01:13:04,058 --> 01:13:07,395
well-aware of the public's mistrust
and concerns.

863
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:11,232
Then why didn't Jang Han-seo
report this to us? This is huge.

864
01:13:11,315 --> 01:13:13,276
Right. He's slacking off already.

865
01:13:16,487 --> 01:13:17,947
He's not slacking off just yet.

866
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:23,870
Go ahead.

867
01:13:23,953 --> 01:13:26,080
We need to talk. It's urgent.

868
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:31,461
They're being led to area A.

869
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:48,686
POLICE

870
01:14:13,085 --> 01:14:14,504
What do you need to discuss?

871
01:14:21,427 --> 01:14:22,595
This is driving me crazy.

872
01:14:57,004 --> 01:14:58,047
You see…

873
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,008
Something's been bothering me.

874
01:15:05,763 --> 01:15:07,014
What is it? Tell me.

875
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:18,109
I wish I didn't have to make
so many choices in life.

876
01:15:28,286 --> 01:15:29,829
It's been fun.

877
01:15:31,789 --> 01:15:33,082
But this is…

878
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:40,256
where our fun ends.

879
01:16:11,746 --> 01:16:13,247
You're just like your brother.

880
01:16:14,165 --> 01:16:15,958
I didn't expect much from you anyway.

881
01:16:17,752 --> 01:16:19,003
A gun?

882
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,923
Don't shoot. I have a gun, too.

883
01:16:23,507 --> 01:16:24,759
Your betrayal means

884
01:16:26,677 --> 01:16:28,512
that you've accomplished your goal.

885
01:16:33,643 --> 01:16:36,979
If either of us starts shooting,
we might both die.

886
01:16:37,063 --> 01:16:39,899
So let's both lower our guns. Okay?

887
01:16:40,483 --> 01:16:42,068
I don't plan on doing that.

888
01:16:42,985 --> 01:16:46,155
Actually, my gun isn't loaded. It's empty.

889
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:48,074
I see.

890
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:50,368
Shoot your head first then.

891
01:16:50,451 --> 01:16:52,745
No. I said it's empty.

892
01:16:53,412 --> 01:16:56,040
I'm pointing it at you to scare you.

893
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:02,046
Shoot first.

894
01:17:12,181 --> 01:17:13,557
Vincenzo Cassano.
