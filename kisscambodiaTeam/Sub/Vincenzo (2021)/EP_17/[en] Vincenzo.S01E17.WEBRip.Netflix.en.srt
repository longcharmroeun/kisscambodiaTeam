1
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:19,243
Who is that?

2
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,913
Help me.

3
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:21,574
Killing my mother

4
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:26,037
wasn't just evil. It was utterly foolish.

5
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:32,793
I knew that you killed countless people
and even tried to kill me.

6
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,465
But do you know why I didn't kill you?

7
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,514
Because it was a hassle.

8
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:55,107
I had a job to do.

9
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,319
So if I'd killed you,

10
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,030
it would've inconvenienced me a lot.

11
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:06,702
Killing these small flies wouldn't,
though.

12
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:11,999
Anyway…

13
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,378
You have to die now.

14
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,923
-No. Please.
-Why? No.

15
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,303
Don't be scared.

16
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,514
It won't be today.

17
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,314
You see, I've got a principle.

18
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:41,320
"A painless death is a blessing."

19
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:48,577
I will give you two things.

20
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,832
A humiliation worse than death,

21
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,583
and…

22
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,213
a slow death, where you'll experience it

23
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,801
every step of the way.

24
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,983
You can take care of that garbage.

25
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,986
And don't even think about
pinning it on me.

26
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,155
If you do, people will find out…

27
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,325
who put him up to it.

28
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,559
I should give you a preview.

29
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,209
Mr. Jang!

30
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,169
Mr. Jang!

31
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,463
-Mr. Jang!
-Sir!

32
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,091
Oh, no. Call 911.

33
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,550
-Call 911.
-Call an ambulance.

34
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,480
We will take her now.

35
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,157
Wait.

36
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:10,923
Mom.

37
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:19,557
Mom.

38
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,666
Mom.

39
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:57,886
Mom!

40
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:30,521
DECEASED, OH GYEONG-JA

41
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:47,329
EPISODE 17

42
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,123
Her son came back after 30 years,

43
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,003
but what came out of it was her death.

44
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,301
If I hadn't shown up,

45
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,472
she would have lived longer.

46
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:13,772
In the end, I'm living in hell.

47
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,152
The hell that is regret.

48
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:21,655
No.

49
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:24,700
It was brief,

50
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:30,789
but you gave your mother
eternal happiness.

51
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,087
And your mother did
the same for you as well.

52
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:42,176
Once you're done hurting, you'll know.

53
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,804
But what pains me the most…

54
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,684
is that I already miss her.

55
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:54,813
I miss my mother.

56
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,081
Ms. Hong.

57
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,167
Once I'm gone,

58
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:03,590
please give this scarf
to my son, Ju-hyeong, for me.

59
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:09,638
The only thing
this foolish mother could give my poor son

60
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:15,310
is this simple scarf,
which is quite embarrassing.

61
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,272
And…

62
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:22,067
please tell him this for me.

63
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,237
"Ju-hyeong,

64
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,532
you were a blessing

65
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,993
and happiness to me.

66
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:36,331
You were the reason
why I carried on living.

67
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,838
Ever since the moment
I could feel your movement in my stomach,

68
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,216
there hasn't been

69
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:51,346
a single second that I did not love you.

70
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:54,725
I'm sorry

71
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,812
that I couldn't show you
how much I love you

72
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,024
by your side.

73
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,028
My baby…

74
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,114
My Ju-hyeong…

75
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:11,950
I love you.

76
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,870
I love you to pieces.

77
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:20,167
I'm grateful that you're my son,

78
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,753
and I'm sorry for everything."

79
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,050
Please take good care of Ju-hyeong.

80
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,802
Thank you.

81
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,531
Go and get my doctor right now.

82
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,075
Right now!

83
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,253
Get me discharged now.

84
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,882
That will take a while to heal.
You should stay here for now.

85
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:14,846
Ms. Choi.

86
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,599
Go and kill Vincenzo right now.

87
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,560
I don't care if you have to hire
100 or 200 men.

88
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:22,354
Kill him by any means necessary.

89
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,398
I don't care how much it costs.

90
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:25,899
Okay?

91
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,777
Please calm down.
Treating your wound takes priority.

92
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,612
I told you I don't need treatments!

93
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,618
You don't have to tell me.
I will make sure to kill Vincenzo.

94
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,289
But right now, you must think
about Babel first.

95
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:52,509
Okay…

96
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,053
but don't just kill him.

97
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:00,017
We'll make him suffer
like he plans to do with us.

98
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,643
Of course.

99
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:38,722
Ju-hyeong.

100
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,808
Ju-hyeong.

101
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:24,202
Why don't we just kill Jang Han-seok
and Choi Myung-hee and call it a day?

102
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:27,247
This isn't for revenge.
I'm playing a game of chess.

103
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:30,584
I'm going to move my pawn today.

104
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,547
All right, then.
Everything is almost ready.

105
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,803

112
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:35,357
Mr. Cassano.

113
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:11,142
We're closing our businesses
for the time being.

114
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:14,688
We want to help you bring down Babel
in earnest.

115
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:18,733
We want us to work together
as a team from now on.

116
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:20,568
To tell you the truth,

117
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,488
I can be quite scary when I'm angry.

118
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:24,948
I'll help, too.

119
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,826
The whole plaza decided to help you,

120
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:30,287
so please let us.

121
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,374
We'll be on standby.
Let us know if you need anything.

122
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:38,378
I'm still in my first trimester,
so I can move around without a problem.

123
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,379
I can help too.

124
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:41,881
You know that I used to work in the field.

125
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:43,508
Use me whenever you want.

126
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,553
All this time,

127
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:49,681
we thought we were weak.

128
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,225
But we weren't weak.

129
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,229
We just didn't try to be strong.

130
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,567
We're going to give it our all now.

131
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,281
Let us fight with you.

132
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:08,992
Mr. Cassano.

133
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:11,286
We are all

134
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,997
a part of the Cassano Family.

135
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:55,872
Vincenzo Cassano!

136
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,668
Vincenzo Cassano!

137
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,310
Why don't you rest at home today?
We'll take care of things.

138
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:20,563
I should be there.
It's the last day of feeding.

139
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:34,452
It's just a few locals from Sangcheon-gu.
You don't have to go.

140
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:37,956
Right. We will take care of
the agreements ourselves.

141
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,415
Why are you so chatty today?

142
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:40,750
I said I'm going.

143
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,462
Right. I told you he was coming.

144
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,262
Did your mom's funeral go well?

145
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,557
It's Vincenzo.

146
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,892
Yes, thanks to you.

147
00:22:58,726 --> 00:22:59,853
Is your hearing okay?

148
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:02,647
Yes, thanks to your excellent aim.

149
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:05,024
By the way,

150
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:08,736
am I going to die today?

151
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,323
There's one more step before that.

152
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,409
I don't remember.

153
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,706
I shot your ear,
but your brain must have been damaged.

154
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:22,625
A humiliation worse than death.

155
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,754
To give you that, I'm playing a game
of chess with you starting today.

156
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,259
And I'll get rid of your pieces
one by one.

157
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,097
Imagine being left all alone
on the chessboard.

158
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:41,019
Isn't that embarrassing and scary?

159
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:43,188
No.

160
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,190
I don't plan on losing in this chess game.

161
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,526
Unfortunately, you already started losing.

162
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:56,326
Defeat begins

163
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,162
with one's fear.

164
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,710
Sir, what did Vincenzo say?

165
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,338
Go and ship the miniature.

166
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,049
Okay.

167
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:18,556
I doubt he just called to say hello.

168
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,268
Right. What if there's another trap?

169
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:23,978
Gosh. No.

170
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,273
No way. He can't be setting traps
all the time.

171
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:28,733
-Come on.
-Right.

172
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,402
What did I do to this valuable thing?

173
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:33,821
Ms. Choi, help us move…

174
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,989
Gosh.

175
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,869
-How can we move it?
-We should push it.

176
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,413
-Unplug it first.
-Unplug it?

177
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:24,998
We wouldn't be
that much help to him anyway.

178
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,666
That doesn't matter.

179
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,544
It's fine as long as he knows
how serious we are.

180
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:33,089
Let's think about
how else we can help him.

181
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:38,761
What's wrong?

182
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,433
What's with the credit card?

183
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:47,061
Mr. Cassano gave us his credit card
for the well-being of the family.

184
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,730
"Family"?

185
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,566
Let's go to a department store.

186
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:52,692
What for?

187
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:57,196
To buy a team uniform
for the Cassano Family.

188
00:26:47,497 --> 00:26:48,706
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REPORT

189
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,500
BABEL TOWER PROJECT PROGRESS

190
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:58,007
The approval process for Babel Tower
is ridiculous no matter how I look at it.

191
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,511
It's not just ridiculous.

192
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,472
It's nothing more than a doodle on a wall.

193
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,977
Once Mr. Nam is done
looking over the Guillotine file,

194
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,687
we'll find more ridiculous stuff.

195
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:13,940
Since we'll be bringing the tower down,

196
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,860
it'll be much better
to bury more trash under it.

197
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,571
Hello, everyone.

198
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:04,198
-Hello. See you soon.
-Hello.

199
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,533
Sir. Yes.

200
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:07,493
Let's see.

201
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:13,166
Secretaries can stay
in the waiting area downstairs.

202
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,125
What's this?

203
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,752
Only the VIPs can enter.

204
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,795
We weren't informed.

205
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,130
-Let's call them.
-Come on.

206
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,425
-This is ridiculous.
-Let's go downstairs for now.

207
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:23,968
-Please step aside.
-Step aside.

208
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:35,229
CONGRATULATIONS ON MOVING IN,
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

209
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,907
Everyone, stay calm and man your posts.

210
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,283
Don't let anyone in.

211
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,161
Yes, Mr. Consigliere.

212
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:54,457
You cannot go here.

213
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,459
-Please go down.
-We're sorry.

214
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,053
All right.

215
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:10,014
Hello, my dear guests from Sangcheon-gu.

216
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,475
We appreciate your patience.

217
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:16,771
I will be the host of today's event.

218
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,899
I am Babel's helper,
Vice Chairman Jang Han-seo.

219
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,947
Finally, today…

220
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:30,993
we'll be giving out the present
we've promised you.

221
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:32,703
It's…

222
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:37,083
your chance to win units at our tower!

223
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,632
That's right.

224
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,218
All right. Sir.

225
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,060
I'm Jang Han-seok.

226
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:58,896
For Babel Tower to be built,

227
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,774
the help
from the head of our district office,

228
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,069
-the police chief,
-Yes.

229
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:07,697
Assemblyman Kim…

230
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:09,866
I'm Kim Uk-hyeon.

231
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:14,912
…and other VIP guests from Sangcheon-gu
were absolutely necessary.

232
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:18,791
And of course,
Babel ought to return the favor.

233
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,502
-Enjoy yourselves tonight.
-I forgot to ask.

234
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,588
-I hope you win a unit.
-Will we get a lot?

235
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,256
-Shut up.
-Congratulations.

236
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:31,095
All right. Let the party begin now!

237
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,044
This is for the 92nd floor of Building A.

238
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:05,129
And the floor goes to…

239
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,925
Congratulations, Mr. Kim Uk-hyeon.

240
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,302
-I did it!
-Gosh.

241
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:13,971
I won!

242
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:16,182
-Gosh.
-He's loving it.

243
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,934
These men are unbelievable.

244
00:31:18,017 --> 00:31:20,186
-Don't be so disappointed.
-They're shameless.

245
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:23,648
-It's the penthouse at Building B.
-How could they be so shameless?

246
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,776
People can't control their greed.

247
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,694
-Only thing bigger than greed…
-It overlooks Han River,

248
00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:30,488
-a park, and the city.
-is just bigger greed.

249
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:32,406
It has the perfect view.

250
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,908
Yes, Ms. District Chief.

251
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:36,869
Tax exemption on construction!

252
00:31:36,953 --> 00:31:39,080
Tax exemption on construction? My gosh!

253
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,207
-Police Chief.
-I'll dispatch more men

254
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,335
-when you demolish the plaza.
-More cops for demolition!

255
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,253
That's pretty big. Anyone else?

256
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,380
Ms. District Chief.

257
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:51,717
All the private businesses
related to Sangcheon-gu

258
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:54,428
will have to do business with Babel Group.

259
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,014
-Sold! Yes!
-I won?

260
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,395
The penthouse goes to the District Chief!

261
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:04,897
-This way. My gosh.
-Goodness.

262
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:07,525
Good for you. I'm so jealous.

263
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:11,696
Hold on. How may I help you?

264
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:24,000
All right. He's the last winner
of today's event.

265
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,251
It's the 52nd floor.

266
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,671
Congratulations, Mr. Ham Seung-un.

267
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,591
Congratulations.

268
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,511
You seem so happy.

269
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:39,098
We have given out all the units now.

270
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:43,185
We will now cut the cake
to celebrate our event today.

271
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,062
District Chief, Mr. Kim,

272
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:47,940
and the police chief,
please come forward now.

273
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:51,318
Who's that?

274
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:04,457
What is it?

275
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,584
You can't come in here.

276
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:09,211
Hey!

277
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:11,964
-Hey, you…
-Who is that?

278
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:13,090
What's going on?

279
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,551
This is a bomb!

280
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:18,304
A bomb?

281
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,347
I'm being threatened now.

282
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:25,019
Ms. Choi, you must help me.

283
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:28,230
-Do you know him?
-No.

284
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:29,774
I don't know him.

285
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,901
How dare you!

286
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:34,653
If you scream

287
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:37,031
or try to run away,

288
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:39,241
this bomb will go off.

289
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:42,661
-Everyone, don't move.
-Wait!

290
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:45,372
Who the heck put you up to this?

291
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,665
I don't know, either.

292
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:49,376
I was abducted and have been getting
instructions via text.

293
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:51,003
And…

294
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,928
What's that?

295
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:03,057
-What?
-What is that?

296
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:06,602
There's a bomb here.

297
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:11,065
-That must be the bomb.
-My gosh.

298
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:12,691
I'm just doing as instructed.

299
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:16,028
You must do as I tell you to from now on

300
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:17,738
if you want to stop this bomb.

301
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,127
That's a nice start.

302
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:47,226
He's ready.

303
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,729
Make them believe that it's a real bomb.

304
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:51,939
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

305
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,943
After this,

306
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:57,695
you guys will be free.

307
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,113
Yes, sir.

308
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,615
Make Choi Myung-hee pay
for humiliating you guys

309
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,325
when you worked for her.

310
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:06,954
Oh, right. After the party,
I'll pay you right away.

311
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:09,290
Leave Korea by the end of today.

312
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,087
Everyone here

313
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,924
must annul the agreement you signed
with the Babel Group

314
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:21,844
and cut all ties
with Chairman Jang Han-seok.

315
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:23,512
Swear it on your knees.

316
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:26,056
What? We have to kneel?

317
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:28,809
Vincenzo?

318
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,522
Hey, you! You are trying
to fool us, aren't you?

319
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,232
There's no bomb! This is Korea!

320
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:37,234
Now! The bomb can go off any minute.

321
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,362
Something looks off.

322
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:43,616
Right. Yes. That's right. That looks fake.

323
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:46,118
I think they're just portable chargers.

324
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:47,995
If this is one of your fake stunts,

325
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,955
you'd better stop it now!

326
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:51,999
For those of you who refuse to believe me,

327
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,710
I will show you this.

328
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:57,463
In five seconds,

329
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:02,509
the miniature model
of Babel Tower will explode.

330
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,428
-What?
-What's he talking about?

331
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:07,765
Five!

332
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,185
Four!

333
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,688
Three!

334
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:16,690
Two!

335
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:18,734
One!

336
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,468
-Help!
-Open up!

337
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,303
-Open the door.
-Open it.

338
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,554
-Help!
-Help!

339
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,431
-Open it now!
-Help!

340
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:51,183
-Open the door.
-Open it now.

341
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,029
Is he really dead?

342
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:09,201
Remember what I told you?

343
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:10,536
That when it was time,

344
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,498
I would let you throw the hunting dogs
that killed your dad

345
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,501
to the lion's den.

346
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,755
I was going to let you push the button,

347
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,466
but I figured I should do it.

348
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:29,388
I see.

349
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,327
Did you change your mind?

350
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:31,158
No, I didn't.

351
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:36,163
They should pay for what they did.

352
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:16,120
RESTRICTED NUMBER

353
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:19,748
The bomb in the cake
can wipe out the entire room.

354
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:21,417
-What?
-What's going on?

355
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,668
-What?
-Oh, no.

356
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,253
-What should we do?
-Look.

357
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:25,921
-What?
-Open the door now.

358
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:30,676
What? I didn't get one.

359
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:34,388
-What's this about?
-The bomb…

360
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:35,848
It can wipe out the room!

361
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:37,683
Wait.

362
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,226
Sir.

363
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,270
I think that's a real bomb.

364
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,112
For your information,
I've been recording you from the start.

365
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:10,924
SEND TEXT MESSAGE

366
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:17,389
DO AS THE DEAD MAN SAID RIGHT NOW

367
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,726
MESSAGE SENT

368
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:21,977
RESTRICTED NUMBER

369
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,564
Do as the dead man said right now.

370
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:31,028
Find your agreement,

371
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,114
chew it, and swallow it.

372
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:37,201
And after identifying yourself,

373
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:39,703
swear on your knees.

374
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:41,580
-The agreement!
-Where is the agreement?

375
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:42,748
The agreement…

376
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:54,092
Spit it out. Gosh, come on!

377
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:56,261
I, the Chief of Sangcheon Police Station

378
00:40:56,345 --> 00:41:00,265
-will cut ties with Babel Group.
-Hey. I need my agreement.

379
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:01,683
I swear it to God!

380
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:03,644
I, Assemblyman Kim Uk-hyeon,

381
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:08,315
will cut ties with Babel Group. I swear.

382
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:14,071
Be quiet!

383
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,907
You be quiet!

384
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,492
Do you want us all to die?

385
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:26,333
I, the head of Sangcheon-gu
district office,

386
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:31,088
swear to cut all ties with Babel Group!

387
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:35,217
It'll be easy to nullify
the approval of Babel Tower now.

388
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,524
I swear!

389
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:58,073
The timer stopped! It stopped!

390
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,284
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

391
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:01,326
Hey.

392
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:06,957
Good job.

393
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,083
Use your influence

394
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:12,296
to make it seem as
the party today never happened.

395
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,006
You may all leave.

396
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:17,259
Let's get out.
We must get out of here now!

397
00:42:19,678 --> 00:42:22,431
-Let's go.
-I'm leaving now.

398
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:24,349
-Hurry up!
-Move!

399
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:26,560
-Hurry.
-Let's get out of here now.

400
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:28,478
-We should get out now.
-Hurry up.

401
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:31,273
Sir, this cake… The bomb…

402
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:34,109
I think something bad is going to happen.

403
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:35,819
Shut up.

404
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,575
The timer!

405
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:43,452
The timer is back on.

406
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:46,371
-The timer.
-Mr. Jang!

407
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:50,500
The timer!

408
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:17,527
Thanks.

409
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:25,077
We won even without moving our bishop.

410
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:31,458
Getting what we wanted
was easier than I thought.

411
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,002
The second party

412
00:43:34,086 --> 00:43:37,089
will be much grander
and crazier than this.

413
00:43:40,258 --> 00:43:42,928
I'll handle the second party.

414
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:04,574
-He's out.
-That's him, right? Okay.

415
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:08,620
Sir!

416
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:11,748
Hello. Salute.

417
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:13,417
Mr. Han.

418
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:15,627
What brings you here this early?

419
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,879
I wanted to see you, sir.

420
00:44:17,963 --> 00:44:20,048
I hope he's doing well.

421
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,928
His approval ratings went up,
so he's in a good mood.

422
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:27,347
Well, you are the kingmaker.

423
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,308
He must feel
as if he has an entire army by his side.

424
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:33,520
You came to see me after a long time
just to flatter me?

425
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,815
Seriously. What's this about?

426
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:38,442
Well…

427
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:41,778
would it be possible to meet with him?

428
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:44,322
Why?

429
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:47,117
There's something
I would like to talk to him about.

430
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,453
Why don't we meet after the election?

431
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:51,663
We can't be too careful
before the election.

432
00:44:53,206 --> 00:44:55,292
It's regarding the Guillotine file.

433
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,174
-Ms. Choi!
-Jeez!

434
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,469
Stay here.

435
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,055
You scared me.

436
00:45:10,223 --> 00:45:13,143
You punk.
Where have you been all this time?

437
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:16,021
I'm sorry.
I should have come to see you sooner.

438
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:20,650
Have you and Hwang-gyu
been working for Vincenzo

439
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,110
after betraying me?

440
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:23,653
We were in a bit of a situation.

441
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,864
I'm sorry.

442
00:45:26,865 --> 00:45:28,074
Please forgive me.

443
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,202
I can't believe this jerk.

444
00:45:30,285 --> 00:45:32,871
How dare you come here
after what you've done?

445
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:35,749
I was out of my mind, ma'am.

446
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:37,000
Please help me.

447
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,543
You have to help me.

448
00:45:38,627 --> 00:45:40,045
Get up.

449
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:41,838
People are watching. Get up.

450
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:50,138
You and I need to have a very long talk.

451
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,726
If you want to live,
you better tell me everything.

452
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:56,186
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:00,023
Get in. Let's go get a drink.

454
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,500
-Ms. Hong?
-Where?

455
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,586
Come on.

456
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,719
Darn it.

457
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,100
You come here.

458
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:37,686
You're not good at hockey.

459
00:46:41,106 --> 00:46:42,983
The tip I gave you was useful, right?

460
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,902
You were able to ruin the party
thanks to me.

461
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:48,780
It wasn't bad.

462
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:51,491
Gosh. Can't you just give me credit
when I deserve it?

463
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,410
What should I do next?

464
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:57,872
There might be a shift
in the power dynamic at Babel.

465
00:46:58,456 --> 00:46:59,624
What change?

466
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,836
Power is bound to shift after a big loss.

467
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,630
When that happens, tell me.

468
00:47:05,714 --> 00:47:06,631
We'll meet here.

469
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:08,842
Sure. I can do that.

470
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:12,429
Let me ask you one thing.

471
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:16,641
You won't kill me, right?

472
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:25,900
I know. I know you won't,
but I just feel anxious for some reason.

473
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:27,902
As long as you don't

474
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:29,779
drop honorifics.

475
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,784
I'm not even wearing my helmet.
How could you do that?

476
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:36,745
How could you do that, sir?

477
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:38,288
You scared me, sir.

478
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,707
Have you been studying?

479
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:44,919
My eyes are killing me these days
because I read so many books, sir.

480
00:47:48,006 --> 00:47:50,467
Your best source of protection
isn't a gun or a sword.

481
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:54,137
It's your brain. Don't forget that.

482
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,556
Bye.

483
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,017
Wait.

484
00:47:59,768 --> 00:48:00,810
Wait.

485
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:16,201
What is it?

486
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:20,538
What?

487
00:48:22,624 --> 00:48:24,250
What did you say?

488
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,129
Thank you, sir.

489
00:48:31,758 --> 00:48:34,177
You made me realize
what an idiot I had been.

490
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,190
Gosh.

491
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:51,861
Vincenzo.

492
00:48:54,072 --> 00:48:55,198
Thank you.

493
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,094
My gosh. You are hurt badly.

494
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,013
Spare me.

495
00:49:19,848 --> 00:49:21,141
What did you say?

496
00:49:22,058 --> 00:49:23,977
Spare me.

497
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:29,190
Do you still think I'm a pushover?

498
00:49:45,665 --> 00:49:47,000
Bury him.

499
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:54,966
GEUMGA PLAZA

500
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,893
Now, you should all go out and fight.

501
00:50:05,727 --> 00:50:07,061
Can you teach us how?

502
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:10,023
We're not that knowledgeable in that area.

503
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,360
First of all, you must use
your enemy's weaknesses as weapons.

504
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,112
You must be brazen.

505
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,697
Forget about manners.

506
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:21,034
Treat them as if they killed your parents

507
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:23,077
and as if you'd never see them again.

508
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:26,498
Never back down from your demands.

509
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:32,086
Don't let their social status
intimidate you.

510
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,588
Be strong

511
00:50:34,923 --> 00:50:36,758
and act like you're their equal.

512
00:50:37,258 --> 00:50:38,968
BLUE SKY, SANGCHEON

513
00:50:47,268 --> 00:50:50,438
Are you a goat or what,
munching on a piece of paper?

514
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:52,190
Why are you doing this to me?

515
00:50:52,273 --> 00:50:54,317
You know the on-site inspection

516
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,945
for the construction of Babel Tower
had issues, right?

517
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:58,822
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT REEXAMINATION

518
00:50:58,905 --> 00:50:59,948
You should reevaluate.

519
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:01,199
And based on that,

520
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:03,868
you must reexamine
the approval process as well.

521
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:07,038
I, the Chief of Sangcheon Police Station

522
00:51:07,121 --> 00:51:09,999
-will cut ties with Babel Group.
-It wasn't some speech contest.

523
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:12,043
Didn't your throat bleed afterwards?

524
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:13,878
What is it that you want?

525
00:51:14,796 --> 00:51:15,797
Firstly…

526
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,967
dispatch cops around Geumga Plaza
around the clock

527
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,468
and reinforce security.

528
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:21,678
Secondly…

529
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:26,224
give the tenants of Geumga Plaza
Courageous Citizen Awards.

530
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:31,646
I won!

531
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:33,940
He's loving it!

532
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,026
What do you want me to do?

533
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,865
Nullify all the redevelopment plans
around Geumga Plaza.

534
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:44,534
Get all the bribes you took
from Babel Group

535
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:46,369
and donate it to Geumga Orphanage

536
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,832
unless you want to be humiliated.

537
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,710
GO, GO, BABEL TOWER HELPERS

538
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:00,550
"Babel Tower Helpers"?

539
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:03,887
What kind of name is that
for a group of lowlife thugs?

540
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,763
It sounds like a name for a yogurt.

541
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:10,268
You'll end up in a freezer next time,
you assholes.

542
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:16,357
Remember my face.

543
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,568
I'm Geumga-dong's nutria.

544
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,623
What?

545
00:53:13,706 --> 00:53:16,834
They say they are reexamining
the approval process.

546
00:53:16,918 --> 00:53:18,670
What is Wusang doing now?

547
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:20,546
Darn it.

548
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,258
I just gave them hell,
so they'll come up with a plan.

549
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,929
-Sit down.
-Okay.

550
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,353
When I was shot in the ear,

551
00:53:36,062 --> 00:53:38,398
the moment you shot me
flashed through my head.

552
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:45,071
Why are you bringing that up?

553
00:53:45,947 --> 00:53:47,782
I'm just saying I'm glad to be alive.

554
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,540
Remember what I told you?

555
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:57,625
It's just us two now.

556
00:53:58,209 --> 00:53:59,419
We're brothers.

557
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,177
A long time ago,
your mother asked me for a favor.

558
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:10,805
She asked me to be nice to you

559
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:13,349
and look after you

560
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,561
even if I don't give you anything.

561
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:18,438
She did?

562
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:20,815
Yes.

563
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:23,401
But you're pretty smart now.

564
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,695
I want to give you something.

565
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,405
No.

566
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:30,992
No, sir.

567
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:32,994
I'm happy as it is.

568
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:34,912
Babel Bio.

569
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,123
Take over and launch it.

570
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,376
You wanted to run a subsidiary.

571
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:48,801
Sir, I'm not cut out to do
such an important job.

572
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,055
And Babel Bio… Gosh, no.

573
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:54,599
-This makes no sense.
-Try it, you punk.

574
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:57,185
If you do a good job,

575
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:00,271
I'll leave Babel Pharmaceuticals
or Chemicals to you.

576
00:55:02,023 --> 00:55:03,149
If you insist…

577
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:06,235
I will do my best.

578
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:10,823
Come here.

579
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,583
Be an innovative entrepreneur
like Elizabeth Holmes.

580
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,545
I'll back you up.

581
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:32,261
Yes, sir. I will do my best. Thank you.

582
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:35,556
Do a good job.

583
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:50,446
CANDIDATE 3, PARK SEUNG-JUN

584
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:56,536
LEADER OF THE NEW ERA, PARK SEUNG-JUN!

585
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:00,039
I said there's no problem.

586
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,125
Yes. Just proceed with that.

587
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:04,669
God, this jerk.

588
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:08,089
-It's been a while, Mr. Han.
-Hello, sir!

589
00:56:08,714 --> 00:56:11,217
Gosh, "sir"? Don't be so formal.

590
00:56:12,677 --> 00:56:14,929
So Wusang is doing well, right?

591
00:56:15,513 --> 00:56:18,599
Gosh, I'm a nobody, but you
even remember my firm. Thank you.

592
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:21,102
-Sit down.
-Okay.

593
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:25,565
You danced tango by yourself
at the company dinner party.

594
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,024
You sang "Dead Drunk," right?

595
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,944
How can I forget such a quirky junior?

596
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:33,197
My gosh. I must have been
out of my mind. I did that again?

597
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:35,575
Oh, no. I'm so embarrassed.

598
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:38,703
Anyway, tell me about the Guillotine file.

599
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:41,038
-What's that about?
-Okay.

600
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:45,751
It's been a crazy couple of weeks, sir.

601
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,298
Mr. Cassano. Ms. Hong.

602
00:56:50,923 --> 00:56:52,592
I analyzed

603
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,720
everything related to Babel
from the Guillotine file.

604
00:56:55,803 --> 00:56:59,348
Do you know the keyword
that comes up the most?

605
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:00,892
Bribery or sex scandals?

606
00:57:00,975 --> 00:57:03,269
-Wrong.
-It's got to be real estate.

607
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:05,354
-How did you know?
-We're in Korea.

608
00:57:05,438 --> 00:57:08,399
That's right. To be precise, it's IUDC.

609
00:57:08,983 --> 00:57:10,109
"IUDC"?

610
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:11,861
What's IUDC?

611
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,614
"Innovative Urban
Development Corporation."

612
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,533
They develop and provide real estate
for building new cities.

613
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:18,659
You get it, right?

614
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:20,495
NAME: PARK SEUNG-JUN
SPECIALTY: REAL-ESTATE

615
00:57:20,578 --> 00:57:24,582
As expected, the main industry
of the Korean cartels is real estate.

616
00:57:24,665 --> 00:57:26,751
IUDC is involved in every process.

617
00:57:27,418 --> 00:57:29,921
Babel and IUDC were already
in on it together.

618
00:57:30,004 --> 00:57:32,507
The insiders and the people
who colluded with them

619
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,134
must've made a fortune
by buying land around Babel Tower.

620
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:39,555
You know, the forerunner of
the presidential election, Park Seung-jun?

621
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:42,099
He acquired some land around the plaza

622
00:57:42,183 --> 00:57:44,519
using certain loopholes five years ago.

623
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,522
His brother-in-law is the head of IUDC.

624
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:48,898
-His brother-in-law?
-Yes.

625
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:52,443
Maybe we shouldn't have opened
the Guillotine file.

626
00:57:52,527 --> 00:57:54,237
It's the root of our frustration.

627
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,280
We keep finding more corruption…

628
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:58,741
when Babel is our only target.

629
00:58:04,956 --> 00:58:06,457
Where are you going?

630
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:10,211
It's about time
that we deal with our greed.

631
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,046
I'll be back.

632
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,842
Mr. Cassano. What now?

633
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:24,267
Let me get this straight.

634
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:29,605
The Guillotine File and 1.5 trillion won's
worth of gold bars are buried

635
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:31,274
underneath the Babel Tower?

636
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:32,525
Yes, sir.

637
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:35,444
And an Italian Mafia lawyer
has control over it?

638
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:36,904
Yes. That's right.

639
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,078
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

640
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:45,955
Is this a plot for a cartoon?

641
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:47,665
Well…

642
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:51,877
it's been confirmed that
his information is somewhat credible.

643
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,256
I see.

644
00:58:56,215 --> 00:58:57,717
Be it politics or life,

645
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:00,845
there's no such thing as too much drama.

646
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:04,390
All of these matters
are very serious, sir.

647
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:05,850
The Babel Tower…

648
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:08,561
The Guillotine file…

649
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,062
Everything…

650
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:16,819
Every one of them

651
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,992
is like a sword that's aimed at my neck.

652
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:28,247
Sir.

653
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,793
I will be your unbreakable shield.

654
00:59:37,506 --> 00:59:39,258
What should I do

655
00:59:41,135 --> 00:59:42,511
to have to use that shield?

656
00:59:43,554 --> 00:59:44,639
Sir…

657
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,815
I'm sorry to ask you this again,

658
00:59:54,899 --> 00:59:57,443
but you have to move.
I'll find you another place.

659
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,154
What is this about now?

660
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,573
You were lucky the other day.

661
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:06,160
If there's another explosion,
it'll be dangerous to stay here.

662
01:00:06,243 --> 01:00:09,330
So I urge you to move as soon as possible.

663
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:12,291
Jeokha and I will follow
the words of Buddha

664
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,627
and stay here as we have been.

665
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:22,510
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

666
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:26,263
I've wanted to ask you a question.

667
01:00:27,348 --> 01:00:28,516
Go ahead.

668
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,488
NANYAK TEMPLE

669
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,505
Are you sure you'll be able to
build Babel Tower?

670
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:02,425
I heard that they are reexamining it now.

671
01:01:03,008 --> 01:01:06,011
From my experience, it will be difficult
to build a tower there

672
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:08,848
with hiccups like this.

673
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:13,185
The media are already starting
to suspect something is going on.

674
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,103
Everyone.

675
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:17,481
It's a minor error with the document.
It's nothing.

676
01:01:18,149 --> 01:01:21,569
Wusang will take care of it in a few days.

677
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,865
Why don't we all have a drink now?

678
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:29,410
And it's nothing big,
but check the present I prepared for you.

679
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:31,454
Gosh.

680
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:33,497
Come on, everyone.

681
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:37,668
I'm sure you know how this works. Come on.

682
01:01:41,505 --> 01:01:42,757
Those annoying bastards.

683
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,550
Can't we just get rid of them?

684
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:47,553
We cannot lose the people
who were at the meeting today.

685
01:01:51,015 --> 01:01:52,433
Keep reassuring them.

686
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:56,729
They might not be my bishops,
but they'll make good pawns.

687
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:08,324
Gosh, you're amazing.
You're making a chess analogy.

688
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:09,492
That's so cool.

689
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:13,662
Where are you?

690
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:15,956
Everyone left, right?

691
01:02:16,957 --> 01:02:19,502
I'm bringing a guest with me.

692
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,170
A guest?

693
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:34,058
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

694
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,101
Hello, sir.

695
01:02:38,562 --> 01:02:39,563
I'm Hong Cha-young.

696
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:43,067
Oh, my. I've also heard a lot about you.

697
01:02:43,943 --> 01:02:46,612
Hello, sir. Nice to meet you.
I'm the paralegal here.

698
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:48,155
I see. Hi.

699
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:55,704
Mr. An, we need to talk.

700
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,290
So…

701
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:00,835
Excuse me.

702
01:03:03,671 --> 01:03:06,590
You have the Guillotine file?

703
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:10,177
Ms. Hong, Mr. Nam, you, and I
are the only people who know about it.

704
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:11,220
Don't tell a soul.

705
01:03:11,303 --> 01:03:13,472
Then, we should head over to my agency--

706
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,432
No. Not yet.

707
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,102
We have a job to do with this file.

708
01:03:19,103 --> 01:03:20,104
Right.

709
01:03:20,813 --> 01:03:23,023
We can destroy everyone with the file.

710
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:24,567
That's right.

711
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,402
-You trust me, right?
-Totally.

712
01:03:26,485 --> 01:03:30,406
Then, let me use the Guillotine file
the way I see fit.

713
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:32,616
After I'm done, I'll hand it over to you.

714
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,493
I think I know how you'll use it.

715
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:36,453
I trust you, Mr. Consigliere.

716
01:03:36,537 --> 01:03:37,538
Thank you.

717
01:03:39,456 --> 01:03:40,875
But I have a favor to ask.

718
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,835
Go ahead.

719
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:43,752
Hey!

720
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:47,756
So let me get this straight.
The Guillotine file is

721
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,718
locked in the basement of Geumga Plaza?

722
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:54,889
And Vincenzo Cassano is the only person
who can take it out?

723
01:03:54,972 --> 01:03:56,891
-Yes.
-You punk.

724
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,643
You have been working

725
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:02,730
with Vincenzo Cassano for a reason!

726
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,944
I will give you the Guillotine file soon.

727
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:10,487
-Okay.
-Then, use the file

728
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:13,741
to beat Directors Kim Hui-won
and Park Jae-beom and become

729
01:04:13,824 --> 01:04:15,242
the president of our agency.

730
01:04:15,326 --> 01:04:16,952
-The president?
-Yes.

731
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,793
Hui-won. Jae-beom.

732
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:32,801
So tell me. What should I do to help?

733
01:04:34,386 --> 01:04:35,471
All right.

734
01:04:35,554 --> 01:04:37,097
The best floors at Babel Tower.

735
01:04:37,181 --> 01:04:40,100
I'll start with
the 120th and 121st floors.

736
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:43,312
What is it?

737
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:47,024
First, infiltrate Babel Group
and find their dirty laundry.

738
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:50,861
To take out the Guillotine file safely,
we must bring down Babel.

739
01:04:50,945 --> 01:04:52,863
I'm sorry I'm late.

740
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:54,865
I had an urgent meeting.

741
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:58,202
I'm Director Tae Jong-gu of
the International Organized Crime Bureau

742
01:04:58,285 --> 01:04:59,995
at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

743
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:01,872
And secondly,

744
01:05:01,956 --> 01:05:06,001
make sure no one comes after Mr. Cassano.

745
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:13,217
Well, about Vincenzo Cassano…

746
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:18,639
You should never go after him.

747
01:05:20,015 --> 01:05:22,726
-Pardon?
-He fled to Korea

748
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,980
with evidence of corruption
pertaining to not only Italian,

749
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:27,898
but also British and French politicians.

750
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:30,859
I didn't know he was that important.

751
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:31,944
He is.

752
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:35,864
He set up a system
that makes the evidence spread

753
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:38,033
all over the dark web when he dies.

754
01:05:38,617 --> 01:05:41,078
And if an international scandal breaks
because of us,

755
01:05:41,996 --> 01:05:45,541
our government will have to
take responsibility.

756
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,574
They are having a blast.

757
01:06:18,657 --> 01:06:20,534
Their cheeks must hurt smiling like that.

758
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:23,871
Look at that gold toad.
I bet it doesn't even cost much.

759
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:29,126
I wore a spy cam
to the first meeting as well,

760
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:30,794
but it didn't record anything.

761
01:06:30,878 --> 01:06:33,130
Gi-seok did a bad job
explaining how to use it.

762
01:06:33,213 --> 01:06:35,090
Mr. Tae confused "on" with "off."

763
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:42,514
Anyway, thanks to you, I think
I might be taking up a bigger position.

764
01:06:44,058 --> 01:06:47,895
Actually, I didn't do much.
He deserves more credit.

765
01:07:02,076 --> 01:07:03,202
Hello, sir.

766
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,120
What? Yeong-un?

767
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:08,082
What are you doing here?

768
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:09,416
Well, to answer that,

769
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,877
it'd be a long story.

770
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,462
Right? I knew it.

771
01:07:13,545 --> 01:07:16,882
Mr. Cho here is one of our agents, right?

772
01:07:17,674 --> 01:07:19,718
I knew it. He looked familiar.

773
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,346
You should catch up with your colleagues.

774
01:07:22,971 --> 01:07:24,139
Which year did you join?

775
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:27,518
No. Gi-seok started working
before you did.

776
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,104
-You look so young.
-Attention.

777
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:31,772
-At ease.
-Gosh.

778
01:07:31,855 --> 01:07:33,524
"Gosh"? Focus.

779
01:07:34,608 --> 01:07:35,609
That's enough.

780
01:07:37,194 --> 01:07:38,487
How…

781
01:07:38,987 --> 01:07:41,448
That makes no sense, Mr. Kim.

782
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,910
So…

783
01:07:45,536 --> 01:07:49,039
Mr. Han will be the chief prosecutor
of Namdongbu Prosecution Service?

784
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,627
And Ms. Choi will just be
the CEO of Wusang?

785
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,504
You might not know this about me,

786
01:07:55,587 --> 01:07:59,424
but I was in the Investigative Division
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

787
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:02,094
You got kicked out
because you always lost!

788
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:03,053
I did?

789
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:08,016
And about the Italian Mafia lawyer.

790
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,019
Don't go after him.

791
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:13,397
He's much bigger than you think.

792
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:15,649
He's on an international scale.

793
01:08:20,821 --> 01:08:22,531
We just met, but you're quite bossy.

794
01:08:23,824 --> 01:08:25,242
Don't butt in our business.

795
01:08:25,826 --> 01:08:30,789
Mr. Park is being generous,
giving you a second chance.

796
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,583
I don't need his generosity.

797
01:08:34,626 --> 01:08:37,171
For a boy who poisoned
his own father to death,

798
01:08:37,254 --> 01:08:39,089
you sure talk back a lot.

799
01:08:42,176 --> 01:08:43,385
What?

800
01:08:43,468 --> 01:08:44,970
You didn't think I'd know?

801
01:08:48,849 --> 01:08:50,726
And one more thing.

802
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:54,104
I think it'll be better if Han-seok
takes a break for the time being

803
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:58,650
and Han-seo runs the company again.

804
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:00,110
What?

805
01:09:00,777 --> 01:09:02,779
You mean me?

806
01:09:03,614 --> 01:09:04,615
Sir.

807
01:09:07,201 --> 01:09:10,495
I know that this is coming from Mr. Park,

808
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,539
but you cannot tell a private company--

809
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:15,626
Choi Myung-hee. Jang Han-seok.

810
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,462
Don't you want a smooth transition

811
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:21,256
with the new administration?

812
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:28,388
And you, Myung-hee.
If you talk back to me again,

813
01:09:29,514 --> 01:09:33,268
I'll take it that you're challenging
a presidential candidate

814
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,188
with an approval rating of 38.7 percent.

815
01:09:43,487 --> 01:09:46,073
Congratulations, Chairman Jang.

816
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:49,701
-One more time.
-Chairman Jang.

817
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:55,707
Am I really the chairman again?

818
01:09:57,334 --> 01:10:00,170
Do you know how hard I worked
to make this happen?

819
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:02,047
Mr. Han…

820
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,048
No.

821
01:10:04,424 --> 01:10:05,634
Seung-hyuk.

822
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:08,053
Gosh. I'm the Chief Prosecutor now.

823
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:09,513
Chief Prosecutor Han.

824
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:17,020
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.
I cannot believe this is happening.

825
01:10:17,104 --> 01:10:18,689
What was his name?

826
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:19,606
Jang Joon-woo?

827
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,775
-Vincenzo.
-Vincenzo.

828
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:25,070
The Interpol will come to arrest him
within 24 hours.

829
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:28,448
The Interpol?

830
01:10:28,532 --> 01:10:30,409
-The International police.
-I know that.

831
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,493
Right.

832
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:33,829
You know…

833
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:38,000
I called the boss of the Cassano Family
and set a trap.

834
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:43,005
I asked him to find a crime
that we could frame Vincenzo with.

835
01:10:43,088 --> 01:10:45,382
And I reported it to the Interpol.

836
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:51,638
Gosh.

837
01:10:53,098 --> 01:10:54,016
Stop it.

838
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:56,059
Why didn't I think of that?

839
01:10:56,143 --> 01:11:00,314
Let's get rid of the person who is
most likely to obtain the Guillotine file.

840
01:11:00,397 --> 01:11:04,568
And you, my dear chairman,
will demolish Geumga Plaza

841
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:06,778
and obtain the Guillotine file.

842
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:10,407
But what if Vincenzo comes back
after some time?

843
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,618
No. Gosh. That's impossible.

844
01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:18,582
Now, you can just focus on leading Babel.

845
01:11:18,665 --> 01:11:22,502
I, the chief prosecutor,
will back you up on other things.

846
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:26,214
Jang Han-seok…

847
01:11:37,184 --> 01:11:39,686
Let's see

848
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,731
Who comes out on top

849
01:12:12,636 --> 01:12:14,888
INAUGURATION OF CHIEF PROSECUTOR
HAN SEUNG-HYUK

850
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:27,192
Please say a few words
as the new chief prosecutor.

851
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:31,780
I am infinitely honored to have the chance
to serve the people of our country.

852
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:36,535
As the guardian of the Constitution
and democracy,

853
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,372
I will dedicate my life
so that the principle of justice

854
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:43,208
can be the driving force
of our legal system.

855
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:46,086
How do you plan to clear up
suspicion about

856
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:48,130
-colluding with Babel?
-Just like that?

857
01:12:48,213 --> 01:12:50,507
How did he become
the chief prosecutor overnight?

858
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,510
Jang Han-seok doesn't have
enough influence to make that happen.

859
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:55,679
They must've used someone much higher up

860
01:12:56,263 --> 01:12:57,806
to ward off our attacks.

861
01:12:57,889 --> 01:12:59,975
-Yes. I am
-Then, could it be…

862
01:13:00,058 --> 01:13:03,395
well-aware of the public's mistrust
and concerns.

863
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:07,232
Then why didn't Jang Han-seo
report this to us? This is huge.

864
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:09,276
Right. He's slacking off already.

865
01:13:12,487 --> 01:13:13,947
He's not slacking off just yet.

866
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:19,870
Go ahead.

867
01:13:19,953 --> 01:13:22,080
We need to talk. It's urgent.

868
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,461
They're being led to area A.

869
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:44,686
POLICE

870
01:14:09,085 --> 01:14:10,504
What do you need to discuss?

871
01:14:17,427 --> 01:14:18,595
This is driving me crazy.

872
01:14:53,004 --> 01:14:54,047
You see…

873
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,008
Something's been bothering me.

874
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,014
What is it? Tell me.

875
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:14,109
I wish I didn't have to make
so many choices in life.

876
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:25,829
It's been fun.

877
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,082
But this is…

878
01:15:34,713 --> 01:15:36,256
where our fun ends.

879
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:09,247
You're just like your brother.

880
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,958
I didn't expect much from you anyway.

881
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:15,003
A gun?

882
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,923
Don't shoot. I have a gun, too.

883
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:20,759
Your betrayal means

884
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:24,512
that you've accomplished your goal.

885
01:16:29,643 --> 01:16:32,979
If either of us starts shooting,
we might both die.

886
01:16:33,063 --> 01:16:35,899
So let's both lower our guns. Okay?

887
01:16:36,483 --> 01:16:38,068
I don't plan on doing that.

888
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:42,155
Actually, my gun isn't loaded. It's empty.

889
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:44,074
I see.

890
01:16:45,283 --> 01:16:46,368
Shoot your head first then.

891
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:48,745
No. I said it's empty.

892
01:16:49,412 --> 01:16:52,040
I'm pointing it at you to scare you.

893
01:16:57,128 --> 01:16:58,046
Shoot first.

894
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:09,557
Vincenzo Cassano.
