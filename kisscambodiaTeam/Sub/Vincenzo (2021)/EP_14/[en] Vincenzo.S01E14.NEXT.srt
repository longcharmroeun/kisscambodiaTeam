1
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,190
Five.

2
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,275
Four.

3
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,194
Three.

4
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,029
Two.

5
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,364
One.

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,606
That was awesome.

7
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,987
I feel like I'm a Mafia from the '60s.

8
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,286
Enjoy it.
See how it feels to be a real villain.

9
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,353
Keep it up!

10
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,042
Escort the chairman out
right now, you morons!

11
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,460
Are you okay, sir?

12
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

13
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,382
Be careful.

14
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,843
-Stop taking pictures!
-Come out!

15
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,845
-This way, please.
-Be careful.

16
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,972
-Coming through!
-Hurry up!

17
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,765
Move out of the way!

18
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,143
-Stop taking pictures!
-No pictures!

19
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,895
Stop that!

20
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,022
-Come this way.
-No pictures!

21
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,032
Make way.

22
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,575
Cover him properly.

23
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,660
Hurry up over there!

24
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,162
What are you doing over there?

25
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,664
-Gosh, seriously.
-What is it now?

26
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,166
Namdongbu Prosecution Service.

27
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,959
Mr. Jang.

28
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,879
You're under arrest
for leading anti-union activities.

29
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,131
-You have the right to remain--
-Cut it out.

30
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,591
There's no evidence.

31
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,593
What we saw back there is enough evidence.

32
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,845
That doesn't count!

33
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,730
There's no conclusive evidence.

34
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,193
Stop taking pictures!
Or I'll sue all of you.

35
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,118
I'll come with Mr. Jang.

36
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,329
You know me, right?

37
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,753
Let's go.

38
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,129
Hurry up, everyone.

39
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,048
Keep reporters under control.

40
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,008
Get moving! Get to work!

41
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,345
Gosh, why did they have to take pictures?

42
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,935
Why did you bring these two in?

43
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,729
You should lock up these punks.

44
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:36,025
They poured pig blood over him.
This is assault.

45
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,278
-It's not assault. It's a prank.
-Hey.

46
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,363
I pulled a little prank
on my beloved friend.

47
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,367
Between you and me,
a prank like this is no biggie,

48
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,536
right, Han-seok?

49
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,498
A "prank"? That's just nonsense!

50
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,417
Charge them now.

51
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,296
The video that played on the screen
is obviously fabricated.

52
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,380
Anyone could see that.

53
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,092
Shouldn't you have verified the video
before arresting him?

54
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,553
Right. If it's been acquired
in an illegal manner,

55
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,180
I'll raise an issue right away.

56
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,142
Just you wait. Let me see.

57
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,603
-Where is it?
-Even without the video,

58
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,940
the Vision Team's documents are
good enough evidence.

59
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,155
What's that?

60
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,408
Anyway…

61
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,788
what's the evidence

62
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,917
that the attorney for the union leader's
family brought?

63
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,211
Do you even have any?

64
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,797
Do you?

65
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,724
Here's testimony from the man
who ran over the union leader

66
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,434
under the influence.

67
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,151
Tell us the truth.

68
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,946
I was told

69
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,408
to run over the union leader while drunk.

70
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,163
They promised me 200 million won
and an early release with manslaughter.

71
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
Who promised you that?

72
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,458
Lawyer Seo Seong-wan of Wusang.

73
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,631
Why are you telling us this?

74
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,633
I heard about an old case.

75
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,052
Wusang had a man

76
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,639
run over a lawyer,
promising him a reduced sentence.

77
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,933
But he died in prison.

78
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,270
I don't want to be killed off like that.

79
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,317
Gosh, too bad for Mr. Seo.

80
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,237
He joined Lomborgheni
a couple of days ago.

81
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,156
In addition to anti-union activities,

82
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,826
all of you will be charged
with aiding and abetting murder.

83
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,161
-What?
-Me, too?

84
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,831
He said it was Mr. Seo.

85
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,709
Do whatever you want.
We have nothing else to say.

86
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,878
They say silence is golden,

87
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,590
but a villain's silence is
a warehouse of sins.

88
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,343
Shut up, you Mafia bastard!

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,137
-Gosh.
-Watch your mouth!

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,556
You rude brat. How old are you?

91
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,890
I was born in 1993.

92
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,308
How old are you?

93
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,103
Sit back down!
I was born in the Year of the Snake.

94
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,855
Me, too.

95
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,537
An Italian Mafia scumbag

96
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,209
is pretending to be a hero for justice.
That's ridiculous.

97
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,339
A hero for justice, my ass.

98
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,429
I'm just a scumbag who cleans up scum.

99
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,642
I can never stand scumbags

100
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,937
that stink more than me.

101
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,628
May we leave now?

102
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,007
Let's go, Ms. Hong.

103
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,134
Sure, Mr. Cassano.

104
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,100
What?

105
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,940
What? What is it? You little…

106
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,734
What are you smiling for?

107
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,081
I bet they never imagined they would
be investigated together.

108
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,333
I'm sure they'll be released tonight,

109
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,962
but it'll be a night to remember
for Jang Han-seok.

110
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,048
I'd say the smoke grenade
went off quite successfully.

111
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,760
Our target isn't the anti-union documents.

112
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,012
Then what is our target?

113
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,599
Once you obtain Vision Team's data,
in addition to the anti-union documents,

114
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,727
secure the evidence on Chairman
Jang Han-seok's paper company.

115
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,648
His paper company is
Mr. Jung's second target, right?

116
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,443
We'll use the anti-union case
as a decoy to divert attention.

117
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,028
"Make a sound in the east,
then strike in the west."

118
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,073
You really are a consigliere.

119
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,450
What does that mean?

120
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,870
Diverting the enemy's attention…

121
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,163
Oh, hello.

122
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,001
And attack when they least expect it.

123
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,628
That's clever.

124
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,297
Listen up.

125
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,216
Even with the most solid evidence,

126
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,844
anti-union activities can't send
Jang Han-seok to prison.

127
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,221
He'll make someone else take the fall.

128
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,472
Right.

129
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,933
Even if he is indicted,
his sentence won't be long.

130
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,895
Our goal regarding the union should be

131
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,317
to force Babel to fully recognize
their union.

132
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,737
If this goes well,

133
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,530
we can finish off Han-seok at once.

134
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
A prison sentence
and an astronomical fine.

135
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,659
I don't understand a word,

136
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,870
but I'm all for finishing him off at once!

137
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,624
Let's get things moving
before the smoke clears.

138
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,843
Okay.

139
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,720
Have him ready.

140
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,143
The Vision Team leader is
in the next room.

141
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,978
He'll be confronted with the chairman.

142
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,857
Mr. Seo of Wusang is
also being brought in.

143
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,443
My goodness.

144
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,446
Mr. Jung.

145
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,997
I'm the one who ordered
the anti-union activities.

146
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,334
My brother

147
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,170
knows nothing about it.

148
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,640
He took up his position
just a few days ago.

149
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
Until then…

150
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,311
I managed the whole thing

151
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,023
and gave the orders. I'm sorry.

152
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,068
Vice Chairman.

153
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,571
Why don't you calm down a little?

154
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,073
No, I'm fine.

155
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,870
Ask me anything.
I'll answer as thoroughly as I can.

156
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,385
Haven't you left yet?

157
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,638
What kind of investigation is this
to hold them up like this?

158
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,141
Do you have any idea
what's going on inside Babel?

159
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,686
Sir.

160
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,272
Are you intervening in our investigation?

161
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,857
That's not it.

162
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm just here to give you information.

163
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,320
There's a group of Babel employees

164
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,449
who served the former chairman
and are unhappy

165
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,033
with Chairman Jang's takeover.

166
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,912
This is their plot against him
to kick him out.

167
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,038
Isn't it obvious?

168
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,000
-That's news to me.
-News to you?

169
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,878
How are you going to investigate
with so little information?

170
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,006
In that case, the Vision Team leader

171
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,050
might have been a part of the plot
all along.

172
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,636
Come to think of it,

173
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,222
Mr. Seo left the company

174
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,392
complaining about
his poor performance reviews.

175
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,355
Anyway, send these people home
and start the investigation over.

176
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,732
I can't do that!

177
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,067
These people
need to be investigated first.

178
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,904
The press will be all over you
for a botched investigation.

179
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,363
Start over.

180
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,705
Be thorough this time.

181
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,556
Mr. Nam, have you found anything?

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,309
Yes, I found a suspicious looking company.

183
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,233
It says, "Jason Fund needs
to expand its workforce."

184
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,651
It's located in Malta.

185
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,237
And it's called "Jason"?

186
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,658
Jang Joon-woo went by Jason at Wusang.

187
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,868
And if you look over here…

188
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,579
They have a branch in Korea as well.

189
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,916
It says, "establishing a security network
for Jason Fund Korea."

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,754
That must mean
that their accounting is managed in Korea.

191
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,467
That's all I could find. No locations,
no phone numbers, no nothing.

192
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,055
I wish we knew someone
familiar with paper companies.

193
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,974
Mr. Cassano.

194
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,976
Yes?

195
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,019
It's not an appealing idea,

196
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,189
but we might know an expert
who we can consult.

197
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,109
An expert?

198
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,154
You came to the right person.

199
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,116
Money laundering and tax evasion
are my expertise.

200
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,744
You used to run a mom-and-pop store.

201
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,913
My boss…

202
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,042
is second to none when it comes
to financial crimes.

203
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,836
He's number one.

204
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,920
Hey.

205
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,381
Is that even a compliment?

206
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,091
Should I be happy or not?

207
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,678
Even a mom-and-pop store

208
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,680
works the same way as a conglomerate.

209
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,892
I'm a bookkeeper
specialized in money laundering.

210
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,436
I can also cook the books.

211
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,402
You should give us a presentation
at Jipuragi soon.

212
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,031
Let me see if you'll be of any help.

213
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,949
Hold on.

214
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,620
What's in it for me?

215
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,580
Isn't Babel your enemy, too?

216
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,334
You almost died
in a freezer recently, right?

217
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,711
Jeez, that brings back terrible memories.

218
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,882
You're right.
It was horrible. How did I forget that?

219
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,510
I don't even want to think about it.
My toes were frostbitten.

220
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,972
Mr. Park, let's get back at them.

221
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,849
Let's do that.

222
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,976
They even took all my money.

223
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
What am I doing here?

224
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,191
Those Babel bastards…

225
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,156
-Good work.
-Cheers.

226
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,617
Those little rats.

227
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,958
The Chief Prosecutor sure came up
with a solid story for us.

228
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,793
He's worth every penny.

229
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,046
Hey, Brother.

230
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,423
-Yes?
-I appreciate your kind gesture,

231
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,468
but you shouldn't take the rap
for such a trivial charge.

232
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,473
Take the fall for paper companies,
tax evasion, illegal stock acquisitions.

233
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,268
That's when you can really prove
how loyal you are to me.

234
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,062
Of course, sir.

235
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,025
Back there, I got ahead of myself.

236
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,777
Don't worry.

237
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,489
I'll do anything for you.

238
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,952
My, this is beautiful.

239
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,496
I love the wine.

240
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085
You should've told me first--

241
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,102
My heart really sank back there.

242
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,563
How could you do that
without discussing with me?

243
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,857
I thought that would be…

244
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,111
the best deal for me.

245
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,032
Did you think Chairman Jang
wouldn't see through that?

246
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,743
My goodness. You frustrate me.

247
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,327
The other charges include

248
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,122
tax evasion, illegal stock acquisitions…

249
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,207
They're too much.

250
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,710
Well, I agree with you.

251
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,422
I doubt that Mr. Jung has
any substantial evidence,

252
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,800
but if Vincenzo uses his tactics
and finds more evidence,

253
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,635
-it's going to--
-Mr. Han.

254
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,595
Yes?

255
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,347
I have a favor to ask you.

256
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,558
Sure, what is it?

257
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,021
Arrange a meeting with Vincenzo.

258
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,189
With Vincenzo?

259
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,315
Yes.

260
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,194
The sooner, the better.

261
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,405
A prosecutor's botched investigation

262
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,200
almost framed Chairman Jang of Babel

263
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,995
for leading the company's
anti-union activities.

264
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,499
But the truth was stronger
than negligence.

265
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,376
It turned out
that the plot was orchestrated

266
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,672
by Director Kim and Team Leader Park,

267
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,300
who were opposed to Chairman Jang…

268
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,552
I'm sorry things turned out
like this again.

269
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,137
It's fine.

270
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,890
The anti-union activities
were only a decoy.

271
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,602
We'll start looking for evidence
of paper companies.

272
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,020
Thank you.

273
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,360
All we need is a Pandora's box
to end all this.

274
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,071
What are you referring to?

275
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,365
Haven't you heard of it?

276
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,992
The Guillotine file.

277
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,869
I have.

278
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,372
It was revealed
when a meeting agenda was leaked.

279
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,581
That's right.

280
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,835
Right now, no one knows where the file is.

281
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,381
Once we get our hands on it,
all the corrupt politicians, lawyers,

282
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,300
and businessmen in the country
can be put behind bars.

283
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,011
-Is it that powerful?
-Yes.

284
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,139
It's beyond our imagination.

285
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,521
Mr. Cho.

286
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,903
You're here.

287
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,586
How could you make such a mistake?

288
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,296
It was finally time.

289
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,338
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,468
I was too flustered to think about
the iris recognition device.

291
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,972
Now, without opening the secret room,
we can't get the Guillotine file.

292
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,015
I'll…

293
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,642
come up with a solution.

294
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,021
For now,

295
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,732
let's leave it to Vincenzo.

296
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,486
He might be able to find a way.

297
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,335
Well…

298
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,880
Here.

299
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,092
Oh, my.

300
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,556
Is this for me?

301
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,362
This is gorgeous.

302
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,036
You wrote a letter, too.

303
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,288
Hold on. Not now.

304
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,332
Please read it at home.

305
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,293
Okay.

306
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,090
Thank you so much.

307
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,884
Oh, right.

308
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,886
Let's give her our gift.

309
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,933
-Here.
-Thank you.

310
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,811
My goodness.

311
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,028
You brought me bungeoppang?

312
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,573
I love these.

313
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,665
Eat slowly.

314
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,543
Okay. I appreciate it.

315
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,963
You two should have some, too.

316
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,267
It's so good.

317
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,940
It's really tasty.

318
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,529
Right.

319
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,240
I'll tell you what.

320
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,452
Do you know the difference
between bungeoppang and ingeoppang?

321
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,748
What is it?

322
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,879
Bungeoppang looks
as if it's saying, "bung."

323
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,839
Ingeoppang looks as if it's saying…

324
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,427
"ing."

325
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,638
Isn't it funny?

326
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,893
Oh, I see.

327
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,981
I never would've guessed that.

328
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,908
Hello?

329
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,703
Hello, this is Han Seung-hyuk of Wusang.

330
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,331
Why are you calling me,
Mr. Han Seung-hyuk?

331
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,668
I have a very important appointment
tonight.

332
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,129
Can you come alone?

333
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,867
Keum Gwang-jin.

334
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:32,911
Here.

335
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,789
See? He's right here.

336
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,918
Mr. Keum Gwang-jin
is going to come to our plaza tomorrow.

337
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,962
-I see.
-I see.

338
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,631
Then shouldn't we have to pay him?

339
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:48,051
Well, he usually gets two million
for each exploration.

340
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,514
But since we're almost like brothers,
he'll do it for free.

341
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,225
-Really? For free?
-Of course.

342
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,060
Would this really be okay?

343
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,021
If Mr. Cassano finds out, he'll be upset.

344
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,732
Right, with what happened last time…

345
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,609
Then this time,

346
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,237
just use me as an excuse.
Tell him I did it.

347
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,447
I guess that's a good idea.

348
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,825
Then we'll pretend we don't know anything.

349
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,413
We'll pretend we didn't know
and watch what he's doing.

350
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,331
All right.

351
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,084
See this article?

352
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,795
See how he found the gold? Where is this?

353
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,589
This is driving me crazy.

354
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,141
Sir, Mr. Cassano is here.

355
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,939
I finally get to talk to you in private.

356
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,317
Sorry for cursing at you yesterday.

357
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,070
Well, it was an understandable situation.

358
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,531
You can make up today.

359
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,241
Yes, let's bury the hatchet.

360
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,579
What do you want?

361
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,876
Mr. Cassano.

362
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,338
I know this is an informal meeting,

363
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,132
but you should still have manners.

364
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,177
I'm not here to show my manners.
If you don't like it, just leave.

365
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,055
I may look young,
but I'm much older than you.

366
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,389
Look at me.

367
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,560
He really is a Mafia member.

368
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,355
It's fine, I like this dark vibe.

369
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,606
Right. It's nice.

370
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,817
He's like a total gangster. My gosh.

371
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,743
Let me ask you something first.

372
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,330
Do you have to destroy me too?

373
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,753
Is your goal to destroy me
along with my brother?

374
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,425
If that's not the case,

375
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,637
then you can have him.

376
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,392
I'll help you kill my brother as you wish,

377
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,520
so just leave me and Babel alone.

378
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,898
Our vice chairman

379
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,193
has made a very tough decision.

380
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,321
Forget it. Just go.

381
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,282
You're the one who came here.

382
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,159
I never exploit betrayal within a family.

383
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,746
Why would you care about that
when you need to win?

384
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,582
Take care of your family matters
on your own.

385
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,793
I won't get involved in it. Okay?

386
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,090
By the way, why is it
that you don't do that?

387
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,803
Because if I exploit
a betrayal within other families,

388
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,724
my own family might betray me in the end.

389
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,852
So keep that in mind.

390
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,113
He's acting all cool, isn't he?

391
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,908
He's pretending to be a family man
when he's a Mafia.

392
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,119
Oh, he drank from this.

393
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,917
GEUMGA PLAZA

394
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,637
I will begin the presentation.

395
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,313
First, what is a paper company?
You, what is it?

396
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,649
A company that makes paper.

397
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,234
-You're so ignorant.
-Jeez.

398
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,196
"A company that makes paper"?
Seriously, honey?

399
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,615
-You should say "paper manufacturer."
-Oh, right.

400
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,824
This is ridiculous.

401
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,118
Well, many people think that.

402
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,870
But a paper company

403
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,415
is an inactive company
that only exists on paper.

404
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,833
A ghost company!

405
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,627
It's not a ghost company.

406
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,879
-It's not?
-It may seem like it,

407
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,130
but it's actually legal.

408
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,549
That's the key point.

409
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,927
So many company executives use them

410
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,762
for purposes other than just business.

411
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,515
They evade taxes
or buy stocks under borrowed names

412
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,266
to increase their shares illegally.

413
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,686
I have no idea what you're saying.
Anyway, it's something bad, right?

414
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,480
-It's very bad!
-Okay.

415
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,150
So they don't pay taxes,
and break the law.

416
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,112
And along with going to jail,

417
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,072
they'd have to pay a huge penalty tax.

418
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,449
It could be up to several trillion won.

419
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,120
If Jang Han-seok gets caught, he'll have
to pay at least a hundred billion won.

420
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,246
By the way…

421
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,250
he must've set up something in Korea

422
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,877
to launder and manage his money.

423
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,547
It wasn't on the files, though.

424
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,674
We only found evidence of tax evasion

425
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,219
and using illegal methods
to gain Babel E&amp;C stocks.

426
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,429
Babel E&amp;C?

427
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,307
Hang on.

428
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,727
I think I'm figuring it out.

429
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,146
What do you mean?

430
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,605
You know Na Deok-jin, right?

431
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,023
Yes.

432
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,485
He said he did some work
for a paper company before.

433
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,903
I see.

434
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,032
What's he been doing since he got fired?

435
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,453
Hello! I'm Singing Mr. Na!

436
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,373
Which is the answer?

437
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,126
SINGING MR. NA

438
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,715
Tapping chopsticks together

439
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:26,222
Let's make a rhythm
To the beat of tapping chopsticks

440
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:33,396
And sing a song tonight

441
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,067
If you have lingering feelings

442
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,696
Look at the passing time

443
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,492
And if your heart is burning with passion

444
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:49,370
Sing a song of love

445
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,081
Life circles round and round

446
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,209
-You've never been to places like this?
-What?

447
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,920
-You've never been to a place like this?
-Never.

448
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,423
This is a Korean style club.

449
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,759
Tapping chopsticks together

450
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,803
Hey, you!

451
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,970
Stop singing!

452
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,722
What did you just throw?

453
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,809
I'd sing better than you
even if I sang through my nostrils!

454
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,227
Jeez!

455
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,062
Don't throw stuff at him!

456
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,565
It's not illegal to be a bad singer.

457
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,234
What's with him?

458
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,986
I guess he's pretty drunk.

459
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,531
She's right.
You didn't need to throw stuff at him.

460
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,330
I made a resolution
while sleeping in my car for a month.

461
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,750
"I will achieve my dream.
I'll live my life to the fullest!

462
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,836
Where are you, my bluebird?"

463
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,131
So I was reborn

464
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,384
as a Trot singer, Singing Mr. Na.

465
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,886
You should try sleeping in your car again.

466
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,055
You may find another dream.

467
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,015
I can't. I sold my car.

468
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,768
By the way, who is she?

469
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,439
Remember the lawyer Hong Yu-chan
of Geumga Plaza?

470
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,607
I hated him.

471
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,775
You little…

472
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,237
I'm his daughter,

473
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,322
Lawyer Hong Cha-young.

474
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,908
Oh, that lunatic?

475
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,871
You better answer my questions honestly.

476
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,622
Yes, sir!

477
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,334
You know Jason Fund, right?
Jang Han-seok's paper company.

478
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,586
Jason…

479
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,713
How would I know that?

480
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,424
I do.

481
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,387
Tell us everything you know.
And everything you don't know.

482
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:35,351
ATTORNEY CHOI MYUNG-HEE

483
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,729
CHOI MYUNG-HEE

484
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,232
-Yes, Ms. Choi.
-I found

485
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,861
the easiest and surest way
to get rid of Vincenzo.

486
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,821
What is it?

487
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,407
"Yi yi je yi."

488
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,201
What is that?
I'm not good with Chinese idioms.

489
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:59,459
"Use other enemies
to get rid of your enemies."

490
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,711
Give me more details.

491
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,589
Yes.

492
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,428
One of the jobs I was tasked with
was sending development information

493
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,057
to the paper company office.

494
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,435
Where was it?

495
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,938
It was disguised as something else,
of course.

496
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,607
It was a place called Ragusang Gallery.

497
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,818
Through the gallery,

498
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,280
they're laundering money with art pieces

499
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,909
and buying Babel E&amp;C stocks
under the paper company's name

500
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,162
to increase the CEO's shares

501
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,623
illegally.

502
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,586
Then the financial documents
must be there, too.

503
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,755
Yes, of course.

504
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,312
Their accountant
works in the director's office.

505
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:07,652
I think the director is keeping her there
and managing the accounts herself.

506
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,072
MONTHLY EXPENSES AND FINANCE

507
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,448
What about security?

508
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,367
Mr. Vincenzo!

509
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,495
It's an art gallery.
Security is tight, of course.

510
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,999
There are guards lined up
in front of the director's office.

511
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,167
And to enter the office,

512
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,294
you need this.

513
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,216
The director's fingerprint.

514
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,051
Anything else?

515
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,512
Anything else?

516
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,932
Oh, I didn't know this either,

517
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,853
but I heard there's this art piece
inside her office.

518
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,106
I can't remember exactly,
but apparently it's really expensive.

519
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,986
I don't know the artist, but the piece
was titled Nothing.

520
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,368
No, not like that.

521
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,880
All right. You have to welcome him
with a big round of applause.

522
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,924
But why is he so late? It's already…

523
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,635
It's past eleven.

524
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,472
I'm sure it's because
he had prior engagements.

525
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,142
I guess he really is busy.

526
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,228
What will you do
if Mr. Cassano finds out about this?

527
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,565
We didn't call him.
It was Mr. Park who called him.

528
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,524
Seriously?

529
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,610
You all suggested calling him.

530
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,487
I'm disappointed in you.

531
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,115
No, it's not what you think.

532
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,660
If we really end up finding the gold--

533
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,621
That must be him!

534
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,623
Gwang-jin!

535
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,938
DOG FINDERS

536
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,152
ANIMAL RESCUE TEAM
DOG FINDERS

537
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,877
Is that a person or a dog?

538
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,296
Are those dog ears?

539
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,298
-Seok-do!
-Gwang-jin.

540
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,635
Sorry for being late.
I was saving this dog on the way.

541
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm sorry.

542
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,180
-I'm sorry, everyone.
-Hello.

543
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,181
Why are you…

544
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,101
I should've told you earlier.

545
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,854
I quit looking for gold three months ago.

546
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,439
-What?
-Why?

547
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,359
I've been looking for gold all my life,

548
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,361
but I've felt empty inside.

549
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,824
And one day,
I started raising an abandoned dog.

550
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,993
It just filled my heart.

551
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:06,289
So I quit everything the very next day
and opened an animal rescue center.

552
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:12,086
You can't imagine how happy I am
doing this job.

553
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,838
I understand.

554
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,132
Everyone,

555
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,718
real gold isn't in gold mines.

556
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,761
It's inside your hearts.

557
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,306
It really is.

558
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,932
So, look for it there.

559
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,435
I'll be off to find more gold now.

560
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,604
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,607
-Call me. I'll get going.
-Goodbye.

562
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,983
Bye.

563
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,028
Bye.

564
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,448
It's inside our hearts.

565
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,252
Why are you looking so down?

566
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,879
You didn't do anything wrong.

567
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,964
It's all my fault.

568
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,094
The truth is, if I were you,

569
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,223
I wouldn't trust
a despicable Mafia member like me.

570
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,432
I understand.

571
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,851
It's not that we don't trust you…

572
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,978
You can do whatever you want.

573
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,149
This dirty, despicable Mafia member
will get going now.

574
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,776
Mr. Cassano…

575
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,361
Don't say that about yourself.

576
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,197
We're sorry. We didn't mean…

577
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,951
How could you do this?

578
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,120
Wait for me, dirty Mafia!

579
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,209
How could you do this?
Wait for me, despicable Mafia!

580
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:42,134
What would've happened
if he hadn't become an animal rescuer?

581
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,680
It would've been the end
if he had found the gold!

582
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,433
Hey, guys.

583
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,319
Why don't we talk for a moment?

584
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,073
I don't want to hear
about the ghost underground.

585
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,283
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

586
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,200
Let's go.

587
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,202
The secret basement.

588
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:20,464
You have no idea how scared I was
that they might find the secret basement.

589
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,012
What are you talking about?

590
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,848
I feel so anxious every day.

591
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,559
When are you going to get the gold out?

592
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,003
The person who made the security system…

593
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,297
for that room

594
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,631
is me.

595
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,388
The iris recognition program

596
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,015
and the demolition program.

597
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,683
I'm the one who made all that.

598
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,851
Hang on.

599
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,521
Why is everyone here so talented?

600
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,815
What was your job?

601
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,318
I was a security system programmer,

602
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,652
and a hacker before that.

603
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,281
But how are you still alive?
All the people involved were--

604
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,493
I didn't work at the scene,
so my identity wasn't exposed.

605
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,424
But when I heard that
all the workers involved had died,

606
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,343
I ran away just in case.

607
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,347
And fortunately,
Wang's men failed to find me.

608
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,686
How did you know
the location of the room, then?

609
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,774
I made the system, so I made sure
I could track it, of course.

610
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,116
And why are you telling me this?

611
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,034
Gather round.

612
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,747
The gold in the room.

613
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,417
Let's get it out together.

614
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,547
You can't open it since Wang is dead,

615
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,674
and if Babel takes this building,
it's over.

616
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,677
Plus, if you make one mistake,
the whole building will collapse.

617
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,681
Can you really open it?

618
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,765
Of course.

619
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,059
I can open it with the building intact.

620
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,730
Since it's come to this,
let's let her join our group.

621
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,818
I can open it if the monks aren't there.

622
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,445
All I need is one minute.

623
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,369
Ms. Seo. Even if you do open it,

624
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,706
it'll take a while to get everything out.

625
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,541
There's that much?

626
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,881
Just wait a little longer.

627
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,802
And make sure to keep this secret, okay?

628
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,306
I've kept my mouth shut
for the past two years.

629
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,475
Don't worry.

630
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,814
All my worries are gone now!

631
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,737
We'll be counting on you, Ms. Seo.

632
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,365
Ms. Seo, you're our savior. I mean it.

633
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,711
What is this?

634
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,298
I made some tteokbokki for you.

635
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,426
And here.

636
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,429
I made this dress shirt myself.

637
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,182
I'm a great tailor too.

638
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,436
Oh, you didn't need to.

639
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,945
We felt bad since all we did
was accept your kindness so far.

640
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:15,741
And we also brought this
on behalf of all the people in the plaza.

641
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,669
MEMORANDUM

642
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,426
THE PEOPLE OF GEUMGA PLAZA
WILL TRUST VINCENZO CASSANO

643
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,554
AND SHARE ANYTHING
THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED

644
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,767
There's no need to do this
for a dirty, despicable man like me.

645
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,477
That's not true!

646
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,939
We really mean what we wrote.
Please accept it.

647
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:51,694
We must have lost our minds
after hearing about all that gold.

648
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,822
We could have been kicked out of here

649
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,907
but you protected us all this time.

650
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,701
Stop it.

651
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,579
We didn't have any money

652
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,747
or any power.

653
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,209
We've been able to live decently
thanks to you.

654
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:11,213
We even got to help others
and teach those Babel jerks a lesson.

655
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,133
We'll now stop chasing false hope

656
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,343
and focus on protecting our plaza

657
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,512
with you.

658
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,271
All right.

659
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,690
I will join you again.

660
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,028
Gosh. Thank you so much!

661
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,907
There's something
we need to do together first.

662
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,618
It's an important matter,

663
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,786
so I'll tell you all about it
tomorrow morning.

664
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,289
All right. Thank you. Get some rest now.

665
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,541
I missed your tteokbokki.

666
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,459
Really?

667
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,877
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

668
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,086
It's no problem.

669
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,254
-Let's go.
-Shall we go?

670
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,672
Bye, then.

671
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,049
Thank you so much.

672
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,024
We're planning to
totally screw Babel over.

673
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,234
It's a very important job.

674
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,571
Then we must all join in.

675
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,824
-Let's do it!
-Yes!

676
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,369
All right, everyone.
This is really important.

677
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,997
We need good teamwork for this
above all else. Got it?

678
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,207
-Yes!
-Yes!

679
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,709
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

680
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,961
-Yes!
-Let's do this!

681
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,546
Let's do this.

682
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,925
-Yes!
-Yes!

683
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,598
All right.

684
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,809
-Geumga!
-Geumga!

685
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,894
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

686
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,788
So he's secretly laundering
his money with all this.

687
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,333
Using art pieces to launder money
is pretty common.

688
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,630
"Ragusang." What's with the name?

689
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,800
-What does it mean?
-How elegant.

690
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,307
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

691
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,979
There are guards
in front of the director's office.

692
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:39,736
Then there's probably no point
in forcing ourselves in there.

693
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,574
And there's a security lock
on the door, too.

694
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,495
We need to find a way
to get inside naturally.

695
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,502
What should we do

696
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,923
to get in there naturally?

697
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,717
This artist's piece is in Korea?

698
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,062
PRIVATE VENUE RENTAL SERVICE

699
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,065
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

700
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,194
I looked into the private venue
rental service,

701
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,988
but it's fully booked
for the next two months.

702
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,448
I see.

703
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,658
It really is fully booked.

704
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,327
It's not even that cheap.

705
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,663
Let's find another way, then.

706
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,465
I've hacked into the reservation list.

707
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,682
GEORGE ANDERSON
JESSICA BENING

708
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,892
They look like a couple.

709
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,560
Their reservation is in two days.

710
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,272
How about you two disguise as a couple
to get in?

711
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,610
Do you mean him and me?

712
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,738
He and I can't be a couple, can we?

713
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,781
Hey…

714
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,784
Gosh, that'll be so awkward.

715
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,871
Fine.

716
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,083
I'll do it.

717
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,835
Here.

718
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,129
Damn it. That was so close.

719
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,635
How will we hack
into the accountant's computer?

720
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,263
Right, there's a catch.

721
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,724
The director's office uses
Babel's own network,

722
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,476
so it's impossible to hack remotely.

723
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,688
I need to install a transmitter
on the computer

724
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,731
and hack from nearby.

725
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,401
Can you change the photos
on the reservation list?

726
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,194
That's a cakewalk.

727
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:49,992
GEORGE ANDERSON
JESSICA BENING

728
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,723
I brought some information
regarding Nothing as you asked.

729
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,522
It's an installation piece
by Jackson Martin, an American artist.

730
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:32,784
It used to be displayed in Milan,
then was sold to Ragusang Gallery.

731
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,120
It's worth around ten billion won.

732
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,711
Why would they keep it in the director's
office and not exhibit it?

733
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,504
It's an extremely rare piece.

734
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,382
Its former owner from Milan
kept it hidden as well.

735
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,759
Thus, there are no photos.

736
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,680
Then let's begin.

737
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,105
My partner would never dress like that.

738
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,361
I'm dressed like this because I'm not.

739
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,239
If you're going to put on an act,
you should do a proper job.

740
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,700
I'm too lazy to get changed.

741
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,703
Don't bother. Get in.

742
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,466
What is he up to this time?

743
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,702
Here is the product you ordered.

744
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,455
When did you prepare this?

745
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,279
You finally look the part.

746
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,533
Aren't you being too generous
for a single act?

747
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,118
They're not a gift.

748
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,872
I'm just giving them
to their rightful owner.

749
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,293
Hey!

750
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:56,112
Starting from 6 p.m., the gallery will be
rented as a private venue.

751
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,991
Please vacate the premises before then
for our next schedule.

752
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:07,415
Starting from 6 p.m., the gallery will be
rented as a private venue.

753
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,377
Please vacate the premises…

754
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:37,320
Our record said
that one of you is fluent in Korean.

755
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,490
That'd be me.
I'm extremely fluent in Korean.

756
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,618
I see. Then she can't speak Korean at all?

757
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,790
I can speak a little.

758
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,544
She has improved a lot lately.
You've been studying hard, right?

759
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,045
Right, darling?

760
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,047
-Yes, darling.
-Right.

761
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,174
I see. Please come in.

762
00:52:58,258 --> 00:52:59,259
-Sure.
-Okay.

763
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,056
This way.

764
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,270
How's Anderson and his lady doing?

765
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,106
-They just started the tour.
-Good.

766
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,074
Pasta and wine.

767
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,212
Thank you.

768
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,049
Okay.

769
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,241
For the next three hours,
this building will be yours.

770
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,537
And I'll be by your side, guiding you.

771
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,164
First, you'll have your meal.

772
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,458
We've prepared a meal at Gallery C.

773
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,836
Actually,
we'd like to look at the art first.

774
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,842
When I was in LA…

775
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,932
Every time I felt that way,
I visited The Broad.

776
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,853
The art pieces touched my heart.

777
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,732
That's when I started to… Right. Study.

778
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,401
Study art.

779
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,947
The library sold some delicious hotdogs.

780
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,993
And the hotdogs… Gosh, I still miss them.

781
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,255
This painting is We, Forever by Ali Osman.

782
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,009
It expresses everlasting love.

783
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:13,995
Mr. Anderson prepared a surprise proposal.

784
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,956
Please come forward, sir.

785
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,960
-Me?
-Yes.

786
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,255
Me?

787
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,299
Yes. Come on.

788
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,974
Here's the ring you told me to keep.

789
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,101
The ring?

790
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,018
Yes.

791
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,689
Right, the ring.

792
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,985
Come on.

793
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,286
Mr. Anderson, now is the time.

794
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,297
-Come on.
-Right.

795
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,517
Please accept my love.

796
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,897
Say it with more love.
A bit more romantically.

797
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,541
I'm on cloud nine.

798
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,461
Here comes the highlight of the proposal.

799
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,553
Kiss.

800
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,514
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

801
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:41,100
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

802
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,646
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

803
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,981
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

804
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,399
I'll do that later.

805
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,818
-Mr. Anderson?
-Yes?

806
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,780
You can't postpone a kiss.

807
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,740
Do you truly love her?

808
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,742
Yes, I do love her.

809
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,912
I really do, but…

810
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,374
But I feel a bit uncomfortable
doing it here.

811
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,521
That was so beautiful, you guys.

812
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,489
This is such a magical night

813
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,325
I will never forget.

814
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,794
I will never forget this night either.

815
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,995
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

816
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,290
-Your wedding, love forever
-Your wedding, love forever

817
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,251
-Don't fight
-Don't fight

818
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:57,422
-From black hair to white hair
-From black hair to white hair

819
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,342
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

820
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,554
-Your wedding, love forever
-Your wedding, love forever

821
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,222
-Don't fight
-Don't fight

822
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:10,059
-From black hair to white hair
-From black hair to white hair

823
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,904
What's up with your outfits?

824
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,824
Are you Go stones or what?

825
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,537
Have one each.

826
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,582
You'll be awake and happy.

827
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,973
It's tasty.

828
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,018
We're a team now, so you should chat.

829
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,020
You're so pretty.

830
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,439
You too.

831
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,026
What's your lipstick color?

832
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,030
I see. It suits you perfectly.

833
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,283
It's like listening to two ghosts talking.

834
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,413
What's taking them so long
to enter the office?

835
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,581
Gosh.

836
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:18,920
William Dayne

837
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:22,590
often portrayed the inner most thoughts
that people have in his paintings.

838
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,345
You must be tired.

839
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,888
You should sit down.

840
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,111
Yes, there's something we want to see.

841
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,655
There is one.

842
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:47,990
We heard

843
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:54,121
that Jackson Martin's Nothing
was in this gallery.

844
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:58,376
You're indeed art enthusiasts
who know your onions.

845
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,170
I'm terribly sorry,

846
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:06,050
but that piece isn't exhibited
for the public, so you cannot see it.

847
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:16,394
We were thinking about buying
some paintings today.

848
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,439
You sure have gotten better in Korean.

849
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,735
We can buy some at other galleries.

850
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,654
-Let's go.
-Okay.

851
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,738
What a disappointment.

852
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:29,991
-Let's go.
-Okay.

853
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,910
Nothing is…

854
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,086
in my office.

855
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,880
This way, please.

856
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,049
Let's take a look before we go.

857
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,261
-Okay.
-This way, please.

858
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,348
Please stop this and leave.

859
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,058
I want to see the director.

860
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,685
Come back tomorrow morning.

861
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:03,649
No. One of the pieces displayed in there
has plagiarized my work.

862
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,694
I just need to get seomthing.

863
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,195
It won't take long.

864
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,991
What and where is it?
Tell us, and we'll get it for you.

865
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,662
It's very personal and is a secret.

866
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,748
-Just let me go inside.
-I can't.

867
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,833
I want to see the director!

868
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,628
-Please stop yelling.
-Is this how you do your job?

869
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,465
Which agency do you belong to?
I said I won't be long.

870
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,133
If she's not coming out, I'll go.

871
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,344
I'll call the police.

872
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,012
I've already called them. Move.

873
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,180
Stop her.

874
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,848
-Please stop.
-Stop her.

875
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,476
-My father…
-You trampled on my passion!

876
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,227
You cannot enter, ma'am.

877
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,703
This must be Nothing.

878
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,874
Ms. Bening, that's a floor lamp.

879
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,584
Ji-eun, turn on the floor lamp.

880
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,543
Turning on the floor lamp.

881
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,133
It's an AI.

882
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,429
How pretty.

883
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,347
Yes?

884
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,099
Your sense of humor has improved.

885
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,650
Someone must be living here.

886
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,362
Why is there a doormat here?
It's about my foot size.

887
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:35,408
This right here is
Jackson Martin's Nothing.

888
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,163
He has portrayed the emptiness
of material culture

889
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:44,291
through his sixth sense.

890
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:54,635
As soon as I saw it, I could feel
the emptiness from the footprints.

891
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,512
-You can, right?
-Yes, those heels.

892
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,014
It amazes you even more,

893
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,849
-the more you look.
-Right.

894
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,267
Ma'am.

895
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,477
How dare you barge in here?

896
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,562
What is it?

897
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,231
Some strange women are demanding
to see you.

898
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,691
They even called the police.

899
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,529
Nothing.

900
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,489
-Mr. Anderson and Ms. Bening.
-Yes?

901
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,825
-Please take your time.
-Sure. No worries.

902
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,035
All right.

903
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:26,208
-Oh, I'm so sad.
-Are you?

904
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,009
Let's see.

905
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,473
I mean, Ms. Hong.

906
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,268
-Okay. Put it in.
-Okay.

907
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,519
Hold on.

908
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:46,854
Hurry.

909
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,610
FATE PIANO ACADEMY, SEO MI-RI

910
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,446
We did it.

911
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,786
I've inserted the thumbstick.

912
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,796
CONNECTING TO REMOTE PC

913
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,932
How long will it take?

914
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,726
Anywhere between one…

915
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,020
or ten minutes.

916
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,565
Why is the gap so big?
Don't toy with my heart like that.

917
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,151
-Hit the glass.
-Hit the glass.

918
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,209
-Drink.
-Drink.

919
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,919
-Here comes the alcohol
-Here comes the alcohol

920
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,838
-Drink
-Drink

921
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,548
Shot.

922
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:02,429
-Well done.
-One more.

923
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:07,768
What the hell are you guys doing?

924
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,646
Are you the director? Gosh, you're tall.

925
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,860
-Why do you have plagiarized art?
-Why won't you let me in?

926
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,444
Something that's mine is in there.

927
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,947
What is this nonsense?

928
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:20,990
Plagiarism?

929
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,702
What's that?

930
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,043
Over here.

931
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,503
Police.

932
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,715
We heard there's plagiarized art.
Detective Jeon, go on.

933
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,551
Who's the director here?

934
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,137
Why is it taking so long?

935
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,930
Let's be patient.

936
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:52,646
She did it.

937
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,607
Here you go.

938
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,276
Is it my turn now?

939
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,279
SHARED DOCUMENTS

940
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,908
Let's see.

941
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,536
"International transactions…"

942
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,664
Why are they all in English?

943
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,834
-Didn't I tell you to study English?
-What is this?

944
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,377
You know that advertisement.

945
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,005
"If you can't speak English,
come to Deoun School.

946
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,673
You too? Me too. Her too."

947
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,509
An accountant doesn't need
to learn English.

948
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:25,471
Here it is. "International transactions."

949
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:32,645
How long will it take?

950
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:36,357
Please wait one minute.

951
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,194
My thighs are drenched with sweat.
Please hurry.

952
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:44,031
My armpits are sweaty as well.
Don't rush me.

953
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,868
COPYING 4 FILES FROM MANAGEMENT TO PROJECT

954
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:53,415
Lee Song-baek's unique touch is
clearly visible in this painting.

955
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,458
Plagiarism?

956
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,963
-Do you want to see mine?
-Let's see it.

957
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,218
Ma'am, what did you leave behind in here?

958
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,472
There it is.

959
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,155
It's still sweet.

960
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:29,243
Why would you chew it again?

961
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,120
Look at my painting.

962
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:33,372
This looks nothing like that painting.

963
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,457
The lines, colors, feelings,

964
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,834
and the impression…

965
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,295
They're awfully similar.

966
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,088
It looks pretty much identical.

967
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:42,798
They're the same.

968
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,092
They pretty much duplicated her painting.

969
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,428
Why are you doing this to me?

970
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,479
Even my calves are sweaty now.
What's taking you so long?

971
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,874
COPYING 4 FILES FROM MANAGEMENT TO PROJECT

972
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,175
It's done. Remove the thumbstick.

973
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,612
Yes?

974
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:50,741
What are you doing,
Mr. Anderson and Ms. Bening?

975
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,958
Oh, no. I think she caught them.

976
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,460
I knew something was off.

977
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,047
How come my ominous feelings
are always right?

978
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,008
You're not a couple, are you?
What are you after?

979
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:10,844
We're caught.

980
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,599
What are you saying?

981
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,818
We're agents from AISE,

982
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,278
the foreign intelligence service of Italy.

983
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:41,250
We're looking into paintings
that have been smuggled from Italy.

984
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,378
We've received a tip-off

985
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,005
that some of them ended up here.

986
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,090
Get them!

987
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:07,860
Don't move.

988
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:16,577
Are you guys really agents from Italy?

989
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,745
Name, Jung Do-hee.

990
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,457
It says you graduated
from Parsons School of Design,

991
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,916
but that's been fabricated.

992
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,418
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

993
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,421
You also didn't win
the Giovanni Award in Italy

994
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:29,756
or the Emerson Award in the US.

995
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,966
How did you know?

996
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:33,385
Our Korean agent tipped us off.

997
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:35,304
Come in.

998
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,479
The two intelligence services
are working together.

999
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,607
Tell us the truth.
How many pieces have you smuggled in?

1000
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,735
None of our pieces have been smuggled.

1001
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:50,777
It's the truth.

1002
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,404
-Don't lie!
-Tell the truth.

1003
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,114
-Do you think we're joking?
-Do you?

1004
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,074
-Talk, or I'll shoot you.
-Hurry up.

1005
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,869
-Just one piece, sir.
-Which one is it?

1006
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:00,579
The portrait of Antonioni.

1007
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,797
Wait. One minute.

1008
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,594
Everything will be fine
once I return the painting, right?

1009
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,846
Can you give me your word
there won't be any trouble?

1010
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,014
Yes.

1011
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:21,475
Hand it over to him,
and he'll take care of the rest.

1012
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,770
-Do you mean him?
-What is it?

1013
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,481
Do you think I'd sell it?

1014
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,734
A bit.

1015
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,195
Split it seven to three?

1016
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,867
Good work, guys.

1017
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,202
Thank you, sir.

1018
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,831
Make sure you erase
all the CCTV footage of us.

1019
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:49,670
But that will take too long.

1020
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,213
Answer me.

1021
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:53,382
Fine.

1022
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,385
If you ever need to flee the country,

1023
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,013
call this number.
It's an affiliated company.

1024
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:01,723
What?

1025
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:04,851
"Byebye Balloon"?

1026
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,147
"A trip just for you"?

1027
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,104
We've arrived, boss.

1028
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,960
I had such a blast acting today.

1029
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,379
Me too.

1030
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,215
There was even a kissing scene.

1031
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,927
Right, there was.

1032
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,182
I'm sorry if I caught you off guard.

1033
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,809
It's okay.

1034
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:41,031
Stop it already.

1035
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:42,824
It's so embarrassing.

1036
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:12,521
Ms. Hong.

1037
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,775
Should we have a celebratory drink
on the rooftop?

1038
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,194
Sure.

1039
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:22,239
Should we order jokbal or chicken?

1040
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,199
Or we could just buy some beef jerky.

1041
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,375
What's wrong? Do you not like beef jerky?

1042
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,504
Ms. Hong.

1043
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:42,509
I'll go upstairs and prepare everything.
Can you go buy some beer?

1044
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,177
There's not much to prepare.

1045
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,179
You just want to send me on an errand.

1046
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,682
When I went up two days ago,

1047
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,934
there were boxes piled up there.

1048
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:51,935
Again?

1049
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,604
Gosh. Who is it this time?

1050
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,274
Get some beer. I'll go up first.

1051
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,196
There are boxes up there again? Jeez.

1052
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,653
Did Paolo send you?

1053
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,156
Perhaps.

1054
