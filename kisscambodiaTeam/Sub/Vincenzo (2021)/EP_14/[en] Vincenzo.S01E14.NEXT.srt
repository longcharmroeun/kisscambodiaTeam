1
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:18,193
Five.

2
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:20,278
Four.

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,197
Three.

4
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:24,032
Two.

5
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,367
One.

6
00:00:58,775 --> 00:00:59,609
That was awesome.

7
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:05,990
I feel like I'm a Mafia from the '60s.

8
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,289
Enjoy it.
See how it feels to be a real villain.

9
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:38,356
Keep it up!

10
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,045
Escort the chairman out
right now, you morons!

11
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,463
Are you okay, sir?

12
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,675
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

13
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,385
Be careful.

14
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:09,846
-Stop taking pictures!
-Come out!

15
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,848
-This way, please.
-Be careful.

16
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,975
-Coming through!
-Hurry up!

17
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,768
Move out of the way!

18
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,146
-Stop taking pictures!
-No pictures!

19
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:19,898
Stop that!

20
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,025
-Come this way.
-No pictures!

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,035
Make way.

22
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,578
Cover him properly.

23
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:35,663
Hurry up over there!

24
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:37,165
What are you doing over there?

25
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:39,667
-Gosh, seriously.
-What is it now?

26
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:41,169
Namdongbu Prosecution Service.

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,962
Mr. Jang.

28
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,882
You're under arrest
for leading anti-union activities.

29
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,134
-You have the right to remain--
-Cut it out.

30
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,594
There's no evidence.

31
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,596
What we saw back there is enough evidence.

32
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,848
That doesn't count!

33
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:03,733
There's no conclusive evidence.

34
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,196
Stop taking pictures!
Or I'll sue all of you.

35
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,121
I'll come with Mr. Jang.

36
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,332
You know me, right?

37
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:26,756
Let's go.

38
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,132
Hurry up, everyone.

39
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:30,051
Keep reporters under control.

40
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,011
Get moving! Get to work!

41
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:35,348
Gosh, why did they have to take pictures?

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,938
Why did you bring these two in?

43
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,732
You should lock up these punks.

44
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:49,028
They poured pig blood over him.
This is assault.

45
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,281
-It's not assault. It's a prank.
-Hey.

46
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,366
I pulled a little prank
on my beloved friend.

47
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,370
Between you and me,
a prank like this is no biggie,

48
00:03:58,413 --> 00:03:59,539
right, Han-seok?

49
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:03,501
A "prank"? That's just nonsense!

50
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:05,420
Charge them now.

51
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:09,299
The video that played on the screen
is obviously fabricated.

52
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,383
Anyone could see that.

53
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:14,095
Shouldn't you have verified the video
before arresting him?

54
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:16,556
Right. If it's been acquired
in an illegal manner,

55
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,183
I'll raise an issue right away.

56
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,145
Just you wait. Let me see.

57
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,606
-Where is it?
-Even without the video,

58
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,943
the Vision Team's documents are
good enough evidence.

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,158
What's that?

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,411
Anyway…

61
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:43,791
what's the evidence

62
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,920
that the attorney for the union leader's
family brought?

63
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,214
Do you even have any?

64
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:52,800
Do you?

65
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:02,727
Here's testimony from the man
who ran over the union leader

66
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,437
under the influence.

67
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,154
Tell us the truth.

68
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:16,949
I was told

69
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,411
to run over the union leader while drunk.

70
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:25,166
They promised me 200 million won
and an early release with manslaughter.

71
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,043
Who promised you that?

72
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,461
Lawyer Seo Seong-wan of Wusang.

73
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,634
Why are you telling us this?

74
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,636
I heard about an old case.

75
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,055
Wusang had a man

76
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,642
run over a lawyer,
promising him a reduced sentence.

77
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,936
But he died in prison.

78
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,273
I don't want to be killed off like that.

79
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,320
Gosh, too bad for Mr. Seo.

80
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,240
He joined Lomborgheni
a couple of days ago.

81
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,159
In addition to anti-union activities,

82
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,829
all of you will be charged
with aiding and abetting murder.

83
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,164
-What?
-Me, too?

84
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:07,834
He said it was Mr. Seo.

85
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,712
Do whatever you want.
We have nothing else to say.

86
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:13,881
They say silence is golden,

87
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,593
but a villain's silence is
a warehouse of sins.

88
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,346
Shut up, you Mafia bastard!

89
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,140
-Gosh.
-Watch your mouth!

90
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,559
You rude brat. How old are you?

91
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:25,893
I was born in 1993.

92
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,311
How old are you?

93
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:30,106
Sit back down!
I was born in the Year of the Snake.

94
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,858
Me, too.

95
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,540
An Italian Mafia scumbag

96
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,212
is pretending to be a hero for justice.
That's ridiculous.

97
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,342
A hero for justice, my ass.

98
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,432
I'm just a scumbag who cleans up scum.

99
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,645
I can never stand scumbags

100
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,940
that stink more than me.

101
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,631
May we leave now?

102
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,010
Let's go, Ms. Hong.

103
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,137
Sure, Mr. Cassano.

104
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,103
What?

105
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,943
What? What is it? You little…

106
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,737
What are you smiling for?

107
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,084
I bet they never imagined they would
be investigated together.

108
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,336
I'm sure they'll be released tonight,

109
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,965
but it'll be a night to remember
for Jang Han-seok.

110
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:22,051
I'd say the smoke grenade
went off quite successfully.

111
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,763
Our target isn't the anti-union documents.

112
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:28,015
Then what is our target?

113
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,602
Once you obtain Vision Team's data,
in addition to the anti-union documents,

114
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,730
secure the evidence on Chairman
Jang Han-seok's paper company.

115
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,651
His paper company is
Mr. Jung's second target, right?

116
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:42,446
We'll use the anti-union case
as a decoy to divert attention.

117
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,031
"Make a sound in the east,
then strike in the west."

118
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:47,076
You really are a consigliere.

119
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,453
What does that mean?

120
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,873
Diverting the enemy's attention…

121
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:54,166
Oh, hello.

122
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,004
And attack when they least expect it.

123
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,631
That's clever.

124
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:02,300
Listen up.

125
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:05,219
Even with the most solid evidence,

126
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:07,847
anti-union activities can't send
Jang Han-seok to prison.

127
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,224
He'll make someone else take the fall.

128
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,475
Right.

129
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,936
Even if he is indicted,
his sentence won't be long.

130
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,898
Our goal regarding the union should be

131
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:22,320
to force Babel to fully recognize
their union.

132
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,740
If this goes well,

133
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,533
we can finish off Han-seok at once.

134
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,619
A prison sentence
and an astronomical fine.

135
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,662
I don't understand a word,

136
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,873
but I'm all for finishing him off at once!

137
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,627
Let's get things moving
before the smoke clears.

138
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:48,846
Okay.

139
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:50,723
Have him ready.

140
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:57,146
The Vision Team leader is
in the next room.

141
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,981
He'll be confronted with the chairman.

142
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,860
Mr. Seo of Wusang is
also being brought in.

143
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:05,446
My goodness.

144
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,449
Mr. Jung.

145
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm the one who ordered
the anti-union activities.

146
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:21,337
My brother

147
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,173
knows nothing about it.

148
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,643
He took up his position
just a few days ago.

149
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:36,894
Until then…

150
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:40,314
I managed the whole thing

151
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,026
and gave the orders. I'm sorry.

152
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,071
Vice Chairman.

153
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,574
Why don't you calm down a little?

154
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:52,076
No, I'm fine.

155
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:57,873
Ask me anything.
I'll answer as thoroughly as I can.

156
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,388
Haven't you left yet?

157
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,641
What kind of investigation is this
to hold them up like this?

158
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:18,144
Do you have any idea
what's going on inside Babel?

159
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,689
Sir.

160
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,275
Are you intervening in our investigation?

161
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:25,860
That's not it.

162
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:29,405
I'm just here to give you information.

163
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,323
There's a group of Babel employees

164
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,452
who served the former chairman
and are unhappy

165
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,036
with Chairman Jang's takeover.

166
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,915
This is their plot against him
to kick him out.

167
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,041
Isn't it obvious?

168
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,003
-That's news to me.
-News to you?

169
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,881
How are you going to investigate
with so little information?

170
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:50,009
In that case, the Vision Team leader

171
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:53,053
might have been a part of the plot
all along.

172
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,639
Come to think of it,

173
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:58,225
Mr. Seo left the company

174
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,395
complaining about
his poor performance reviews.

175
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:06,358
Anyway, send these people home
and start the investigation over.

176
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,735
I can't do that!

177
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:10,070
These people
need to be investigated first.

178
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,907
The press will be all over you
for a botched investigation.

179
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,366
Start over.

180
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,708
Be thorough this time.

181
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,559
Mr. Nam, have you found anything?

182
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,312
Yes, I found a suspicious looking company.

183
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,236
It says, "Jason Fund needs
to expand its workforce."

184
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,654
It's located in Malta.

185
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,240
And it's called "Jason"?

186
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,661
Jang Joon-woo went by Jason at Wusang.

187
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,871
And if you look over here…

188
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,582
They have a branch in Korea as well.

189
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,919
It says, "establishing a security network
for Jason Fund Korea."

190
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:11,757
That must mean
that their accounting is managed in Korea.

191
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:16,470
That's all I could find. No locations,
no phone numbers, no nothing.

192
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:21,058
I wish we knew someone
familiar with paper companies.

193
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,977
Mr. Cassano.

194
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:24,979
Yes?

195
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:27,022
It's not an appealing idea,

196
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,192
but we might know an expert
who we can consult.

197
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,112
An expert?

198
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,157
You came to the right person.

199
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:40,119
Money laundering and tax evasion
are my expertise.

200
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,747
You used to run a mom-and-pop store.

201
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:45,916
My boss…

202
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,045
is second to none when it comes
to financial crimes.

203
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,839
He's number one.

204
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:52,923
Hey.

205
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:55,384
Is that even a compliment?

206
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,094
Should I be happy or not?

207
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,681
Even a mom-and-pop store

208
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,683
works the same way as a conglomerate.

209
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,895
I'm a bookkeeper
specialized in money laundering.

210
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,439
I can also cook the books.

211
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:16,405
You should give us a presentation
at Jipuragi soon.

212
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:20,034
Let me see if you'll be of any help.

213
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:21,952
Hold on.

214
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,623
What's in it for me?

215
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:27,583
Isn't Babel your enemy, too?

216
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,337
You almost died
in a freezer recently, right?

217
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,714
Jeez, that brings back terrible memories.

218
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:37,885
You're right.
It was horrible. How did I forget that?

219
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:41,513
I don't even want to think about it.
My toes were frostbitten.

220
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,975
Mr. Park, let's get back at them.

221
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,852
Let's do that.

222
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:48,979
They even took all my money.

223
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,440
What am I doing here?

224
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:55,194
Those Babel bastards…

225
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,159
-Good work.
-Cheers.

226
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:04,620
Those little rats.

227
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,961
The Chief Prosecutor sure came up
with a solid story for us.

228
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,796
He's worth every penny.

229
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,049
Hey, Brother.

230
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:19,426
-Yes?
-I appreciate your kind gesture,

231
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,471
but you shouldn't take the rap
for such a trivial charge.

232
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:27,476
Take the fall for paper companies,
tax evasion, illegal stock acquisitions.

233
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,271
That's when you can really prove
how loyal you are to me.

234
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,065
Of course, sir.

235
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,028
Back there, I got ahead of myself.

236
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:39,780
Don't worry.

237
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,492
I'll do anything for you.

238
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:47,955
My, this is beautiful.

239
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:50,499
I love the wine.

240
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,088
You should've told me first--

241
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,105
My heart really sank back there.

242
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,566
How could you do that
without discussing with me?

243
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,860
I thought that would be…

244
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:22,114
the best deal for me.

245
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:26,035
Did you think Chairman Jang
wouldn't see through that?

246
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,746
My goodness. You frustrate me.

247
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,330
The other charges include

248
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:33,125
tax evasion, illegal stock acquisitions…

249
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,210
They're too much.

250
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,713
Well, I agree with you.

251
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:41,425
I doubt that Mr. Jung has
any substantial evidence,

252
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:44,803
but if Vincenzo uses his tactics
and finds more evidence,

253
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,638
-it's going to--
-Mr. Han.

254
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:47,598
Yes?

255
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,350
I have a favor to ask you.

256
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,561
Sure, what is it?

257
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,024
Arrange a meeting with Vincenzo.

258
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:58,192
With Vincenzo?

259
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,318
Yes.

260
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:03,197
The sooner, the better.

261
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,408
A prosecutor's botched investigation

262
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,203
almost framed Chairman Jang of Babel

263
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,998
for leading the company's
anti-union activities.

264
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:16,502
But the truth was stronger
than negligence.

265
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:19,379
It turned out
that the plot was orchestrated

266
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:23,675
by Director Kim and Team Leader Park,

267
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,303
who were opposed to Chairman Jang…

268
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:28,555
I'm sorry things turned out
like this again.

269
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:30,140
It's fine.

270
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:32,893
The anti-union activities
were only a decoy.

271
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,605
We'll start looking for evidence
of paper companies.

272
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,023
Thank you.

273
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,363
All we need is a Pandora's box
to end all this.

274
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,074
What are you referring to?

275
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,368
Haven't you heard of it?

276
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:51,995
The Guillotine file.

277
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:53,872
I have.

278
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:56,375
It was revealed
when a meeting agenda was leaked.

279
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,584
That's right.

280
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,838
Right now, no one knows where the file is.

281
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:05,384
Once we get our hands on it,
all the corrupt politicians, lawyers,

282
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:08,303
and businessmen in the country
can be put behind bars.

283
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,014
-Is it that powerful?
-Yes.

284
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,142
It's beyond our imagination.

285
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,524
Mr. Cho.

286
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,906
You're here.

287
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,589
How could you make such a mistake?

288
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,299
It was finally time.

289
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:46,341
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:51,471
I was too flustered to think about
the iris recognition device.

291
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,975
Now, without opening the secret room,
we can't get the Guillotine file.

292
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:56,018
I'll…

293
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,645
come up with a solution.

294
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:02,024
For now,

295
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,735
let's leave it to Vincenzo.

296
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:09,489
He might be able to find a way.

297
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,338
Well…

298
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,883
Here.

299
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,095
Oh, my.

300
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,559
Is this for me?

301
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,365
This is gorgeous.

302
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:59,039
You wrote a letter, too.

303
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:01,291
Hold on. Not now.

304
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,335
Please read it at home.

305
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:06,296
Okay.

306
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,093
Thank you so much.

307
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,887
Oh, right.

308
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:15,889
Let's give her our gift.

309
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:20,936
-Here.
-Thank you.

310
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,814
My goodness.

311
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:33,031
You brought me bungeoppang?

312
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:36,576
I love these.

313
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,668
Eat slowly.

314
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,546
Okay. I appreciate it.

315
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,966
You two should have some, too.

316
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,270
It's so good.

317
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,943
It's really tasty.

318
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:15,532
Right.

319
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,243
I'll tell you what.

320
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,455
Do you know the difference
between bungeoppang and ingeoppang?

321
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:25,751
What is it?

322
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:31,882
Bungeoppang looks
as if it's saying, "bung."

323
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,842
Ingeoppang looks as if it's saying…

324
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,430
"ing."

325
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,641
Isn't it funny?

326
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,896
Oh, I see.

327
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,984
I never would've guessed that.

328
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:00,911
Hello?

329
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:04,706
Hello, this is Han Seung-hyuk of Wusang.

330
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,334
Why are you calling me,
Mr. Han Seung-hyuk?

331
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:11,671
I have a very important appointment
tonight.

332
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,132
Can you come alone?

333
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:43,870
Keum Gwang-jin.

334
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:45,914
Here.

335
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,792
See? He's right here.

336
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,921
Mr. Keum Gwang-jin
is going to come to our plaza tomorrow.

337
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,965
-I see.
-I see.

338
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:57,634
Then shouldn't we have to pay him?

339
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:01,054
Well, he usually gets two million
for each exploration.

340
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:05,517
But since we're almost like brothers,
he'll do it for free.

341
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,228
-Really? For free?
-Of course.

342
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,063
Would this really be okay?

343
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:13,024
If Mr. Cassano finds out, he'll be upset.

344
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,735
Right, with what happened last time…

345
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:17,612
Then this time,

346
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,240
just use me as an excuse.
Tell him I did it.

347
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,450
I guess that's a good idea.

348
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,828
Then we'll pretend we don't know anything.

349
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,416
We'll pretend we didn't know
and watch what he's doing.

350
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,334
All right.

351
00:23:32,335 --> 00:23:34,087
See this article?

352
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,798
See how he found the gold? Where is this?

353
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,592
This is driving me crazy.

354
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,144
Sir, Mr. Cassano is here.

355
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,942
I finally get to talk to you in private.

356
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:58,320
Sorry for cursing at you yesterday.

357
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:02,073
Well, it was an understandable situation.

358
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,534
You can make up today.

359
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,244
Yes, let's bury the hatchet.

360
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,582
What do you want?

361
00:24:14,836 --> 00:24:15,879
Mr. Cassano.

362
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,341
I know this is an informal meeting,

363
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,135
but you should still have manners.

364
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:25,180
I'm not here to show my manners.
If you don't like it, just leave.

365
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,058
I may look young,
but I'm much older than you.

366
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:29,392
Look at me.

367
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,563
He really is a Mafia member.

368
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:36,358
It's fine, I like this dark vibe.

369
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,609
Right. It's nice.

370
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:40,820
He's like a total gangster. My gosh.

371
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:49,746
Let me ask you something first.

372
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,333
Do you have to destroy me too?

373
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,756
Is your goal to destroy me
along with my brother?

374
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,428
If that's not the case,

375
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,640
then you can have him.

376
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:13,395
I'll help you kill my brother as you wish,

377
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:16,523
so just leave me and Babel alone.

378
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:19,901
Our vice chairman

379
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:23,196
has made a very tough decision.

380
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:26,324
Forget it. Just go.

381
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,285
You're the one who came here.

382
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:31,162
I never exploit betrayal within a family.

383
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:34,749
Why would you care about that
when you need to win?

384
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,585
Take care of your family matters
on your own.

385
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,796
I won't get involved in it. Okay?

386
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:45,093
By the way, why is it
that you don't do that?

387
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,806
Because if I exploit
a betrayal within other families,

388
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,727
my own family might betray me in the end.

389
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:56,855
So keep that in mind.

390
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,116
He's acting all cool, isn't he?

391
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,911
He's pretending to be a family man
when he's a Mafia.

392
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:14,122
Oh, he drank from this.

393
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:20,920
GEUMGA PLAZA

394
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:32,640
I will begin the presentation.

395
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:41,316
First, what is a paper company?
You, what is it?

396
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:44,652
A company that makes paper.

397
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,237
-You're so ignorant.
-Jeez.

398
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:49,199
"A company that makes paper"?
Seriously, honey?

399
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:51,618
-You should say "paper manufacturer."
-Oh, right.

400
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:52,827
This is ridiculous.

401
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,121
Well, many people think that.

402
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:56,873
But a paper company

403
00:26:56,956 --> 00:27:00,418
is an inactive company
that only exists on paper.

404
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:01,836
A ghost company!

405
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,630
It's not a ghost company.

406
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:05,882
-It's not?
-It may seem like it,

407
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,133
but it's actually legal.

408
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:09,552
That's the key point.

409
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:11,930
So many company executives use them

410
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,765
for purposes other than just business.

411
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,518
They evade taxes
or buy stocks under borrowed names

412
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,269
to increase their shares illegally.

413
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:21,689
I have no idea what you're saying.
Anyway, it's something bad, right?

414
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,483
-It's very bad!
-Okay.

415
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:27,153
So they don't pay taxes,
and break the law.

416
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:30,115
And along with going to jail,

417
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,075
they'd have to pay a huge penalty tax.

418
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:34,452
It could be up to several trillion won.

419
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:38,123
If Jang Han-seok gets caught, he'll have
to pay at least a hundred billion won.

420
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,249
By the way…

421
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:43,253
he must've set up something in Korea

422
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,880
to launder and manage his money.

423
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,550
It wasn't on the files, though.

424
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,677
We only found evidence of tax evasion

425
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,222
and using illegal methods
to gain Babel E&amp;C stocks.

426
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,432
Babel E&amp;C?

427
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,310
Hang on.

428
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,730
I think I'm figuring it out.

429
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:04,149
What do you mean?

430
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:05,608
You know Na Deok-jin, right?

431
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,026
Yes.

432
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,488
He said he did some work
for a paper company before.

433
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:11,906
I see.

434
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:16,035
What's he been doing since he got fired?

435
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:19,456
Hello! I'm Singing Mr. Na!

436
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,376
Which is the answer?

437
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,129
SINGING MR. NA

438
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:31,718
Tapping chopsticks together

439
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:39,225
Let's make a rhythm
To the beat of tapping chopsticks

440
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:46,399
And sing a song tonight

441
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:51,070
If you have lingering feelings

442
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:54,699
Look at the passing time

443
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:58,495
And if your heart is burning with passion

444
00:28:58,578 --> 00:29:02,373
Sing a song of love

445
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,084
Life circles round and round

446
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,212
-You've never been to places like this?
-What?

447
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:09,923
-You've never been to a place like this?
-Never.

448
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:13,426
This is a Korean style club.

449
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,762
Tapping chopsticks together

450
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:17,806
Hey, you!

451
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,973
Stop singing!

452
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,725
What did you just throw?

453
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:23,812
I'd sing better than you
even if I sang through my nostrils!

454
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,230
Jeez!

455
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:27,065
Don't throw stuff at him!

456
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:30,568
It's not illegal to be a bad singer.

457
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,237
What's with him?

458
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,989
I guess he's pretty drunk.

459
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,534
She's right.
You didn't need to throw stuff at him.

460
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:45,333
I made a resolution
while sleeping in my car for a month.

461
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,753
"I will achieve my dream.
I'll live my life to the fullest!

462
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,839
Where are you, my bluebird?"

463
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:55,134
So I was reborn

464
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:57,387
as a Trot singer, Singing Mr. Na.

465
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:59,889
You should try sleeping in your car again.

466
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,058
You may find another dream.

467
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,018
I can't. I sold my car.

468
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,771
By the way, who is she?

469
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:11,442
Remember the lawyer Hong Yu-chan
of Geumga Plaza?

470
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:12,610
I hated him.

471
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:13,778
You little…

472
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,240
I'm his daughter,

473
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,325
Lawyer Hong Cha-young.

474
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,911
Oh, that lunatic?

475
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:25,874
You better answer my questions honestly.

476
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:27,625
Yes, sir!

477
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:31,337
You know Jason Fund, right?
Jang Han-seok's paper company.

478
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:32,589
Jason…

479
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:34,716
How would I know that?

480
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:37,427
I do.

481
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:42,390
Tell us everything you know.
And everything you don't know.

482
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:48,354
ATTORNEY CHOI MYUNG-HEE

483
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:50,732
CHOI MYUNG-HEE

484
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:54,235
-Yes, Ms. Choi.
-I found

485
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,864
the easiest and surest way
to get rid of Vincenzo.

486
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,824
What is it?

487
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,410
"Yi yi je yi."

488
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,204
What is that?
I'm not good with Chinese idioms.

489
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:12,462
"Use other enemies
to get rid of your enemies."

490
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:14,714
Give me more details.

491
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,592
Yes.

492
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,431
One of the jobs I was tasked with
was sending development information

493
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,060
to the paper company office.

494
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,438
Where was it?

495
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,941
It was disguised as something else,
of course.

496
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,610
It was a place called Ragusang Gallery.

497
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,821
Through the gallery,

498
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:42,283
they're laundering money with art pieces

499
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,912
and buying Babel E&amp;C stocks
under the paper company's name

500
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:49,165
to increase the CEO's shares

501
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,626
illegally.

502
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,589
Then the financial documents
must be there, too.

503
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:58,758
Yes, of course.

504
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:14,315
Their accountant
works in the director's office.

505
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:20,655
I think the director is keeping her there
and managing the accounts herself.

506
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:24,075
MONTHLY EXPENSES AND FINANCE

507
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:25,451
What about security?

508
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,370
Mr. Vincenzo!

509
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:30,498
It's an art gallery.
Security is tight, of course.

510
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,002
There are guards lined up
in front of the director's office.

511
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,170
And to enter the office,

512
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,297
you need this.

513
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:43,219
The director's fingerprint.

514
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,054
Anything else?

515
00:32:46,222 --> 00:32:47,515
Anything else?

516
00:32:49,392 --> 00:32:50,935
Oh, I didn't know this either,

517
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:54,856
but I heard there's this art piece
inside her office.

518
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:58,109
I can't remember exactly,
but apparently it's really expensive.

519
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:02,989
I don't know the artist, but the piece
was titled Nothing.

520
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:10,371
No, not like that.

521
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:21,883
All right. You have to welcome him
with a big round of applause.

522
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,927
But why is he so late? It's already…

523
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,638
It's past eleven.

524
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:30,475
I'm sure it's because
he had prior engagements.

525
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,145
I guess he really is busy.

526
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:37,231
What will you do
if Mr. Cassano finds out about this?

527
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,568
We didn't call him.
It was Mr. Park who called him.

528
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,527
Seriously?

529
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,613
You all suggested calling him.

530
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:45,490
I'm disappointed in you.

531
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:49,118
No, it's not what you think.

532
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:52,663
If we really end up finding the gold--

533
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:54,624
That must be him!

534
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,626
Gwang-jin!

535
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,941
DOG FINDERS

536
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:26,155
ANIMAL RESCUE TEAM
DOG FINDERS

537
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:42,880
Is that a person or a dog?

538
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,299
Are those dog ears?

539
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,301
-Seok-do!
-Gwang-jin.

540
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,638
Sorry for being late.
I was saving this dog on the way.

541
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,223
I'm sorry.

542
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,183
-I'm sorry, everyone.
-Hello.

543
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:55,184
Why are you…

544
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:58,104
I should've told you earlier.

545
00:34:58,187 --> 00:35:00,857
I quit looking for gold three months ago.

546
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,442
-What?
-Why?

547
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:06,362
I've been looking for gold all my life,

548
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:08,364
but I've felt empty inside.

549
00:35:09,198 --> 00:35:12,827
And one day,
I started raising an abandoned dog.

550
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,996
It just filled my heart.

551
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,292
So I quit everything the very next day
and opened an animal rescue center.

552
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:25,089
You can't imagine how happy I am
doing this job.

553
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:26,841
I understand.

554
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,135
Everyone,

555
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:31,721
real gold isn't in gold mines.

556
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,764
It's inside your hearts.

557
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,309
It really is.

558
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:37,935
So, look for it there.

559
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,438
I'll be off to find more gold now.

560
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:42,607
I'm sorry.

561
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:45,610
-Call me. I'll get going.
-Goodbye.

562
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:46,986
Bye.

563
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,031
Bye.

564
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,451
It's inside our hearts.

565
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,255
Why are you looking so down?

566
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,882
You didn't do anything wrong.

567
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,967
It's all my fault.

568
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:15,097
The truth is, if I were you,

569
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,226
I wouldn't trust
a despicable Mafia member like me.

570
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,435
I understand.

571
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,854
It's not that we don't trust you…

572
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,981
You can do whatever you want.

573
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:28,152
This dirty, despicable Mafia member
will get going now.

574
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:29,779
Mr. Cassano…

575
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,364
Don't say that about yourself.

576
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,200
We're sorry. We didn't mean…

577
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,954
How could you do this?

578
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:41,123
Wait for me, dirty Mafia!

579
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,212
How could you do this?
Wait for me, despicable Mafia!

580
00:36:51,717 --> 00:36:55,137
What would've happened
if he hadn't become an animal rescuer?

581
00:36:55,221 --> 00:36:58,683
It would've been the end
if he had found the gold!

582
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:02,436
Hey, guys.

583
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:13,322
Why don't we talk for a moment?

584
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,076
I don't want to hear
about the ghost underground.

585
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,286
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

586
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,203
Let's go.

587
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,205
The secret basement.

588
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:33,467
You have no idea how scared I was
that they might find the secret basement.

589
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:39,015
What are you talking about?

590
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,851
I feel so anxious every day.

591
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,562
When are you going to get the gold out?

592
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,006
The person who made the security system…

593
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,300
for that room

594
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,634
is me.

595
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,391
The iris recognition program

596
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:24,018
and the demolition program.

597
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,686
I'm the one who made all that.

598
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,854
Hang on.

599
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,524
Why is everyone here so talented?

600
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:32,818
What was your job?

601
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,321
I was a security system programmer,

602
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:36,655
and a hacker before that.

603
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:40,284
But how are you still alive?
All the people involved were--

604
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:43,496
I didn't work at the scene,
so my identity wasn't exposed.

605
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:58,427
But when I heard that
all the workers involved had died,

606
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:00,346
I ran away just in case.

607
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,350
And fortunately,
Wang's men failed to find me.

608
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,689
How did you know
the location of the room, then?

609
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:14,777
I made the system, so I made sure
I could track it, of course.

610
00:39:21,617 --> 00:39:23,119
And why are you telling me this?

611
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:25,037
Gather round.

612
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,750
The gold in the room.

613
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,420
Let's get it out together.

614
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,550
You can't open it since Wang is dead,

615
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:39,677
and if Babel takes this building,
it's over.

616
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,680
Plus, if you make one mistake,
the whole building will collapse.

617
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,684
Can you really open it?

618
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:47,768
Of course.

619
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:50,062
I can open it with the building intact.

620
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:54,733
Since it's come to this,
let's let her join our group.

621
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,821
I can open it if the monks aren't there.

622
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,448
All I need is one minute.

623
00:40:05,744 --> 00:40:08,372
Ms. Seo. Even if you do open it,

624
00:40:09,623 --> 00:40:11,709
it'll take a while to get everything out.

625
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:13,544
There's that much?

626
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:19,884
Just wait a little longer.

627
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,805
And make sure to keep this secret, okay?

628
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,309
I've kept my mouth shut
for the past two years.

629
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:30,478
Don't worry.

630
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,817
All my worries are gone now!

631
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,740
We'll be counting on you, Ms. Seo.

632
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:46,368
Ms. Seo, you're our savior. I mean it.

633
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:58,714
What is this?

634
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,301
I made some tteokbokki for you.

635
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:05,429
And here.

636
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:08,432
I made this dress shirt myself.

637
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,185
I'm a great tailor too.

638
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,439
Oh, you didn't need to.

639
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:23,948
We felt bad since all we did
was accept your kindness so far.

640
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:28,744
And we also brought this
on behalf of all the people in the plaza.

641
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,672
MEMORANDUM

642
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:47,429
THE PEOPLE OF GEUMGA PLAZA
WILL TRUST VINCENZO CASSANO

643
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:49,557
AND SHARE ANYTHING
THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED

644
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:54,770
There's no need to do this
for a dirty, despicable man like me.

645
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:56,480
That's not true!

646
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,942
We really mean what we wrote.
Please accept it.

647
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:04,697
We must have lost our minds
after hearing about all that gold.

648
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,825
We could have been kicked out of here

649
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:09,910
but you protected us all this time.

650
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:11,704
Stop it.

651
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,582
We didn't have any money

652
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,750
or any power.

653
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,212
We've been able to live decently
thanks to you.

654
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:24,216
We even got to help others
and teach those Babel jerks a lesson.

655
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,136
We'll now stop chasing false hope

656
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,346
and focus on protecting our plaza

657
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:31,515
with you.

658
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,274
All right.

659
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:42,693
I will join you again.

660
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:47,031
Gosh. Thank you so much!

661
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:51,910
There's something
we need to do together first.

662
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,621
It's an important matter,

663
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,789
so I'll tell you all about it
tomorrow morning.

664
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,292
All right. Thank you. Get some rest now.

665
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,544
I missed your tteokbokki.

666
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:01,462
Really?

667
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,880
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

668
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:04,089
It's no problem.

669
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:05,257
-Let's go.
-Shall we go?

670
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:06,675
Bye, then.

671
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:08,052
Thank you so much.

672
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:25,027
We're planning to
totally screw Babel over.

673
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,237
It's a very important job.

674
00:43:28,113 --> 00:43:30,574
Then we must all join in.

675
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,827
-Let's do it!
-Yes!

676
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,372
All right, everyone.
This is really important.

677
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:40,000
We need good teamwork for this
above all else. Got it?

678
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,210
-Yes!
-Yes!

679
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:43,712
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

680
00:43:43,796 --> 00:43:45,964
-Yes!
-Let's do this!

681
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:47,549
Let's do this.

682
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:50,928
-Yes!
-Yes!

683
00:43:55,974 --> 00:43:57,601
All right.

684
00:43:57,685 --> 00:43:59,812
-Geumga!
-Geumga!

685
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:01,897
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

686
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,791
So he's secretly laundering
his money with all this.

687
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:24,336
Using art pieces to launder money
is pretty common.

688
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:29,633
"Ragusang." What's with the name?

689
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,803
-What does it mean?
-How elegant.

690
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,310
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

691
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,982
There are guards
in front of the director's office.

692
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:52,739
Then there's probably no point
in forcing ourselves in there.

693
00:44:54,366 --> 00:44:56,577
And there's a security lock
on the door, too.

694
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:01,498
We need to find a way
to get inside naturally.

695
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,505
What should we do

696
00:45:09,882 --> 00:45:12,926
to get in there naturally?

697
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,720
This artist's piece is in Korea?

698
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:27,065
PRIVATE VENUE RENTAL SERVICE

699
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:30,068
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG

700
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:33,197
I looked into the private venue
rental service,

701
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,991
but it's fully booked
for the next two months.

702
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:37,451
I see.

703
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:39,661
It really is fully booked.

704
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:41,330
It's not even that cheap.

705
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:44,666
Let's find another way, then.

706
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:54,468
I've hacked into the reservation list.

707
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,685
GEORGE ANDERSON
JESSICA BENING

708
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:04,895
They look like a couple.

709
00:46:04,978 --> 00:46:06,563
Their reservation is in two days.

710
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:10,275
How about you two disguise as a couple
to get in?

711
00:46:13,195 --> 00:46:14,613
Do you mean him and me?

712
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:17,741
He and I can't be a couple, can we?

713
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:18,784
Hey…

714
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,787
Gosh, that'll be so awkward.

715
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,874
Fine.

716
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:29,086
I'll do it.

717
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:31,838
Here.

718
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,132
Damn it. That was so close.

719
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:39,638
How will we hack
into the accountant's computer?

720
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:42,266
Right, there's a catch.

721
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,727
The director's office uses
Babel's own network,

722
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,479
so it's impossible to hack remotely.

723
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:50,691
I need to install a transmitter
on the computer

724
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,734
and hack from nearby.

725
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:55,404
Can you change the photos
on the reservation list?

726
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:57,197
That's a cakewalk.

727
00:46:58,907 --> 00:47:02,995
GEORGE ANDERSON
JESSICA BENING

728
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,726
I brought some information
regarding Nothing as you asked.

729
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:33,525
It's an installation piece
by Jackson Martin, an American artist.

730
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:45,787
It used to be displayed in Milan,
then was sold to Ragusang Gallery.

731
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:48,123
It's worth around ten billion won.

732
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:55,714
Why would they keep it in the director's
office and not exhibit it?

733
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:57,507
It's an extremely rare piece.

734
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,385
Its former owner from Milan
kept it hidden as well.

735
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:01,762
Thus, there are no photos.

736
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,683
Then let's begin.

737
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:15,108
My partner would never dress like that.

738
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:20,364
I'm dressed like this because I'm not.

739
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,242
If you're going to put on an act,
you should do a proper job.

740
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,703
I'm too lazy to get changed.

741
00:48:27,663 --> 00:48:29,706
Don't bother. Get in.

742
00:48:40,926 --> 00:48:42,469
What is he up to this time?

743
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:09,705
Here is the product you ordered.

744
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,458
When did you prepare this?

745
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:45,282
You finally look the part.

746
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,536
Aren't you being too generous
for a single act?

747
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,121
They're not a gift.

748
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:54,875
I'm just giving them
to their rightful owner.

749
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,296
Hey!

750
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:09,115
Starting from 6 p.m., the gallery will be
rented as a private venue.

751
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,994
Please vacate the premises before then
for our next schedule.

752
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:20,418
Starting from 6 p.m., the gallery will be
rented as a private venue.

753
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:23,380
Please vacate the premises…

754
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:50,323
Our record said
that one of you is fluent in Korean.

755
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,493
That'd be me.
I'm extremely fluent in Korean.

756
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,621
I see. Then she can't speak Korean at all?

757
00:51:58,456 --> 00:52:01,793
I can speak a little.

758
00:52:01,877 --> 00:52:05,547
She has improved a lot lately.
You've been studying hard, right?

759
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,048
Right, darling?

760
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:09,050
-Yes, darling.
-Right.

761
00:52:09,134 --> 00:52:11,177
I see. Please come in.

762
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,262
-Sure.
-Okay.

763
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,059
This way.

764
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,273
How's Anderson and his lady doing?

765
00:52:23,899 --> 00:52:26,109
-They just started the tour.
-Good.

766
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:17,077
Pasta and wine.

767
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:30,215
Thank you.

768
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:34,052
Okay.

769
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:59,244
For the next three hours,
this building will be yours.

770
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:03,540
And I'll be by your side, guiding you.

771
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,167
First, you'll have your meal.

772
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:08,461
We've prepared a meal at Gallery C.

773
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,839
Actually,
we'd like to look at the art first.

774
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,845
When I was in LA…

775
00:54:20,432 --> 00:54:23,935
Every time I felt that way,
I visited The Broad.

776
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:27,856
The art pieces touched my heart.

777
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:31,735
That's when I started to… Right. Study.

778
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:34,404
Study art.

779
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:38,950
The library sold some delicious hotdogs.

780
00:54:39,034 --> 00:54:42,996
And the hotdogs… Gosh, I still miss them.

781
00:54:51,796 --> 00:54:55,258
This painting is We, Forever by Ali Osman.

782
00:54:56,176 --> 00:54:59,012
It expresses everlasting love.

783
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,998
Mr. Anderson prepared a surprise proposal.

784
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,959
Please come forward, sir.

785
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:33,963
-Me?
-Yes.

786
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,258
Me?

787
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:39,302
Yes. Come on.

788
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:47,977
Here's the ring you told me to keep.

789
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:49,104
The ring?

790
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:50,021
Yes.

791
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:54,692
Right, the ring.

792
00:55:57,904 --> 00:55:58,988
Come on.

793
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:08,289
Mr. Anderson, now is the time.

794
00:56:17,924 --> 00:56:19,300
-Come on.
-Right.

795
00:56:28,226 --> 00:56:30,520
Please accept my love.

796
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:35,900
Say it with more love.
A bit more romantically.

797
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:36,544
I'm on cloud nine.

798
00:57:36,628 --> 00:57:39,464
Here comes the highlight of the proposal.

799
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,556
Kiss.

800
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,517
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

801
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,103
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

802
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:57,649
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

803
00:57:57,732 --> 00:57:59,984
-Kiss.
-Kiss.

804
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:01,402
I'll do that later.

805
00:58:01,486 --> 00:58:03,821
-Mr. Anderson?
-Yes?

806
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:06,783
You can't postpone a kiss.

807
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,743
Do you truly love her?

808
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:10,745
Yes, I do love her.

809
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,915
I really do, but…

810
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:17,377
But I feel a bit uncomfortable
doing it here.

811
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:03,524
That was so beautiful, you guys.

812
01:00:10,531 --> 01:00:12,492
This is such a magical night

813
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,328
I will never forget.

814
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:25,797
I will never forget this night either.

815
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:00,998
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

816
01:01:01,082 --> 01:01:04,293
-Your wedding, love forever
-Your wedding, love forever

817
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:06,254
-Don't fight
-Don't fight

818
01:01:06,337 --> 01:01:10,425
-From black hair to white hair
-From black hair to white hair

819
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:14,345
-Congratulations
-Congratulations

820
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:17,557
-Your wedding, love forever
-Your wedding, love forever

821
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,225
-Don't fight
-Don't fight

822
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:23,062
-From black hair to white hair
-From black hair to white hair

823
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:34,907
What's up with your outfits?

824
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:37,827
Are you Go stones or what?

825
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:42,540
Have one each.

826
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,585
You'll be awake and happy.

827
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:01,976
It's tasty.

828
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,021
We're a team now, so you should chat.

829
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,023
You're so pretty.

830
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,442
You too.

831
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,029
What's your lipstick color?

832
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,033
I see. It suits you perfectly.

833
01:02:17,784 --> 01:02:20,286
It's like listening to two ghosts talking.

834
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:25,416
What's taking them so long
to enter the office?

835
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,584
Gosh.

836
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:31,923
William Dayne

837
01:02:32,006 --> 01:02:35,593
often portrayed the inner most thoughts
that people have in his paintings.

838
01:02:38,846 --> 01:02:40,348
You must be tired.

839
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:41,891
You should sit down.

840
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,114
Yes, there's something we want to see.

841
01:02:57,615 --> 01:02:58,658
There is one.

842
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:00,993
We heard

843
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:07,124
that Jackson Martin's Nothing
was in this gallery.

844
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:11,379
You're indeed art enthusiasts
who know your onions.

845
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:14,173
I'm terribly sorry,

846
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:19,053
but that piece isn't exhibited
for the public, so you cannot see it.

847
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,397
We were thinking about buying
some paintings today.

848
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,442
You sure have gotten better in Korean.

849
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,738
We can buy some at other galleries.

850
01:03:38,656 --> 01:03:39,657
-Let's go.
-Okay.

851
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,741
What a disappointment.

852
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:42,994
-Let's go.
-Okay.

853
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:45,913
Nothing is…

854
01:03:53,004 --> 01:03:55,089
in my office.

855
01:03:55,673 --> 01:03:56,883
This way, please.

856
01:03:58,593 --> 01:04:00,052
Let's take a look before we go.

857
01:04:00,845 --> 01:04:03,264
-Okay.
-This way, please.

858
01:04:05,433 --> 01:04:07,351
Please stop this and leave.

859
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:09,061
I want to see the director.

860
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,688
Come back tomorrow morning.

861
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:16,652
No. One of the pieces displayed in there
has plagiarized my work.

862
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,697
I just need to get seomthing.

863
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,198
It won't take long.

864
01:04:21,282 --> 01:04:24,994
What and where is it?
Tell us, and we'll get it for you.

865
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:29,665
It's very personal and is a secret.

866
01:04:29,749 --> 01:04:31,751
-Just let me go inside.
-I can't.

867
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,836
I want to see the director!

868
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,631
-Please stop yelling.
-Is this how you do your job?

869
01:04:36,714 --> 01:04:40,468
Which agency do you belong to?
I said I won't be long.

870
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:42,136
If she's not coming out, I'll go.

871
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:44,347
I'll call the police.

872
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:46,015
I've already called them. Move.

873
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:47,183
Stop her.

874
01:04:47,266 --> 01:04:48,851
-Please stop.
-Stop her.

875
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:51,479
-My father…
-You trampled on my passion!

876
01:04:51,562 --> 01:04:53,230
You cannot enter, ma'am.

877
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,706
This must be Nothing.

878
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:14,877
Ms. Bening, that's a floor lamp.

879
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:16,587
Ji-eun, turn on the floor lamp.

880
01:05:16,671 --> 01:05:17,546
Turning on the floor lamp.

881
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,136
It's an AI.

882
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:28,432
How pretty.

883
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:29,350
Yes?

884
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:31,102
Your sense of humor has improved.

885
01:05:38,192 --> 01:05:40,653
Someone must be living here.

886
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,365
Why is there a doormat here?
It's about my foot size.

887
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:48,411
This right here is
Jackson Martin's Nothing.

888
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:54,166
He has portrayed the emptiness
of material culture

889
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,294
through his sixth sense.

890
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:07,638
As soon as I saw it, I could feel
the emptiness from the footprints.

891
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:09,515
-You can, right?
-Yes, those heels.

892
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,017
It amazes you even more,

893
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,852
-the more you look.
-Right.

894
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,270
Ma'am.

895
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:16,480
How dare you barge in here?

896
01:06:16,564 --> 01:06:17,565
What is it?

897
01:06:17,648 --> 01:06:20,234
Some strange women are demanding
to see you.

898
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:21,694
They even called the police.

899
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,532
Nothing.

900
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,492
-Mr. Anderson and Ms. Bening.
-Yes?

901
01:06:28,576 --> 01:06:30,828
-Please take your time.
-Sure. No worries.

902
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:32,038
All right.

903
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,211
-Oh, I'm so sad.
-Are you?

904
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,012
Let's see.

905
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:53,476
I mean, Ms. Hong.

906
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,271
-Okay. Put it in.
-Okay.

907
01:06:57,354 --> 01:06:58,522
Hold on.

908
01:06:58,606 --> 01:06:59,857
Hurry.

909
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:05,613
FATE PIANO ACADEMY, SEO MI-RI

910
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:08,449
We did it.

911
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,789
I've inserted the thumbstick.

912
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,799
CONNECTING TO REMOTE PC

913
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:35,935
How long will it take?

914
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:38,729
Anywhere between one…

915
01:07:39,939 --> 01:07:41,023
or ten minutes.

916
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:44,568
Why is the gap so big?
Don't toy with my heart like that.

917
01:07:44,652 --> 01:07:47,154
-Hit the glass.
-Hit the glass.

918
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:03,212
-Drink.
-Drink.

919
01:08:03,295 --> 01:08:04,922
-Here comes the alcohol
-Here comes the alcohol

920
01:08:05,005 --> 01:08:06,841
-Drink
-Drink

921
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:08,551
Shot.

922
01:08:12,596 --> 01:08:15,432
-Well done.
-One more.

923
01:08:18,018 --> 01:08:20,771
What the hell are you guys doing?

924
01:08:20,855 --> 01:08:23,649
Are you the director? Gosh, you're tall.

925
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,863
-Why do you have plagiarized art?
-Why won't you let me in?

926
01:08:28,946 --> 01:08:30,447
Something that's mine is in there.

927
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,950
What is this nonsense?

928
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:33,993
Plagiarism?

929
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:37,705
What's that?

930
01:08:44,879 --> 01:08:46,046
Over here.

931
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,506
Police.

932
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,718
We heard there's plagiarized art.
Detective Jeon, go on.

933
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:53,554
Who's the director here?

934
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,140
Why is it taking so long?

935
01:08:56,724 --> 01:08:57,933
Let's be patient.

936
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:05,649
She did it.

937
01:09:06,192 --> 01:09:07,610
Here you go.

938
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:10,279
Is it my turn now?

939
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:13,282
SHARED DOCUMENTS

940
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:16,911
Let's see.

941
01:09:18,162 --> 01:09:20,539
"International transactions…"

942
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,667
Why are they all in English?

943
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:26,837
-Didn't I tell you to study English?
-What is this?

944
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:28,380
You know that advertisement.

945
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,008
"If you can't speak English,
come to Deoun School.

946
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:32,676
You too? Me too. Her too."

947
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,512
An accountant doesn't need
to learn English.

948
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:38,474
Here it is. "International transactions."

949
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:45,648
How long will it take?

950
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:49,360
Please wait one minute.

951
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,197
My thighs are drenched with sweat.
Please hurry.

952
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,034
My armpits are sweaty as well.
Don't rush me.

953

COPYING 4 FILES FROM MANAGEMENT TO PROJECT

954
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:06,418
Lee Song-baek's unique touch is
clearly visible in this painting.

955
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,461
Plagiarism?

956
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:11,966
-Do you want to see mine?
-Let's see it.

957
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,221
Ma'am, what did you leave behind in here?

958
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:21,475
There it is.

959
01:10:36,573 --> 01:10:38,158
It's still sweet.

960
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:42,246
Why would you chew it again?

961
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:44,123
Look at my painting.

962
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,375
This looks nothing like that painting.

963
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:48,460
The lines, colors, feelings,

964
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,837
and the impression…

965
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,298
They're awfully similar.

966
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,091
It looks pretty much identical.

967
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:55,801
They're the same.

968
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,095
They pretty much duplicated her painting.

969
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:00,431
Why are you doing this to me?

970
01:11:07,313 --> 01:11:10,482
Even my calves are sweaty now.
What's taking you so long?

971
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:29,877
COPYING 4 FILES FROM MANAGEMENT TO PROJECT

972
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:39,178
It's done. Remove the thumbstick.

973
01:11:58,781 --> 01:11:59,615
Yes?

974
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:03,744
What are you doing,
Mr. Anderson and Ms. Bening?

975
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,961
Oh, no. I think she caught them.

976
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:14,463
I knew something was off.

977
01:12:14,546 --> 01:12:18,050
How come my ominous feelings
are always right?

978
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,011
You're not a couple, are you?
What are you after?

979
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:23,847
We're caught.

980
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:28,602
What are you saying?

981
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:38,821
We're agents from AISE,

982
01:12:38,904 --> 01:12:41,281
the foreign intelligence service of Italy.

983
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:54,253
We're looking into paintings
that have been smuggled from Italy.

984
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:57,381
We've received a tip-off

985
01:12:57,923 --> 01:13:00,008
that some of them ended up here.

986
01:13:00,092 --> 01:13:01,093
Get them!

987
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:20,863
Don't move.

988
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,580
Are you guys really agents from Italy?

989
01:13:30,122 --> 01:13:31,748
Name, Jung Do-hee.

990
01:13:31,832 --> 01:13:34,460
It says you graduated
from Parsons School of Design,

991
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:35,919
but that's been fabricated.

992
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:37,421
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

993
01:13:37,504 --> 01:13:40,424
You also didn't win
the Giovanni Award in Italy

994
01:13:40,507 --> 01:13:42,759
or the Emerson Award in the US.

995
01:13:42,843 --> 01:13:43,969
How did you know?

996
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,388
Our Korean agent tipped us off.

997
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:48,307
Come in.

998
01:13:53,812 --> 01:13:56,482
The two intelligence services
are working together.

999
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,610
Tell us the truth.
How many pieces have you smuggled in?

1000
01:14:00,194 --> 01:14:02,738
None of our pieces have been smuggled.

1001
01:14:02,821 --> 01:14:03,780
It's the truth.

1002
01:14:03,864 --> 01:14:05,407
-Don't lie!
-Tell the truth.

1003
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:07,117
-Do you think we're joking?
-Do you?

1004
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:09,077
-Talk, or I'll shoot you.
-Hurry up.

1005
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,872
-Just one piece, sir.
-Which one is it?

1006
01:14:11,955 --> 01:14:13,582
The portrait of Antonioni.

1007
01:14:21,173 --> 01:14:23,800
Wait. One minute.

1008
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:28,597
Everything will be fine
once I return the painting, right?

1009
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,849
Can you give me your word
there won't be any trouble?

1010
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,017
Yes.

1011
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,478
Hand it over to him,
and he'll take care of the rest.

1012
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,773
-Do you mean him?
-What is it?

1013
01:14:38,524 --> 01:14:40,484
Do you think I'd sell it?

1014
01:14:42,903 --> 01:14:43,737
A bit.

1015
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,198
Split it seven to three?

1016
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:51,870
Good work, guys.

1017
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,205
Thank you, sir.

1018
01:14:54,998 --> 01:14:57,834
Make sure you erase
all the CCTV footage of us.

1019
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:02,673
But that will take too long.

1020
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,216
Answer me.

1021
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:06,385
Fine.

1022
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,388
If you ever need to flee the country,

1023
01:15:10,264 --> 01:15:13,016
call this number.
It's an affiliated company.

1024
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:14,726
What?

1025
01:15:16,436 --> 01:15:17,854
"Byebye Balloon"?

1026
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:22,150
"A trip just for you"?

1027
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:02,107
We've arrived, boss.

1028
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,963
I had such a blast acting today.

1029
01:16:26,423 --> 01:16:27,382
Me too.

1030
01:16:28,759 --> 01:16:30,218
There was even a kissing scene.

1031
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,930
Right, there was.

1032
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:38,185
I'm sorry if I caught you off guard.

1033
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:40,812
It's okay.

1034
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:54,034
Stop it already.

1035
01:16:54,701 --> 01:16:55,827
It's so embarrassing.

1036
01:17:24,564 --> 01:17:25,524
Ms. Hong.

1037
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:29,778
Should we have a celebratory drink
on the rooftop?

1038
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:32,197
Sure.

1039
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:35,242
Should we order jokbal or chicken?

1040
01:17:35,325 --> 01:17:37,202
Or we could just buy some beef jerky.

1041
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:46,378
What's wrong? Do you not like beef jerky?

1042
01:17:49,506 --> 01:17:50,507
Ms. Hong.

1043
01:17:51,675 --> 01:17:55,512
I'll go upstairs and prepare everything.
Can you go buy some beer?

1044
01:17:55,595 --> 01:17:57,180
There's not much to prepare.

1045
01:17:57,264 --> 01:17:59,182
You just want to send me on an errand.

1046
01:17:59,891 --> 01:18:01,685
When I went up two days ago,

1047
01:18:01,768 --> 01:18:03,937
there were boxes piled up there.

1048
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:04,938
Again?

1049
01:18:05,522 --> 01:18:07,607
Gosh. Who is it this time?

1050
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:10,277
Get some beer. I'll go up first.

1051
01:18:13,905 --> 01:18:16,199
There are boxes up there again? Jeez.

1052
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:37,656
Did Paolo send you?

1053
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:41,159
Perhaps.
