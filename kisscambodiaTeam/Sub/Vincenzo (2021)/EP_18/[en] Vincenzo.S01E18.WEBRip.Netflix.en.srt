1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,314
Shoot first.

2
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,281
Vincenzo Cassano.

3
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,874
We're from the Interpol.

4
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,336
We came here to arrest you
and repatriate you.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,422
Drop your gun, Vincenzo Cassano.

6
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,066
Stay away! Stay away from me.

7
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,315
Put your guns down.

8
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,331
KIM IN-YONG

9
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,332
Officer Kim In-yong.

10
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,168
Officer Baek Gyeong-su.

11
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,419
Yes.

12
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,046
Go tell your superior

13
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,925
that the Interpol had no evidence
and went back.

14
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,637
Also, take care of these bodies.
Understood?

15
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,391
Do as I say,
or you'll be dead within two days.

16
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,101
Got it, Officer Baek?

17
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,852
Yes.

18
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,239
You go back and tell your boss

19
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,158
to stop acting up and wait for his death.

20
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,369
Yes, I will.

21
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,716
I'll get going.

22
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,054
Wait. I can't let you go like this.

23
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,808
Here's your preview.

24
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,897
For a moment there,
I thought I was going to die.

25
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,401
Didn't you say
you were just going to lure Vincenzo

26
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,153
for the Interpol to catch him?

27
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,530
Yes, I did.

28
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,532
Where did you get a gun?

29
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,534
Well…

30
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,498
I bought one to kill Vincenzo.

31
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,003
The Chief Prosecutor
brought in the Interpol.

32
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,422
Why did you try to kill him yourself?

33
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,466
Ms. Choi, are you stupid?

34
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,927
Vincenzo is a Mafia.

35
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:50,391
Unless he gets a death sentence in Italy,
he'll come back to kill us.

36
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,393
How can you not know that?

37
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,273
So there were Vincenzo's men
at the ice rink?

38
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,025
Yes.

39
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,653
He hid five of his men there.
That sly bastard.

40
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,074
Then it means
he fooled us completely, doesn't it?

41
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,658
As frustrating as it is…

42
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,953
it seems so.

43
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,624
Was he aware
that the Interpol was coming to get him?

44
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,752
Seeing he hid his men there.

45
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,212
About that…

46
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,342
I'm not so sure.

47
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,265
Did he hire more men
like they do in the Mafia?

48
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,393
Yes, you're probably right.
That must be it.

49
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,108
Stay away from guns
if you value your life.

50
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,527
Let's go, Ms. Choi.

51
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,695
Bye, Ms. Choi.

52
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,535
I know you're all busy.
Don't bother coming to see me.

53
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,583
You're hiding something.

54
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,545
Of course not. Can't you see I got shot?

55
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,171
I need you to be honest with me.

56
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,799
Come on. You don't trust me?

57
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,927
Just hold my hand. I'm in pain.

58
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,140
It hurts so much.

59
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,600
-I'll call you.
-Where are you going?

60
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,982
EPISODE 18

61
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,403
So this is your first task
as the Chief Prosecutor?

62
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:32,493
You win some, you lose some.
That's how it is, right?

63
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,497
Now that you've done this yourself,
what do you think?

64
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,918
After one more try,
I might be able to master it.

65
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,671
Do you know what the biggest problem is
right now?

66
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,298
VIP WARD

67
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,591
What could it be?

68
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,970
I'm afraid
you might also just have made it

69
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,264
on Vincenzo's hit list.

70
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,602
If you had sat back,
you could have spared your life.

71
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,646
He won't kill me
just because I brought in the Interpol.

72
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,569
Stop making things worse
by meddling in affairs you're not good at.

73
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,571
Focus on keeping your position

74
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,450
and staying alive. All right?

75
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,037
You look awful.

76
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,919
Who gives her the right
to talk to me like that?

77
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,422
Yes. Chief Prosecutor speaking.

78
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,217
I'm not interested.

79
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,594
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

80
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,393
Goodness.

81
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,939
If things had gone wrong, Mr. Cassano
would be on a plane right now.

82
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,068
That would have been horrible.

83
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,695
We almost said goodbye to you today.

84
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,161
We need to talk. It's urgent.

85
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,374
Han Seung-hyuk brought in the Interpol
to take you to Italy.

86
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,000
They'll be landing shortly.

87
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,097
What? Are you scared?

88
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,057
Of course.

89
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,142
We'll be surrounded by guns.

90
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,522
Just have one of them come close to me.

91
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,816
And leave the rest to me.

92
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,779
It's done.

93
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,364
-Great.
-Thanks.

94
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,840
Are you saying Paolo framed you?

95
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,302
-Yes.
-How can we trust you?

96
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,597
If my priority had been to escape,

97
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,807
I would have killed you all.

98
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,981
Leave me here. In return…

99
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,483
I have a present for you.

100
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,894
The list of bribes that Paolo gave
to politicians and ministers

101
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,439
and the recordings to prove that.

102
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,318
There's more.

103
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,330
Fly out to Malta tomorrow and look
for a paper company named Jason Fund.

104
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,625
Look into their accounting records
in that flash drive.

105
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,294
All of you will receive
a special promotion.

106
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,769
-Is it heavy?
-No, not at all.

107
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,978
-Give me some.
-I'm fine.

108
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,814
-It's okay.
-I'm really fine.

109
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,191
-You must be tired. Let me help.
-I'm not tired.

110
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,113
Why did you not betray me
when he said he'd make you the chairman?

111
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,824
He won't make me the real chairman.

112
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,617
I'll just be his puppet.

113
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,536
So I said no.

114
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,330
You did well today. Bye, then.

115
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,540
Wait a second.

116
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,668
They'll be suspicious.

117
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,590
Can you shoot me somewhere fleshy
so that the bullet just grazes me?

118
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,217
-In the arm?
-Yes.

119
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,015
-Get me the gun.
-Is it in the bag?

120
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,688
-Silencer.
-Silencer.

121
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,774
-Quickly.
-Quickly.

122
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,614
It might…

123
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,784
hurt more than you think. You might faint.

124
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,579
Don't worry. I can handle this much.

125
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,709
I didn't shoot yet.

126
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,295
-On three.
-On three.

127
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,588
-One.
-One.

128
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,839
-Two.
-Two.

129
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,221
It's not as bad as I thought,

130
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,432
Grandma. Why are you here, Grandma?

131
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,107
Hey.

132
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,443
Lovely morning.

133
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,613
-Can we have a word?
-Do you want a beating?

134
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,782
Gosh. Come on.

135
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,243
Please.

136
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,541
BYEBYE BALLOON TRAVEL

137
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,713
Jasmine tea? Coffee? Solomon's seal tea?

138
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,299
Don't bother.
Is there something you want to tell me?

139
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,977
The thing is…

140
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,565
a new hot-air balloon
arrived in Busan recently.

141
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,942
It's the latest model
and is very powerful.

142
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,777
It can fly extremely long distances.

143
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,696
Why are you telling me this?

144
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,327
ONE-TIME FREE TICKET

145
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,330
When you're in this line of work,

146
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,417
you might need to flee in a hurry one day.

147
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,627
You won't have time to book flights.

148
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,755
They might even bar you
from leaving the country.

149
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,097
Are you telling me

150
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,641
to escape using this?

151
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,394
We already helped 47 people
leave the country safely.

152
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,565
Sadly, two of them didn't make it.

153
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,110
I'd say it's a worthwhile bet.

154
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:10,075
Why are you trying to help me
after all I've done to you?

155
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,244
How should I put it?

156
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,207
It's kind of a wish fulfillment.

157
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,137
There was a man who dreamed of living
like Michael Corleone from The Godfather.

158
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,432
Then he met a real Corleone.

159
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,435
How could he not respect him?

160
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,029
Anyway, I'll hold on to it for now.

161
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,329
Yes?

162
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,997
Can you…

163
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,042
call me bro just once?

164
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,380
Bro…

165
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,134
my ass. I ought to beat you up.

166
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,305
All right. Fine.

167
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,726
Gosh, I've got goosebumps
all over my body.

168
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,645
My goodness.

169
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,147
Number one.

170
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,734
We need to remove the rest of
Jang Han-seok's pieces from the board.

171
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,278
All his pieces in Sangcheon-gu are gone.

172
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,990
So only the bigger pieces are left.

173
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,075
Then let's take care of them today.

174
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,412
It's going to be a long, hard day
for them.

175
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,206
Mr. Nam, what about the lawsuit
against Babel Tower?

176
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,541
It's ready.

177
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,086
All you have to do now is
submit it to the court.

178
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,067
-Gosh.
-I shouldn't do that.

179
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,237
-Oh, my.
-Look at that.

180
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,617
Come to Glory Sound Cafe by 3 p.m.,

181
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,411
or you'll be held responsible.

182
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,580
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

183
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,017
Why did he tell us to come
to a place like this?

184
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,685
I have no idea.

185
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,064
What are we going to do
in a public space like this?

186
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,357
His text startled me.

187
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,319
How dare he send us a message like that?

188
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,447
Are you sure you'll be able to
build Babel Tower?

189
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,823
-What?
-I heard

190
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,825
that they are reexamining it now.

191
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,204
-From my experience…
-Why is this being played here?

192
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,955
What are you doing? Turn that off.

193
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,873
Quick!

194
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,666
Where's the manager?

195
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,960
-The media are already
-Is something wrong?

196
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,962
-starting to suspect…
-Turn that off.

197
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,297
-Hurry up.
-Quick.

198
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,966
-Okay.
-It's a minor error with the document.

199
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,093
No big deal.

200
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,928
-It's even louder now!
-Wusang will

201
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,805
-Move.
-take care of it in a few days.

202
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,848
-I'll pull the plug.
-Don't you worry.

203
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,684
My goodness.

204
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,439
-Damn it.
-I'm sorry.

205
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,774
I'm sorry.

206
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,911
Mr. Jang,
is this how you're going to play it?

207
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,704
It had nothing to do with me.

208
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
It was your house.

209
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,836
Your very own house!

210
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,754
It could have been a bug--

211
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,007
This is completely different
from when Mr. Seo died.

212
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,425
I'm not in this alone.

213
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,679
If you keep this up, I won't sit back.
Do you understand?

214
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,806
Mr. Hwang. Hello?

215
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,564
Damn it.

216
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,489
This time,

217
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,660
we're determined to root out
all corruption related to the Babel Tower.

218
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,914
You're all about to witness
the shocking truth.

219
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,083
Would you like to add anything, gentleman?

220
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,838
In the Bible, the Tower of Babel falls
because of human greed.

221
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:36,633
And that's exactly what's going to happen
in court soon.

222
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,969
The Babel Tower will fall
before it's even built.

223
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,637
Any message for them?

224
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,855
These are going to be
our last words for Babel.

225
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,941
"You can see yourself out."

226
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,908
Goodbye.

227
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,706
-Anything else?
-What's your plan?

228
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,499
-What will happen next?
-Wait!

229
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,751
Please add something!

230
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,338
NANYAK TEMPLE

231
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,759
Have some fruit.

232
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,679
Sorry. We're going out to beg for alms.

233
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,892
You're begging for alms
quite often these days.

234
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,312
You've been doing it every day
lately, right?

235
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,148
Are you struggling?

236
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,983
No. We're okay.

237
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,986
Please leave the fruit inside.
I appreciate it.

238
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,655
-Sure.
-Goodbye, then.

239
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,077
See you.

240
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,584
The temple can't make ends meet
without any visitors.

241
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,128
I feel sorry for them.

242
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,506
My goodness.

243
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,800
If they're begging for alms every day,

244
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,885
their situation must be pretty bad.

245
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,431
They're monks, so they won't have
any money saved.

246
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:12,020
Who would want to visit the temple
when this whole building is a mess?

247
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,482
I would go, but I'm a Christian.

248
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,986
Then why don't we all chip in
and help them out?

249
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,114
Right. We should help each other
during hard times.

250
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,408
I'll go and talk
to the laundromat owner, too.

251
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,660
-Okay.
-All right. Let's do that.

252
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,081
Since we handed in the files, should
we start leveling the playing field?

253
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:35,419
Yes. We should do this fiercely
as my father wanted.

254
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,796
Take it easy.

255
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,757
I should say the same to you.
I'll see you later.

256
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,097
All right.

257
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,352
They checked, but there were no bugs.

258
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,773
How on earth was it recorded, then?

259
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,277
There were a lot of people.

260
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,404
It's likely that it was one of them.

261
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,450
No. This is Vincenzo's doing.

262
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,744
A humiliation worse than death.

263
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,039
To give you that, I'm playing a game
of chess with you starting today.

264
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,791
And I'll get rid of your pieces
one by one.

265
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,884
They're all gone.

266
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,802
If it really is Vincenzo's doing,

267
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,597
it's a pretty big blow this time.

268
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,102
My gosh. Those spineless idiots.

269
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,563
We should've gotten rid of them as I said.

270
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,982
This happened
because you didn't listen to me.

271
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,737
JIPURAGI FILED A CLAIM
FOR DAMAGES AGAINST BABEL

272
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,948
Did something else happen?

273
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,538
Hong Cha-young filed a claim for damages
against the Babel Group.

274
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,751
That claim must be the checkmate.

275
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,927
CLAIM FOR DAMAGES
AGAINST ILLEGAL ACTS

276
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,763
FILED BY: CHO YEONG-UN AND 10 OTHERS
AGAINST: THE BABEL GROUP

277
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,890
PLAINTIFF'S DEMAND

278
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,769
CHIEF PROSECUTOR HAN SEUNG-HYUK

279
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,897
BABEL HAS HIRED ANT COMPANY
TO THREATEN THE TENANTS

280
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,699
VINCENZO

281
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,412
Yes, this is Chief Prosecutor
Han Seung-hyuk.

282
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,498
I saw off the Interpol agents you sent.

283
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,586
I just did what's legally appropriate.

284
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,004
You shouldn't have done that.

285
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,632
Why does "legally appropriate" sound
so awkward

286
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,801
when it's coming from a Chief Prosecutor.

287
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,972
Let's make a deal tonight.

288
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,431
Well…

289
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,725
why would I make a deal with you?

290
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,227
You should if you want to live.

291
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,022
I'm hanging up on the count of three.
One, two.

292
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,941
Wait… He hung up.

293
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,027
Damn it. He has the upper hand.

294
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,823
What kind of a deal does he want to make?

295
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,332
Bring some wet towels.

296
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,375
Let me join you.

297
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,174
How do you always find me?

298
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,967
Are you my stalker or what?

299
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,847
You may not know when,

300
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,267
but you look pretty calm
for someone who's going to die.

301
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,773
Didn't it occur to you
that we could kill you first?

302
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,108
No, not at all.

303
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,279
But if you win the lawsuit
regarding the Babel Tower,

304
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,989
we'll let you live a bit longer.

305
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,073
There's no need.

306
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,244
I'll fulfill my dream of living longer
at a convenience store

307
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,538
by drinking some yogurt.

308
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,711
But it won't be a life worth living,

309
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,339
because we'll come after you again.

310
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,681
VOICE RECORDING

311
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,266
Pyo Hyeok-pil and I

312
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,769
were ordered by Choi Myung-hee

313
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,980
to kill Hong Yu-chan
and disguise it as a car accident.

314
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,486
Oh, my poor Crystal Balls.

315
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,322
Recordings like that are useless.

316
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,370
On Choi Myung-hee's orders,
we've gotten rid of the following people.

317
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,122
Congressman Baek Min-u,

318
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,167
Park Dong-cheon of Gudam Police Station,

319
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,795
Deputy Minister Jung Jin-taek,

320
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,506
the Good Politics Committee
Chairman Lee Seon-u,

321
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,966
Reporter Lee Yang-su,

322
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,426
TQ Logistics'
labor union leader Kim Min-hyeok…

323
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,432
What do you want with those useless names?

324
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,021
I'll use this

325
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,608
to give you a Christmas present this year.

326
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,986
About 30 years in jail.

327
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:16,241
Don't you think the pot
is calling the kettle black?

328
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,659
Who's the pot?

329
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,329
Oh, I know. You're the pot.

330
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,707
-And I'm the kettle.
-You and Vincenzo…

331
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,335
Do you think you'll look clean
if you expose us?

332
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,130
We're not trying to look clean.

333
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,550
We just want to have the upper hand.

334
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,428
Yes. That's the spirit.

335
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,179
Good point.

336
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,974
Let's see who wins in the end.

337
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,044
All right.

338
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,464
I get that I upset you,

339
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:17,260
but people are bound to get hurt
during a war.

340
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,304
You know, like a collateral damage.

341
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,307
Anyway…

342
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,684
what deal did you mean?

343
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,027
A deal regarding your life.

344
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,487
What?

345
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,784
I was going to let you live,

346
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,205
but I decided to kill you after that stunt
you pulled with the Interpol.

347
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,880
Seriously?

348
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,593
That's not something to make a deal about.

349
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,098
Life is the most precious gift
that was given to us.

350
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,224
Hey!

351
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,856
I'm a Chief Prosecutor
at the Namdongbu Office.

352
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,194
How dare you be so disrespectful
to your elder, you little brat?

353
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,698
Don't talk about age.

354
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,577
All age does is
give you a lot of responsibilities.

355
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,621
Don't take that tone with me!

356
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,791
You little brat!

357
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,877
Show some respect!

358
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,092
But, hey!
I'm signaling for you to come in!

359
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,136
I told you to come in
once I hit the table!

360
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,638
Why are you all so clueless?

361
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,265
Darn it.

362
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,851
Gosh, my hand hurts.

363
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,811
You're pretty old-fashioned and childish.

364
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,230
It's quite disappointing.

365
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,693
Fights are always
old-fashioned and childish.

366
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,695
I'm sure you know that.

367
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,044
Don't worry.
The bullets went through your legs.

368
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,421
What are you waiting for?

369
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,632
Come on! Do something!
Don't you have any guns?

370
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,387
-Get out, all of you.
-Get out.

371
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,432
Get out!

372
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,935
Come on, get out.
Take those guys on the floor.

373
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,621
I've never seen a sly person
who's not a coward.

374
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,498
You're right. I'm pretty sly.

375
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,041
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,336
Please don't kill me.

377
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,846
Who are you?

378
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,139
This is what you get
for disrespecting your elders.

379
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,812
Those darn geezers!

380
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,941
How dare they do this to him?

381
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,527
They're full of energy, aren't they?

382
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,071
They're provoking us.

383
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,114
Look at his foot.

384
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,701
Should we just get rid of them all?

385
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,538
They still have quite a lot of power
in this country.

386
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,582
It could just backfire on us.

387
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:43,336
It may not be now,
but we'll deal with them eventually.

388
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,673
They're useless to us now.

389
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,568
A devil tantalizes

390
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,906
another devil…

391
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,506
Stop!

392
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,322
-Get him!
-Damn it!

393
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,291
Get him.

394
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,459
Let's go.

395
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,592
There was no need
to beat him up like that.

396
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,182
You know who I am, don't you?

397
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,725
Mr. Kim.

398
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,729
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk and I

399
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,440
have been close for a long time.

400
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,609
He told me

401
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,029
to find you if I wanted to open
the secret room

402
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,864
in Geumga Plaza.

403
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,785
I can't open it.

404
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,871
The iris recognition device is
inside the room.

405
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,040
Then we should find another way.

406
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,461
Who designed the security system?

407
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,712
I don't know.

408
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,174
Mr. Wang hired that person himself.

409
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:57,220
When installing security systems
in another country, you use local people

410
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,432
because security structures and methods
are different for each country.

411
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,772
Here.

412
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,197
You'll have to do some work
with my men starting today.

413
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,868
Look into all the security experts
and hackers

414
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,288
who were working in Korea
during that time.

415
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,000
How would I do that?

416
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,963
You're an intelligence agent.
You'd better pull it off

417
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,507
if you don't want to die with your family.

418
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,565
What is this?

419
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,332
Hey! Go!

420
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,750
Come on!

421
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,777
CHIEF PROSECUTOR HAN SEUNG-HYUK

422
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,365
We can't just sit back and watch anymore.

423
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,913
Mr. Jang could really end up dying.

424
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,790
Terrorism, shooting…

425
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,461
Just arrest them and Vincenzo.

426
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,671
You should know better.

427
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,548
Arrest them?

428
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,177
That's only possible
when we have the upper hand.

429
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,386
If anything goes wrong,

430
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,097
all our bribes and the Guillotine file
could be revealed.

431
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,141
You're the Chief Prosecutor,

432
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,477
and you can't catch one lousy Mafia?

433
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,605
You were an ace prosecutor
of the Namdongbu office.

434
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,440
Can't you do anything right?

435
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,650
Hey!

436
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,073
You're in the Chief Prosecutor's office
right now!

437
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,032
Lower your voice.

438
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,867
All right, fine.

439
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,123
You know…

440
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,961
I've been thinking hard about it.

441
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,463
Let's use one of the Mafia's tactics.

442
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,593
The safest place to be right now

443
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,971
is jail.

444
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,722
You know what I mean?

445
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,766
Stop talking nonsense.

446
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,850
It does make sense.

447
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,603
Even for Vincenzo Cassano,

448
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,273
breaking into a jail cell won't be easy.

449
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,990
What do you mean?

450
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,159
Are you telling me to go to jail?

451
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:11,080
Just for a week or two. I'll make sure
you feel at home there.

452
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,542
Ms. Choi, you know how much I hate jail.

453
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,712
I've been hiding my identity
because I didn't want to go to jail.

454
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,879
I know that.

455
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,383
I'm not telling you to stay there.
It's just for your protection.

456
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,094
Protection or not,
I don't want to go to jail.

457
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,140
You must admit it now.

458
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,349
Vincenzo…

459
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,686
We're no match for him.

460
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,772
Darn it!

461
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,651
I really mean it.

462
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,362
I don't want to go to jail!

463
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,785
Don't be afraid.

464
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,039
I'll make sure your cell
is like a hotel room.

465
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,249
Darn it.

466
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,889
BABEL GROUP

467
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,858
Mr. Jang Han-seok?

468
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,985
We're from the Namdongbu
Prosecution Service.

469
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,614
We are arresting you
on charges of tax evasion.

470
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,741
Me?

471
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,953
You have the right to consult an attorney,
to explain yourself,

472
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,414
and to a writ of habeas corpus.

473
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,168
You're always arresting innocent people.

474
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,004
Just be quiet. There are people watching.

475
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,592
Let me talk to my brother for a minute.

476
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,352
Launch Babel Bio while I'm away.

477
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,145
I postponed it.

478
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,605
What?

479
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,191
There are a lot of rumors
about Babel Bio right now.

480
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,486
They're saying it's a front for inflating
stocks and manipulating accounts.

481
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,238
Who are you to decide that?

482
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,906
No, it wasn't all me.

483
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,575
The board and the Planning Division
advised me.

484
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,536
-Hey.
-And sir…

485
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,374
you told me to become a businessman
like Elizabeth Holmes.

486
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,170
But she's a fraud…

487
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,339
and she's in prison.

488
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,264
So what you were saying

489
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,391
was for me to become a fraud.

490
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,478
But I can't do that.
I don't want to cause any trouble for you.

491
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,151
Do you…

492
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,405
really have a death wish?

493
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,331
This is exhausting.

494
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,543
Why would I die?

495
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,421
This is all for your sake.

496
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,226
Take him.

497
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,832
Anyone hungry?

498
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,066
All right. Get out.

499
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,492
You must've had a tough time, sir.

500
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,499
-It's been a while, Mr. Jung.
-Hello, sir.

501
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,461
It's been a while for me too, sir.

502
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,133
Vincenzo won't stand still.
Are you sure you can return?

503
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,678
Did he not threaten you?

504
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,596
He did once.

505
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,058
But a prosecutor should never give in
to a Mafia.

506
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,727
Next week, he's going to become
an assistant chief.

507
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,563
He'll have more power then.

508
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,906
I see.

509
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,825
I'll look forward to it.

510
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,494
Thank you, sir.

511
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,121
Me too, sir.

512
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,386
You have good drinking etiquette.

513
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,388
I may lack knowledge,

514
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,724
but I'm confident about my etiquettes.

515
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,351
It's hot.

516
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,732
-By the way…
-Yes?

517
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,028
You won't kill me, right?

518
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,863
Yes.

519
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,409
Because it kind of looks like
you're repenting.

520
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,330
How can you tell if I'm repenting, though?

521
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,165
I could be putting up a front.

522
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,958
You don't repent with words.

523
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,128
You do it by showing
how much you've changed.

524
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,130
I don't know how long it'll last,

525
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,549
but you're keeping it up pretty well.

526
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,343
My gosh.

527
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,805
How are you so eloquent?

528
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,018
That was a compliment.

529
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,978
You're just amazing.

530
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,360
By the way, why are you helping me
despite the chairman position?

531
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,197
Why am I helping you?

532
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,579
Because you just feel

533
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,332
like a brother to me.

534
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,046
It's strange.

535
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,758
You curse at me, and it's fine.

536
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,428
We play hockey, and I feel at ease.

537
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,684
And it just feels like
I'm drinking with a friend.

538
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,937
That's how I feel.

539
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,777
I'm only asking because I'm tipsy.

540
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,197
Can I treat you like a brother
when we're alone?

541
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,281
No.

542
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,702
I understand, Mr. Cassano.

543
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,165
Fine, but you better mind your manners.

544
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,752
Okay, bro.

545
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,511
The food got cold.

546
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,721
It smells weird.

547
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,056
There's some left.

548
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,525
-Hey.
-Yes?

549
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,236
It's a bit salty.

550
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,321
Maybe there's too much salt.

551
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,823
-Is that it?
-Yes.

552
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,036
Every time I invest, it's a flop.

553
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,913
He gave me some tips.

554
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,833
Share some tips with me.

555
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,460
I'm so jealous.

556
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,597
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

557
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,789
Jang Han-seo, you bastard.

558
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,255
Inmate 6723, you have a visitor.

559
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,942
I'm glad. I was bored.

560
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,405
What do you think?
Don't I look good in these clothes?

561
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,448
You do.

562
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,952
You look relaxed like you're in Cancún.

563
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,662
It's nice in here.

564
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,664
And people are nice too.

565
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,709
Do you think you're safe in there?

566
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,046
You must have people looking after you.

567
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,341
The head of the jail
must treat you well too.

568
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,885
I'm sure you did this in Italy too,
so you must know.

569
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,640
I'm sorry for being a party pooper,

570
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,395
but do you think everything is going
according to your plan?

571
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,251
Don't you think I'd know
that your car was bulletproof?

572
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,039
Do you really think

573
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,626
those men failed to kill you that night?

574
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,382
Persuade Jang Han-seok to go to jail

575
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,343
without him knowing.

576
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,346
I can make that happen,

577
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,058
but wouldn't he be suspicious
if I came up with a charge?

578
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,895
You'll find a reason
to arrest him tomorrow morning.

579
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,898
Okay.

580
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,400
I'm the one…

581
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,612
who put you in there.

582
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,038
Nothing's more entertaining

583
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,918
than an enemy who doesn't know
why they're losing.

584
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,379
Just kill me, you Mafia bastard.

585
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,547
Stop bothering me.

586
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,302
Tell me the truth.
Why are you keeping me alive?

587
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,098
You're afraid, aren't you?

588
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,977
You're afraid of the aftermath.

589
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,355
Right?

590
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,325
I thought you were smart,

591
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,121
but you still haven't caught up.

592
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,598
Let me tell you something new.

593
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,227
Guess what the Mafia used to call me.

594
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,943
It means "a cat that's full."

595
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,070
A cat that's full

596
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,616
toys with a mouse all day
before eating it.

597
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,372
When I was little,
a robber murdered my foster parents.

598
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,501
I joined the Mafia and tormented him
for two years.

599
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,756
Then he attempted suicide.

600
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,512
I had him receive treatment
in the best hospital.

601
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,890
The day he was discharged,

602
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,437
I treated him to the best meal
and killed him.

603
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,525
The real reason I've let you live so far

604
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,195
is because you're my mouse.

605
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,785
That's who I really am.

606
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,459
This is my last time toying with you
before gobbling you up.

607
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,420
You're going to witness

608
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:35,300
the Babel Tower falling from your cell.

609
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,765
I can get out of here tomorrow if I want.

610
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,112
This is the information on your
paper company I got from Ragusang Gallery.

611
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,950
Did you think I gave Mr. Jung
the original copy?

612
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,791
Idiot.

613
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,209
You little…

614
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,379
With this, you'll be in there
for another whole month…

615
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,508
no matter how hard they rack their brains
to get you out.

616
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,183
I hope you enjoy…

617
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,356
seeing the Babel Tower fall
from your cell.

618
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,592
Inmate 6723, let's go back.

619
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,635
Let me go!

620
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,603
About the information
on the paper company.

621
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,521
Did he say there were no copies?

622
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,690
Yes, that's what he said.

623
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,775
How could you blindly believe him?

624
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,070
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

625
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,157
It'll take some time
since it's a criminal charge.

626
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,074
Yes.

627
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,494
Chairman Jang won't be released
anytime soon.

628
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,374
At this rate,
he might as well live behind bars.

629
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,084
Isn't that what many people want?

630
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,252
Hey…

631
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,006
You're right.

632
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,469
Chairman Jang Han-seo can retrieve
the Guillotine file.

633
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,558
Let's keep him behind bars a bit longer
with that information.

634
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,601
Should we?

635
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,479
All right, then.

636
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,483
I'm more concerned
about the Babel Tower lawsuit.

637
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:00,070
Who knows what Vincenzo
and Hong Cha-young may do?

638
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,739
Sir, could you postpone my promotion
for a while?

639
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,617
I'll take care of the lawsuit

640
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,912
and Chairman Jang's case myself.

641
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,919
Hey, Luca.

642
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,297
Mr. Consigliere, I've arrived
at Incheon Airport.

643
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,218
"Incheon"?

644
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,345
What's wrong?

645
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,684
I had no idea that this was all his plan.

646
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,311
I'm sorry, sir.

647
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,898
In any case, I'm safe here, right?

648
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,024
Yes, sir.

649
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,655
Mr. Jung and I will take care
of the paper company

650
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,573
as well as the Babel Tower.

651
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,620
I can't leave for now, right?

652
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:52,956
No, sir.

653
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,586
I refuse to watch Babel Tower fall
from behind bars.

654
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,715
Get me out of here as soon as possible.
Got it?

655
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,967
Yes, sir.

656
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,763
And Han-seo…

657
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,932
Keep an eye on him.

658
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,728
He seems to have awfully matured lately.

659
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,704
I'm looking for Vincenzo Cassano.

660
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,373
-Consigliere?
-Yes.

661
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,168
Follow me.

662
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,427
-How have you been, Luca?
-Excuse me.

663
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,014
Luca!

664
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,893
Luca!

665
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,983
Are these your friends?

666
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,943
Everyone likes you.

667
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,570
Luca!

668
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,658
Consigliere.

669
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,745
Dario and Sebastian have been killed
by the Luciano family.

670
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,664
There's no telling who's next.

671
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,336
What the hell is Paolo doing?

672
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,005
Paolo was indifferent from the get-go.

673
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:28,051
There's intel that the police are planning
to catch him,

674
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,178
so he's packing up to leave.

675
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,807
That heartless bastard!

676
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,560
Their conversation seems quite serious.

677
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,688
I think a few people lost their lives,

678
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,608
and Vincenzo just swore.

679
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,027
Consigliere.

680
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,405
Come back to Italy and save our family.

681
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,784
If you don't,
it will be over for our family.

682
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,634
I've narrowed it down to
four security experts and hackers.

683
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,261
Look at the last page.

684
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,100
PERSONAL INFORMATION

685
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,228
Her current home address is Geumga Plaza.

686
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,022
That's right.

687
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:10,945
So the locksmith has been living
right next to the vault.

688
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:26,980
What is this?

689
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,910
Don't go…

690
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,287
Come on, now.

691
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,873
It's not like he's going to fight
in a war.

692
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,793
-Stop it.
-But he is going to fight in a war.

693
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,463
He might be fighting a battle
to the death--

694
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,799
-Enough.
-Okay.

695
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,842
But I can't.

696
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,344
Mr. Nam

697
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,722
I'll only be away for two weeks.
Don't worry.

698
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:32,647
But what if two weeks become four,
and four weeks become…

699
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,440
Please!

700
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,487
I didn't know you could be so troublesome.

701
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,447
I'm sorry.

702
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,454
Don't worry.
We'll be okay for the time being.

703
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,790
Chairman Jang is in jail after all.

704
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,879
Come on. Don't look at us like that.

705
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,676
Geumga Plaza is like a fortress.

706
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,900
Mr. Nam.

707
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,279
Please, don't cry.

708
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,115
Wipe your tears before you see him off.

709
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,393
Hey, come on out!

710
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,728
Coming!

711
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,986
This is red pepper paste
and seasoned dried radish.

712
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,614
Have them while you're there, okay?

713
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,657
-Thank you.
-I'll put it inside.

714
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,992
There.

715
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:12,830
This is pickled lettuce that my mom made.

716
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,250
I'll put it in your suitcase.

717
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:21,005
This will bring you good luck.
Keep it with you at all times.

718
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,508
It's true. They say it has magical powers.

719
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,009
-Yes.
-Thank you.

720
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,349
We'll protect this place
for the next two weeks.

721
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,019
You will come back for sure, right?

722
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:38,105
Of course, he will. Don't be absurd.

723
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,066
He'll take care of everything

724
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,443
and return right away.

725
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,405
Buddha will be by your side at all times.

726
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,200
Help us, merciful Buddha.

727
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,159
Thank you.

728
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,290
Be careful.

729
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,670
Thanks, bro.

730
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,345
Have a safe trip.

731
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,391
You should go.

732
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:18,813
Your passport?

733
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,283
Have a safe trip.

734
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,578
Make sure to eat on time.

735
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,912
Don't take too long.

736
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,706
Bye.

737
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,457
Don't cry.

738
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,460
-Why are you crying?
-He'll be back soon.

739
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,962
It's only for two weeks.

740
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,380
Are you sure?

741
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,507
You cried.

742
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,175
-I didn't.
-You did, didn't you?

743
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,151
You should go.

744
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,987
I'll see you off.

745
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,196
It's okay.

746
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,702
I'll be back.
Prepare for the lawsuit while I'm away.

747
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:15,703
Okay.

748
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:21,125
And you don't need to buy me
a perfume or scarf on your way back.

749
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,043
Never.

750
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,426
Go inside and have a cup of coffee.

751
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,352
If something happens,

752
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,604
call me right away.

753
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,064
Don't you worry.

754
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,901
I'll get going then.

755
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,405
Luca.

756
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,468
Mr. Cassano!

757
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,815
Friends are…

758
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:30,277
like two souls

759
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,863
in one body.

760
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,499
Don't get hurt…

761
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,672
since it'll hurt me too.

762
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,226
I promise.

763
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,018
Would you like some wine?

764
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,227
No, thank you.

765
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,621
HOW TO BEFRIEND A BIRD

766
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,307
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo.

767
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,565
We won't become friends,

768
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,150
so I'll skip the introduction.

769
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:16,527
Open it right now.

770
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,866
I don't know what you're talking about.

771
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:23,909
I don't know how.

772
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,001
Say that one more time,

773
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:33,711
and I'll kill you.

774
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,610
Did you see him off?

775
01:09:58,652 --> 01:09:59,570
Of course.

776
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,542
He'll take care of everything and return

777
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,586
like he's been doing here.

778
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,546
Of course.

779
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:22,343
But this place does feel so empty
without him.

780
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,930
Two weeks?

781
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:29,266
We'll be busy preparing for the trial,
and time will fly.

782
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,269
You're right. Let's focus on that.

783
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,063
We can do it.

784
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,317
We can do it.

785
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,371
It's open.

786
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:57,271
Where's the gold and the Guillotine file?

787
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,231
I have no idea.

788
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,067
Damn it. Where did you hide them?

789
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,570
I'm telling you the truth. I have no idea.

790
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,209
You little…

791
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:21,754
Tell me the truth.

792
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,088
Where is it?

793
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,689
Damn it.

794
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,649
Go get her.

795
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,201
Mr. Tak!

796
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,620
Mr. Lee!

797
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,790
Mr. Park!

798
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:02,961
What's wrong?

799
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,672
Some thugs barged into Nanyak Temple.

800
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,091
Who?

801
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,222
Mr. Nam, hurry upstairs
and call the others.

802
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,182
I can't! Then you'll be in danger.

803
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,475
Now!

804
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,526
Ms. Seo.

805
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,904
Come here while I'm asking you nicely.

806
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,074
Who are you?

807
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:35,202
This has nothing to do with you.
Stay out of it. It's dangerous.

808
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,580
It does have something to do with me.
I'm her lawyer.

809
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,791
I see.

810
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:44,670
Jipuragi Law Firm.
You're Lawyer Hong Yu-chan's daughter.

811
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,005
How do you know my dad?

812
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:51,635
How could I not? He was an incredible man.

813
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:52,761
Whatever.

814
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:55,639
-Just get lost.
-I guess

815
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:59,560
he didn't teach you
how to respect your elders.

816
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:04,106
He taught me to show absolutely no respect
to people like you.

817
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,318
Bring her over.

818
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,741
Get your hands off of her!
You can't take her.

819
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,288
No!

820
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:47,608
Stop right there.

821
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:10,839
Mr. Cassano.

822
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,592
Are you two all right?

823
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,385
Why didn't you go?

824
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,180
I took care of it in another way.

825
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:21,892
And…

826
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,103
I forgot to feed Inzaghi as well.

827
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,238
Anyway, stand back.

828
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,284
Do you happen to be Vincenzo Cassano?

829
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,744
That's none of your business.

830
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,082
I'll make you pay
in less than five minutes.

831
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:52,399
