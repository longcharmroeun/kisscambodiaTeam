1
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,237
That's enough.

2
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,532
Jang Han-seok.

3
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,202
Damn it.

4
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,120
You got me.

5
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,541
How did you find out?

6
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,251
You can hide the fire,

7
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,878
but you can't hide the smoke.

8
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,547
I guess there was still some smoke left

9
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,341
even when I had the fan on high.

10
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,759
Say your last prayer.

11
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,936
Kill me already.

12
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,979
You Mafia bastard.

13
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,565
As you wish.

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,422
That was a blank,
but next time, it'll be a real bullet.

15
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,174
Put the gun down.

16
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,760
This man is the real boss behind Babel,

17
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,304
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

18
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,889
I'm not Jang Han-seok!

19
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,225
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Shut up!

20
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,477
If he really is Chairman Jang Han-seok,

21
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,312
I'll take care of everything.

22
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,816
I'm not Jang Han-seok! I'm not!

23
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,696
Mr. Cassano.

24
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,699
We're going to fire.

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,706
Shoot me if you can, you Mafia prick.

26
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,129
Put the gun down.

27
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,423
Come on. Do it.

28
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,426
Mr. Cassano.

29
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,243
The day after I saw the broadcast,
I went to the Yangdong Underpass.

30
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,539
It was cleaned up, but there were
bullet marks and bloodstains.

31
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,751
I've been keeping an eye on you
since that day.

32
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,377
Take him.

33
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,017
Please come with us.

34
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,563
Okay.

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,505
EPISODE 12

36
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,806
You're leaving already, Mr. Chairman?

37
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,100
-Cha-young.
-Of course.

38
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,770
Mr. Jang is a victim of attempted murder.

39
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,815
There's no reason at all
for him to be kept here.

40
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,776
Cha-young, there must be
a misunderstanding.

41
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,530
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

42
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,573
Cha-young, please hear me out.

43
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,450
Ms. Choi, just a second.

44
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,955
I have no idea what's going on.

45
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,501
Fine, let's say it's no big deal
for a person to fool another person.

46
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,503
You had fun, I feel like shit,

47
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,880
and we'll never see each other again.

48
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,216
But this is on another level.

49
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,552
You brutally murdered innocent people

50
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,179
and shamelessly put on an act

51
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,932
without feeling any guilt
about killing them.

52
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,852
That means you are less than human

53
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,187
and don't deserve to live.

54
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,731
Understood?

55
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,152
Cha-young, I'm innocent, I swear.

56
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,612
Please don't say that.

57
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,950
You're incredibly consistent.
I'll give you that, you jerk.

58
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,829
Why don't you go and try to save Vincenzo?

59
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,956
Illegal firearm possession,
attempted murder…

60
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,416
This is the end for him.

61
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,753
It's my business whether this is
the end or the beginning.

62
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,381
Take good care of your master.

63
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,054
Cha-young!

64
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,019
PROSECUTOR JUNG IN-KUK

65
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,654
Mr. Cassano,
your gun turned out to be fake.

66
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,866
As well as your bullets.

67
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,996
It's Mr. Vincenzo Cassano's hobby
to collect fake guns.

68
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,915
He is also in the Italian Mafia.

69
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959
The Cassano Family's consigliere.

70
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,754
That's just an aspect
of my client's personal life.

71
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,508
And you used a fake gun like this?

72
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,134
That's unexpected.

73
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,387
So he just violated
Article 11 of the Gun Control Act

74
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
by carrying an imitation firearm.

75
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,184
It's aggravated intimidation,
not attempted murder.

76
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,778
You had no intention
of killing Jang Han-seok, right?

77
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,531
I'll answer that question as his attorney.

78
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,533
No. I want Mr. Cassano to answer it.

79
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,452
If I do, will you exempt me
from being arrested?

80
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,543
You'll have more to gain by releasing me.

81
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,798
That's not enough to convince me.

82
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,846
You're going to kill Jang Han-seok, right?

83
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,433
No. My plans have changed.

84
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,189
I recalled the Italian rules of revenge.

85
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,400
"One.

86
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,944
Give your enemy what they fear the most.

87
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,154
Two.

88
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,823
Take away what they value the most."

89
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:33,161
What Jang Han-seok fears the most
right now is his identity getting exposed.

90
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,288
He also fears

91
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,249
the collapse of Babel,
the most precious thing to him.

92
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,462
Let's aim to give him both.

93
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,300
But that means…

94
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,053
you'll have to stay in Korea longer.

95
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,805
It was partly for you, actually.

96
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,934
Even if I kill Jang Han-seok and leave,

97
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,563
Babel will remain strong,
and you'll continue to fight against them.

98
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,192
I didn't want to leave you
fighting the long war alone.

99
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,493
First, we'll pressure Jang Han-seok
into revealing his identity himself.

100
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,203
We'll start…

101
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,998
by using Prosecutor Jung.

102
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,214
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION
WITH THE REDEVELOPMENT

103
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,135
-Yes?
-The man following you since yesterday

104
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,679
is one of Prosecutor Jung's men.

105
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,231
I usually don't enjoy talking at length,

106
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,566
but I had to stall until you arrived.

107
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,026
As you wish.

108
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,745
We've done our part pressuring him,

109
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,540
so it's your turn now.

110
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,459
Why should I pressure him?

111
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,837
Isn't it your goal to summon
the real chairman of Babel?

112
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,677
I heard that you're ready to bring
all six charges against the Babel Group.

113
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,596
They will be brought one by one

114
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
and are on an unimaginable scale.

115
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,561
The reporters must have been talking.

116
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,980
This time, we'll gladly help you.

117
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,982
We're the only ones…

118
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,570
who are on your side.

119
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,081
"To find a true friend
is like finding a treasure."

120
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,701
Damn it.

121
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,456
The floor got all dirty!

122
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,545
Why did they have to come in here
with their shoes on?

123
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,550
Why wasn't Vincenzo wasn't arrested?

124
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,261
-Well…
-Prosecutor Jung concluded

125
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,640
that his gun was fake and he should
only be charged with intimidation.

126
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,350
Give me just a second.

127
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,230
His gun was fake?

128
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,192
I think Prosecutor Jung fabricated it.

129
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,446
He calls himself
a prosecutor of integrity,

130
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,323
but he's colluding with a Mafia member.

131
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,159
Why don't you lay low for a few weeks?

132
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:04,997
I'm fine.

133
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,709
Let him kill me if he can.

134
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,170
It's not Vincenzo, it's Prosecutor Jung.

135
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,798
-He's trying to summon you.
-Summon me?

136
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:19,804
The thing is, Mr. Jung is ready
to bring six charges against Babel.

137
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,973
Is he seriously planning to summon me
to the prosecutors' office?

138
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,436
Sir, I'll attend the investigation,

139
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,398
so why don't you stay
at Father's vacation home for a while?

140
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,201
Buongiorno, Gilbert.

141
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,829
I mean, Inzaghi.

142
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,958
Who was Gilbert again?

143
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,427
Gilbert.

144
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,224
I like your name.

145
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,268
Gilbert.

146
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,897
It's actually gilbeot, not Gilbert.

147
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,818
Korean for "a friend on the road."

148
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,910
Anyway…

149
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,458
so you heard about the gold

150
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,169
at a bar?

151
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,689
Did you tell anyone
other than the Plaza people?

152
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,150
Just them.

153
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,154
They gave me beer and pizza,
so I spilled the beans.

154
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,241
I have a favor to ask.

155
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,244
Can you leave this neighborhood for good?

156
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,622
Why should I?

157
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,717
As you leave,
forget everything about the gold.

158
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,721
I don't want to.

159
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,975
I'll spend the rest of my life
as a beggar in Geumga-dong.

160
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,566
You'll easily find a neighborhood

161
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,319
much better than here.

162
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:44,156
Are you kidding me?
Geumga-dong is my favorite area.

163
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,124
Is that enough to make you leave
and forget about the gold?

164
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,669
What's gold? Gold?

165
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,421
What are you talking about? What gold?

166
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,553
I'm getting a little tipsy.

167
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,730
Who are you?

168
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,150
What's this?

169
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,823
Why is your phone in my pocket?

170
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,875
-Thank you for everything.
-Not at all.

171
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,419
-Eat up before it gets cold.
-Okay.

172
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,758
I've got to the bottom of the rumor

173
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,679
that there is gold hidden in Geumga Plaza.

174
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,725
Is it true, Mr. Cassano? I'm sure it is.

175
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,321
Not at all.

176
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,990
It was all made up.

177
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,952
That can't be.
Gilbert even showed us a picture

178
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,288
of some workers
in front of that very gold.

179
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,748
Oh, that picture?

180
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,292
I'm sure he downloaded it
from the Internet.

181
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,338
What kind of beggar uses the Internet?
He couldn't even pay his phone bills.

182
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,341
You can use Wi-Fi for free on any street.

183
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,343
Korea is the leader in IT!

184
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,930
Those who survive in the wild
have a strong survival instinct.

185
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,100
It'll be cold up there, so wrap up warm.
Bring hand warmers, too.

186
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,810
Thank you.

187
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,063
-No problem.
-Thank you very much.

188
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,231
-What?
-Bye.

189
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,733
-My goodness.
-Mr. Park!

190
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,152
Mr. Park, listen!

191
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,072
There's gold hidden in this building.

192
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,908
I'm not even going to react.

193
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,415
It's true.

194
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,084
Everyone here knows about it.

195
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,253
Why do you look so serious?
It's not like you.

196
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,547
Unbelievable.

197
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,132
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

198
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,809
Gosh, you startled me.
Do you have something to tell me?

199
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,522
I heard this
from one of my students' grandfather.

200
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,318
What's hidden in this building is
not gold but a ghost.

201
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,487
It's in the basement.

202
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,282
Ten years ago, there was an office there.

203
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,909
The CEO killed his employee,

204
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,036
buried them, and poured cement over them.

205
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,373
Every full moon, the ghost whispers,
"Cement, cement…"

206
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,375
"Cement, cement…"

207
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,672
Thanks to the power
of Buddha from Nanyak Temple,

208
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,674
the ghost is trapped in the basement.

209
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,301
So you should never dig there.

210
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,013
If you do, you'll be possessed
immediately.

211
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,557
Okay.

212
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,476
Why are you telling me this?

213
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,186
I wonder why.

214
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,233
Cement, cement…

215
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,529
Cement, cement…

216
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,406
Cement…

217
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,951
What's with her?

218
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,288
Take good care of things while I'm away.

219
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,915
-Call me if anything happens.
-I will. Don't worry.

220
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,587
Before, I was worried you were too dumb.

221
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,881
Now, I'm worried
you're becoming too reliable.

222
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,261
I'm working really hard.
I'm studying a lot, too.

223
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,514
Then go ahead with auctioning off
the Babel Tower while I'm away.

224
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,020
I thought we were waiting
until after the groundbreaking ceremony.

225
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,188
We should hurry up.

226
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,024
I wasn't expecting to be attacked.

227
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,528
Okay. I'll do my best with the auction.

228
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,740
Have fun messing around
with the higher-ups.

229
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,118
I'll get going.

230
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,996
Take care.

231
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,641
Mr. Cassano doesn't seem to be
able to help us.

232
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,142
I think we pushed him too much.

233
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,062
There's no way he'd know anything.
The gold isn't his.

234
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,522
You're right.

235
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,399
The gold does belong to someone.

236
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,653
If the gold is found,
it will go to the building owner.

237
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,406
Does that mean
the gold belongs to the Babel Group?

238
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,951
Then there's no way
we can let them have it.

239
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,079
We have to stop them from getting the gold
for the sake of justice.

240
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,499
Starting today,
let's not bother Mr. Cassano

241
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,919
and quietly look for the gold ourselves.

242
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,673
I'll take my leave then.
I need to help Mr. Cassano.

243
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,342
I'll let you go.

244
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,520
Seriously. Seeing your face up close,
it's like watching a horror movie.

245
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,273
Then what are you, a war movie?
Your face is in ruins.

246
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,734
Gosh, how can someone look like that?

247
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,403
-What are you looking at?
-What?

248
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,074
That martial artist prick…

249
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,535
What brings you here, Mr. War Movie?

250
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,371
Well, I heard there was gold here.

251
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,333
I overheard everything.

252
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,795
Don't say that. You're cramping our style.

253
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,923
And what if we did?

254
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,258
Seriously.

255
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,219
You could have just told me.

256
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,391
We have no idea what you're saying.

257
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,228
What gold? There's no gold here.

258
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,899
Cut the crap. You're a horrible actor.

259
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,613
Well, just let me know if you need help.

260
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,158
I'm an expert in this field.

261
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,244
Assuming that Jang Han-seok does appear,

262
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,371
we'll have to support these charges.

263
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,625
Every single charge is massive.

264
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,627
To do that,

265
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,672
we'll have to look into Babel's
accounting, stocks, and connections.

266
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,592
Which one will be the first?

267
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,930
Babel Chemicals'
illegal anti-union activities.

268
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,514
That's most likely.

269
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,516
Wusang and Babel would think the same.

270
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,436
Yes. I've planted a spy

271
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,188
to see what they're up to.

272
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,025
Then we'll have no problem
getting information.

273
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,319
Why don't we go and talk to him later?

274
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,487
Sure, let's do that.

275
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,280
Let me be your spy, too.

276
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,201
If you can't accept me officially,

277
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,246
can I at least be an intern?

278
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,999
-What are you talking about?
-Sorry?

279
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,294
He asked me
if he could help us in any way.

280
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,257
Right. I'm sure I can be of help.

281
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,217
Just tell me what to do.

282
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,471
This work is not for everyone.

283
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,099
If you're not as smart
and quick to react as I am--

284
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,601
Great. Let's work together.

285
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,604
Thank you. Thank you so much.

286
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,691
I'm going to prove myself to you.

287
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,070
Fine.

288
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,325
Yes?

289
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,455
I see.

290
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,999
Okay.

291
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,043
Jang Han-seok

292
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,046
has left his nest.

293
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,943
Let's go.

294
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,246
How's it going?

295
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,875
Who are you?

296
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,627
I'm agent Lee Cheol-uk from Jipuragi.

297
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,674
Mr. Cassano said he told you about me.

298
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,223
Nice to meet you both.

299
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,685
Actually, we've met before.

300
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,521
At the underpass. Three men.

301
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,236
Anyway, let's monitor what they're up to.

302
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,615
Can you give me the binoculars?

303
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,408
Thanks.

304
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,791
Among these six charges,

305
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,877
which one will Prosecutor Jung
pursue first?

306
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,463
-Can you guess?
-Yes.

307
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,425
Babel Chemicals'
illegal anti-union activities.

308
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,138
The Babel Chemicals labor union
seems invincible.

309
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,517
They're like a weed that never dies.

310
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,769
They're Babel's strongest labor union,

311
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,188
and the union leader has a lot of power.

312
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,526
They're causing all this trouble
because we didn't trample them properly!

313
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,445
What's your plan, then?

314
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,989
We'll have to go with a classic method.

315
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,033
"Classic"?

316
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,994
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

317
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,124
Request an urgent meeting
with Babel Chemicals labor union leader.

318
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,297
Are you thinking of doing the thing
you did to Daseong Textile's union?

319
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,341
Something like that.

320
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,511
Just make sure we have enough money
to pay for their lives.

321
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,595
Wait.

322
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,307
The world has changed.

323
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,435
What will you do if something goes wrong?

324
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,899
Why don't we let Mr. Jang Han-seo
take care of the negotiations?

325
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,193
He's done business for a while now.

326
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,154
He seems to have gotten quite good at it.

327
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,947
Seung-hyuk.

328
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,907
Yes, Myung-hee?

329
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:18,540
Let me give you
a sincere piece of advice as a friend.

330
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,334
All right.

331
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:28,466
Be careful which ladder
you choose to climb.

332
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,264
If you choose the wrong one,

333
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,352
you'll end up falling to your death.

334
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,481
Keep that in mind.

335
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,697
You're scaring me.

336
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,824
Myung-hee!

337
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,630
From the look of things,

338
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,716
I could tell that there's a conflict
between Mr. Han and Ms. Choi.

339
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,137
It seems like they're
supporting different people.

340
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,265
And Mr. Han seems to be loyal
to Jang Han-seo.

341
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,893
I knew it wouldn't last long.

342
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,022
Did you start working
on the Babel Chemicals labor union?

343
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,608
-Hang on.
-Yes?

344
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,402
When are you going to send me
to the new law firm?

345
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,612
Oh, that…

346
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,323
Well…

347
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,204
Some things still need
to be taken care of in Boston.

348
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,749
Then I can't give you any info.

349
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,376
Not until I join that law firm.

350
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,127
Seriously?

351
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,342
How about the legal team
for Lomborgheni in Korea?

352
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,679
What? Lomborgheni?

353
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,556
I'm friends with the branch manager,
so I can get you in.

354
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,643
They're the best sports car company,

355
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,521
so the pay is good,
and the work isn't that difficult.

356
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,399
I can get you a job at the head office
in Italy, too.

357
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,650
My goodness!

358
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:16,741
Do they give you a Lomborgheni
as a company car too?

359
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,368
I can arrange that for you.

360
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,040
Well, about the Babel Chemicals
labor union…

361
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,043
Ms. Choi said she'd take care of it
using classic method.

362
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,212
But that's all I know.

363
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,842
That would mean they're going to
use brute force.

364
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,014
I have a favor to ask.

365
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,182
Sure. Anything you want.

366
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,892
Can I see you do an impression?

367
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,105
I watched Parasite recently.
It was pretty good.

368
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,276
Are Lomborghenis that good?

369
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,862
Are they that fast?

370
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,909
Yes, they're the fastest cars
in South Korea.

371
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,455
Once you step on the gas…

372
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,214
If Mr. Han teams up with Jang Han-seo
and Ms. Choi with Jang Han-seok,

373
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,551
it'll be so fun to watch them
fight each other.

374
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,178
Which side do you think will win?

375
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,764
My money's on the underdog, Jang Han-seo.

376
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,641
Simple-minded rookies win sometimes.

377
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,312
Underdogs may be appealing,
but they don't win that often.

378
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,818
Thank you.

379
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,781
Do you know the difference between
bungeoppang and ingeoppang?

380
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,574
Of course.

381
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,535
Really? No one seemed to know
exactly how they differ.

382
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,787
Tell me.

383
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,792
The shapes of their mouths are different.

384
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,211
No, that's not it.

385
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,421
The dough is different.

386
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,341
The dough is the same.
The shapes of the mouths are different.

387
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,221
Should we make another bet, then?

388
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,767
All right. Why don't we do
a finger flick like last time?

389
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,647
I'm going to flick your forehead
real hard.

390
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,983
-Are you sure you can handle it?
-Of course.

391
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,902
-I won't go easy on you.
-Me neither.

392
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,363
-I'll flick your forehead…
-Fine.

393
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,989
Take a look.

394
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,744
This is actually an ingeoppang.

395
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,288
-Yes, look at the shape.
-The bread is crispy.

396
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,082
-I'm right.
-About 85 percent

397
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,543
of the bungeoppang we eat
is actually ingeoppang.

398
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,336
You and your nonsense.

399
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,796
I'm telling you, it's true.

400
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,724
-What's that?
-Hey, Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.

401
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
It turns out we were in the same field.

402
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,438
You were the Italian Mafia,
and I was the Geumga-dong Mafia.

403
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,983
How nice.

404
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,902
You're not a Mafia.
You're just a common thug.

405
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,282
Come on. I'm not trying to pick a fight.

406
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,494
Anyway, I'll let you two use
our service for free.

407
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,080
Tell us if you need to run away somewhere.

408
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,042
Come on, let's get along well together.

409
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,505
My goodness.
You're getting prettier every day.

410
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,134
At least you have an eye for beauty.

411
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,886
What is this?

412
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,804
Hot-air balloons?

413
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,808
Is this Around the World in Eighty Days
or what?

414
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,396
The idea is pretty good, though.

415
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,316
It does look fun.

416
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,318
No, you'll die riding it.

417
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,653
-Let's ride one together.
-No way.

418
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,113
Come on!

419
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,282
The fuel expenses…

420
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,995
It's too exhausting handing out flyers.

421
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,332
There aren't many people
who want to flee abroad.

422
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,251
We should work diligently.

423
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,172
The most diligent street dogs
will get to eat the warmest garbage.

424
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,424
-Why would we eat garbage?
-Let's work harder.

425
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,136
-Hey, did you--
-Hello, Mr. Park.

426
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,310
-Try this, too.
-It's tasty if you dip it in this.

427
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,229
-It's delicious.
-Isn't it good?

428
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,773
This is really tasty.

429
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,693
But what's gotten into you guys?

430
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,906
Well, we'd like to let go
of our past grudges

431
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,950
and get along with you.

432
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,369
Please visit my restaurant next time.

433
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,830
I'll treat you to an extravagant meal.

434
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,250
Come on, you're making me feel awkward.

435
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,127
You want to find the gold, right?

436
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,133
Do you know how to find it?
You said you're an expert.

437
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,512
My goodness.

438
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,015
The food is great.

439
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,440
Who is he?

440
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,988
Why does he look like a total fraud?

441
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,030
Don't be ridiculous!

442
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,367
He's the best gold prospector in Korea,

443
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,369
currently working around Mount Taebaek.

444
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,912
Mr. Keum Gwang-jin.

445
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,373
Keum Gwang-jin? His name sounds fake too.

446
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,625
No, he was just born to do this.

447
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,420
He's the best
when it comes to finding gold in Korea.

448
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,632
-Let me see.
-He seems…

449
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
My goodness.

450
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,219
Should I invite him over?

451
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,557
I heard he's on Mount Odae right now.
I miss him.

452
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:02,462
All I need to do is get to the floor.

453
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,517
I'm the only one who knows
that you're the real Kim Jin-min.

454
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,647
If you're gone,
I can become the real Kim Jin-min.

455
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,315
You'll never have your way.

456
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:30,740
THE AGE OF STRAY DOGS AND WILD DOGS

457
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,036
Looks like I did already.

458
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,673
Darn it.

459
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:25,354
You know, fish eyeballs
are considered a delicacy.

460
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,440
You should try some.

461
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,277
I'll never accept the terms you suggested.

462
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,612
Come on.

463
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,158
You'll be the vice president
of the US branch.

464
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:42,497
You'll be getting 20,000 shares
of Babel Chemicals as compensation,

465
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,042
and we'll be paying
for your children's education in the US.

466
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,920
I heard your eldest child is
really bright.

467
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,839
Send them to Harvard.
And we'll double your severance pay.

468
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,552
Tell me if you want anything else.

469
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,305
Don't offer such a dirty deal to me.

470
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,266
It's despicable and it offends me.

471
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,357
How could you turn down
such a wonderful offer?

472
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,235
I'll tell the prosecution
about this as well.

473
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,529
You're making a mockery of our union.

474
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,823
I didn't mock you.

475
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,616
I'm not a mockingbird.

476
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
I'm leaving.

477
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,549
I'm not a mockingbird

478
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,436
You should've accepted my offer
while it was still on the table.

479
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,900
Where are the eyeballs?

480
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,068
Here's one.

481
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,865
It's too fishy.

482
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,387
-Yes?
-What did you do?

483
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,098
Oh. Mr. Jang Han-seok.

484
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,479
You mean the bottled water?

485
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,565
Well, I went through something awful

486
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,984
because of bottled water
when I arrived in Korea.

487
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,736
I had no one else to take it out on.

488
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,799
REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCTS

489
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,600
But it was too easy,
so I don't feel that satisfied.

490
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,519
You still failed to kill me.

491
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,021
That means you're just not good enough.

492
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,776
Don't kid yourself.
I kept you alive on purpose.

493
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,566
How many fingers?

494
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,192
Three!

495
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,570
I tested it

496
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,990
to make sure the effect would only last
a short time.

497
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:50,453
Had it lasted ten minutes, you'd be
checking in at hell's entrance by now.

498
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,038
Why didn't you just kill me?

499
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,875
I really am going to kill you soon.

500
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,627
If I kill you now,

501
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:03,007
you'll be dying
as a rookie lawyer of Wusang.

502
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,177
I prefer that since it's quieter.

503
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,430
Because I don't want to see an obituary

504
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,308
as Chairman Jang Han-seok
of the Babel Group.

505
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,021
Run to another hideout if you're afraid.

506
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,940
I'll follow you there too.

507
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,859
I'm not running away.

508
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,154
Try killing me again. Come and try!

509
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,368
Sorry. The music's going to
hit the climax soon.

510
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,596
Change all the guards standing outside.

511
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,598
No, get a new security company!

512
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,478
I'm sorry, sir. But it's Wusang's most
trusted company… I'll change it, sir.

513
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,774
How can someone almost get killed twice
over three days?

514
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,860
Why don't we have our men
get rid of Vincenzo

515
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,821
when they attack Geumga Plaza?

516
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,197
I ought to…

517
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,203
You must have been startled.

518
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,997
But I have good news for you.

519
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,126
What is it?

520
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,505
The labor union leader of Babel Chemicals
is gone now.

521
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,758
He's up there now.

522
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,344
That was quick.

523
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,264
Then what will happen to the union now?

524
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,934
The stronger the leader,
the bigger the absence.

525
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,687
They'll fall apart soon.

526
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,113
Ms. Choi. You've made me feel much better.

527
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,535
You're the best!

528
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,639
The victim was identified as Mr. Lee,
the Babel Chemicals' labor union leader.

529
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,975
He died at the scene of the accident.

530
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,729
The truck driver had a BAC of 0.171,

531
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,772
enough for him to lose
his driver's license.

532
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,900
Babel and Wusang are at it again.

533
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,194
I'm so sick of them.

534
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,738
Is that what she meant by "classic"?

535
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,948
In order for them
to kill people like that,

536
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,534
they need to keep hiring thugs and hitmen.

537
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,454
I have no idea where they find
all those bad people.

538
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,832
This is just unbelievable!
It's so annoying!

539
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,668
The most villainous lawyers
use the law like money.

540
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,130
They offer to lighten their sentences
or stop them from going to jail.

541
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,382
They have plenty of people to make use of.

542
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,343
Do you do that, too?

543
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,684
Mr. Cassano!

544
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,813
-What brings you here so early?
-Good morning.

545
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,150
We won't bother you anymore
about finding that gold.

546
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,237
We decided to ask a professional to do it.

547
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,364
-Mr. Keum Gwang-jin.
-Gold?

548
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,157
Keum Gwang-jin?

549
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,163
I don't know what you're talking about,
but do whatever you want.

550
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,707
What are they talking about?

551
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,377
What? Didn't Mr. Cassano tell you guys?

552
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,506
Apparently, there's a huge pile of gold
in this building.

553
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,758
Is that really true?

554
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,594
It's just a rumor.
It hasn't been confirmed.

555
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,055
How did you two not know?

556
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,352
Everyone in the Plaza knows about it.

557
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,064
Right. How could you not know about it?

558
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:52,027
My goodness. This is so funny.

559
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,321
-Let's go.
-My goodness.

560
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,489
Hang on.

561
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,410
Don't you dare fight over this, okay?

562
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,371
It's fine, let's go. We'll see you later.

563
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,207
What should I do then not to fight?

564
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,459
All right.

565
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,505
I remember.

566
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,258
You brought up the gold at that bar.

567
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,677
Where did you say it was hidden?

568
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,100
Beneath Nanyak Temple,

569
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,519
in a secret room.

570
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,064
Help us, merciful Buddha!

571
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,359
Then you should've told me it was true!

572
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,820
I did tell you that it was true.

573
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,990
Anyhow, I'm the only one who didn't know.

574
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,452
I was the only one left out.

575
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,539
I've gone through the good and the bad
with you…

576
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,250
for several months now.

577
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:52,212
Well, the others don't know
where exactly the gold is yet.

578
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,548
Did you say it was worth 150 billion won?

579
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,466
What?

580
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,473
Mr. Nam.

581
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:10,272
The gold bars are worth
a trillion and 50 billion won.

582
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,652
Why did you say it was 150 billion?

583
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,320
We weren't that close back then.

584
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,072
-Hey!
-Sorry.

585
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,074
I'm so hurt.

586
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:26,038
I thought of you as my family.

587
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,124
My brother.

588
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,878
-No.
-Come on.

589
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,880
-No…
-There, there.

590
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,007
-It must've been tough.
-My brother.

591
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,385
-You're my brothers.
-I…

592
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,942
HAIR DESIGNER MI-NU

593
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,236
HAIR DESIGNER SEO-NU

594
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,366
Why don't you stay somewhere else?

595
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,828
No, I'll stay here.
Just place twice as many guards here.

596
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,996
All right, sir.

597
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,749
Don't make me look too young.

598
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,543
I want to look neat and strong.

599
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,044
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

600
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:22,177
How about going hunting near by with me
to get your mind off things tomorrow?

601
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,847
I heard the permit expires next month.

602
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,015
Wait.

603
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,518
Should we?

604
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,896
-We haven't hunted since Father died.
-Right.

605
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,859
Then we have to get guns
from the police station.

606
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,278
I'll tell Mr. Kim to bring them tomorrow.

607
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,239
Continue.

608
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,416
A trillion and 50 billion…

609
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,752
It's like a national budget.

610
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,421
Is it all yours?

611
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,048
Just 70 percent of it.

612
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:05,053
The remaining 30 percent is for Mr. Cho.

613
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,765
Seventy percent…

614
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,060
It's 730 billion!

615
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,273
You were actually Korea's Mansour!

616
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,362
Since we're a family now,

617
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,282
we have to protect it together.

618
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,912
Does that mean that we get a share?

619
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:30,954
Of course.

620
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,167
I'll think about how much.

621
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,003
Give me a gun.

622
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,632
I'll stand guard
in front of Nanyak Temple every day.

623
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,135
This is crazy! This is unbelievable!

624
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,930
I can't believe this is happening!

625
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,723
Please lower your voice.

626
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:54,561
But what will you do
if the tenants keep searching for it?

627
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,940
First, we should play dumb.

628
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,527
We should.
To maintain peace in this plaza.

629
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,239
Wait. It's… Hold on. That area's sore.

630
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,198
Gosh.

631
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,211
I heard you visited the prosecution.
What's this fuss about?

632
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,506
There was a leak from the International
Security Intelligence Service.

633
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,967
And the prosecution got a hold of it.

634
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,218
And?

635
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,639
Do you remember?

636
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,725
The Intelligence Service's
Guillotine file?

637
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,185
Of course, I do.

638
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,020
They decided not to disclose it.

639
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,939
Turns out that wasn't the case.

640
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,527
After the file was created,
it was hacked and lost.

641
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,655
But they've pretended as if
they had it all along.

642
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,865
The Prosecution Service is in an uproar.

643
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,713
Hurry up and sit down.

644
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:10,387
How could one of our papers be leaked?

645
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,056
Who in the world leaked it?

646
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,768
This means the prosecution has learned
about the Guillotine file.

647
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,396
Gosh, we've totally humiliated ourselves.

648
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,358
Come back here and help fix this issue.

649
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,528
I can't, sir. Things are hectic
over there as well.

650
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,698
Hey. You're an executive in the bureau.

651
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,408
You need to act like one!

652
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,868
I need more time, sir.

653
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,538
I'll wrap things up and return
as soon as possible. They're in trouble.

654
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,206
Hey. Mr. An.

655
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,666
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Hey.

656
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,918
Hey!

657
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:47,507
No. Let's just halve it,
chip in, and invest--

658
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,884
Mr. Consigliere!

659
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,930
What is it?

660
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,099
I urgently need your advice.

661
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,976
About what?

662
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,855
It's related to our intelligence service.
I need your take on…

663
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,694
"Intelligence service"?

664
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,863
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

665
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,116
He's a double agent of the International
Security Intelligence Service.

666
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,118
-Isn't that incredible?
-"A double agent"?

667
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,333
I was left in the dark again.

668
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,669
Why doesn't anyone tell me anything?

669
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,921
Why is it me every single time?

670
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,883
What am I to you? A kettle?

671
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,347
It must hurt. Just like how I'm in pain.

672
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,768
Several years ago, a former president
gave our intelligence service an order.

673
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,522
Assemblymen, prosecutors,
people in finance, culture and sports…

674
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,775
Look into every single one of them.

675
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,568
From the moment they wake up until…

676
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,280
We collected all corrupt deeds
made by those individuals

677
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,324
and put them into a file.

678
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,993
It was called the Guillotine.

679
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,954
What a terrifying file name.

680
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,956
The "Guillotine" file?

681
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,251
Why did he order it?

682
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,961
To sugarcoat it,

683
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:09,548
he wanted to protect himself
from his enemies after his resignation.

684
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,426
To put it bluntly, he didn't want
to end up behind bars.

685
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,593
Correct.

686
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:18,098
However, a big problem surfaced.

687
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,474
DRAGON

688
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,769
A year later, hackers
from the North Dragon Gang in China

689
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,732
hacked our intelligence service
and stole the file.

690
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,317
Afterwards, they deleted the file
on our end.

691
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,986
GUILLOTINE FINAL REPORT
TOP SECRET

692
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,988
The service hid this fact,

693
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:37,826
marked it as classified,
and swept it under the rug.

694
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,586
As if the file was never lost.

695
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,506
They really put their all into it.

696
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,175
Any information on the hackers?

697
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,137
After a long search,
we finally managed to identify

698
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,557
the boss who gave them the orders
from Shanghai.

699
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,392
And we were trying to trace him.

700
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,518
However…

701
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,021
I'm curious.

702
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,565
I'm sure it's going to be shocking.

703
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,445
The boss had hidden the file
as well as his secret fund

704
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,322
somewhere in Korea

705
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,074
and died of a heart attack one year ago.

706
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,916
That Chinese boss…

707
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,210
What's his name?

708
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,795
Wang Shaolin.

709
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,971
In any case, the file did return to Korea.

710
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:44,976
If you were Wang Shaolin,

711
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,815
where would you have hidden it?

712
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,901
I'm not sure.

713
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,946
Could you think before--

714
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,740
I really don't know. I'm drawing a blank.

715
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,493
So where is that file?

716
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,329
Who knows?

717
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,833
The entire country will be in an uproar
if this is exposed.

718
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,211
It'd be like dropping a nuclear bomb
in Yeouido and Seocho-dong.

719
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,713
And Babel is no exception.

720
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,720
How serious are the details?

721
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,224
I don't know what it's about exactly,

722
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,644
but Babel has been paying
the intelligence service

723
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,813
two big ones every month because of it.

724
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,232
So it's obviously quite serious.

725
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,194
We need to find it quickly.

726
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,321
Exactly, but how?

727
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,906
This is driving me crazy.

728
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,201
Should we tell Chairman Jang?

729
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,206
No.

730
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,459
Let's feel it out first.

731
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,590
We should inform him
when the time is right.

732
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,477
The Guillotine file.

733
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,147
Wang Shaolin.

734
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,067
He hid it in Korea
alongside his secret fund.

735
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,990
That means…

736
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,349
This is nice.

737
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,772
Gosh, I haven't held a firearm in ages.

738
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,317
Tell me about it. I think it's been years.

739
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:02,656
Hey, are you sure
we don't need any hounds?

740
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,408
Yes. It's a hassle to handle them.
Let's just go alone.

741
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,243
Sure.

742
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,789
-Let's go.
-Okay.

743
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,420
This is great.

744
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,013
Do you remember?

745
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,516
I saw you for the first time
at this vacation home.

746
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,393
Yes, I remember.

747
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:36,648
Our father took us hunting
so that we'd become close.

748
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,277
We were terrified of the sound of gunfire,
so we just hid behind him.

749
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,029
I was truly petrified.

750
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,739
Me too.

751
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,741
Over there.

752
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,828
Damn it.

753
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,550
Where did it go?

754
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,266
This is your chance, sir.

755
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,354
You should bid farewell to your brother.

756
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,443
Look here, Mr. Han.

757
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,408
Are you telling me to kill him?

758
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,994
Yes. For your sake.

759
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,665
I can help you become a happy Abel.

760
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,585
You don't need to be afraid of Cain.

761
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,627
But still--

762
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,678
The smaller the gap
between ambition and action,

763
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,473
the better the result.

764
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,519
You must do it now
to make things easier for you.

765
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,898
What are you doing?

766
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,649
-Come up.
-Coming!

767
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,951
Han-seok! I see something over there.

768
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:12,869
Where?

769
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,497
To your right!

770
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,290
To my right?

771
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,084
Yes, that's right!

772
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,670
I think I see it.

773
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,338
Sir…

774
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,199
You…

775
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,077
should've aimed properly.

776
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,650
What's going on?

777
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,905
Help us!

778
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,658
Sir!

779
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,993
Sir!

780
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,079
Sir!

781
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,039
Wake up, sir.

782
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,667
-What happened?
-Please help us.

783
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,253
Look at all this blood. Sir…

784
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,380
Sir.

785
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,300
Hello, is this 911?

786
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,885
Yes.

787
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,220
This is…

788
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:20,306
Sir…

789
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,276
I was right.

790
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,570
Come here.

791
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,656
What is it?

792
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,163
An expert in bungeoppang
and ingeoppang wrote this.

793
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,499
This is how they differ.

794
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,711
"Their taste and texture differ
due to the dough that's used."

795
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,798
It has nothing to do
with the shapes of their mouths.

796
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,008
That's absurd.

797
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,969
But I'm right.

798
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,096
You need to be flicked.
Your forehead, please.

799
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,779
Fine. I should be a good sport.

800
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:18,990
Stay still.

801
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,284
Don't move unless you want to get hurt.

802
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,536
I am standing still.

803
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,085
Enough with the warm-up. Get on with it.

804
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,866
Ms. Hong.

805
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,696
I think I got brain damage.

806
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,827
I only used half of my strength.

807
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:50,289
Had I not,
I would've fractured your skull.

808
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,133
Yes?

809
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,219
When?

810
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,099
Okay. Keep an eye on them for now.

811
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,356
What is it?

812
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,317
Jang Han-seok

813
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,987
went hunting with Jang Han-seo

814
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,823
and was shot by accident.

815
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,118
He's not dead, is he?

816
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,786
He's been taken to the hospital.

817
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,664
That's all we know for now.

818
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,167
I seriously doubt it was an accident.

819
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,294
If this is true…

820
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,090
I guess a war broke out
between the two of them.

821
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,874
Doctor, how is he?

822
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,710
He was bleeding excessively
due to the bullet in his liver.

823
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,922
But we've successfully stopped
the bleeding and removed the bullet.

824
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,674
You don't need to worry anymore, sir.

825
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,852
Thank you, Lord.

826
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:05,675
Don't be scared. Don't regret it.

827
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,886
Han-seo. Han-seo!

828
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,891
Don't be scared, okay?

829
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,103
Don't regret it either.

830
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,105
Ever.

831
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,931
Sir.

832
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,731
I had a terrifying nightmare.

833
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,279
I was buried in a nameless cemetery.

834
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,285
Someone was…

835
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,914
pouring dirt over my face.

836
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,751
There was no one else.

837
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,673
I've managed to survive,

838
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,553
but it's likely that the dream…

839
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,391
could end up coming true, right?

840
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,482
Please answer me…

841
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,695
my consigliere.

842
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,539
It's time for you to make a decision.

843
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:08,172
This could very well happen again.

844
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,760
If you don't want to die namelessly,
you should reveal yourself

845
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,930
and become the chairman.

846
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,266
But I've been hiding it so well until now.

847
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,476
If you continue,

848
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:26,691
it'll become your biggest weakness.
Just like this incident.

849
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,236
Gosh, my poor brother.

850
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,949
You should've aimed properly.

851
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,493
Let's not jump to conclusions.

852
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,121
It could have been an accident.

853
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,747
An accident?

854
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,795
Sure, let's say that it is for now.

855
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,778
Hello, Mr. Cassano.

856
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,156
I'd like to speak with you urgently.

857
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,582
Thanks.

858
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,126
Why did you want to see me so suddenly?

859
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:20,429
To tell the truth, my daughter

860
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:25,142
had to quit her violin lessons last month.

861
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,853
My wife dropped out of her
Pilates class as well.

862
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,942
That's how tough my situation is
right now.

863
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:38,489
So I'd appreciate it if I could get
my share of the gold soon.

864
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,077
-You want to take the gold out?
-Yes.

865
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,080
Let's just take out what we can

866
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,207
and check the condition
of the room as well.

867
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,091
How much do you need? I'll give it to you.

868
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,973
For now, I need 30 billion won.

869
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:13,274
-What?
-I need 30 billion won.

870
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,860
What did you do to have that much debt?

871
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:20,489
For the past several months,
I've been spending money on

872
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,868
cryptocurrency, stocks,
and also on horse racing and other sports.

873
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,369
You shit!

874
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,788
You…

875
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,459
-I'm sorry. You son of a…
-It's all right.

876
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,837
I'm sorry, sir. I am.

877
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,257
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

878
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,217
You were never the type!

879
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,094
-No, I wasn't.
-Why…

880
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,182
Knowing that I'd get the gold

881
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,267
got the best of me.

882
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,234
All right.

883
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,449
Let's take out the amount you need.

884
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,784
We need to talk after that.

885
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,537
Okay. Thank you, sir.

886
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,791
But it'll take a few hours
to take the gold out.

887
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,752
What should we do about the temple?

888
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,771
How can we make the monks
vacate the temple?

889
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,398
Should I take them out for a picnic?

890
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:40,527
No. We need to close down the plaza,
and there should be no one left inside.

891
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:42,321
Right.

892
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,241
The residents often visit each other.

893
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,576
They may make a surprise visit.

894
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:54,541
I have a great idea.

895
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,044
What do you mean?

896
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:58,671
A night at the hot springs?

897
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,840
You've all been through so much lately,

898
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:05,427
so I'd like to send you on vacation.

899
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:10,307
Go have a good rest
and come back feeling rejuvenated.

900
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,019
Here. Please take a look at this.

901
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,814
Jipuragi will cover all expenses.

902
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,067
I specifically looked for a place
that is 53°C, has a pH level of 8.3,

903
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,028
and is slightly alkalic.

904
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,864
But I have lessons every day.

905
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,534
My students really don't like it
when I cancel on them.

906
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,828
Same here. I'd need new clothes to travel.

907
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,329
I don't want to spend money.

908
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,540
I'll go. I could use some relaxing.

909
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,958
-Me too.
-Me too.

910
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:39,003
Me too. I haven't scrubbed my body
in a while.

911
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,379
Who'd like to scrub my back?

912
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,464
I'll get rid of all your dead skin.

913
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:46,302
Just imagining it makes me feel refreshed.

914
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,223
This is a luxury for us.
We can barely make ends meet.

915
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,267
And we can't leave the temple unattended.

916
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,644
You must take extra good care of your skin

917
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,604
-since it's humid in there.
-Right.

918
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,649
I have baby skin. I'm fine.

919
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,319
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

920
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,741
I forgot to tell you
about the prize money.

921
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,661
Whoever takes the best photo
during the trip

922
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:15,748
will receive 20 million won in cash!

923
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,041
-Twenty million?
-Twenty million?

924
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,709
-Twenty million?
-Seriously?

925
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:20,502
It's all yours.

926
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,629
What are you talking about?

927
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,174
All right.

928
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,638
We didn't build Babel Tower
to make a profit.

929
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,933
We built it to display our gratitude
to the assemblymen,

930
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,978
director generals,
and Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

931
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:43,317
From now on, whomever helps Babel,

932
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,863
we're going to give them
this much of the tower.

933
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:50,157
We'll start with the penthouse.

934
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:55,162
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

935
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,873
Your decisions will affect your future--

936
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,001
Damn it. What is it? What is it?

937
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,233
Sir.

938
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,361
That's not how you do it.
Do you think this is telemarketing?

939
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,906
Hey, you. Who are you?

940
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,200
Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

941
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:35,869
Have you been well?

942
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,414
Who are you?

943
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:42,209
Oh, right. You couldn't see my face
because I was wearing

944
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,710
a helmet and a mask.

945
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:05,691
I'm Choi Myung-hee, a lawyer at Wusang

946
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,152
and Babel's legal representative.

947
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:13,240
And he is the eldest son of Babel

948
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:17,369
and Chairman Jang Han-seo's older brother.

949
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,372
-What?
-"The eldest son"?

950
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:26,420
This is embarrassing.

951
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,382
My name is Jang Han-seok.

952
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:35,137
From this moment on,
I will lead the Babel Group.

953
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,271
My brother, you've worked so hard
until now.

954
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,315
Come here.

955
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:57,201
It hurt so much, I thought
I was going to die, you bastard.

956
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,461
-All right, get in.
-Welcome.

957
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,338
Byebye Balloon is lending you this bus

958
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,339
-for free.
-Get in.

959
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,965
I'll pay for the gas as well.

960
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,510
Look at him boasting.

961
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,805
This is wonderful.

962
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:22,184
We'll get going now.

963
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,394
I feel bad for leaving you behind.

964
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,481
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Let's go.

965
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:32,277
-Get on.
-Didn't you say you were not going?

966
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,613
-Okay.
-Watch your step.

967
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,906
Goodness.

968
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:43,539
This is so wonderful.

969
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:46,542
Goodbye.

970
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,253
Let's go.

971
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,107
NANYAK TEMPLE

972
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,652
"Nanyak Temple."

973
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,446
Let's go inside.

974
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,407
The door

975
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,201
is unlocked.

976
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,913
They leave it open
in case anyone comes to pray.

977
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,427
Please excuse us.

978
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,287
-Use that.
-Okay.

979
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,248
-Here.
-Here.

980
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,375
One, two, three.

981
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,587
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

982
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,797
Grab it.

983
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,050
-Grab it!
-Grab it!

984
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,636
Do it again.

985
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:23,764
One, two, three.

986
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:25,182
Grab it!

987
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,340
Help me.

988
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:03,053
-Help me with this.
-Okay.

989
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,972
-One…
-Hold on.

990
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:08,517
Lift it.

991
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,578
Help me.

992
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,332
Be careful.

993
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,894
Today…

994
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:37,606
We finally made it.

995
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,903
I still can't believe
that this is all gold.

996
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,171
There are cultural assets as well.

997
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:14,369
SPECIAL THANKS TO AHN CHANG-HWAN,
HWANG CHANSUNG, NICHKHUN

998
