00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,730
- Hello?
- Are you off to see Jeong Eun?

3
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,490
- Yes.
- You ignored my warning,

4
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,450
so I told her everything.

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,170
I told her that...

6
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,650
you approached her for a reason.

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,190
I told her that you don't like her,

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,370
and that you're using her to get back at your father...

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,370
for abandoning you and your mother.

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,230
Aren't you grateful?

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,490
Had I left you alone,

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,770
you could have become total trash.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,420
You're right.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,730
You're the only one who looks out for me.

15
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,290
I owe you a drink.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,450
Do you...

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,770
eat at all?

18
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,410
Don't skip meals...

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,210
or your medicine.

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,770
Take care of yourself.

21

(SHIN JOON YOUNG)

22
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,410
I plan to get Jeong Eun's confession today.

23
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,050
The hit-and-run case with the fake witness,

24
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,020
evidence and perpetrator.

25
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,130
Jeong Eun's the person who killed Eul's father.

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,740
I will make her admit it herself.

27
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,890
I'm 90 percent sure I'll fail because of you.

28
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,770
If I fail,

29
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,770
you better keep your word.

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,530
Leave the revenge to me.

31
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,090
Whether it's yours...

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,770
or Eul's, I'll be the one to do it.

33
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,230
So just die in peace.

34
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,850
I trust you, so I'll die pitifully but beautifully...

35
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,850
like you told me to.

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,610
So if I fail,

37
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,490
make sure you keep your promise.

38
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,130
Why are you telling me this?

39
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,410
What if I tell Jeong Eun...

40
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,250
and ruin your plan?

41
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,610
If she confesses, it'll ruin my parents.

42
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,050
Why risk telling me this?

43
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,250
You're the only one I could think of.

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,890
I was so sick and tired that I wanted to tell someone.

45
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,730
You're the only one I could tell.

46
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,730
As much as I thought about it,

47
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,930
you're the only person that came to mind.

48
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,290
If you want to ruin my plan, do it. I won't blame you.

49
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,410
I'll just think I lived in a world with no hope at all.

50
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,730
I'll consider myself lucky to be able to leave.

51
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,330
It would help me...

52
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,730
die without any regrets.

53
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,430
So tell me it's not true.

54
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,670
Tell me that Ji Tae is lying.

55
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,250
We didn't meet by chance.

56
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,290
I approached you...

57
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,060
with a purpose.

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,210
It was all planned.

59
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,730
I wanted to get back at my father who abandoned me.

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,460
Let's do this together.

61
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,690
I think you and I may share...

62
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,730
the same destination.

63
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,580
Let's do it together.

64
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,570
(SECURITY SYSTEM: ON)

65
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,090
Hello, this is Shin Joon Young.

66
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,250
Yes.

67
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,590
I was hoping...

68
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,810
you could send Producer Noh to film me this evening.

69
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,950
I wanted to become a prosecutor like my father.

70
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,130
And once I become one, I wanted to visit my father...

71
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,490
and tell him that I grew up well even without him.

72
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,410
I wanted to receive his compliment.

73
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,740
But one day,

74
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,610
I found out about my father's true colours.

75
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,050
My father, whom I respected more than anyone,

76
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,770
was cruel, scary and a cheating fraud,

77
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,850
who'd do anything...

78
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,450
to get his hands on what he wanted.

79
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,330
He covered up...

80
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,850
a hit-and-run case with a request from a powerful man.

81
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,370
He deleted the CCTV footage,

82
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,540
appeased the witness,

83
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,250
changed the driver for a false assertion.

84
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,930
He relegated his junior who wanted to reveal the truth.

85
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,490
That man who died from the hit-and-run accident...

86
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,570
was my girlfriend's father.

87
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,010
And I interfered...

88
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,850
when she wanted to get the truth out there.

89
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,410
She had something on my father.

90
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,490
I snatched her bag as she headed to the TV station.

91
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,410
Thinking that he's still my father,

92
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,090
I wanted to protect him.

93
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,930
So I killed...

94
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,570
my girlfriend.

95
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,370
I killed...

96
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,010
her.

97
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,940
Isn't that scary?

98
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,770
It's a beautiful story.

99
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,690
I envy Congressman Choi.

100
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,530
He has such a loyal son who loves him this much.

101
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,870
I said I killed someone.

102
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,450
People die anyway.

103
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,250
Numerous people are dying even right this moment...

104
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,410
because of accidents, diseases...

105
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,370
or of other causes.

106
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,540
Don't feel too guilty. Let it go.

107
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,490
People die in due time even if you had no part in it.

108
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,180
Is this how you rationalised it...

109
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,730
when you killed a man?

110
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,550
What do you mean?

111
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,450
December 5, 2006.

112
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,330
1:50am.

113
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,060
You hit a man who was pulling a cart across the road.

114
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,610
Then you fled.

115
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,690
Your car model...

116
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,490
was ZEF 320.

117
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,790
The colour of your car was red.

118
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,810
Your license plate number was Seoul 3 Ga 3126.

119
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,750
What are you talking about?

120
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,300
You should know very well.

121
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,110
I should go. My father's looking for me.

122
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,510
Let's film some other day.

123
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,810
You were the driver...

124
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,250
of that sports car.

125
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,830
What kind of a novel are you writing?

126
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,160
Is it really a novel?

127
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,810
It's so nonsensical that I can't stand listening to it.

128
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,770
Then leave.

129
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,530
I planned to get a confession.

130
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,610
The evidence I have will be enough.

131
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,970
You should go.

132
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,810
Drive safely.

133
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,130
What is all this nonsense?

134
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,750
"I was scared and fled."

135
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,500
"I wasn't in my right mind."

136
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,690
"I suffered with guilt all this time."

137
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,690
"I suffered as much as the victim did."

138
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,530
I thought you'd be human enough to say that.

139
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,170
The statute hasn't expired yet.

140
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,090
Let's drink the leftover wine after you do your time.

141
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,050
Oh, wait.

142
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,570
I might not be available then.

143
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,810
You're messing with the wrong person here.

144
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,290
My father is Yoon Seong Ho.

145
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,740
I don't know what evidence you have,

146
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,050
but you can't get me.

147
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,210
Do you think what happened then won't happen again?

148
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,460
My father is much more powerful than he was back then,

149
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,210
and there are many more prosecutors like your father.

150
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,090
Were you testing me?

151
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,370
You don't have any evidence, do you?

152
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,090
You're right.

153
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,330
I don't.

154
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,690
You got rid of everything 10 years ago.

155
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,890
But now I have something.

156
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,050
You just confessed.

157
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,650
Eul.

158
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,090
Are you watching?

159
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,010
This is the truth you wanted so badly.

160
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,810
The woman standing in front of me...

161
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,090
killed your father.

162
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,530
And...

163
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,130
the jerk who took your USB...

164
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,850
and almost killed you...

165
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,690
is me.

166
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,530
I wanted to tell you this before I died.

167
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,050
This is...

168
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,450
the first item on my bucket list...

169
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,530
and the last one.

170
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,810
Did you two stage everything to fool me?

171
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,850
Where's the camera?

172
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,850
Do you have it?

173
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,970
Do you have the camera?

174
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,890
You don't have to scream and incriminate yourself.

175
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,770
You're already in a deep hole,

176
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,410
Ms Yoon.

177
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,900
- Hello?
- Joon Young.

178
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,110
Run.

179
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,330
Get out of there.

180
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,540
Why should he run?

181
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,450
Don't you trust him?

182
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,090
Of course I trust him, but...

183
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,500
Joon Young, then stay right where you are.

184
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,370
If the detectives come, go with them.

185
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,670
We'll be right there.

186
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,130
Don't say a word until you see a lawyer, okay?

187
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,730
What are you talking about?

188
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,250
You're under arrest for illegal drug use.

189
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,580
You have the right to a lawyer...

190
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,190
and the right to remain silent.

191
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,490
You can refuse to give any statements.

192
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,770
What did you say I did?

193
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,470
We'll take samples to test for illegal substances.

194
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,610
Please come with us.

195
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,310
What?

196
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,590
About Shin Joon Young's rumour...

197
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,610
It wasn't your mother's doing. It was your father.

198
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,930
Is that...

199
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,610
possible?

200
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,700
The tests will come up negative.

201
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,690
That's the extent of your father's power.

202
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,250
He can turn any negative into a positive.

203
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,730
But how...

204
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,530
Joon Young...

205
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,090
is his own son.

206
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,730
Do we have any soju?

207
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,090
Shin Joon Young's arrest...

208
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,950
Was it you?

209
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,410
I'd like some kimchi jjigae.

210
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,050
Let's have a drink.

211
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,170
Honey.

212
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,250
Shin Joon Young...

213
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,410
I abandoned him long ago.

214
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,410
My brother met with Young Ok...

215
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,930
and told her she wasn't good enough for me.

216
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,210
He sent her away.

217
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,290
Honey.

218
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,610
- That was...
- I asked him to do it.

219
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,170
It was my idea.

220
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
I...

221
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,690
sent her away.

222
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,370
I knew she was pregnant with my child.

223
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,890
But I wanted to come to you.

224
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,690
Honey...

225
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,450
I fought so hard to get here.

226
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,740
I can't lose it all for someone like him.

227
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,330
Many more shocking things will happen.

228
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,090
I hope you're prepared for it.

229
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,970
(YOON JEONG EUN)

230
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,500
Help me, Ji Tae.

231
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,170
What should I do?

232
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,930
I'm scared.

233
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,850
Joon Young and Eul set me up.

234
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,450
Help...

235
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,970
We have witnesses. Stop denying it.

236
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,940
Model Ha Soo Hee, actor Park Si Geum...

237
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,660
and singer Cho Yoon admitted to doing drugs with you.

238
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,350
Your supplier Yoon Il Joo said he sold you...

239
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,270
the drugs at a club in Itaewon...

240
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,770
eight times since last year.

241
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,530
He has a notebook that lists your name and date...

242
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,090
Joon Young.

243
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,170
- Joon Young.
- What are you doing?

244
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,330
I'm laughing.

245
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,590
What are you doing?

246
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,650
I'm laughing because this is so funny.

247
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,330
Don't you find this funny? Is it just me?

248
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,130
Give that back.

249
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,910
Clearly, someone wrote what they were told.

250
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,930
The spelling's atrocious.

251
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,500
This person even misspelt "committed".

252
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,260
This reaction...

253
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,570
won't do you any good.

254
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,170
I'm really curious.

255
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,660
Am I being punked?

256
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,210
(WE'LL BE CLOSING FOR A WHILE.)

257
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,850
Hey.

258
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,450
We aren't closing.

259
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,740
Can I take the loss from your pay?

260
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,930
Just hear me out.

261
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,380
Let's close for the day...

262
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,850
once those people leave.

263
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,580
Everyone who came in talked about Joon Young on drugs.

264
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,810
I can't take it any more.

265
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,690
That's the only thing they talk about.

266
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,910
That's my point.

267
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,160
Put this up.

268
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,240
They're just misinformed.

269
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,790
"You're wrong. Joon Young wouldn't do drugs."

270
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,410
That's all you have to say.

271
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,330
You have a mouth for a reason.

272
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,650
That's my point.

273
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,810
Tear that up.

274
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,650
Young Ok.

275
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,990
Could I have your attention, please?

276
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,930
Did any of you here read about...

277
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,250
Shin Joon Young...

278
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,870
doing drugs and things?

279
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,530
- Young Ok.
- Ms Shin.

280
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,950
It's okay. Please raise your hand.

281
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,620
If you tell the truth, I'll give you some dumplings.

282
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,690
I see. You all read about it.

283
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,230
Which of you believe those rumours are true?

284
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,890
What are you doing?

285
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,600
It's okay. Please raise your hand.

286
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,490
If you tell the truth, I'll give you bossam.

287
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,930
Young Deuk.

288
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,490
Okay.

289
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,170
Most of you will know that...

290
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,930
I am...

291
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,570
Joon Young's mother.

292
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,670
If those rumours were true,

293
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,450
would I be here selling yukgaejang? I'm not crazy.

294
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,010
My son is innocent.

295
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,900
The rumours mean nothing.

296
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,350
If you hear anyone talk about Joon Young,

297
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,250
tell that person that they're wrong and mistaken.

298
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,930
Tell them that for me, okay?

299
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,370
Will you do that?

300
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,130
- Thank you.
- Bye.

301
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,010
I haven't seen you in a while, Eul.

302
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,170
My goodness. Put that down.

303
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,310
What are you doing?

304
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,690
You can't drink someone's leftovers.

305
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,290
You're going to throw it out anyway.

306
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,770
Consider me a trash can. Throw it into me.

307
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,990
I don't get it.

308
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,530
I thought you'd change, but you're still so crass.

309
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,730
Sit at a clean table.

310
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,210
Is something wrong?

311
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,090
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

312
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,810
Have you heard?

313
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,410
Do you think Joon Young really did it?

314
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,570
Do me a favour.

315
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,970
Don't mention that name around me today.

316
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,450
Okay.

317
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,100
Shin...

318
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,540
ramyeon is a bestseller.

319
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,130
I was talking about noodles, not him.

320
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,130
Won't you order anything?

321
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,910
My goodness. Will you stop reading that?

322
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,190
Joon Young would never do drugs.

323
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,670
How would you know?

324
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,750
His career's over now.

325
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,500
What do you know about him?

326
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,550
Don't talk about him like that. You're older than him.

327
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,610
Excuse me.

328
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,930
You don't own the place.

329
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,230
Could you keep it down?

330
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,070
- Who's she?
- A lunatic.

331
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,490
Yes, I'm a lunatic.

332
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,410
So shut your mouth and drink.

333
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,750
Eul.

334
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,210
No one can drink through closed lips.

335
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,700
Ladies.

336
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,390
She's in a really bad mood. Just ignore her.

337
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,710
You can speak all you want.

338
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,290
When can you chat if not when you drink?

339
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,670
Hey, look. There's another article on him.

340
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,970
- Let's see.
- What does it say?

341
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,090
Can't you complete a sentence without mentioning him?

342
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,550
Politics, economy and culture.

343
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,350
There are so many issues other than Shin Joon Young.

344
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,630
He's the only thing my customers talked about today.

345
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,870
He's the hottest topic right now.

346
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,530
If you can't stand it, get out.

347
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,930
I texted him.

348
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,770
He asked me to do so if you ever came over.

349
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,850
I think it's that time of the month for her.

350
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,330
You should stay at least 500m away from her.

351
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,930
Let's talk.

352
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,850
You'll be filled with disbelief.

353
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,660
The man you love so much...

354
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,570
is Choi Hyun Joon's son.

355
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,650
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,570
My deceiving you...

357
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,810
was crazy enough.

358
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,050
I was the only one in the dark.

359
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,850
It must've been fun for you all.

360
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,370
You deceived me and toyed with me.

361
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,330
I bet you enjoyed it.

362
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,100
I didn't.

363
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,810
Joon Young suffered...

364
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,810
as much as you did.

365
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,180
Maybe even more.

366
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,210
Forget it.

367
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,290
I have no time to listen to your hypocritical excuses.

368
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,530
Joon Young got arrested for using drugs.

369
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,230
The test will come back positive.

370
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,130
My father will see to that.

371
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,610
He stabbed his father in the back...

372
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,930
to find out who really killed your father.

373
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,170
This is the payback he gets...

374
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,730
from his own father...

375
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,090
and mine.

376
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,450
So what?

377
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,690
- Eul.
- What does that have to do with me?

378
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,770
What do you want me to do?

379
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,330
He should've...

380
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,180
turned a blind eye like me.

381
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,530
He should've ignored it and moved on.

382
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,970
That's what everyone else does.

383
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,770
But he did that for a woman,

384
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,570
for conscience and for guilt!

385
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,050
He doesn't even have that long to live.

386
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,290
Why throw away the rest of his life like that?

387
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,650
How's a coward like me...

388
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,130
supposed to deal with that?

389
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,930
Hate me for the rest of your life, but Joon Young...

390
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,010
needs you.

391
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,570
Please, Eul.

392
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,610
No.

Eul.

395
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,690
Jik's upstairs.

396
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,170
What's wrong?

397
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,490
Are you sick?

398
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,090
No.

399
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,810
I told him everything.

400
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,450
The story behind your dad's death.

401
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,570
I had to.

402
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,530
There was no way out.

403
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,410
I had no choice.

404
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,050
I'll come home in a bit.

405
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,970
Text me once your fight dies down.

406
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,330
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,980
Why didn't you say Choi Hyun Joon covered up...

408
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,580
our dad's accident?

409
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,390
His wife threatened you with my life.

410
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,550
Why didn't you tell me?

411
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,010
Why didn't you say that's why you wanted to leave?

412
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,570
Why didn't you tell me that?

413
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,650
- To save you the pain.
- I still should've known.

414
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,630
You made me look like an idiot.

415
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,580
That's what I am and one idiot's enough.

416
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,790
- Eul!
- How could I have told you?

417
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,130
It would've ended your life, too.

418
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,660
Every day is full of pain.

419
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,290
Every hour is torture.

420
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,670
Your smiles are fake,

421
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,610
and you can barely breathe.

422
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,610
- Eul.
- If happiness makes you forget for a second,

423
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,940
you think about how your dad died and wonder if...

424
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,690
you deserve to be so happy.

425
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,550
Do I deserve to smile?

426
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,590
Do I deserve to eat something this tasty?

427
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,890
Do I deserve to sleep in comfort?

428
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,090
Your whole life is riddled with guilt!

429
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,850
- Eul.
- I couldn't put you through that!

430
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,010
Okay, that's enough. I'm sorry.

431
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,290
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,170
Don't tell me to forgive him.

433
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,570
Don't say that.

did you just say?

437
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,430
I...

438
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,090
like men.

439
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,110
Men?

440
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,390
Who's that?

441
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,450
What kind of a name is "Men"?

442
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,130
Bring her over. Is she prettier than me?

443
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,450
Is she cuter?

444
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,510
Is she richer?

445
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,310
Men.

446
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,390
The opposite of women.

447
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,750
Male.

448
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,470
Do you mean...

449
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,750
instead of girls,

450
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,910
you like boys?

451
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,630
You can't be...

452
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,150
Is this a joke?

453
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,270
It's not.

454
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,070
That's why I couldn't touch you.

455
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,190
That's why Na Ri was against us dating.

456
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,910
My gosh.

457
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,030
- No way.
- Sorry for not telling you sooner.

458
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,550
We should...

459
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,470
stop seeing each other.

460
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,550
I'm really sorry.

461
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,670
It's fine.

462
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,750
Don't get up.

463
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,510
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say you're sorry.

464
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,430
- I apologise.
- Don't apologise.

465
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,590

470
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,190
and call you like some mad woman?

00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,590

Okay.

484
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,590
I'll see you there.

485
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,300
Is she still asleep?

486
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,330
Yes.

How can someone sleep for 15 hours?

488
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,810
Is she dead?

489
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,090
I checked a while ago. She's breathing.

490
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,970
Did you end it with Ha Ru?

491
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,210
Yes.

492
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,050
I can't believe she let you go so easily like that.

493
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,590
Have you eaten?

494
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,620
No.

495

Let her sleep a while longer.

496
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,890
We should eat.

00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,090
- I'm hungry.
- Okay.

498
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,660
She'll wake up when she had enough sleep.

499
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620

It's our 100th day.

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,370
You're so cute.

503
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,690
I just can't study because of you.

504
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,230
I'm Joon Young's girlfriend.

Honey, are you done for the day?

506
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,090
Yes, you're my type.

507
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,970
Happy now?

508
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,090
Yes.

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,210
I like you.

510
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,210
Will that do?

511
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,090
Please.

512
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,620
Listen only to me.

513
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,140
Don't listen to anyone else.

514
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,930
Listen only to me.

00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,690
I love you, Eul.

517
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,810
Jik told me to be careful.

518
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,770
I guess I'm the crazy one here! I'm the crazy one!

519
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,210
My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.

520
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,260
What's your problem?

521
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,090
I told you to add fish sauce, not oyster sauce!

522
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,450
I confused the two. Sorry.

523
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,370
Jeong Sik.

524
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,970
What?

525
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,810
- Am I crazy?
- What?

526
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,490
My son...

527
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,660
is at a police station,

528
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,990
and I'm complaining that you used oyster sauce...

529
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,690
instead of fish sauce.

530
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,660
I'm not in my right mind.

531
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,010
To be honest,

532
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,370
you aren't sane.

533
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,180
Ever since yesterday,

534
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,290
you've been acting like 5 or 6 screws are loose.

536
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,770

537
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,490
Let me see.

538
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,140
You're back to normal.

539
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,010
Young Ok.

540
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,330
I'll get the car.

My goodness.

546
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,410
Why would Joon Young need to be investigated?

547
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,310
I'm here to take care of some personal issues.

548
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,620
Joon Young isn't in there.

549
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,290
Are the rumours about him true though?

550
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,090
Did he really take drugs?

551
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,330
What drugs?

552
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,810
He never went near the stuff.

553
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,450
Do you want to end up getting sued for defamation?

Gosh, where did I leave my phone?

555
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,930
Just a moment.

556
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,290
Excuse me.

557
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,890
If you even so much as write one line about this,

558
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,450
you and I...

559
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,450
will end up in there for a cross-examination.

560
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,890
So watch out.

561
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,390
Why are you here when the press is, too?

562
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,620
We didn't think they'd be here.

563
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,540
- We came to see Joon Young.
- Don't look at me.

564
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,180
Act like you're here for something else.

565
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,890
If the reporters find out who you are, it'll get bad.

566
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,850
How is Joon Young?

567
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,730
Is he sick?

568
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,890
We just saw him. He's fine.

569
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,050
He told me to tell you that...

570
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,770
there's nothing to worry about.

571
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,370
I'm sure it's nothing.

572
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,260
He'll be fine.

573
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,330
They won't...

574
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,220
accept any more visitors today.

575
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,620
- What?
- Don't look at me.

576
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,140
I'm sorry about this.

577
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,290
I owe your wife.

578
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,410
What you're going through...

579
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,970
has nothing to do with my wife.

580
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,970
I gave the order.

581
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,690
Once you get out,

582
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,660
you should retire...

583
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,690
and move abroad with your mother.

584
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,140
I will see to it that you get to live...

585
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,690
a comfortable life.

586
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:50,930
I'll give you plenty of...

587
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,850
I have more than enough money.

588
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,660
That's good to hear.

589
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,450
Anyway,

590
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,140
as soon as...

591
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,930
What happens if I refuse to leave?

592
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,290
Will I be convicted for drug use?

593
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,890
We shouldn't let it go that far.

594
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,050
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

595
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,330
You really have a lot of power.

596
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,170
10 years ago and even now.

597
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,290
I know.

598
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,010
I did all sorts of things...

599
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,210
to get where I am now.

600
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,890
Did you abandon my mother...

601
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,490
so you could gain all that power?

602
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,730
She wasn't the one to leave, was she?

603
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,410
I'll take that as a yes.

604
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,170
If you...

605
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,690
promise to leave Korea in silence,

606
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,410
I will drop the drug charges...

607
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:25,810
Detective!

608
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,090
We're done.

609
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,410
Joon Young.

610
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,770
Dad.

611
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,770
This will be...

612
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,570
the last time I call you that.

613
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:55,890
Also,

614
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,810
the fact that I'm your son...

615
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,610
I will consider it a disgrace...

616
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,370
and an embarrassment...

617
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,570
and shame until the day I die.

618

620
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,580
This is the truth you wanted so badly.

621
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,250
The woman standing in front of me...

622
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,970
killed your father.

623
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,490
And...

624
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,370
the jerk who took your USB...

625
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,130
and almost killed you...

626
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,090
is me.

627
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,930
I wanted to tell you this before I died.

628
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,410
This is...

629
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,890
the first item on my bucket list...

630
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,890
and the last one.

631
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,490
It's Yoon Jeong Eun.

632
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,010
Hello.

633
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,560
Was the traffic bad?

634
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,260
There's no one here.

635
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,570
There aren't any customers or staff.

636
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,930
I wanted to talk to you in private.

637
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:31,790
I'm sure you did.

638
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,770
Would you like some coffee?

639
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,130
I'm upset.

640
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,980
I fell into the trap Joon Young set...

641
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,570
and blurted out some nonsense.

642
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,810
You didn't believe everything you heard, did you?

643
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:59,530
I'm not the driver who hit your father...

644
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,730
I remember...

645
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,690
the face of the driver who hit him.

646
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,770
Shoot.

647
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,290
Dad!

648
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,970
Hey!

649
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,530
Come back!

650
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,770
I saw it all.

651
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,730
Why didn't I recognise you right away?

652
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,330
Did you enjoy your life of comfort and luxury?

653
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,650
Just so you don't misunderstand,

654
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,090
this doesn't mean I'm admitting to anything.

655
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,940
I just pity you for what you went through,

656
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,370
and I want to console you.

657
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,510
I'll air it on TV.

658
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,730
The whole thing, without any editing.

659
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,300
I'll also hand this over to the police as evidence...

660
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,650
of what you did.

661
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,970
Can you do that?

662
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,150
You're just a freelance producer.

663
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,370
I'll make it happen.

664
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,170
I'm just a freelance producer,

665
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,650
but power doesn't prevail all the time.

666
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,230
That will hurt Joon Young, the man you love so dearly.

667
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,090
If he committed a crime, he must pay.

668
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,910
That goes for everyone.

669
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,250
Noh Eul.

670
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,570
I didn't get to taste the coffee you prepared for me.

671
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,010
You can...

672
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,930
eat it all yourself.

673
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,250
Hey!

674
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:21,890
Stop right there.

675
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,690
I said stop!

676
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,610
Stop!

677
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,130
Honey.

678
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,690
Why are you so deep in thought?

679
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,470
Don't worry, it's nothing.

680
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,610
Drink your medicine.

681
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,010
Thanks.

682
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,890
Ji Tae.

683
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:57,970
Tell me what to do.

684
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,030
What are you talking about?

685
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,690
However hard I think about this,

686
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,130
there nothing I can do to stop you two.

687
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:10,450
You two have become monsters I can't deal with.

688
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,890
Ji Tae.

689
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,310
Please, think carefully.

690
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,490
Is there really no way...

691
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,290
to stop you?

692
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,870
Your father's tired. Stop talking such nonsense.

693
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,570
- Dad.
- Yes.

694
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:28,410
I'm sorry to say there is no way.

695
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,050
Kyu Cheol.

696
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,490
Gather the press.

697
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,810
Say I'll tell them a story about my parents...

698
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,890
that will shock everyone who hears it.

699
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,810
Ji Tae.

700
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,180
What about that?

701
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,410
Could that...

702
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,650
possibly work?

703
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,170
Have you lost your mind?

704
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,290
Root for me, Dad.

705
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,410
I'd like to win this fight.

706
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:22,350
Shin Joon Young suffered from constant headaches...

707
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,900
and was diagnosed with a brainstem glioma.

708
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,910
He kept it from his friends and family...

709
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,630
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes.

710
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,810
Everyone's shocked to hear that he suffered alone.

711
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,550
His good looks...

712
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,030
It's 81 dollars and 50 cents.

713
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,310
That can't be right.

714
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,330
The popular Hallyu star, Shin Joon Young, is...

715
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,610
You had yukgaejang jeongol, bossam,

716
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,070
dumplings and three bottles of soju.

717
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,270
You forgot about the dumplings.

718
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,670
Thank you.

719
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,680
Just a moment.

720
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,960
Hello?

721
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,670
I saw the article, and we're trying to confirm. Bye.

722
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,870
I'll call you back in 30 minutes.

723
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,030
Will you answer the phones?

724
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,990
Hello?

725
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,070
We're not planning to have a press conference just yet.

726
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,950
I wasn't able to talk to him, either.

727
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,710
Wait.

728
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,630
Is Joon Young...

729
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,750
really dying?

730
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:44,070
(SHIN JOON YOUNG)

731
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,590

00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,040
Did you see this?

734
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,910
Is Shin Joon Young really dying?

735
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,330
Do you think the drugs are killing him?

736
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:09,870
It's not the drugs.

737
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,000
He has something in his brain.

738
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,030
In his brain?

739
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,330
It must hurt to die so young when he has everything.

740
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,710
Too bad.

741
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,830
What are you talking about?

742
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,820
(THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.)

743
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,510
(SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THAT THIS IS ALL A DREAM.)

744
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,390
(PLEASE SAVE JOON YOUNG.)

745
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,310
I'm 10 minutes away.

746
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,510
Are the reporters there?

747
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,550
Okay, I'll be right there.

748
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,890
Well done, Eul.

749
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,050
Did you see the girl's face?

750
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,370
It was a complete success.

751
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,250
She really thought that you're my girlfriend.

752
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,690
Why don't you try acting?

753
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,650
Okay, I'll dock twice more.

754
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,150
I stayed up studying for my exams.

755
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,610
Give me just 10 minutes.

756
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,170
I think I'll get an A for everything.

757
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,330
I'll treat you if I get a scholarship.

758
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,730
Joon Young.

759
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,010
I'm going to sleep now. Don't wake me.

760
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,130
I'm the crazy one.

761
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:51,610
How did I end up in this mess with you?

762
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,290
You're the one who got yourself in this mess.

763
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:00,670
I did more than enough for the day. I'm going home.

764
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,430
I stayed up studying for my exams.

765
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,730
Give me just 10 minutes.

766
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,160
No way.

767
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,570
This counts as 2 of the 10 penalties you owe me.

768
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,690
Make it three.

769
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,290
You might as well be generous.

770
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,650
Deal.

771
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:22,010
I did well today, so dock one more.

772
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,010
- Call it four.
- Watch it.

773
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,450
He may have...

774
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,570
some delusional memories.

775
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,650
He'll temporarily confuse the past and present.

776
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:44,290
Don't overreact. Just hug him.

777
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:58,130
After the long, tiresome...

778
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,370
and painful period,

779
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,170
Joon Young returned...

780
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,740
to the time he missed...

781
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,580
and wished to return to the most.

782
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,650
(UNCONTROLLABLY FOND)
