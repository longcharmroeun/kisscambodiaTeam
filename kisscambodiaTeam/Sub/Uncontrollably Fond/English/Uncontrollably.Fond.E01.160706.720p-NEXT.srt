00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,160
This woman standing next to me...

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,800
is my wife...

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,200
from this very moment.

6
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,520
Through joy,

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,440
sorrow,

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
difficulties, sickness, aging...

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,520
or any other hardships that may come,

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,120
I won't let go...

11
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,120
of my wife's hand...

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,720
that I'm holding right now.

13
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,560
Hey.

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,640
You traitor.

15
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,960
How dare you meddle with Boss' woman?

16
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,760
She's always been my girl.

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
What?

18
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,960
What was that? What gibberish is he saying?

19
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's go home.

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,730
Kill him. Let's go home.

21
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,440
Let's go.

22
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,920
Honey!

23
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,920
Let go of me.

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Let go!

25
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,720
You!

26
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Hey!

27
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,720
No!

28
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
I don't want to die.

29
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,000
This isn't Hollywood. Who dies at a gunshot?

30
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
Why didn't he die?

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,520
Producer.

32
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,520
- It's too cold.
- Could you give her a jacket?

33
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,640
Producer.

34
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,480
What is it all of a sudden?

35
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
You joined the show knowing that you'd die in the end.

36
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,480
- I changed my mind.
- What?

37
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,440
I can't die like this.

38
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Please edit...

39
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
the script.

40
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
My goodness.

41
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,720
Girls, why did you come all the way here?

42
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,520
What's wrong with you girls?

43
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Move away. You'll hurt yourself.

44
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
How did they make it here on this cold day?

45
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
Darn it.

46
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,600
My gosh, he's such a prince.

47
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
There he is.

48
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
- What happened?
- The writer said...

49
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,480
she won't edit it...

50
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,280
and doesn't care whether it gets aired or not.

51
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,160
She got really angry and said...

52
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,600
she'll get rid of Joon Young from this industry.

53
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,640
What are you going to do?

54
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,320
What are we going to do?

55
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,640
But how can she get rid of a huge star...

56
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,200
like Joon Young?

57
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,920
She's the one who might end up losing her ground.

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,400
It's all over the Internet now.

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,600
"Shin Joon Young is in trouble with his writer."

60
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,480
"The star may leave the show unaired."

61
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,400
"Shin Joon Young's bossy", "Shin Joon Young's rude"...

62
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,720
and "Shin Joon Young never dies."

63
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
You look excited.

64
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Do I?

65
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,880
I'll go meet the producer. You can stop the reporters.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,280
He didn't say anything about the script last week.

67
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
He was fine with dying back then.

68
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,760
He was so excited talking about it.

69
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,720
This is why he's crazy.

70
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,560
"Shin Joon Young, you are a rude jerk."

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,800
"You still have a lot to learn."

72
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
That's what one of the comments said.

73
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,760
There are worse ones. Do you want to hear it?

74
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,080
Where's Joon Young?

75
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,960
The patient, Yoo Jong Soon, in room number 2011...

76
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,120
seems to have an atypical parkinsonism disorder.

77
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,120
Take another blood sample and run an examination.

78
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Mr Shin Joon Young.

79
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I couldn't get any sleep last night...

80
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,440
thinking this through.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,320
- It doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't?

82
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,200
The fact that...

83
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,960
I only have another year or so to live...

84
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,960
due to a disease even modern medicine has no cure for.

85
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Do you even know how healthy I am?

86
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,520
I can run 100m in 11 seconds.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,960
It takes me 30 minutes to climb up Mount Cheonggye.

88
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,160
I sleep well and I eat well.

89
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,600
Other than a few headaches, I'm completely fine.

90
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
I see.

91
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,920
Did you by any chance...

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,920
get me confused with my role in that drama?

93
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,410
No.

94
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I didn't.

95
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,410
It may be a misdiagnosis.

96
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,920
That happens often to bad doctors, right?

97
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
If you can't trust me,

98
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,160
I can refer you to another doctor.

99
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,160
What if I say...

100
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,920
that I refuse to die?

101
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
I don't care if you're a doctor.

102
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,840
How do you know when I'll die?

103
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,360
What if I say I refuse to die?

104
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,160
What happens then?

105
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,960
Joon Young, just quietly die this once, please?

106
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,080
They already filmed a scene for your cremation.

107
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,080
If you keep saying that you won't die,

108
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,880
things would get very serious.

109
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,600
This has to air tonight.

110
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,320
Do you really want to cause a problem?

111
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,120
I will get you scripts...

112
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
with only happy endings from now on.

113
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,600
So let's just do this.

114
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,040
Please don't be a hassle just this once.

115
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,120
Can you just die without making a scene?

116
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,600
DL Industrial illegally discharges industrial waste.

117
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,720
Scene 17, film 1.

118
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,680
What is it? Did someone make fun of your weight?

119
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,600
Write their names down.

120
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
- I'll get back at them.
- Joon Young is dead.

121
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
The last episode...

122
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,480
of his drama just ended.

123
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
He got shot...

124
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
- during the wedding scene.
- How old are you?

125
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,000
You shouldn't be crying over a fictional character.

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,040
Oh, Joon Young.

127
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,880
My goodness.

128
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,000
You're...

129
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm hanging up. Don't call me again.

130
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,200
Why are there only 2 guys? I thought I saw 3...

131
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,240
Open the door.

132
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,960
I have to go to the restroom.

133
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
Open the door!

134
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
Darn it. Who are you to lock me up?

135
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,160
You criminals who discharge waste water illegally!

136
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,400
You are worse than a brute!

137
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,040
If you don't open this door,

138
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm going to pee right here.

139
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
There's a toilet here, too.

140
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
You illegally discharged waste water...

141
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,880
and violently took away my belongings.

142
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,320
Also, you've threatened me and locked me up.

143
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
Do you also murder people?

144
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,120
No way.

145
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Mr Kim.

146
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,480
I am Yang Jun Ho, a director of this company.

147
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,960
You look like a college student,

148
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,000
but you are very infamous in this industry,

149
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,200
Producer Noh Eul of SNU Production.

150
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,400
My goodness.

151
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,280
You erased everything I recorded today.

152
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,640
Did you film anything?

153
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,600
It's all right.

154
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
I already have enough cuts.

155
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I just came to see if I can get some more footages.

156
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,160
The 3rd, 10th, 18th of last month...

157
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,400
and the 5th, 13th and 19th of this month.

158
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
It's a total of six times...

159
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,760
that you discharged waste water on rainy days.

160
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,360
I already have enough footage.

161
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,200
If you aren't going to murder me, can you show me out?

162
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
If I'm late,

163
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,920
my staff member may call the police.

164
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
What do you want?

165
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,640
Tell me what you want.

166
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,600
A world where the least of justice,

167
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,440
common sense and principles prevail.

168
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,400
A world where people like you...

169
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,800
are too embarrassed to walk around.

170
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,200
If you let it pass this once, it won't happen again.

171
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
If you need more, you can tell me.

172
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,360
Unbelievable.

173
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,960
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
- Producer.

174
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
Is this world that easy for you?

175
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,320
Do you think money is an answer to everything?

176
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,120
Do you think you can cover up the truth with money?

177
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,880
(TRANSFERRING 4,950 DOLLARS)

178
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,600
Your transaction is being processed. Please wait.

179
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,760
(GRIM REAPER)

180
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,480
I just sent 4,950 dollars.

181
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,160
That means I have 32,250 dollars left.

182
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Keep your books right.

183
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,400
Why do you care where I got this money from?

184
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,720
Whether I stole this or sold the country for this,

185
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,760
it shouldn't matter to a loan shark like you.

186
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,640
(LAWYER PYO)

187
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
Yes, Mr Pyo.

188
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,440
Are you working out? Isn't it a little late for that?

189
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Yes, but I want to live long.

190
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm glad to hear that.

191
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,240
- It's about that lady you asked me.
- Yes?

192
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,200
How much would you like me to look into?

193
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,120
Find out where she's living...

194
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,800
and what she does for a living.

195
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,240
See if she owns her place or if it's rented.

196
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,960
Find out about her assets...

197
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,600
and her education.

198
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,680
Find out if she's married.

199
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,000
If she is,

200
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,480
find out what her husband does.

201
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,280
Anything else?

202
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
- That's all.
- Okay.

203
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
When I find her, should I mention you?

204
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
No, don't say anything.

205
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
Don't even say that I was looking for her.

206
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
Weren't you going to meet her?

207
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Not at all.

208
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,880
Okay. I'll give you a call as soon as I find her.

209
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,280
Don't work out too hard. Good night.

210
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
You too.

211
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,640
(YOU DID A GREAT JOB TODAY.)

212
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,610
(YOU DID A GREAT JOB TODAY.)

213
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,040
Why are you up so early?

214
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,040
What time is it?

215
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,040
Is it already?

216
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,850
You know you eat a lot for a dog, right?

217
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,160
And you only like expensive food.

218
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,610
You shouldn't do that.

219
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,880
When I'm gone, Gook Young will take care of you.

220
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,480
He's not going to buy you expensive dog food.

221
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,370
He'll probably give you leftovers.

222
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
Should I write a will?

223
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,440
Even if I did write one, he wouldn't abide by it.

224
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,000
You'll just have to deal with him.

225
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,520
First of all,

226
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,240
try eating some human food.

227
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
Try not to be picky.

228
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,640
Okay?

229
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,320
He's so short-tempered.

230
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,850
Ramyeon is the best.

231
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
That looks so good.

233
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,400
This is why I'm ill.

234
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,560
I never eat a hearty meal.

235
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,440
Destruction, destruction, all will be destroyed

236
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,800
There's the evil lady.

237
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,800
- We can't let her have the earth.
- Destruction,

238
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,610
- destruction - Die, you evil scoundrel!

239
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,880
It hurts.

240
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,640
Kids, stop.

241
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,090
If you have something to say, tell me.

242
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,720
You shouldn't act violent like this, okay?

243
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,440
Stop talking, you evil lady.

244
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,160
Be quiet, you evil lady.

245
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,090
Hey. What are you doing?

246
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,120
Stop watching those cartoons.

247
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,640
You are becoming more and more violent every day.

248
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,960
Should I work on the violence of cartoons?

249
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,760
Why did you make them cry?

250
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,960
- She hit me.
- Mum, she hit me.

251
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
Did you hit my children?

252
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,160
I didn't. They tried to kill me.

253
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,920
- Do you want to see?
- I don't care.

254
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,880
Even if you do chores around the house,

255
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,040
it won't stop me from raising the rent.

256
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,120
Let's go, my babies.

257
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,600
Can you cut the rent down, please?

258
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
Just 100 dollars. How about 50? Maybe just 30 then?

259
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,800
If you don't like my price, you can leave.

260
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,240
I never liked it, you know.

261
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
But still...

262
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I've got nowhere else to go.

263
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,360
Let me see.

264
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,320
Look how dark your blood is.

265
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,680
It's because you always eat in a hurry.

266
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,680
I'll bring some porridge.

267
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Have that instead of yukgaejang today.

268
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,560
- I'm fine.
- You punk.

269
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,480
Just do as I say, will you?

270
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,800
I'd like 100 servings of yukgaejang.

271
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,520
Why? Do you think I can't eat all of it?

272
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
Give it to me and see if I can do it or not.

273
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,880
We don't sell yukgaejang, Sir.

274
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,760
What are you talking about? This is a yukgaejang place.

275
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,400
Whatever we decide to sell in this restaurant is...

276
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
none of your business.

277
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,400
- I'll bring porridge.
- Okay.

278
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
If you want it so badly, find another place.

279
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,160
I don't want to go elsewhere. Give me yukgaejang.

280
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
I told you I am not serving it.

281
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,320
Then what are all these people eating?

282
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm selling it to them, but not to you.

283
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,320
Then I'll have plain rice and kimchi.

284
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,920
If you continue to hassle me,

285
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm calling the police for obstruction of business.

286
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,520
In that case, I'll call my lawyer.

287
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,800
I'll report you for denying service without a reason.

288
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,200
What are you trying to do?

289
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,080
Just give me that yukgaejang.

290
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,160
Goodness.

291
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,560
- Oh my gosh.
- I can't believe he's here.

292
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,960
- This is awesome.
- You idiot.

293
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,040
Please stop taking pictures.

294
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,000
Don't take pictures. I'm sorry.

295
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,080
Joon Young, just go.

296
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,440
She won't give you anything no matter how hard you try.

297
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,120
People are watching. Just go.

298
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
Stop taking pictures.

299
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,360
- Young Deuk, stop them.
- Okay.

300
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,040
Stop taking pictures, please.

301
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,680
Jeong Sik,

302
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,760
pour some salt out in the front when this guy leaves.

303
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,360
Excuse me, stop taking pictures.

304
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
Stop, please.

305
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,680
Can you charge me for 100 servings on this?

306
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,120
I even made a payment.

307
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,600
I'm going to report you if you don't give it to me.

308
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Okay.

309
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,240
I'll do that. Keep coming until she gives it to you.

310
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,920
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.

311
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,800
Or even 10 to 20 years from now, keep coming.

312
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,240
Don't give up. All right?

313
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,200
Okay.

314
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,960
Excuse me. May I try your yukgaejang?

315
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,440
Can anyone please pour out money from the sky?

316
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,680
I have...

317
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,080
exactly 240 dollars in my account now.

318
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,640
I have to help my brother study...

319
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,080
and send him off to college, too.

320
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,600
I need to feed him meat, too.

321
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,800
His sneakers are...

322
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,480
all worn out,

323
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,880
and all his underwear are worn out, too.

324
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
My goodness.

325
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,920
You don't need to come to work starting today.

326
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,160
We don't need trash like you.

327
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,360
My gosh.

328
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,920
You are being too harsh. That was awful.

329
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,960
Joon Young is your own son.

330
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
- Has he gone?
- Of course.

331
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,680
He had to beg a customer...

332
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,160
for a spoon of yukgaejang...

333
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,080
before he left.

334
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,000
- Is he a beggar?
- Who made him like that? My gosh.

335
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,880
You are so old-fashioned.

336
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,120
Celebrities aren't treated awfully like the old days.

337
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,080
You wanted him to be a prosecutor or a judge,

338
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,640
but Joon Young makes much more money,

339
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,120
and he is much more famous.

340
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,880
Shut your mouth. You are spitting.

341
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,280
Young Ok, Joon Young isn't...

342
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,560
someone you can look down on.

343
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,560
What will you do when Joon Young...

344
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,600
suddenly treats you like a complete stranger?

345
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,440
This porridge is all yours now.

346
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,960
You spat all over this bowl. I can't serve it any more.

347
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,800
I failed again.

348
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,760
Should I just tell Mum...

349
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,960
that I'm dying soon,

350
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,560
and that she should give me yukgaejang?

351
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
I won't give you a bite. This is all mine.

352
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,160
Why are you refusing to do this documentary?

353
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,400
Just because. I don't want to do it.

354
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,120
Just because?

355
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,160
Nonsense.

356
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,520
Do you know how much money...

357
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
and manpower went into this project?

358
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,320
Other celebrities are dying to do this.

359
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,200
That sounds great. They can take the project.

360
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
What are you? 15?

361
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,680
You threw a huge fit...

362
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,040
about how you didn't like that drama's ending.

363
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,920
Yes, I threw a fit, but I went with the script.

364
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,120
I won't do anything I don't want to do from now on.

365
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,040
Joon Young, you jerk.

366
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,800
Is this all you have after a week's time?

367
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,040
Don't you have any better ideas?

368
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,320
I'm sorry for being late.

370
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,320
My gosh.

371
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,760
This is for you.

372
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,160
Chocolate milk tea with tapioca.

373
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,160
Let's see. Here is taro milk tea for you.

374
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
And this is...

375
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,520
my heart for you.

376
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
This is jasmine green tea...

377
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,880
just for you.

378
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,400
This is grapefruit-flavoured...

379
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,120
green tea ade.

380
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,600
Lastly, for you,

381
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,120
- mango smoothie.
- Noh Eul.

382
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
- Yes, Sir!
- What are you doing?

383
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,600
Didn't you get my text?

384
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,440
I'm sure you received it.

385
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,520
I found a great item.

386
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,280
Kangin Pharmaceutical recently made new diet pills.

387
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,920
I heard there was an accident during the clinical test.

388
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,880
- They tried to cover it by...
- So what?

389
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,560
How much money are you expecting this time?

390
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,000
Kangin Pharmaceutical is...

391
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,160
really awful.

392
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,400
They tried to quiet the victims...

393
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,680
Wasn't that enough?

394
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,880
Wasn't it enough money you took...

395
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,720
for covering up the case for DL Industrial?

396
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,600
Yes, it was enough.

397
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,920
But...

398
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,960
I didn't take as much as you think I did.

399
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,360
DL Industrial was...

400
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,000
caught for the first time.

401
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,040
They've given back to society, too.

402
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,280
And nothing will change even if I...

403
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,320
Noh Eul!

404
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,520
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,040
Do you still call yourself a producer?

406
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,640
Where are your ethics, common sense and...

407
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Forget it.

408
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,560
Do you even have a thing called conscience?

409
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,320
Of course, I do.

410
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,720
I can't show you, but I do have one.

411
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,520
Unbelievable.

412
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,080
You. Get out of here right now. Now!

413
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,560
Also, before I report you to the police,

414
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,760
give back what you got from DL Industrial...

415
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,960
and never come back.

416
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,760
Stop disgracing us and just leave already!

418
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,240
You know what?

419
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,080
I remember you...

420
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,920
covering up nomination malpractice...

421
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,440
and receiving 100,000 dollars. Was it 200,000?

422
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,400
Aren't I right?

423
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,720
Hey, are you crazy?

424
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,720
You, too.

425
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
You covered up Yuil Motors' supplier corruption...

426
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,280
and received a car and a good amount of stocks.

427
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,360
Hey, you!

428
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,240
Are you kidding me?

429
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,840
Can you let this one slide?

430
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,440
I will try to hide it as much as I can...

431
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,840
just like you two.

432
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240
Just let this one pass, please?

433
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,480
Jerks.

434
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,320
Idiot.

435
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Who?

436
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,000
It's you.

437
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,200
Who's the idiot?

438
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Everyone.

439
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,160
Everyone...

440
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,720
- in this world.
- Why is everyone that bad?

441
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,880
- A producer like you is bad...
- Gosh. Darn it.

442
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,400
for covering up malpractices for money.

443
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,600
- He's so loud. Gosh.
- Why do you blame everyone?

444
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,360
The CEO and my senior...

445
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,160
took a lot more than I did, but only I got fired.

446
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,520
- I'm thankful that you are.
- Ji Tae.

447
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,240
You stole an egg. Next time, it'll be an ox.

448
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,120
If you hadn't got fired, you would have become...

449
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,560
a huge thief just like your CEO or your senior.

450
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,360
I'm glad that you got caught and got fired.

451
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,640
Excuse me.

452
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,480
Don't stand around. Take a seat.

453
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,800
No, I'm leaving.

454
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,920
I don't want to drink with her.

455
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,840
- Ji Tae.
- Okay.

456
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,960
Don't hang out with her today.

457
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,160
- She needs to be punished.
- Bong Sook!

458
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,760
You don't deserve to talk back to us.

459
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,080
Why do you live like that?

460
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,680
Do you think your parents would...

461
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,520
be proud of you looking down from above?

462
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
Stop picking on me.

463
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,000
You can't say anything to those who are worse than me.

464
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,280
Stop picking on me!

465
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,360
I'm leaving.

466
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,960
Stick your nose into a bowl...

467
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
and reflect on yourself.

468
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,440
Bong Sook.

469
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,720
- Give me a bowl.
- What for?

470
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,640
I'll stick my nose into a bowl...

471
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,680
and die while looking back on myself!

472
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,080
Hurry up and give me a bowl.

473
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,800
Give me a bowl.

474
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,360
Give me a bowl.

475
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,840
- What an idiot.
- Bring me one.

476
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,530
Stop drinking and go home!

477
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,680
Bong Sook, I'm going to kill myself.

478
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,440
You can die a little bit...

479
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,920
after I die.

480
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,840
I have to put my nose in this tofu soup...

481
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,490
and die before you.

482
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,400
So you put your nose...

483
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,490
- in your bowl later.
- What is he saying?

484
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,600
Hey, stop it. Gosh.

485
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,280
No, I'm fine.

486
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,440
Now, I will try...

487
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,840
to kill myself as a sign of resistance...

488
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,560
against his overuse of power...

489
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,600
by putting my nose in this soup.

490
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,320
Guys, don't let my death go in vain.

491
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,720
Make sure you tell the jerk, Shin Joon Young,

492
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,680
that I died because of him.

493
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,840
- Producer.
- Yes?

494
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,120
You've gone a little too far.

495
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,800
Joon Young isn't a jerk.

496
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,440
What do you know about him?

497
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,760
Gook Young, calm down.

498
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,400
Look at him. He's obviously drunk.

499
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,440
Gosh. I am completely sober.

500
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,360
I am perfectly fine.

501
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,320
Gosh. Shin Joon Young, that scum.

502
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,010
Is being a celebrity all that matters?

503
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,320
Is being popular all that matters?

504
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
What gives him the right...

505
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,760
to break contracts whenever he wants...

506
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,360
and break promises like they are not important?

507
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,010
Goodness. We will pay the penalty.

508
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,840
We'll pay.

509
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,600
That penalty isn't worth much.

510
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,760
You didn't even write a proper contract with us.

511
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,720
We worked so hard...

512
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,080
to get him to agree on filming the documentary.

513
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,600
We tried so hard to attract that much investment.

514
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,970
He was fine with filming it with us until yesterday.

515
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,120
If he changes his mind all of a sudden now,

516
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,040
what can us powerless people do? Darn it.

517
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,560
- Come on.
- My gosh.

518
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,320
- Come on. Get up.
- I don't care.

519
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
- Let's go now.
- Gosh.

520
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,120
- Gosh.
- Do you want me to change his mind?

521
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,920
- The bowl girl.
- I know...

522
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,010
what that documentary is.

523
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,680
It's the series with Ban Ki Moon and Park Ji Sung.

524
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,280
Isn't that right? Shin Joon Young was next.

525
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
- Isn't that right?
- Who are you?

526
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm in the industry, too.

527
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,880
As you probably heard,

528
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,640
it's been five hours...

529
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,320
since I was sacked for taking bribes.

530
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,880
So what?

531
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,080
I will...

532
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,400
- talk to Shin Joon Young.
- Gosh.

533
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,490
I will make him film the documentary.

534
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Do you know him?

535
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,970
- Are you a friend of his?
- Everyone knows...

536
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,320
who Shin Joon Young is.

537
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,360
- My gosh.
- Excuse us.

538
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,010
We can't sit through your drunk talk.

539
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,530
Can you just leave us? Go.

540
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,040
What if I do persuade him?

541
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,280
- Are you...
- If I do persuade him,

542
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,920
will you give me a job at your production?

543
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,240
I won't take any bribes this time.

544
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,080
I will work clean and fair.

545
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,920
I'm serious.

546
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,010
Should I write this down?

547
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Sure, goodbye.

548
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,400
- What a weirdo.
- Get up.

550
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,320
This is insane!

551
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,920
My gosh.

552
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,600
(SHIN JOON YOUNG WAS SIGHTED AT A CLUB.)

553
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,530
Hey, have you really seen him there?

554
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
Darn it.

555
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,400
I can't believe this.

556
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Look.

557
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,120
This is obviously one of Seo Yoon Hoo's fans' doing.

558
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,600
How am I supposed to handle this?

559
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,680
Why? What is it?

560
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,360
Is this really Joon Young?

561
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,280
Joon Young never goes clubbing.

562
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,640
How are you so sure?

563
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,600
This story seems...

564
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,600
Is that guy's full name...

565
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,600
Shin Joon Young?

566
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,530
He's that celebrity, right?

567
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,440
Ha Ru is a fanatic for him, right?

568
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,120
I'm not a fanatic.

569
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm a huge fan.

570
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,640
I'm also a huge fan of his, too.

571
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,010
Ha Ru helped me join his fan club.

572
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,920
You should join us.

573
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,600
You get 10 percent off on the tickets to his concerts.

574
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,970
- Let's see.
- Dad.

575
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,360
This picture is maliciously photoshopped.

576
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,360
Exactly.

577
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,120
Indeed, a former prosecutor is different.

578
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,320
What can I do about them?

579
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,760
Joon Young has been getting...

580
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,490
a lot of bad comments because of that since last night.

581
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,600
Ha Ru.

582
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,010
Do you like him that much?

583
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,160
I feel like dying because I like him so much.

584
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,240
I want to marry him.

585
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,440
You can't do that, Ha Ru.

586
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,840
Don't let me down here.

587
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,010
I don't approve of guys like him...

588
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,280
as my son-in-law.

589
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,640
I don't like his job, either.

590
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,400
I also don't like his looks.

591
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,760
Handsome guys make me feel uncomfortable.

592
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,680
It's not like he wanted to be handsome.

593
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,040
His father made him into a handsome man.

594
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,530
Good morning.

595
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,320
Hello, good morning.

596
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,530
- Good morning, Ms Lee.
- Hello.

597
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
Hi, Mum.

598
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Hi, Ha Ru.

599
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,970
I feel so dizzy.

600
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,160
I think I need to go and rest.

601
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,320
I'll eat breakfast later.

602
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,200
What will I do with her?

603
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,040
She can't sleep or eat because of her studies.

604
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,760
I feel so bad.

605
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,560
If it were something I could do, I'd do it for her.

606
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,560
Don't worry about our kids.

607
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,560
Just worry about your health.

608
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,970
Right, Doctor Kim told you to watch out.

609
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,760
Your liver index was too high on your last checkup.

610
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,490
I am not surprised because you work day and night.

611
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,880
You're not the only congressman in this country.

612
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,010
No one will recognise you for your hard works.

613
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,560
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

614
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,400
Could you bring me the newspaper?

615
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,040
Sure.

616
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
Why? Do you want me to stop nagging?

617
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,360
Why would you make me...

618
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,720
I am still amazed,

619
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,080
happy and thankful...

620
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,240
that you are my wife.

621
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
Thank you.

Oh dear. Gosh.

627
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,010
- Darn it.
- What is it?

628
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,490
Oh well, it's...

629
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,320
It's not what it seems.

630
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,600
I wasn't going to give this to Joon Young.

631
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,920
It's just...

632
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,880
One of my friends really wanted to try this.

633
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,600
These aren't...

634
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,320
meant for Joon Young either.

635
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,640
What's so bad about giving it to him?

636
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,760
Joon Young is very picky.

637
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,400
He won't eat the housekeeper's food.

638
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,120
So he just wants to eat your food.

639
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,400
And he's been eating...

640
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,200
only gimbap and ramyeon.

641
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,720
It breaks my heart to think about Joon Young.

642
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,120
How can you be so cold?

643
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,040
You can be his mum, then.

644
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,160

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,160
Who is this?

646
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,240
Oh, my gosh. She's really here.

647
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,880
Mr Shin, are you there?

648
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,320
I'm not a solicitor,

649
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,840
your fanatic or a weird stranger.

650
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,040
I am just a pretty, kind and honest...

651
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,360
citizen of Korea.

652
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,560
I met her the other day when we had a drink.

653
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,400
She said that...

654
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,480
she can persuade you into filming that documentary.

655
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,240
She was also a producer,

656
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,200
but she got fired after taking a bribe.

657
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,080
She seems a bit like a crook.

658
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,800
She seems a bit crazy.

659
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm not crazy.

660
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,560
I can tell that you are his manager.

661
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,400
Shouldn't you be helping me instead?

662
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,160
You had a lot to complain about him, too.

663
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,520
Did she just hear what I said?

664
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,120
You were complaining about how Joon Young...

665
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
refused to do movies, dramas, singing and all.

666
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,800
You said that you'd also lose your job...

667
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,440
and that you wanted to give him a good beating.

668
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,040
You said it as you were peeing outside the restaurant.

669
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,080
My gosh, she's insane.

670
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,040
Joon Young, I didn't say that.

671
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,440
Can you meet me, Sir?

672
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,760
Let's talk face-to-face.

673
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,600
If I seem crazy, you can kick me out then.

674
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,800
I'll kick you out now. Goodbye.

675
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Mr Shin...

676
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,240
Hold on.

677
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,880
Mr Shin.

678
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,080
Hey! Shin Joon Young!

679
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,960
No, Joon Young.

680
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,040
If you retire,

681
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,440
I guess I'd become jobless.

682
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,120
But I didn't talk about you like that.

683
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,360
I say things inside, but I never say them out loud.

684
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,040
You know how I am.

685
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,040
Pororo, it's time to shower.

686
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,080

These cyclists avoid obstacles here and there,

690
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,360
driving down the endless roads...

691
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,920

692
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,280

699
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,080
Doesn't it feel good?

700
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,240
Let's wash you up now.

701
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,400
Does it feel good?

702
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,840
You have scored.

703
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,600
Darn it.

704
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,560
You need things like this...

705
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,320
on days like these.

706
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,160
You probably know this well, Korean red ginseng.

707
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,520
Yes, today's product is something...

708
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,880
- very popular.
- Very popular.

709
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,280

- Selling like hot cakes...

710
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,520

711
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,040
We have prepared various products.

712
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,000
Why didn't you send me a picture of your dinner?

713
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,160
Wait.

714
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,920

Are you going ice climbing?

724
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,480
I did some research in your fan club website.

725
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,840
Your likes, dislikes,

726
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,960
hobby, specialty and habits.

727
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,400
You go ice climbing or racing when you're stressed out.

728
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,640
Should I drag you out?

729
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,880
I know that you probably are...

730
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,040
very annoyed with me, but I'm desperate, too.

731
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,480
I have to make a living.

732
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,320
I will count to three.

733
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,400
- One.
- Let's just film that documentary.

734
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,040
- Two.
- We'll do a lot of video revisions, too.

735
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,800
- You won't see any of your pores.
- Three.

736
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,320
Slow down. Otherwise...

737
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,520
Is he crazy?

738
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,040
Do you want to get off?

739
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,360
Take this as your compensation.

740
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,680
And don't ever come back again.

741
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,760
(RADIO)

742
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,160
There has been an accident due to the heavy snow.

743
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,520
Reporter Kim Eun Ah is out on the scene.

744
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,720
This is Kim Eun Ah.

745
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,600
A truck on highway six slipped on snow...

746
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,800
and hit a woman in her 20s.

747
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,920
This unidentified female...

748
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,200
is being taken to the hospital at the moment.

749
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,000
However, she is said to be severely injured.

750
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,680
According to the weather bureau,

751
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,640
additional 10 to 15cm of snow...

752
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,480
is predicted to accumulate.

753
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,040
All drivers should be careful.

754
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,280
(LAWYER PYO)

755
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,080
Yes, Mr Pyo. I'm in a hurry, so...

756
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,040
I found the woman.

757
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,040
Me too.

758
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,280
I think I found her, too.

759
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,760
Did you change your mind?

760
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,480
Is that why you're back?

761
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
You know...

762
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,160
I'm not doing this...

763
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,000
just so I can work or something.

764
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,600
This documentary will work wonders...

765
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,440
to change your image of an arrogant jerk.

766
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,520
To be honest, the more you earn...

767
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,520
Don't you recognise me?

768
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,000
I do.

769
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,640
You're a star.

770
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,600
Even my landlord's young kids know you.

771
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,640
Noh Eul.

772
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,440
Do you not recognise me?

773
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,400
I do.

774
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,240

It's Joon Young.

777
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,920
I want to confess my love.

778
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,160
To the guy that you like?

779
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,880
Joon Young, my name is Noh Eul.

780
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,560
I liked you for a long time.

781
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,040
You're adorable. I love you, Eul.

782
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,800
You'll probably have a brother-in-law soon.

783
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,240
You said you'd rather go to prison...

784
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,800
than be my girlfriend.

785
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,640
That's not where the restroom is.

786
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,040
If I become a prosecutor, it's all your fault.

787
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,560
How can love change?

788
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,320
Are you going to make fun of poor Eul?

789
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,760
Just leave her alone.

790
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,160
I couldn't sleep because I had to study.

791
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,480
Please let me sleep for 10 minutes.

792
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,480
If I'd known you'd become so glamorous,

793
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,040
I wouldn't have let you go no matter what.

794
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Be my girlfriend.
