1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,900
Where are you, Pororo?

2
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,020
I dreamed of you all week.

3
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,300
Could you dream of me, too?

4
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,900
I'll call you back later.

5
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,860
I don't have a lot of time right now.

6
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,220
Stop playing hard to get and come back, Eul.

7
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,540
I got back...

8
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,510
from the doctor's.

9
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,380
He says things got a bit worse.

10
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
So...

11
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,100
I don't think I have much more time to spend with you.

12
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,340
I'm afraid I'll die before I get to...

13
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,660
tell you how much I love you.

14
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,580
That's my biggest worry.

15
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
What's wrong?

16
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,699
I don't think it's an audio issue.

17
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
Why can't we hear what he says to the cameras?

18
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,639
I hear everything.

19
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,340
Can you hear that?

20
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
Yes.

21
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,220
I can...

22
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,580
hear him loud and clear.

23
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
Hello, Mother.

24
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,620
I'm away right now.

25
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
I will...

26
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,300
give up on Ji Tae.

27
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,180
You should give up, too.

28
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,900
Ji Tae won't ever change his...

29
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
Jeong Eun. Hello?

30
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,980
Hello? Jeong Eun?

31
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm not here to surrender.

32
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm here to declare war.

33
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,310
I don't know how far you'll go,

34
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,620
but I plan to follow you all the way.

35
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,750
That's what I'm here to say.

36
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,700
I'll give up on Ji Tae.

37
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,700
You should give up, too.

38
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,380
Ji Tae won't ever change his...

39
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,380
(MOTHER)

40
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,460
Have you sobered up?

41
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Let go.

42
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,140
Let go of my arm, you scumbag.

43
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,860
Lose the engagement ring when we next kiss.

44
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,620
I'm not kind or strong enough to welcome a woman...

45
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,580
wearing another man's...

46
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,980
engagement ring.

47
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,740
My goodness, look who's here.

48
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,980
Aren't you Director Yoon?

49
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,980
She had a lot to drink. Take her home.

50
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,740
What just happened?

51
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,780
Nothing happened between you and Ms Yoon, right?

52
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,189
Have you forgotten who she is?

53
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,380
You should hurry.

54
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,220
We can't let her drink and drive.

55
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,260
Did you two really get up to something?

56
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,759
If you did, you gave up being human!

57
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,759
That makes you a beast, okay?

58
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,380
That little punk.

59
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,700
Give me your car key.

60
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,500
You shouldn't drive if you're drunk.

61
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Do you think you can make fun of me, too?

62
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,740
I'm not making fun of you. Once I take you home,

63
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,919
I will forget everything I saw and heard today.

64
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,940
Don't you worry.

65
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,030
Do you hate seeing me that much?

66
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
Yes.

67
00:08:56,581 --> 00:09:00,150
My fans wish they could see my face for over a minute.

68
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,460
They'd want to kill you if they heard that.

69
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,459
Drop me off at the hospital and get lost.

70
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Sure.

71
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,030
I'm good at getting lost.

72
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,380
I'll disappear from your sight right away...

73
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,380
without leaving a trace.

74
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,100
But just not right now.

75
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,910
- What?
- I'll go after a minimum of three months...

76
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,620
or a maximum of four months.

77
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,380
Loversleporineladymart, bring my love to me.

78
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,439
Loversleporineladymart, please, my love.

79
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,239
Please, come to me.

80
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,479
Are you still doing this? It's been days.

81
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,900
You're 20 years old.

82
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,340
Do you trust what primary school kids put online?

83
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,679
Your whole family's tense as it is.

84
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,260
Couldn't you at least pretend to study?

85
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,559
Why are you eating that?

86
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,940
There are so many other things to eat.

87
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,129
Spit it out right now.

88
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,579
Do you think you're a goat?

89
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,780
Spit it out.

90
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
There you go.

91
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,979
Eating that completes the spell. Give it back.

92
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,839
If something like this guarantees love,

93
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,780
I'd be with a truckload of men right now.

94
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,279
Loversleporineladymart, loversleporineladymart.

95
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,879
Give it up, will you?

96
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,580
Loversleporineladymart, loversleporineladymart.

97
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
(NOH JIK)

98
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Ms Jang.

99
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,220
Apologise to the kids.

100
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,780
The spell...

101
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,260
just worked.

102
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,340
It worked. It finally worked.

103
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,399
You must be really angry.

104
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,159
I ignored your calls...

105
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,740
and your texts.

106
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,509
- Sorry.
- No.

107
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,660
I'm not angry.

108
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,999
While I couldn't reach you,

109
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,039
I met a truckload of other guys who are...

110
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,620
1,000 times sexier and 10,000 times cooler than you.

111
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,060
I see.

112
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,780
Okay, then.

113
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,700
I should go.

114
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,209
Where are you going?

115
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,659
You said you met guys who are 1,000 times sexier...

116
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,580
and 10,000 times cooler than me.

117
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,879
- So you'll just leave?
- Yes.

118
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,140
This is insane.

119
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,359
Where would I ever meet someone else?

120
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,369
I idolised Joon Young for the past three years.

121
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,940
Now, I finally moved on to you.

122
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,140
I may seem like a rude punk, but I'm a devoted...

123
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,060
Why did you just gulp?

124
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,900
- What?
- What will you do this time?

125
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,959
What would I possibly do to you?

126
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,679
Do you think I'm a pervert?

127
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,860
I'm not at all like that.

128
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm very conservative and unsociable.

129
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,780
I won't bite, so don't worry, you little kid.

130
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,799
No physical contact until I graduate from high school.

131
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,060
- What?
- Hugs are only for special days.

132
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,639
What are you talking about?

133
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,780
I'd like to...

134
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,540
meet your parents.

135
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,709
I'll introduce you to my sister, too.

136
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,420
I can't understand a word you're saying.

137
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,860
Let's ask for permission...

138
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,060
and date for real.

139
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,980
- What?
- Don't you want to?

140
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,060
It's not that I don't want to.

141
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,139
This isn't the Joseon dynasty.

142
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,899
We aren't getting married.

143
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,020
We don't need permission.

144
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,639
And why can't I kiss you?

145
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,780
Even middle school kids kiss their boyfriends.

146
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,740
That's up to them.

147
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,959
I have certain values.

148
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,879
Once I become an adult who can take responsibility,

149
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,460
I will take care of you...

150
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,620
and act accordingly.

151
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,780
What are you saying?

152
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,340
My head hurts.

153
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,780
Can't I touch even a hair on your body...

154
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,100
until you graduate from school?

155
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,780
Let's just hold hands.

156
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,620
I mean, people shake hands all the time, so...

157
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,300
I... I don't think we can hold hands, either.

158
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,660
Why not?

159
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,999
Hello, Doctor Kang, how are you?

160
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,860
A lady named Noh Eul came by this morning.

161
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,180
Why was she there?

162
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,180
She said she knew you were sick.

163
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,460
So I told her everything.

164
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,270
I told her you need help.

165
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,540
Tell me.

166
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,620
What does Joon Young have and how bad is it?

167
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,180
You're his doctor.

168
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,270
I know everything.

169
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,389
So don't lie to me.

170
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,860
Tell me everything. Don't leave anything out.

171
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,700
Will Joon Young...

172
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,660
really...

173
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,020
die?

174
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
How did you get in?

175
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:57,100
What kind of a celebrity uses 0000 for a password?

176
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,540
Are you a birdbrain?

177
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,549
I thought we were over.

178
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,900
You're right.

179
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,060
We were,

180
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,529
but I suddenly thought that...

181
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,100
ending it now wouldn't benefit me that much.

182
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,660
What would make you think otherwise?

183
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,750
Let me continue working.

184
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,180
I'm not saying we should date.

185
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,180
I don't care if you see someone else.

186
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,860
I don't care if you hug someone else in front of me.

187
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,780
Just let me be next to...

188
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,660
Honestly, being the producer of your documentary...

189
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
is a huge resume in itself.

190
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,020
It's not worth changing it for 10,000 dollars.

191
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I'd like to be a star producer, too.

192
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,510
Will you let me?

193
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,380
Joon Young.

194
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
No.

195
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,900
Don't be so clingy. Keep your word.

196
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,620
You have one minute to get out.

197
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,509
You good-for-nothing...

198
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,540
The chairwoman should be responsible for her actions.

199
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,959
My mother did nothing to rectify the problems.

200
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,059
Whenever something went wrong, to avoid scrutiny,

201
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,139
she stayed at home or...

202
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,900
How dare you say that.

203
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,429
I know that filial piety means nothing these days...

204
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,559
and that business isn't always about family,

205
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,340
but how could a son try to dismiss his own mother?

206
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,019
Take this back right now.

207
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
I'm sorry.

208
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,180
I can't do that, Uncle.

209
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,979
Keep fighting, then.

210
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,460
Let's see who gets hurt.

211
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,460
You ungrateful jerk.

213
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,660
Stop trying.

214
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,580
You can't beat your mother.

215
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,180
You're only hurting yourself.

216
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,750
I'm falling for Joon Young.

217
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Are you surprised?

218
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,180
So am I.

219
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,380
I'm actually falling for someone other than you.

220
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,900
I never imagined it would be possible.

221
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
He...

222
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,060
makes my heart pound.

223
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,180
Will you not stop me?

224
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,100
Ji Tae.

225
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,180
I already gave you my answer.

226
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,140
Madam Yoon's here.

227
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,500
Why didn't you call to say you'd be here?

228
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,079
Did something good happen recently?

229
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,660
You're glowing.

230
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,419
About what I said yesterday...

231
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,349
Someone from Jeju Island sent some saw-edged perch.

232
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,869
Why don't you have dinner with us today?

233
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,140
Are you free?

234
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,919
Ji Tae said he'd come home for dinner.

235
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,620
- Mother.
- I almost forgot.

236
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,839
This is for you.

237
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,149
It's a limited edition. Only two came in Korea.

238
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,780
I hope you like it.

239
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Mother.

240
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,019
About the phone call yesterday...

241
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,140
What about that?

242
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,100
About you saying you'll give up on Ji Tae?

243
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,860
I'm sorry.

244
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,260
I really have nothing to say as his mother.

245
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,180
Be the warm-hearted person you are and forgive Ji Tae.

246
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Please...

247
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm seeing someone else.

248
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,580
I was with him...

249
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,380
yesterday.

250
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,820
End it with him.

251
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,060
- Mother.
- Shall I do it for you if you can't?

252
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,180
Like before?

253
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,309
I also talked to some reporters,

254
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,199
and they said his mother, Shin Young Ok,

255
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,740
has always been a single mother who raised him alone.

256
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Hyun Joon.

257
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,460
Shin Young Ok seems to be pregnant with your child.

258
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,620
When is Joon Young's birthday?

259
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,740
It's September 1, 1989.

260
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
My dream...

261
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,260
is to become a prosecutor.

262
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,020
I also aim to...

263
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,780
go to the same university you did.

264
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,660
You must do pretty well in school.

265
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Well...

266
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,380
Your parents must be proud.

267
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,580
You have a dream,

268
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,900
and you're determined to make it real.

269
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,740
I have children, too.

270
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
But honestly, kids are terrible these days.

271
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,549
They have no dream...

272
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,740
or belief.

273
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,900
They even have less determination.

274
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,260
I envy your parents.

275
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Why...

276
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,860
are you here?

277
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,180
Our department is organising a Hallyu event.

278
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,439
I want to ask Joon Young to sing a few songs.

279
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,660
In person?

280
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,060
I heard that celebrities can be very conceited.

281
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,380
My aides said that...

282
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,140
a star like Joon Young would require my presence.

283
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,900
Were you crying?

284
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,149
Why would I cry?

285
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,540
The cold wind aggravates my dry eye syndrome.

286
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,899
You know my condition.

287
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,300
How much do you know?

288
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,019
What are you talking about?

289
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,780
Your relationship with Joon Young.

290
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,260
How much do you know about it?

291
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,380
I don't know...

292
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,380
what you're talking about.

293
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,540
I was mistaken, then.

294
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,620
I'll come back later.

295
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,300
Go and meet Joon Young.

296
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
How much...

297
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,300
do you know?

298
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,780
My relationship with Joon Young.

299
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,860
How much do you know about it?

300
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
I know...

301
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,620
as much as you do.

302
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,460
Were you expecting me?

303
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,899
- What?
- You weren't surprised.

304
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Oh, dear.

305
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,860
You caught me.

306
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,980
When do you die?

307
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,620
Didn't the doctor tell you...

308
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,100
how long you have left to live?

309
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
Why?

310
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,079
Do you want me gone soon?

311
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,540
If you're dying, yes.

312
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,540
My doctor told me that...

313
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,100
a person's lifespan depends on the person's willpower.

314
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,540
He said no one can interfere with that.

315
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,180
Sorry. I won't die any time soon.

316
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,060
There's a lot I have to do...

317
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,229
and a lot I want to do.

318
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,660
Whatever the doctor says,

319
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,060
I will hang onto my life the best I can.

320
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,860
That's what my willpower says.

321
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,999
I could even outlive you.

322
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,300
Leave the revenge to me.

323
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,780
Whether it's yours...

324
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,420
or Eul's, I'll be the one to do it.

325
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,060
So just die in peace.

326
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,780
Don't use Jeong Eun to make things messier.

327
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,580
Die in peace...

328
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,140
as the pitiful...

329
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,780
but beautiful star, Shin Joon Young.

330
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,420
Be remembered that way.

331
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,100
You must be kidding me.

332
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,119
Look here, Mr Choi.

333
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,740
Your father considered Jeong Eun his daughter-in-law.

334
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,659
I don't know what you're planning,

335
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,180
but stop being a jerk.

336
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,300
Die quietly.

337
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,500
This is my last warning.

338
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,020
Why do you keep saying that? I won't die!

339
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,140
I'm not even 30.

Producer Noh's at your mother's restaurant.

343
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,300
It's really good.

344
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,500
It's all yours. Slow down.

345
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Thank you.

346
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,300
Is Joon Young...

347
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,780
that mean to you?

348
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,420
How did you know?

349
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,679
She's just like you.

350
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,559
When you're upset and want to cry,

351
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,799
you make a bucketful of bibimbab and stuff your face.

352
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,239
Get back to work.

353
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,260
Okay.

354
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,740
Why is Joon Young such a jerk?

355
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,740
He's the worst kind of person I ever met.

356
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,669
He's so selfish and rude.

357
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,959
He only cares for himself.

358
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,759
He's timid and holds a grudge.

359
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,420
He doesn't even consider others this much.

360
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
Are you...

361
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,900
badmouthing my son?

362
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,129
Yes. And I haven't even started yet.

363
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,140
If...

364
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,879
If he treats you that badly, find someone else.

365
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,519
I'd love to do that, but there is no one else.

366
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,269
Why isn't there anyone else?

367
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,679
Half the population is male.

368
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,700
He's male.

369
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,660
Don't. He's mine.

370
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,519
Man Ok.

371
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,820
You've lost your mind.

372
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,609
Why is he yours?

373
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,659
I didn't give you my permission.

374
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,180
He's male, too.

375
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,479
Sir, would you like to date me?

376
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,740
- What?
- What?

377
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,999
Young Deuk, call the psychiatrist.

378
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,900
Tell him that we'll send someone over.

379
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,500
Come and see me when you're done eating.

380
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,799
I almost forgot about it.

381
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,300
Didn't you say you'd break up with Joon Young?

382
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,660
You said you knew your place.

383
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,300
You could just forget about him.

384
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,140
Why cling to him when he'll only hurt you?

385
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,780
Don't see him.

386
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,900
What's that look for?

387
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,300
Could you give me a hug?

388
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,060
- What?
- Or shall I hug you?

389
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,940
Stop it.

390
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,140
What are you doing? People are watching.

391
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,140
Stay like this a while.

392
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
But...

393
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,780
Can you tell me to be strong?

394
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,829
Tell me not to cry...

395
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,500
however hard it gets.

396
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,260
Whatever happens,

397
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,060
you shouldn't...

398
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,140
cry too much, either.

399
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,180
Don't get run down.

400
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,420
Stay strong.

401
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,620
Don't worry about me.

402
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,759
Will you get off me?

403
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,910
People are staring at us.

404
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,119
End it with him.

405
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,780
Shall I do it for you if you can't?

406
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,910
Like before?

407
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,430
You should've cleared things up before coming to me.

408
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,269
Lose the engagement ring when we next kiss.

409
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,430
I'm not kind or strong enough to welcome a woman...

410
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,580
wearing another man's...

411
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,910
engagement ring.

412
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,500
(SHIN JOON YOUNG'S DOCUMENTARY IS A HUGE HIT.)

413
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,910
(HE SENDS A MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR THOSE FACING DEATH.)

414
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
Joon Young.

415
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,340
Joon Young.

416
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,649
Joon Young.

417
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,749
- Yes.
- What are you...

418
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,300
so deep in thought about?

419
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,749
What was the question?

420
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,909
You're working on the first item on your bucket list.

421
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,300
Could you give us a hint as to what it is?

422
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Well...

423
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,300
the first item on my bucket list...

424
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,430
is to bring the girlfriend I'm courting...

425
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,460
right into this shot...

426
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,780
and be proud about it.

427
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,599
Do you mean Kim Yoo Na?

428
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,180
- No.
- Cut! Just a moment.

429
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,079
Yoo Na is your girlfriend.

430
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,669
You went public about the relationship.

431
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,100
I guess the cold weather messed with your memory.

432
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,060
That was your lie.

433
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,599
We can't lie on documentaries, right?

434
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,100
Yes, I guess.

435
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
What is he talking about?

436
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,910
Well...

437
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,870
Is the camera off?

438
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
It is now.

439
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,499
What happened was...

440
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,909
Will you stop conning people?

441
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,740
I didn't say anything yet.

442
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,599
We had our reasons.

443
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,959
I'll tell you everything over dinner later.

444
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,820
Who is this girlfriend you're courting?

445
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,870
- Is it Eul?
- Hey!

446
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
No.

447
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,409
Is it Director Yoon Jeong Eun?

448
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,959
What are you talking about?

449
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,889
She's right. What nonsense is that?

450
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,910
You're right.

451
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,620
It's Director Yoon.

452
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,740
Hello, everyone.

453
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,159
What are you doing here?

454
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,469
I'm here to work.

455
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,049
I'll be your assistant.

456
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,909
I'll wind wires, log data, edit,

457
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,879
drive and be your sandbag.

458
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,700
Forget about it. I don't need help.

459
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,060
That's a joke if ever I heard one.

460
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,949
He told you to leave.

461
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,820
You got fired!

462
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,140
I'm invested in this documentary, too.

463
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,780
If you won't let me help, I won't give you my tapes.

464
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Eul.

465
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,580
What got into you?

466
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,500
Man Ok, call the police.

467
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,540
Report her for fraud, blackmail and robbery.

468
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,100
Let's call it a day.

469
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,580
But we just got started.

470
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,020
Please leave the house immediately.

471
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,620
All of you.

472
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,020
You heard him. He wants you all gone.

473
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,460
You're the reason he wants us gone.

474
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,359
You ruined everything!

475
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,140
Will you just stop it?

476
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,460
- Are you okay?
- What do you mean?

477
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,500
Getting hit by the flying bun?

478
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,180
- That didn't hurt.
- Not that, you silly.

479
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,020
I can't do this any more.

480
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,020
Sir, I'd rather live off rocks...

481
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,390
then be the manager of a jerk like Joon Young.

482
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,479
I'll text you my resignation.

483
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,620
Gook Young!

484
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,540
Have you lost your mind?

485
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,439
My blood pressure's going back up.

486
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,639
- Sir, are you all right?
- My gosh.

487
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,660
Oh, dear.

488
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,660
I was going to call 911,

489
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,140
but I didn't want rumours to spread.

491
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,580
Let's get help.

492
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,180
I'll call Doctor Kang right now.

493
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,430
Joon Young.

494
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,300
I said leave.

495
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,620
I told you to leave!

496
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,239
Everyone's gone.

497
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,279
Producer Yoon and President Nam Goong left.

498
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,300
You should go, too.

499
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,740
Get admitted.

500
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,460
Doctor Kang said you need to get treated.

501
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,390
Go home.

502
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,620
Why won't you listen?

503
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,620
You need help.

504
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,500
Why are you so stubborn?

505
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,910
Are you afraid people will find out?

506
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,780
Is that what's important?

507
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,740
You...

508
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,390
are dying.

509
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,980
Let's go to hospital.

510
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,100
Forget the documentary. Get admitted.

511
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,300
Let's try everything we can.

512
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
Joon Young.

513
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,660
Joon Young.

514
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,020
I'll tell everyone.

515
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,619
If you keep doing this,

516
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,500
I'll tell everyone.

517
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,939
Can I do that? Your mother will find out.

518
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,060
Do whatever you want.

519
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,020
Joon Young.

520
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,780
Joon Young.

521
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,140
You're home late.

522
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,820
The same goes for you.

523
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,500
Promise me that...

524
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,780
you will never leave Mum...

525
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,100
whatever happens.

526
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,500
Dad.

527
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,380
Yes, I promise.

528
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,559
Thank you.

529
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,700
What about you?

530
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,540
Can you promise that...

531
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,500
you will never leave your mother, whatever happens?

532
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,420
No.

533
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,780
That's why I asked.

534
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,740
You, at least,

535
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,140
should stay with her.

536
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,380
Jeong Eun.

537
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,780
It's been so long.

538
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,500
It has been, Ha Ru.

539
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,260
Jeong Eun, can you taste this for me?

540
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,420
Sure.

541
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,580
Me first. I'll borrow her for just five minutes.

542
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,100
We need to talk about something.

543
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,020
What about?

544
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,980
When a man falls in love with someone,

545
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,260
isn't it normal for him to want to hold hands and kiss?

546
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,979
I guess.

547
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,100
I knew it.

548
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,380
Who made the first move between you and Ji Tae?

549
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,700
Who kissed who and when and were was it?

550
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,500
I'm all grown up. I'm an adult.

551
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,879
I know about these things.

552
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,649
What are you two ladies whispering about?

553
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,729
Dad.

554
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,860
Hey, Ji Tae.

555
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,979
Mother invited me to dinner.

556
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,740
I see. I'm glad to see you.

557
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,159
Welcome home. Are you hungry?

558
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,519
You should've told me that you invited Jeong Eun.

559
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,540
Ji Tae.

560
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,639
Let's wash our hands.

561
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,360
I'd have come without an invitation anyway.

562
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,379
I need to tell your family something.

563
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,420
Like what?

564
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,300
Let's sit at the table.

565
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,020
Jeong Eun, taste the salad for me.

566
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,860
Fine.

567
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,140
Let's stop...

568
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,700
playing house.

569
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,580
Jeong Eun.

570
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,180
What's going on?

571
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,140
I already told Madam Lee and Ji Tae.

572
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,180
I'm seeing someone else, Sir.

573
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,469
What?

574
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,279
You helped me out once.

575
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,020
I believe my father made it up to you long ago.

576
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,300
I hope you don't use that incident...

577
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,580
to hold me back.

578
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Jeong Eun.

579
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,140
Can we talk about this?

580
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,620
I should go.

581
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,500
I left the bag you gave me in your room.

582
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,759
I'm capable of buying any bag I want.

583
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,740
What's wrong with you, Jeong Eun?

584
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,740
Who is it?

585
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Who's the man you're seeing?

587
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,300
Pororo, where are you?

588
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,620
- Na Ri.
- Yes?

589
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,900
Can you give me your hand?

590
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540
My hand?

591
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,860
What for?

592
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,660
Forget it.

593
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,860
Hey.

594
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,620
What did you just do?

595
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,940
Kids go slightly mad in their last year of high school.

596
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,860
Have you lost it?

597
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,780
Who are you? Who am I?

598
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,180
Would you like to...

599
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,249
kiss me?

600
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,260
What?

601
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,820
This isn't a slight madness.

602
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,780
You've completely lost it.

603
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,919
I didn't feel anything when I just kissed you.

604
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,879
But why does my heart almost explode...

605
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,049
when I hold Ha Ru's hand...

606
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,420
and feel static electricity when we touch?

607
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,900
That crazy jerk. That punk.

608
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,380
Pororo.

609
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,900
Pororo.

610
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,249
Gook Young.

611
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,380
What do you want?

612
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
I'm no longer your manager.

613
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:54,909
Did you take Pororo?

614
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,500
I can't seem to find him.

615
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,580
Are you kidding me?

616
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,460
If you need an excuse to call, make it sound plausible.

617
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,029
What do you mean?

618
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,069
You sent Pororo away a while ago...

619
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,860
so he could live where the air's fresh.

620
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,540
When?

621
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,060
Why would I send Pororo...

622
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,980
Po...

623
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,060
I remember now.

624
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,980
I sent him away.

625
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,180
You're a piece of work.

626
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,540
I'm sick of talking to you. Bye.

627
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,380
Joon Young! Open up!

628
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,380
Did you change the password?

629
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,420
I have something to say. Let me in.

630
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,180
I have something to say.

631
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,020
Open the gate.

632
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,660
You're pushing me away...

633
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,180
on purpose, aren't you?

634
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,100
You're afraid I'll get hurt when you're gone, right?

635
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,780
Did you think that would help me?

636
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,060
You're wrong.

637
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,180
We were never madly in love with each other.

638
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,260
I never understood you...

639
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,899
and you never understood me.

640
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,740
We always missed each other's cues.

641
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,420
It was all a lie.

642
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,679
Not wanting to see you as a love interest...

643
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,260
It was a lie.

644
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,420
I like you.

645
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,300
I love you.

646
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,119
That's why I can't stand wasting another minute,

647
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,580
another second not being with you.

648
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,340
That's why from now on,

649
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,639
I'll do nothing else but look at you.

650
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,199
I'll stay at your side...

651
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,140
and stare at your face until I bear a hole in it.

652
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,660
Will you give me a chance?

653
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,780
Open the door.

654
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,660
I miss you, Joon Young.

655
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,380
Joon Young.

658
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,580
Hey, Gook Young.

659
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,300
I called because I forgot to say something.

660
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,140
You may be...

661
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,620
a huge star...

662
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,420
and a household name.

663
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,199
But don't flirt with any woman who comes your way...

664
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,389
and break the heart of a poor girl.

665
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,060
If you do that,

666
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,900
you'll pay for it.

667
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,359
You'll suffer after you die.

668
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,949
- What statute expires in 13 days?
- What?

669
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:22,980
I'd set an alarm saying a statute expires in 13 days.

670
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,180
Why are you asking me that?

671
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,100
How would I know?

672
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,180
I left my engagement ring behind.

673
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,860
Can I come in now?
