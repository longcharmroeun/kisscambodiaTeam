2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Can you kill her?

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
What?

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,430
She says she wants to die.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,860
Do what you can to kill her.

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,100
Excuse me.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,260
Here's your friend's coat. Her phone's ringing.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,160
Thank you.

9
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,870
(SPAM)

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
No.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,300
Your client isn't well.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,400
Would you be happy if a telemarketer called at...

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,100
this time of night?

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,500
(EMERGENCY ROOM)

15
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,760
It's been five hours since Joon Young left.

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Aren't you worried?

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,160
No, not at all.

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,330
He went to see his father.

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,660
Wouldn't it be strange to worry?

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,700
What if he were to collapse...

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,660
or something were to happen to him?

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,730
I hope something like that never happens,

23
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,060
but if he were to collapse, someone would help him...

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700
and call for help.

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,860
He's Shin Joon Young, and the whole of Korea...

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,400
loves and cares for him.

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,130
I'm...

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,130
really good at waiting.

29
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,600
Whether it's 100 times or 1,000 times,

30
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,900
I know I can wait.

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,300
What I fear the most is the fact that...

32
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,300
I might not have to wait one day.

33
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,930
I might wake up one morning,

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,130
and Joon Young...

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,730
might no longer be part of this world.

36
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,130
It's acute enteritis.

37
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,500
The doctor's too busy today,

38
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,900
so he said he'll kill you next time.

39
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,660
Are you Noh Eul's guardian?

40
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,060
She doesn't have to be hospitalised,

41
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
so you can check out.

42
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,200
Get on.

43
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,160
Let me live!

44
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,660
I don't want to die, so let me live!

45
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Who will care for...

46
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,630
my mum after I die?

47
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,800
For my whole life,

48
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,930
I was never a decent son!

49
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,600
All I did was break her heart!

50
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,000
There's...

51
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,260
There's so much I want to do for her.

52
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,260
I can't die like this.

53
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,800
I want to live.

54
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,460
I don't want to die. I want to live.

55
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,030
The people I love...

56
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,430
are all here.

57
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,600
We're only just...

58
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,630
about to be happy. Why do I have to die now?

59
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,660
I don't want to die.

60
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,430
I want to live.

61
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,630
Let me live.

62
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I... I'm scared.

63
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm scared.

64
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,960
I'm so sorry.

66
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,630
Early this morning, a video surfaced on the internet,

67
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,200
and it turned Korea upside-down.

68
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,060
It mentions how a politician and a prosecutor...

69
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
covered up a hit-and-run that resulted in death.

70
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,260
You hit a man crossing a road pulling a cart.

71
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,300
Then you fled.

72
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,660
I don't know what evidence you have,

73
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,370
but you can't get me.

74
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,160
Do you think what happened then won't happen again?

75
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,400
The story is shocking, but what caught our attention...

76
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,060
were those who appeared and were mentioned in the clip.

77
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,160
Daehan Jeil Party's Yoon Seong Ho and his daughter,

78
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,100
Shin Joon Young and Congressman Choi Hyun Joon...

79
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,300
were identified.

80
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,060
Viewers are signing a petition to reopen the case,

81
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,560
and it's said 57,000 people have signed it so far.

82
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,960
Congressman Choi stated that...

83
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,500
he will come in voluntarily to explain the matter.

84
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,300
Excuse me. Mr Choi has just arrived at the police station.

85
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,700
We'll go right to the scene.

86
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,830
Reporter Jeon?

87
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,870
Mr Choi.

88
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,760
Are you the senior prosecutor mentioned in the video?

89
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
Is it all true?

90
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,030
Is Shin Joon Young your illegitimate son?

91
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,500
Any comments, Sir?

92
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,160
I apologise for causing trouble.

93
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,370
I will answer all questions sincerely.

94
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,500
(CHOI HYUN JOON IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED.)

95
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,030
Mr Choi...

96
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,460
went straight in to be questioned by the police.

97
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,830
If he admits the charges,

98
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
he will lose his seat as a congressman...

99
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,300
and be sentenced for his past crimes.

100
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,630
My gosh. Is Joon Young really Choi Hyun Joon's son?

101
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,400
Then was Ms Shin's his mistress?

102
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,960
Where's Young Ok?

103
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,400
Choi Hyun Joon's aide gave an interview.

104
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,160
He said...

105
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,700
Mr Choi himself told him to upload the video.

106
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,370
The man you never forgot or got over...

107
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,870
had a shred of decency after all.

108
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,900
I was asked to cover up for the hit-and-run,

109
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,960
so I threatened the prosecutor handling the case.

110
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,300
I told him to fabricate the evidence and witness...

111
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,600
to cover up the case.

112
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,000
But...

113
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,260
he refused, so I demoted him to a regional office.

114
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,630
In return for...

115
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,260
covering up the case,

116
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
Congressman Yoon...

117
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,860
nominated me as the candidate for the by-election.

118
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,400
My plane leaves in an hour. Clear it up for me, Dad.

119
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,230
I only did as you said!

120
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,230
You said you'd deal with it.

121
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I went to America because you told me to,

122
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,760
and laid low because you told me to.

123
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,760
You told me to forget all about it, so I did.

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,230
What did I do wrong?

125
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,400
Ms Yoon Jeong Eun?

126
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,560
We're with the police.

127
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,060
Stop crying, Jik.

128
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Eul.

129
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,560
Do you think Dad can rest in peace now?

130
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,600
He won't feel wronged any more, will he?

131
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
Why did you do it?

132
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,860
Do what?

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,260
Why did you give the video to Choi Hyun Joon?

134
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,100
I didn't give it to him.

135
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,760
I guess he stole it.

136
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,460
You weren't going to air it, were you?

137
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,430
I was going to.

138
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,600
- I was going to give the video to...
- Eul.

139
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,630
Fine. I gave it to him.

140
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,460
I don't need it any more.

141
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,160
We found out who killed my dad. That's enough.

142
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,630
If you let it go like that,

143
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,060
those people will get away with it...

144
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,660
and think it's okay.

145
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,230
They'll think nothing of the death of others.

146
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,030
He didn't, though.

147
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,400
He could have pretended like it never happened,

148
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,060
but he came clean...

149
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,260
and is paying the price for it.

150
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
This is the world I want to believe in.

151
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,760
This is the world I believe in.

152
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Home delivery.

153
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,560
Hello.

154
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,860
You can put it here.

155
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,230
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

156
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,630
Thank you.

157
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,160
What's that?

158
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,660
Pororo's house.

159
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,100
Let's bring him over.

160
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,560
I want to get to know him.

161
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,760
You're allergic to dogs.

162
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Not so much now. I've been taking antihistamines.

163
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,500
If I feel sick, I'll take some more.

164
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll look after Pororo.

165
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,700
Don't you trust me more than Mr Jang?

166
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,060
(PORORO)

167
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,860
(PORORO'S HOME)

168
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Hey.

169
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,200
Hey. How could you?

170
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,700
- What?
- Hey.

171
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,560
That night, Eul woke me up...

172
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
and told me about how she planned...

173
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,460
to live without me.

174
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,500
Justice and honesty,

175
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,060
convictions, morals...

176
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,900
or conscience were still too serious...

177
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,460
for someone like her.

178
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,300
She only talked about common sense.

179
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,660
She said that's how she would live.

180
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,500
She wanted to live...

181
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,400
decently enough so she wouldn't...

182
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,100
embarrass her brother, father or me.

183
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,400
When Eul fell asleep around daybreak,

184
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,860
Choi Hyun Joon...

185
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,000
I mean, my father sent me a text.

186
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,000
He said...

187
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,600
he would take pride...

188
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,360
and joy in the fact that...

189
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,400
he was my father until the day he died.

190
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,670
Forget it. Take it away.

191
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,760
He doesn't deserve a sip of water.

192
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
Do you think I paid you a fortune...

193
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,000
to get this kind of a result?

194
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,460
Your husband was the one...

195
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,260
who denied to have me present.

196
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,630
What does that mean?

197
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,170
I told him he doesn't need to represent me any more.

198
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,030
He did nothing wrong.

199
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
It was my idea.

200
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,260
You can leave.

201
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,800
Goodbye.

202
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,760
From now on,

203
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
I will continue without a lawyer.

204
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,200
I will not appeal.

205
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
- Why not?
- There's no reason.

206
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,400
- I want to.
- Honey.

207
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Ji Tae's right.

208
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,100
You and I both...

209
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
have become monsters.

210
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,260
We're out of control.

211
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,430
Let's stop.

212
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Please.

213
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,460
Let's not go any further.

214
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,170
I made you into what you are now.

215
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,900
You were crawling in the gutter,

216
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,960
but I transformed you.

217
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,460
Honey.

218
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,460
Why? Do you want to go back to where you came from?

219
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,830
Mother.

220
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,170
You were poor and powerless.

221
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,900
That's why your mother died.

222
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,700
She needed a heart,

223
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,430
but you couldn't even do anything when...

224
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,230
stronger and richer people than you cut in line.

225
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,300
Do you want to go back to those days?

226
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,460
- Eun Soo.
- What did you say to me then?

227
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,400
You said you wanted power...

228
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,500
so you wouldn't have to lose anything to anyone.

229
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Do you think you can...

230
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,960
gain power by sitting and doing nothing?

231
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,830
Do you think you'll get lucky if you...

232
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,830
live by your conscience?

233
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,800
To get what you want,

234
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,400
you must endure the pain and sacrifice...

235
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
and pay the price in full.

236
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,260
To protect you, I even...

237
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,000
hit my own son with a car.

239
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,760
Get out of this house.

240
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,800
Go back to the gutter.

241
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,430
That's where you came from.

242
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,760
You don't have to...

243
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
keep your promise.

244
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,460
You said you wouldn't leave her.

245
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,170
But you don't have to keep that promise.

246
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,700
I will suffer with her for the rest of my life.

247
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,430
- You can...
- She is also my wife.

248
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,600
She's also the mother of my children.

249
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Ji Tae.

250
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
I will...

251
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,360
stay by your mother.

252
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Even if that's...

253
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,760
worse than living in a sewer.

254
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,460
Does he not have to work today?

255
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,000
Where is he?

256
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,560
There's a pimple on your forehead.

257
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,360
Did you have a rough few days?

258
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,200
You have one on your cheek.

259
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,100
Did you have a hard time?

260
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Well?

261
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Did you hate that kiss?

262
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
No.

263
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
It made my heart pound.

264
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,600
You lied about liking boys, didn't you?

265
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,630
You lied to get rid of me because of my father, right?

266
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,300
Give me your number.

267
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,200
My friends all remember their ex-boyfriend's numbers,

268
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,300
but I'm stupid.

269
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,560
Didn't we break up?

270
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,460
We did.

271
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,500
I won't see you again.

272
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,560
I won't call...

273
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,500
or text you.

274
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,430
- Then what's it for?
- Later on,

275
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,100
if I never find a man as good as you,

276
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,700
I'll call you then.

277
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,830
(NOH JIK)

278
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
Okay. Call me then.

279
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,300
I'll take your call.

280
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,830
Take care, Jik.

281
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,230
You, too.

282
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
So...

283
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
I'm angry.

284
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,100
I bought the blender...

285
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,030
a long, long time ago, okay?

286
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,800
Okay? Good.

287
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,430
But... No.

288
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,100
But you didn't give it to me yet.

289
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,860
You didn't give it to me, okay?

290
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,400
What is she saying?

291
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you even speaking English?

292
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,360
Excuse me.

293
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,460
Could you check on the status of her order?

294
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,100
It seems like the item she ordered online...

295
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,260
hasn't arrived yet.

296
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,300
Yes. Thank you.

297
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,230
Something went wrong with the delivery,

298
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,830
so the item was returned.

299
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,100
They resent it two days ago...

300
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,230
and sent you an email. Didn't you get it?

301
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,400
Oh, they emailed me.

302
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,360
I don't open the English ones in case they're spam.

303
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,430
You were awesome.

304
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,860
Where's Joon Young?

305
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,160
He's...

306
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Is he not in?

307
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,100
He is, but...

308
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,230
What is it?

309
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
- Is something wrong?
- Hey.

310
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm going to go for a walk.

311
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,100
Did he just...

312
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,200
not recognise me?

313
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,760
It started a week ago.

314
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,030
One day he calls me Eul,

315
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,200
the next day he asks who I am.

316
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,030
Now, he even forgot what his name is.

317
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,960
He got so confused and upset,

318
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,100
so I told him that I'm a live in helper for now.

319
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,200
Are you following me?

320
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Yes.

321
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,360
Do you know me?

322
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
Yes. Very well.

323
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,830
What was I like?

324
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,230
You said you know me very well.

325
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,700
- I do.
- What was I like?

326
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,800
You're a jerk who thinks you're better than anyone.

327
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,960
You say hurtful things.

328
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,860
- Excuse me.
- You hurt people.

329
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,030
You believe you are right...

330
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,960
and always want to look cool.

331
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,300
- Stop it.
- You're rude and say horrible things,

332
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,300
but you're actually always right.

333
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,000
You don't have to, but you do crazy things...

334
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,560
and make cowards like me...

335
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,300
feel small and ashamed.

336
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
You crush us.

337
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,060
Is that a compliment?

338
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
It is.

339
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,960
Were we friends?

340
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,700
We must've been close.

341
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,830
We weren't.

342
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,060
I really hated you a lot.

343
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,300
I even wished that you'd disappear.

344
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,800
So...

345
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,100
next time,

346
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,160
let's meet again.

347
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,460
I'll be good to you then.

348
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,160
I'll be a real big brother.

349
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,630
I'll care for you...

350
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
and love you.

351
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,030
Forget it.

352
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,360
You're weird.

353
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,160
- What's this?
- I found it.

354
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,630
Keep it.

355
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm not a beggar.

356
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,060
Don't give me everything you find.

357
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,100
Fine. I bought it.

358
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,600
Keep it.

359
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,600
Why give me a ring?

360
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,700
- Give it to your girlfriend.
- You're my girlfriend.

361
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,030
Yes.

362
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,560
I like you. Is that enough?

363
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,360
- You're crazy.
- I'm not.

364
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,200
I've never been more sane.

365
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,630
I'm in no mood to put up with your jokes.

366
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,900
Get out before I pour garbage on you.

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,100
How can you do this to the mum of a dying boy?

372
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,500
When you go to see him,

373
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,500
make sure you wear that ring.

374
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,260
Wear it...

375
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,400
and show it to him.

376
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,460
Brag about it.

377
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,430
I should show him what?

378
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
You fool.

379
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,060
How could you?

380
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,800
How could you do this?

381
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,960
Joon Young...

382
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,500
asked me to look after you.

383
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,630
Show him that ring and say...

384
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,700
you'll be fine...

385
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,360
without him.

386
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,660
Tell him that I said...

387
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,860
I'll make you happy.

388
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,700
Put his mind at ease.

389
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,060
I know you avoid him...

390
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
and can't bear to see him...

391
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,960
because you feel guilty and sorry.

392
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,160
But you're...

393
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,830
his mother.

394
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,700
You're his mum.

395
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,860
Why should you...

396
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,600
feel guilty?

397
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,100
Go and see him...

398
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,400
before it's too late.

399
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll be released soon.

400
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,630
You will never get your way.

401
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,360
Sorry about that.

402
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,100
I will get my revenge.

403
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,460
How dare you challenge me.

404
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,030
I will crush you.

405
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,100
My father said he'd go after you all.

406
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,500
Especially your father.

407
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,700
If my father gets to it,

408
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,100
your father will never get back on his feet again.

409
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,900
Why are you so quiet?

410
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,560
Why won't you try to lecture me like always?

411
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,700
If I tell you that I fell for you once,

412
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,960
would you believe it?

413
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,430
If this woman became my girlfriend,

414
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,000
life would be so fun and happy.

415
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,600
If I were to say I once thought so,

416
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,760
would you believe it?

417
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,500
You will teach me?

418
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,430
I'm really good at English.

419
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,160
I don't need a tutor to teach me English.

420
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,830
- I need...
- A moving yet unique essay...

421
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,600
that will get you into an Ivy League university.

422
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,760
Tips that will make the interviewers gasp...

423
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
and say they must pick you at all costs.

424
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,400
Is that what you need?

425
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,100
I didn't bribe my way to get here.

426
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,460
I passed your mother's rigorous interview.

427
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,500
People think I'm too pretty to be smart.

428
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,460
But my grades are outstanding.

429
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,700
I play two instruments at the professional level,

430
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,400
and I'm good at sports.

431
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,030
Essays and speeches are my specialty...

432
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,230
What are you doing?

433
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,360
I'm trying to impress you.

434
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
I'll introduce myself again.

435
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,260
I'm pretty and have an impressive background,

436
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,800
and I liked you for eight years.

437
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,630
That proves I'm persistent, patient and loyal.

438
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,800
I'm Yoon Jeong Eun.

439
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
You're right.

440
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,460
You may have the power to get out.

441
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,360
But I'd rather you stay and do time.

442
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,230
I'll wait for you.

443
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,700
What do you mean?

444
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,300
Let's talk again then.

445
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,660
What do you mean?

446
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,200
Let's see if you'll really never get back on your feet,

447
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,360
or if...

448
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,300
you'll have at least a bit of hope to become better.

449
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,300
If there's hope,

450
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,760
I'll be there for you.

451
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,570
I'll visit again.

452
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,100
Don't.

453
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,700
Don't come back.

454
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,230
Not until you die.

455
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,260
I don't want to see you again.

456
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,360
I'll kill you!

457
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,600
Who are you?

458
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,430
Why are you here?

459
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,860
Are you here to sell something?

460
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,570
Where is Eul?

461
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,570
Is she out?

462
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,900
She went to get groceries.

463
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
Are you here to see her?

464
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
You can wait inside.

465
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,570
You can wait here.

466
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,360
When...

467
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,660
will Eul be back?

468
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,100
I don't know.

469
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,900
She ruined the yukgaejang she was making,

470
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,300
so she went to get the ingredients for curry.

471
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,070
Could you taste it for me?

472
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Sure.

473
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,360
Is it good?

474
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,360
It's awesome.

475
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,860
It's really good.

476
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
It tastes exactly like my mum's yukgaejang.

477
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,700
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

478
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,430
Did you find a hair or something?

479
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,600
I'll get you a new bowl.

481
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,360
Mum.

482
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,900
Sorry for not recognising you.

483
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,660
You look lovely today, Ms Shin.

484
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,700
I had my hair done before coming here.

485
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,000
Gook Young even bought me a new outfit. es for her.

486
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,400
Man Ok bought me these earrings.

487
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,460
This ring...

488
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,360
is from Jeong Sik.

489
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,600
He proposed to me.

490
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Really?

491
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,660
Congratulations.

492
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,360
Gook Young and Man Ok...

493
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Now, I have two very sweet stepchildren.

494
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,860
I'm too blessed.

495
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,400
I was a horrible son.

496
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,860
I feel terrible now.

497
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
No.

498
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,500
You were a great son.

499
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,460
I was not.

500
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,100
Children do all the good...

501
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,600
they need to do before they turn three years old.

502
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,430
You always...

503
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,760
slept well and ate well.

504
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,400
You even pooped well.

505
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,900
You didn't cry...

506
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,830
or get sick.

507
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,300
Whenever you looked at me,

508
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,460
you smiled for some reason.

509
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,960
You just made me sound like I'm a great guy.

510
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,830
Okay.

511
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,300
Let's say I was a good son, then.

512
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,460
Mum.

513
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,300
I don't want you to think that...

514
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,830
I didn't do by best.

515
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,600
Okay.

516
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,600
I lived hard.

517
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,800
Even if I got another chance, I couldn't do it better.

518
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,360
But I still feel sorry towards you.

519
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:22,600
I'm sorry, Mum.

520
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,570
I'm really sorry.

521
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,260
My door will always be open.

522
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,360
Come visit whenever you miss me.

523
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,600
When the flowers bloom,

524
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,630
I'll think that you're there.

525
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,800
When the wind blows,

526
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,700
I'll think that you're there.

527
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,400
Even when it rains,

528
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,430
I'll think you came by.

529
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,860
When it snows,

530
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,030
I'll also think that you came by.

531
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,960
Thank you, Joon Young.

532
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,030
Thank you for being my son.

533
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Me, too.

534
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,660
It was...

535
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,660
a great honour...

536
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,860
to have you as my mum.

537
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,760
The tax investigation and audit revealed that...

538
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,830
KJ Group has many issues.

539
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,200
As a member of upper management

540
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,300
And family of the owner, I feel responsible.

541
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,830
Chairwoman Lee Eun Soo and I...

542
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,300
will resign effective immediately.

543
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,360
KJ Group will be managed by a professional.

544
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,430
Chairwoman Lee and I...

545
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,300
will serve only as majority shareholders and owners.

546
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,160
Charitable donations...

547
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,560
I have bad news.

548
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,230
They issued a warrant for your arrest.

549
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,630
- Have you eaten?
- Sir.

550
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,300
I haven't had lunch yet.

551
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,660
Find a restaurant nearby.

552
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,830
I'd like yukgaejang.

553
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,300
Do you think you're pretty?

554
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,660
My brother misses me, so he asked for my picture.

555
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,500
Did you see your mother off?

556
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,230
Yes.

557
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,560
What are you looking at?

558
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,600
There are none of us together.

559
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,400
Why didn't you ask me...

560
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,100
for a photo?

561
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,100
Will you pose for one if I ask?

562
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,060
I look amazing today.

563
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,230
I shine so bright I can barely look.

564
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,030
You're the only one who disagrees.

565
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,630
Why do I look so good?

566
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,360
It's a pity it's wasted on you.

567
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,560
You can't take it without a warning.

568
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,800
You look really tired.

569
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
I am.

570
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,430
I feel really tired today.

571
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,200
Get some sleep.

572
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,900
Will you wake me up?

573
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,700
I won't. Sleep.

574
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,460
You'll wake me and ask me to play with you.

575
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,560
I won't. Sleep well.

576
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,360
Are you asleep?

577
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,800
Yes.

578
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
How did you answer, then?

579
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,360
Are you asleep?

580
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,960
Not yet.

581
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,300
Am I not pretty at all?

582
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,260
You're pretty.

583
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,960
You're so pretty that I can't dare look at you.

585
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,300
Are you asleep?

586
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,660
Are you really asleep?

587
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Okay.

588
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,430
I won't talk.

589
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,260
I won't ask you to play with me.

590
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,060
Yes.

591
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,200
You had a really long day today.

592
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,260
I won't wake you again.

593
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,630
Forget about your mum.

594
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,160
Forget about your dad.

595
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,660
Forget about me.

596
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,660
Don't think about anything.

597
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,360
Just sleep.

598
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,300
Thank you, Joon Young.

599
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,600
See you tomorrow.

600
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,760
Why aren't you taking out the boxes?

601
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,860
Can you at least pretend to help?

602
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,700
Come and look at this.

603
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,500
The tree's growing new leaves.

604
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,830
What do you mean?

605
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,200
Joon Young said it was dead and wanted to dig it up.

606
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,500
But look at it now.

607
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,660
- It's growing new leaves.
- You're right.

608
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,300
This is incredible.

609
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,700
- Hello?
- Gook Young.

610
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:24,100
Which do you prefer? Red or pink?

611
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,700
No.

612
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,630
What colour do you like?

613
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,400
I like you.

614
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,060
What? Really?

615
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,630
I know we were supposed to watch a movie today,

616
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,700
but something came up and...

617
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,160
What's wrong?

618
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,300
Can we not watch the movie then?

619
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,660
No, no, no.

620
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,500
Something came up, so after the movie,

621
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,400
I think we'll have to eat dinner together, too.

622
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,600
Gosh, you scared me.

623
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,600
- Stop it.
- Hello?

624
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,830
Hello? Gook Young?

625
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,860
Who is it? Who's the witch?

626
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,560
How dare you say that.

627
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,600
You can't call my potential girlfriend a witch.

628
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,300
Hey.

629
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,760
I found something up here.

630
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,430
I'm Shin Joon Young.

631
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,830
A few months ago,

632
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,700
my doctor told me that...

633
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,460
I don't have much long to live.

634
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,630
I was perplexed,

635
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,260
but everyone dies.

636
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
What...

637
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,900
worries me the most...

638
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,300
is that the people I love...

639
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,000
might think I was unhappy.

640
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:33,000
I was really, truly happy.

641
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,160
I had a great life,

642
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,900
and I couldn't have asked for more.

643
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,060
I think that...

644
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,700
knowing my time is limited...

645
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,260
helped me show my true feelings.

646
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,630
It gave me courage.

647
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,660
I consider it as my final blessing.

648
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,830
Yesterday...

649
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,060
marked the end of the three months the doctor gave me.

650
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,700
When...

651
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,400
you find this and watch the video,

652
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,660
am I...

653
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,400
still alive?

654
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,700
And...

655
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,500
my love,

656
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:17,900
Noh Eul.

657
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,200
How is she doing now?

658
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,960
Sir.

659
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,360
Where are my tapes?

660
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,200
I worked on that for over three months.

661
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,600
I even got death threats over it.

662
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,500
Give it back.

663
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,030
Do you think I came back for this?

664
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,500
I'm not doing this to save my skin.

665
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,630
Think about who you're dealing with.

666
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,230
Rebates are a tradition. No one cares about that.

667
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,500
I traced at least three million dollars.

668
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,830
Hundreds of doctors are taking bribes.

669
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,760
- We shouldn't cover it up.
- We shouldn't.

670
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:16,900
But...

671
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,560
this changes everything.

672
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,160
- What's all this?
- Eul.

673
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,500
Turn a blind eye, just this once.

674
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,860
It's not that hard to do.

675
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,560
The freedom of speech...

676
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,200
shouldn't give in to capitalism.

677
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,200
But then, I did spend a lot on expenses,

678
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,830
and I do need to pay off my staff.

679
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,030
You're right.

680
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,700
You should take some, too.

681
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,800
No. Don't worry about me.

682
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,060
I have...

683
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,830
this and this is all I need.

684
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,200
You got a foreign brand car. Good for you.

685
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,060
Are you getting this?

686
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,830
Getting what?

687
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,600
Do you see the camera up there? Say hi.

688
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,660
- Eul.
- Thank you.

689
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,660
Thanks to your statement,

690
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,030
I can add bribing the media to the list of charges.

691
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,230
Make sure no one steals your tapes.

692
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,030
Hey.

693
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:28,860
(WELL DONE. YOU SURVIVED THE DAY.)

694
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,500
You think so, too?

695
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,460
I did really well today, didn't I?
