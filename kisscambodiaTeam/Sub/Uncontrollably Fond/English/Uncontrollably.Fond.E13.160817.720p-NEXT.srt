00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,119
Yoon Jeong Eun, 30 years old.

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,340
The only daughter of Congressman Yoon Seong Ho.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,100

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,309
Her license plate number was Seoul 3 Ga 3126.

00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,039
Her car model was ZEF 320.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,839
The colour of her car was red.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,299
She scrapped her car right after the incident.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,700
Stop right there!

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,700
Hey!

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,630
Stop!

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,780
Know your place.

31
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,700
Why can't I get drunk today?

32
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,460
The surveillance camera at the site was broken.

33
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,139
The witnesses changed their statements...

34
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,349
as if they had promised to do so beforehand.

35
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,799
No further witness.

36
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,100
No evidence.

37
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,700
Zero chance for a retrial.

38
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,780
What did you just say?

39
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,959
I said, I'll film that movie.

(DAEHAN JEIL PARTY AND KJ GROUP BECOME IN-LAWS.)

41
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,300
Why all of a sudden?

42
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,100
I changed my mind.

43
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,259
I heard the new team manager...

44
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,940
of the investing company is really pretty.

45
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,859
But...

46
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,279
that's not why you changed your mind, right?

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,380
It is.

48
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,940
- Come on.
- Please.

49
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,159
I forgot to take my blood pressure medicine.

50
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,220
So please refrain from such jokes, Joon Young.

51
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,749
- Does it sound like I'm joking?
- Well, aren't you?

52
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,959
Ms Yoon is the future in-law of KJ Group.

53
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,639
She's not someone you can...

54
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,379
But she's not married yet.

55
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,620
Man Ok, give me my sedative.

56
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,060
This is good for your body.

57
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,620
There aren't any more sedatives.

58
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,700
Please tell me that you were joking.

59
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
No.

60
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,919
I heard Yoon Hoo started filming. We should go, too.

61
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,419
Kim Soo Chan already took that role,

62
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,209
and there are articles about that, too.

63
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,579
Exactly. I heard from his stylist...

64
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,460
that their team is headed there tonight.

65
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,260
In that case,

66
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,780
ask the production company to choose.

67
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,180
They can either choose the rookie actor Soo Chan,

68
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,060
or they can choose me, the most popular actor...

69
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,100
in Korea.

70
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,679
I'm going to go and meet the director.

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,669
You're not really doing this for Ms Yoon, right?

72
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,380
- It's a lie, right?
- I'm serious.

73
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,220
She's rich and from a good family.

74
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,939
On top of that, she's pretty.

75
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,499
Since when did you have a thing...

76
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,059
for rich girls who come from a good family?

77
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,380
Since a long time ago.

78
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,399
You just didn't notice.

79
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,940
But still, she's engaged and will get married soon.

80
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,389
Hey.

81
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,820
KJ Group means she'll be Congressman Choi's...

82
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,140
It means Ms Yoon will soon become his daughter-in-law.

83
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,799
- Stop lying.
- He's right.

84
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,780
KJ Group has only one son.

85
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,220
You didn't think that far, did you?

86
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,679
Thank goodness you just found out.

87
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,940
You would've gotten in trouble if it wasn't for me.

88
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,020
I guess you can focus on your acting, then.

89
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,180
It was a movie we shouldn't have missed, anyway.

90
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,220
Yoon Jeong Eun.

91
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,259
Choi Hyun Joon and Lee Eun Soo's...

92
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,380
future daughter-in-law.

93
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
Choi Ji Tae's fiancée.

94
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,780
What's wrong with him these days?

95
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,989
I thought he liked Producer Noh.

96
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,269
I don't know.

97
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,260
How can anyone know what he's thinking?

98
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,460
- I'm fine.
- A lot of people I know I'm here.

99
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,060
This is our subsidiary resort.

100
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,020
Many people from KJ Group are here, too.

101
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,559
Kim Soo Chan. He'll join the team tomorrow.

102
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,700
Really?

103
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,300
That's great.

104
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,479
There are only 46 days left...

105
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,949
until the statute of limitation expires.

106
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,389
I have a minimum of 30 days...

107
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,899
or a maximum of 60 days to live.

108
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,460
- Joon Young's a jerk.
- Is someone badmouthing me?

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,580
Why are you here?

110
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,420
To shoot a movie. With you.

111
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,809
I'm the psychopath.

112
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,260
You turned it down.

113
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm not that irresponsible.

114
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,980
I finish up what I started.

115
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,780
I have to go. I'll call you.

116
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,020
There are reporters everywhere. Watch out.

117
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,620
I apologise for the intrusion. Bye.

118
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,780
We met before.

119
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,780
I was going to feign ignorance.

120
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,620
I'm Yoon Jeong Eun.

121
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,310
I'm Shin Joon Young.

122
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,220
You must know that.

123
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,980
Let me down.

124
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,620
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

(NOH EUL)

127
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,820
You didn't change your number.

128
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
You ignored my texts and calls.

129
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,380
So I thought maybe you changed your number.

130
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,380
I was going to, but I haven't had the time.

131
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,580
Why did you ignore my texts and calls?

132
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,260
Just because.

133
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,180
"Just because"?

134
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,340
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy.

135
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
- If you're finished...
- I'm not finished.

136
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,459
I can go on for a while.

137
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,500
If I don't want to hear it, I don't have to, right?

139
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,700
See you.

I'm going back to my room. Good night.

141
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,380
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,060
- Is that all?
- If I had made a faster decision,

143
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,700
I wouldn't have confused you.

144
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,980
I am truly sorry.

What am I planning to get myself into after drinking?

148
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
My gosh.

149
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,060
Sir, are you busy?

150
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,900
Do you want to party tonight with me?

151
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,220
You said you liked skinny girls

152
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,029
So I went on a diet

153
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,620
You said you liked long straight hair

154
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,580
So I grew my hair

155
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,029
You said you didn't like girls who knew many guys

156
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,469
So I ignored a lot of guys who tried to talk to me

157
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,629
You said you didn't like girls who partied

158
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,140
So I don't even go to nightclubs

159
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,719
But what's the point?

160
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,589
There's no use

161
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,540
During that time, you found a girlfriend

162
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,439
You bad guy!

163
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm crying, but I can't give up on you

Let's go and 5, 6

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,660
You broke my heart

In 1, 2, 3, 4

Let's go!

Are you here to see Eul?

174
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,969
I came to film a movie.

175
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,559
I thought you turned it down.

176
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,900
Well, I...

177
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,020
changed my mind because of Ms Yoon.

178
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,540
You see, I have a weakness for beautiful women.

179
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,340
I almost forgot.

180
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,980
You shouldn't be drinking. You're ill.

181
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,020
I'm not ill.

182
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,820
Brainstem glioma.

183
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,819
The tumour has spread too much...

184
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,860
to even consider performing a surgery.

185
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,020
The life expectancy is estimated...

186
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,860
at two months.

187
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,380
Right?

188
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,020
I will look out for Eul.

189
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,300
You should take care of yourself.

190
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,460
I don't think...

191
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,620
you should be wasting your time like this.

192
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,500
You'll be gone soon.

193
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,540
You can't even take responsibility.

194
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,260
So stop confusing her.

195
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,540
I'll take this.

196
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,329
Let's grab another drink.

197
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,510
Get out of my way.

198
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,309
Hey, why are you ignoring me?

199
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,030
Get out of my way!

200
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,279
You're something now.

201
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,460
You couldn't even look at me before.

202
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,829
You see, Man Ok used to have a huge crush on me.

203
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,540
She said, "Will you please go on one date with me?"

204
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,300
Stop it, seriously. Move out of my way.

205
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,629
There's your dialect.

206
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,519
It's Man Ok's best feature.

207
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,269
Man Ok, you are...

208
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,669
the most attractive when you speak in a dialect.

209
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,879
Don't ever lose your dialect again,

210
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,159
and call me often, okay?

211
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,639
Aren't you going to move?

212
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,540
If you go on like this, I'll call Gook Young.

213
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,719
Fine. Go ahead.

214
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,759
He's nothing...

215
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,639
with his little curly hair.

216
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,860
Call him.

217
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,419
I'm not scared.

218
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,700
Get out my way! Move!

219
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,220
She told you to move! Are you guys deaf or what?

220
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,660
Yes, Joon Young.

221
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,060
- Where are you right now?
- Nowhere.

222
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,629
You jerks.

223
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,419
- Hey!
- You little...

224
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,249
Hey! You little punks.

225
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,220
My goodness, she's so rough.

226
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,900
If you want to drink, drink peacefully.

227
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,700
- You're dead.
- You little punks.

228
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,340
Let's just kill them all today.

229
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,700
- Hey!
- Hey, it's Shin Joon Young.

230
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,140
What are you doing?

231
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,269
Are you gangsters or what?

232
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,439
It's not like that.

233
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,639
They were picking on Man Ok first.

234
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,660
Be quiet.

235
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,900
Gook Young. Man Ok.

236
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,750
Come out this second.

237
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,380
My goodness.

238
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,819
We didn't do anything.

239
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,339
- My gosh.
- What did you say?

240
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,540
Stop it, please.

241
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,159
Don't talk to Gook Young like that.

242
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,980
He's two years older than you.

243
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,860
Where are your manners?

244
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,510
Mr Jang did nothing wrong.

245
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,799
Those jerks picked on Man Ok first.

246
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,820
So what?

247
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,900
Well, nothing.

248
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,100
- I mean...
- You mean what?

249
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,340
I got hurt.

250
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,620
I have a scratch here,

251
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,620
and they took out a handful of my hair.

252
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,620
He also kicked me,

253
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,900
so I got bruised.

254
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,839
I can't really show you,

255
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,820
but I have a huge bruise on my butt, too.

256
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,460
I think my ribs may be fractured.

257
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,860
My ribs. Is it here?

258
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,300
Maybe not.

260
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,420
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

261
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,340
May I help you?

262
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,779
Is there a hospital nearby?

263
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,759
Yes. You can get there in 10 minutes.

264
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,269
I think she's hurt. Could you take her there?

265
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,420
Yes, Sir.

266
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,580
Goodbye, then. Take care.

267
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,660
Please come with me.

268
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,540
Are you hurt badly?

269
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,300
No, I'm not hurt.

270
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
I'm sorry.

271
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,100
How did you get in?

272
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,759
You're up.

273
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,799
You drank a lot yesterday. Do you want coffee?

274
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,500
What are you doing in my room?

275
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,980
Your mother asked me to call her when you're up.

276
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,020
Mother, Ji Tae is up.

277
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
Hold on.

278
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,629
- Yes.
- Good morning.

279
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,820
Did you sleep well?

280
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,179
Jeong Eun became the investment team leader...

281
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,940
instead of you.

282
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,940
Did you hear about that?

283
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
I did.

284
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:48,180
So I want you to be Jeong Eun's team member.

285
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,660
What do you think?

286
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,580
Sure. I will do that.

287
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,420
I'm giving your director position to Jeong Eun, too.

288
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,900
- Is that okay?
- Go ahead.

289
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,540
In that case, you should leave your room.

290
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,519
That room isn't for a regular employee.

291
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,980
Sure. I will leave right now.

292
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,499
Okay. I heard you drank a lot yesterday. So...

293
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,340
You can do whatever you want with me,

294
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,740
but don't lay a hand on Eul.

295
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,749
That includes Eul, Eul's brother and Eul's friends.

296
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,660
If any one of them get hurt,

297
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,140
I won't stay still.

298
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,620
You know what I have to offer...

299
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,469
better than anyone.

300
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,869
- Ji Tae.
- If you're finished,

301
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,020
I'll hang up.

302
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,140
Congratulations on your promotion,

303
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,780
Director Yoon Jeong Eun.

304
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
I'll wait...

305
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,780
until you come back.

306
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,500
- I'll resign when...
- That won't happen.

307
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Ever.

308
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,940
Things will become harder.

309
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,780
Starting from extreme headaches, vomiting...

310
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,340
and double vision,

311
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,869
you'll also start having problems with...

312
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,580
your motor nerves and sensory nerves.

313
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,060
I look more awful after a good night's sleep.

314
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,740
Is there a hospital nearby?

315
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,700
I think she's hurt. Could you take her there?

316
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,060
That cold jerk.

317
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,780
Hello, I'm the person who asked for a raw egg.

318
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm sorry, but may I have another one?

319
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Have you seen...

320
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,860
five dollars anywhere?

321
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,060
No, I haven't.

322
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,300
I'm sure I dropped it here somewhere.

323
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,180
Can you lift your shoes up?

324
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,500
Take them off.

325
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,260
Are you hiding my money in your shoes?

326
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,460
This is odd. Where did it go?

327
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,580
This one, too.

328
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,500
I don't believe it.

329
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,860
People say...

330
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,100
that you're avoiding me...

331
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,620
because you're afraid.

332
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,940
They say that you're afraid...

333
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,660
that I'll have a bad influence on you.

334
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,220
But I don't buy that.

335
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,140
How can I?

336
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,300
I know who you are.

337
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,380
You're not someone who'd run away because of that.

338
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,820
I know that very well.

339
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,340
What do you know?

340
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,260
How would you know me?

341
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
I do.

342
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,940
I know everything.

343
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,260
I even know what you're thinking right now.

344
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,700
"I missed you, Eul."

345
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,740
"I really missed you."

346
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,340
You're saying that right now.

347
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,780
Things must be easy for you.

348
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,660
You're good at imagining things for your own sake.

349
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,100
If that makes things easier for you, keep thinking so.

350
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,460
I missed you too, Joon Young.

351
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,900
I missed you a lot.

352
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
I missed you so much.

353
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
I missed you very much.

354
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,100
I almost went insane.

355
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,020
This is my answer to your thoughts.

356
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,540
See you later.

357
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,940
I'll see you tomorrow and the day after.

358
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,300
I'll see you every single day.

361
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,319
Did you go to a farm to get the groceries?

362
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,660
Why did you come back so late?

363
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,659
Why? What's wrong?

364
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,060
Ms Shin is really weird.

00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,959
She served bossam to someone who ordered yukgaejang,

366
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,780
alcohol to someone who wanted water...

367
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,580
and a ladle to someone who asked for a spoon.

368
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,940
What's all this?

369
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,580
- What's all this?
- You're the one who bought these.

370
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,780
Should I call a psychiatrist...

371
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,100
and set up an appointment for two?

372
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,100
Yes, Young Ok.

373
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
What?

374
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,780
You don't put sugar in your coffee.

375
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,380
No, I do. My taste changed.

376
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,020
Have you been well?

377
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,630
Of course.

378
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,190
Hyun Joon...

379
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,500
Congressman Choi, have you been well?

380
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,020
What brings you to Shin Joon Young's house?

381
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,580
Did you...

382
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,780
get married?

383
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,820
Why did you call me over?

384
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,780
- Is something wrong?
- Well,

385
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,220
I wanted you to come and have some tea, too.

386
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Please, sit.

387
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,420
This is my husband.

388
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,540
Oh, I see.

389
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,060
Hello.

390
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,529
Hello.

391
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,940
Excuse me. I didn't get to greet you properly.

392
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,260
Honey, do you want anything?

393
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,380
No.

394
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,060
Water is fine.

395
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,900
Joon Young is our son.

396
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,389
We've been living apart because he didn't want...

397
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,759
Joon Young to become a celebrity.

398
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,700
But we'll live together soon. We're still a family.

399
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,980
Oh, I... I see.

400
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,060
You must be proud to have a son like him.

401
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
Yes.

402
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
But...

403
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,700
what brings you to Joon Young's house?

404
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,300
Well, the thing is,

405
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,630
I owe him a lot.

406
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,700
He saved my life.

407
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,900
My goodness.

408
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,500
How uncanny is this?

409
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,670
He's just like his father.

410
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,220
He's too kind of a person just like him.

411
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,980
Honey.

412
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,869
- Do you want some warm water?
- No, I'm fine.

413
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,900
Honey.

414
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,999
What else? What else do you know about Jik?

415
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,019
We told you about his family, friends, personality,

416
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,649
hobby, habits, blood type, nickname,

417
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,349
height, weight, clothes and shoes size...

418
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,759
and even what lotion he uses.

419
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
You still want more?

420
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
By any chance,

421
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,809
does he have a secretive past?

422
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,620
Why do you want to know about my past?

423
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,540
Is stalking your hobby?

424
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,140
It's not like that.

425
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,229
(NOH JIK)

426
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,940
You really are Noh Jik, not Oh Jik.

427
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,960
Then is Eul really...

428
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,410
Is Producer Noh...

429
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,410
really your sister?

430
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I'll kill you if you ever tell her anything about me.

431
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,680
I'll pay for that table.

432
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,309
Why are you paying? I got these for your friends.

433
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,169
She's right. She's bribing us because she likes you.

434
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,609
She wants us to help her out.

435
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,339
Old man, you two look great together.

436
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,860
She's really rich.

437
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,659
- Date her, date her.
- Date her, date her.

438
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,620
- How much is it?
- My gosh.

439
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,510
You don't have to. I told you, I'll pay.

440
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,990
Let go of me. Why would you pay for my friends?

441
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,990
Ha Ru.

442
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,829
Really? Is that right?

443
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,900
You're so pretty.

444
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,670
Is she really crazy?

445
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,710
The doctor says she's fine,

446
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,329
but she doesn't remember a thing.

447
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,729
She doesn't know who she is or where she lives.

448
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,889
And she doesn't want to go to the police.

449
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,289
- Where's her cell phone?
- She must've lost it.

450
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,630
I can't find it. What do I do?

451
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,110
Hello, do you remember me?

452
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,350
What about him?

453
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,910
What's your name?

454
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,069
- Elsa.
- What's the capital of Korea?

455
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,840
San Francisco.

456
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,530
What year is it right now?

457
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,000
Is it the Shilla dynasty?

458
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,449
What is this?

459
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,480
A cow.

460
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,190
I need to talk to you.

461
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,710
She didn't lose her memory. She's just gone crazy.

462
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,820
What do I do?

463
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,980
I'm saying she's gone crazy for you.

464
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,380
I think she's pretending to be insane...

465
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,190
because she wants to stay with you.

466
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,820
She must have read a lot of comic books.

467
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,979
That tactic is from the comic book...

468
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,300
"Queen Of Relationships", volume 13.

469
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,580
What am I to her?

470
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,860
- What?
- I mean,

471
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,300
what am I to her...

472
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,380
that she's even pretending to be crazy?

473
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,230
She looks like she'd be very popular herself.

474
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,020
She's cute.

475
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,860
That's why she's insane.

476
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,620
Jik, what are you going to do?

477
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,759
"Jik's favourite girl group is GFRIEND."

478
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,909
"His favourite movie is 'Memories About Murder'."

479
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,839
"His favourite song is 'Run the Horse'."

480
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,959
"His favourite chicken part is the breast."

481
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,180
These are all wrong.

482
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,109
Everything other than my family and height are wrong.

483
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,959
My favourite girl group is Fin.K.L.

484
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,189
My favourite movie is "Memories of Murder".

485
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,340
My favourite song is "What About My Age?"

486
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,070
My favourite chicken part is the gizzard.

487
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,500
From now on, instead of asking my friends,

488
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,780
just ask me directly.

489
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,580
I'll tell you.

490
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,180
Jik.

491

492
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:22,510
Hello?

493
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:24,749
Seo Yoon Hoo's already on stand by.

494
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,449
What's taking you so long?

495
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,670
Well, that's...

496
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,470
What do you think you're doing?

497
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,350
This job seemed easy, didn't it?

498
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,350
You thought it would be easy, didn't you?

499
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,510
Are you crazy or what?

500
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,670
Why are you dressed like this?

501
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:01,830
Well,

502
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,889
I had a small problem.

503
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,470
And why do you have sunglasses on...

504
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,390
when you're going to be holding a camera?

505
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,310
Do you think you're an actress?

506
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,750
I'm sorry.

507
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,070
Look at you.

508
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,470
Are you kidding me?

509
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,950
Are you here to work or to fight?

510
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,289
You're the one who made her like that.

511
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,530
You're the one who bruised her.

512
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,070
Gook Young.

513
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,750
I'm so sorry.

514
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,950
I'll make sure this won't ever happen again.

515
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,310
What are you doing? Apologise again.

516
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,110
I'm sorry.

517
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,910
- This won't happen...
- Forget that.

518
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,929
Go home.

519
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,409
- Yoon Hoo.
- Look at her slippers...

520
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,150
and her hair.

521
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,830
When was the last time...

522
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,630
you washed these?

523
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,270
Gross.

524
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,630
I can smell kimchi all the way from here!

525
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,359
Didn't you hear me? Go home!

526
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,190
Come on, Yoon Hoo.

527
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,889
I just need to film well as a camera crew.

528
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,790
Why do I need to be dressed well?

529
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,230
It's not like I'm going to sleep with you.

530
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,230
- What?
- Eul.

531
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,769
You must be insane.

532
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,009
I'm not insane.

533
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,950
This is why people call you a pervert.

534
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,749
This could happen when we're busy with work.

535
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,609
What's wrong with being dirty from time to time?

536
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,829
It's not like I'm covered in excrement.

537
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,990
Hey, get lost.

538
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,830
Get lost right now.

539
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,190
You should know your place.

540
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,910
So this is why Joon Young fired you.

541
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,109
If you had already known that she was insane,

542
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,510
you should've told me earlier.

543
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,030
I didn't know she was your staff member.

544
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,830
If I'd known, I would've told you.

545
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,710
Noh Eul, was it?

546
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,230
You'll never get to work again.

547
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,070
I'll do anything to get rid of you from this business.

548
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,589
- And you.
- Yes?

549
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,110
The same goes for you, too.

550
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,649
How dare you let someone like her work for me?

551
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,009
Do you want to go out of business?

552
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,670
No, it's not like that, Yoon Hoo.

553
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,190
Hey.

554
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,110
Eul.

555
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,390
Eul, are you insane?

556
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,710
Eul.

557
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,230
Why aren't you at the shooting?

558
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:50,910
I got fired.

559
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,230
I'm sorry. You worked hard to get me in the team.

560
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:01,990
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

561
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,030
You were fired too, right?

562
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,309
The team leader had changed to that lady.

563
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,950
I almost got engaged to her.

564
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,630
You almost got engaged?

565
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,510
I called it off on the morning...

566
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,550
of our engagement day...

567
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,750
and ran over to you.

568
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,590
Do you like Joon Young that much?

569
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,199
Mind your own business.

570
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,550
You always get hurt.

571
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,470
Why do you like him so much?

572
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,910
Where's your pride?

573
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,510
The same goes for you.

574
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:11,070
You called off an engagement just to get hurt.

575
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,510
Why do you like me so much?

576
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,270
Don't you have any pride?

577
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,990
It's not an issue of pride. I'm just being smart.

578
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,030
I know you'll come to me...

579
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,990
if I wait long enough.

580
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,110
That won't happen.

581
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,510
You and I can never be.

582
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,590
You know that better than I do.

583
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:45,670
Don't be so sure.

584
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,750
You never know.

585
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,070
Should the two jobless people go back to Seoul?

586
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,670
We can go on a date.

587
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,689
Where are you going?

588
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,609
I quit being Joon Young's manager. I'm going home.

589
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:06,710
Are you crazy?

590
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,609
Eul was being treated unfairly,

591
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,510
and he knows that she got hurt protecting you.

592
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,299
"I didn't know."

593
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,049
"If I'd known, I would've told you."

594
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,830
How can he say that?

595
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,470
I will work for Dad if I have to,

596
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,279
but I can't work with that jerk any more.

597
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,310
I'm leaving.

599
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,350
Stay still.

600
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,630
- I'll shoot if you move.
- I don't want to.

601
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,030
I'm going to move.

602
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,369
Hey.

603
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,649
Shoot me.

604
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,910
Go ahead and shoot.

605
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,670
Shoot me.

606
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,070
Hey.

607
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,710
You should hurry up and get rid of this trash.

608
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,599
Shoot me.

609
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,310
Hurry up and shoot!

610
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,790
Tell me!

611
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:15,910
Tell me everyone you killed. Then you can die.

612
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,470
Tell me.

613
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,190
Hey, why are you hitting me?

614
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,950
This isn't on the script.

615
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,489
Hey, wait! Stop!

616
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,430
Someone stop him.

617
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,150
Cut.

618
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,350
Excuse me. May I have some plastic bags?

619
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,710
I have wet clothes.

620
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,150
Please wait.

621
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,430
Our keys, please.

622
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,289
Is the shooting already over?

623
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,150
I thought you were shooting through the night.

624
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,230
There was an accident, so it got cancelled.

625
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,929
I read it wrong. I thought I had to hit him.

626
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,870
Yoon Hoo is about to sue you.

627
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,389
The producer is talking to him, but...

628
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,670
Tell him to sue me.

629
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,750
I hit someone. I should pay for what I did.

630
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,190
Joon Young.

631
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,310
Wait.

632
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,030
You should apologise to him...

633
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,030
before the reporters find out.

634
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:23,990
Joon Young.

635
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,830
Yoon Hoo has done this to me before.

636
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,070
I broke my nose back then.

637
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,510
He didn't apologise to me.

638
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,510
"When actors..."

639
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:40,870
"are shooting something,"

640
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,070
"things like this can happen."

641
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,310
That's what he said.

642
00:53:46,311 --> 00:53:47,990
We barely started filming.

643
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,590
Do you want to call it off?

644
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,310
Let's call it off.

645
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,669
I don't care.

646
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,910
I care.

647
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,550
This is my first project after becoming a team leader.

648
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,910
The doors are closing.

649
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,310
Which hospital is he at?

650
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,430
I'm sorry.

651
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,070
Forgive me.

652
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,710
No.

653
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,449
- Yoon Hoo.
- I'm sorry.

654
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,729
I read the script wrong.

655
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,110
You also made a mistake before, didn't you?

656
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,609
He came to apologise, so forgive him.

657
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,310
I said, no.

658
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,089
He did this on purpose.

659
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,110
No way.

660
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,879
Why would I do that on purpose?

661
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,430
I really like you.

662
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,510
- Kneel, then.
- Yoon Hoo.

663
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,559
I'll forgive you...

664
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,150
if you kneel down.

665
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,350
Why?

666
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,790
- Can't you do that?
- Yoon Hoo.

667
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,590
You're awful.

668
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,110
What's with you?

669
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,190
I'll kneel down.

670
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,430
I will kneel down instead.

671
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,230
Forgive me, Yoon Hoo.

672
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,470
Be the bigger man.

673
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,110
Let's be friends...

674
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,710
and shoot this movie.

675
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,190
You did it because of me, right?

676
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,550
Seo Yoon Hoo.

677
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,790
You hit him because of me.

678
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,169
You did it for me.

679
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,350
You must be imagining things again.

680
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,310
Go take some medicine and sleep.

681
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,670
I'm right. You did it because of me.

682
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,950
Why do you pretend like you don't care?

683
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,870
Why are you being so mean?

684
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,190
I haven't slept since yesterday. I'm going to sleep.

685
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,110
Please leave.

686
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,110
If this is some kind of a joke,

687
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,950
go ahead and continue.

688
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,209
Whatever you do, I won't get hurt.

689
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,849
I won't get upset or misunderstand you.

690
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,110
Go ahead and carry on.

691
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,590
Do you want to sleep with me?

692
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,430
If that's not what you want, tell me now.

693
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:04,830
I'll open the door for you.

694
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,870
