00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,450
Where are we going?

4
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,480
I don't know.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,680
Don't ask to be let off.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,880
I don't plan on stopping.

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,280
You're late.

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,050
So are you.

9
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,600
I had to listen to a friend whine.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,200
- Why?
- My friend...

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,360
and my friend's...

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
younger brother...

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,720
both liked the same girl.

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,770
- That's too bad.
- But...

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,200
my friend's father had...

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,360
an ill-fated relationship with the girl's family.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,680
My friend had no choice...

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,080
but to give up on her.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,120
His brother, on the other hand,

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
took the girl's hand and ran away with her.

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,080
That sounds like the plot of a drama Ms Jang watches.

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
It does, doesn't it?

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,720
Let's skip our exercise today.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
Buy me a drink instead.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,090
It's as far as we can go.

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,090
We can't drown in the sea.

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,640
Let's drown.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
I don't really want to live.

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,280
Let's just die.

30
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,560
You can't even do it anyway.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
What a coward.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,120
- What are you doing?
- You wanted to die.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
You're crazy.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,280
You really are.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,960
Die alone if you want to.

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
Where are you going?

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520

Your call cannot be connected.

43
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,320
Is she not answering?

44
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,120
Where do you think Joon Young took her?

45
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,760
I knew he was a loose cannon, but this is spectacular.

46
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
My goodness.

47
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,440
The top 10 search terms are all about them.

48
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,960
Look at the comments.

49
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,840

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,080
Hello?

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,320
Don't touch Noh Eul.

53
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,560
- What?
- You're the chair of Joon Young's fan club.

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,960
If you touch a hair on Eul's head, you'll pay for it.

55
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
Tell your minions that.

56
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Hey!

57
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,760
And if they don't stop posting malicious comments,

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,040
I'll trace their IP addresses and crush them forever.

59
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,960
Tell them that, too.

60
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
How dare you.

61
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
Do you know who I am?

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,840
- How dare you threaten me.
- You.

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,560
You told the girls to find out about Producer Noh.

64
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,840
If I ever catch you, I will hurt you bad.

65
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,960
You better watch out in the dark.

66
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
You lunatic.

67
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
Where are you?

68
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,960

72
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
Dad, where are you?

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,480
Some lunatic is threatening your daughter.

74
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,080
What are you talking about?

75
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,240
Why did you pick up?

76
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,200
We were having a drink. Dad went to the men's room.

77
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
What's going on?

78
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,680
It's just that someone thinks I told Joon Young's...

79
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
Never mind.

80
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
Do you know me?

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,560
What do you care?

82
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,520
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

83
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,240
Why am I drunk already?

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,200
I didn't even drink that much.

85
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,080
You can't take as much now.

86
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880
It's because your mother's overly protective.

87
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,120
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

88
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,040
My phone.

89
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
Is it in here?

90
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,600
Where is it?

91
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,280
- Have you seen my phone?
- No.

92
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,640
Is it in here?

93
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,210
Here.

94
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,680
What was the number?

95
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
It was 3, 9...

96
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,960
No, that's Na Ri's number.

97
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,210
It's 7, 3...

98
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
My goodness.

99
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Why did he drink so much?

100
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,880
Was this your idea?

101
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,280
Yes. I asked him to buy me a drink.

102
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,240
He has to watch his health. He's not supposed to drink.

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,520
He hasn't been sleeping much because of work.

104
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Sorry.

105
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,720
Why are you all so selfish?

106
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,120
I'll make him honey tea. Help him change.

107
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,560
- Okay.
- This is so upsetting.

108
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,600
Hello?

109
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Hello?

110
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Hello? You called, so speak up.

111
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,120
Do you know...

112
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,210
how hard it was for me?

113
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Pretending not to like you was...

114
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,720
You don't know how hard that was.

115
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,560
Why were you nice to me?

116
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,960
Why did you buy me food and clothes...

117
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,160
when you didn't even have money yourself?

118
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,920
Why did you smile at me,

119
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,840
care if I'd eaten or not,

120
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,760
and take me to the hospital? Why did you do all that?

121
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,320
You rejected me twice.

122
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,040
That was in public, too, which was so embarrassing.

123
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,560
Why did you confuse me? Why?

124
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,800
What makes you so special?

125
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Tell me.

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,560
You aren't as rich as Shin Joon Young.

127
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
You're older than him, too.

128
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,680
He has three cars and you have none.

129
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
You don't have a house or a building.

130
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,520
What gives you the right to reject me?

131
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
Give me the phone.

132
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
Hey.

133
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,040
Could you think about it one last time?

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,880
I'm a catch if you think about it.

135
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,080
I promise to be really good to you.

136
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Please take me back.

137
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,800
Will you date me, please?

138
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,360
Hey!

139
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,000
Give it back.

140
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
It's mine, not yours.

141
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,240
Still, give it back. I'm not done talking to him!

142
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,400
You made a fool of yourself already!

143
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,680
I want my phone back.

144
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
No!

145
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Are you okay?

146
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Do you want water?

147
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,040
It's your fault.

148
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,960
Because of what you did,

149
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,640
I can't be with Eul.

150
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,160
Go and get my phone.

151
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,720
It was mine, not yours.

152
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,280
Go and get my phone! I wasn't done talking to him!

153
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,480
Go and get it yourself, then!

154
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,680
What a psycho.

155
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,520
- Get out!
- Let me go.

156
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Get out of there.

157
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,840
- Let go of me!
- My gosh!

158
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,520
Put me down.

159
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,840
Hey!

160
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,560
Hey, you.

161
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
My gosh!

162
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,640
Hey!

163
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
Don't you see me?

164
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,400
Think of what I did for you!

165
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,160
Don't you see me?

166
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
Mister...

167
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,400
Mister...

168
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
Mister...

169
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,080
Ouch!

170
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,040
Mister...

171
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,600
My head aches.

172
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
It hurts.

173
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,080
Why are my clothes up there?

174
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,280
Are you feeling all right?

175
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,960
You drank soju straight up.

176
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,080
Five bottles of it, too.

177
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,720
- Did I really?
- What?

178
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
My goodness.

179
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,600
I made some hangover soup. Wait while I set the table.

180
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,880
Wait. Excuse me, Ma'am.

181
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,280
Why are my clothes hanging up there?

182
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,520
And why am I wearing this weird outfit?

183
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,560
Do you really not remember anything?

184
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,240
You walked into the sea and got drenched.

185
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,120
Then you threw up on yourself.

186
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,840
It was so gross.

- Yes.

I was born and raised here and I never left the place.

209
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,650
Was that for free?

210
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,960
Of course it was.

211
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,320
It's odd how you grew up in Gyeongsang Province...

- Look at her.

Sorry, Jik. You must've been worried about me.

If our restaurant business were to expand abroad,

252
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,650
it would improve our company's image and revenue.

On page 32, I think...

256
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,560
That is not enough reason or cause!

That's why I'm asking.

or swapped clubs as you played golf,

262
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,120
did one of your minions make a small mistake...

263
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,480
out of exhaustion of working day and night?

264
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,240
Or did you, for once, try to do this yourself,

265
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,640
but because it's been so long since you've worked,

266
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,920
did you mistake the pointless for the important?

267
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,200
Is that why you ended up with a proposal...

268
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,120
that has no meaning, grounds, uniqueness or creativity?

Young Ok, do you know what he said?

368
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,240
He said "mental" and that means crazy.

369
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,960
He just called you crazy. I had to react.

370
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,720
Don't react! Just be still!

became your project because...

409
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,040
you threatened him like the woman from "Misery".

410
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,440
Apparently, you have a video that can't go public,

411
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,680
and they say you're blackmailing him with it.

412

- Not really.

Why are you trying so hard to shield her,

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,080
Enjoy your meal.

547
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Eul.

548
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,280
What should I do?

549
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,360
The weird girl who turned her back to me...

550
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,600
won't even cast me a glance.

551
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,760
Instead, she wants the guy who abandoned her.

552
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,760
I'm Shin Joon Young.

553
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,840
Should I comfort her?

554
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,040
Should I threaten that I'll hit her if she won't stop?

555
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,600
It's obvious that she isn't normal.

556
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,960
Should I take her to see a doctor?

557
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
Or...

558
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,840
maybe I was just too late.

559
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,280
Should I give up on you...

560
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,120
and send you off to that guy?

561
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,760
- Where is Eul?
- She just left. Didn't you see her?

562
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,400
Is she actually from a rich family?

563
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,920
Your face tells me I'm right.

564
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,120
That's why she eloped with Shin Joon Young.

565
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,760
Did I do or say anything to upset her?

566
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Taxi.

567
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,680
- Where to?
- To Geoje.

568
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,800
Take me there.

569
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
We're here.

570
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,960
(402 DOLLARS AND 80 CENTS)

571
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,400
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

572
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,160
Could you give me a discount?

573
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,120
Taxi fees are fixed.

574
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,320
Do you take instalments?

575
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,920
Producer Noh?

576
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,160
Are you still looking?

577
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,640
I have men scouring the whole area,

578
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,120
but no one has seen him.

579
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,120
Could he be in Seoul?

580
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,720
Would a star like him have taken a bus or taxi?

581
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,120
What about the police? Did you call them?

582
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,000
How could I? If the press catches anything,

583
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,280
that would really take a turn for the worse.

584
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,760
Do you think he walked into the sea?

585
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,680
Joon Young! Where are you?

586
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,480
If you drowned, tell me so!

587
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,400
What if he really is dead?

588
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,920
Then we should go and get him!

589
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,360
Did you kill him to take his belongings?

590
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,080
His watch is worth tens of thousands of dollars.

591
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,520
- What?
- You love money.

592
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,360
I killed him.

593
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,280
I wanted his money, so I killed him. So what?

594
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,560
How much do you have? Shall I kill you, too?

595
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,800
No, please don't.

596
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,200
I have nothing but only loans to pay back.

597
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,720
He proposed to you in public, but you rejected him.

598
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,280
He's nothing without his pride and ego.

599
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,960
If he really did do something drastic because of you,

600
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
then I really won't stand still.

601
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,240
Where could he be?

602
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,160
My goodness. Are you still here?

603
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
Ma'am.

604
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,560
Eat this.

605
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,000
I heard your husband's missing.

606
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,480
People came here last night.

607
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,640
They asked when you came and left, what you did,

608
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,880
and if you had said anything strange.

609
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,880
They acted like you two were having an affair.

610
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,400
Did he really not tell you where he was going?

611
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,840
He didn't. He told me to cook you some hangover soup.

612
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,560
Since your clothes weren't dry yet, he paid me tons...

613
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,680
to give you some of my clothes.

615
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,280
You fool.

616
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,440
Eul.

617
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,880
Did I really do something stupid?

618
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,720
"I hate Joon Young's guts. Go and die."

619
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000
"Why hasn't the Grim Reaper taken him yet?"

620
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,320
I hope I didn't say anything like that.

621
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,880
My goodness.

622
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Ma'am.

623
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,680
Where is this?

624
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,920
That? It's the island over there.

625
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,600
- Is it nearby?
- Yes.

626
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,280
It takes 40 minutes by boat.

629
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,640
Excuse me, Sir.

630
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,640
Captain.

631
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,560
Could you give me a ride?

632
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,040
Joon Young.

633
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,640
Joon Young!

634
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,320
Joon Young.

635
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,320
(TO THE DOCK)

636
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,840
Joon Young!

637
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,000
Where are you, Joon Young?

638
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,640
Where are you if you aren't here?

639
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,160
Where are you hiding, you jerk?

640
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,200
Hello?

641
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,120
It's me, Eul. Have you found Joon Young yet?

642
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,280
No, not yet.

643
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,920
I think something bad happened.

644
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,000
If we don't find him today,

645
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,680
then we're planning to report it to the police.

646
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,640
Joon Young.

647
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,440
How can you sleep?

648
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,280
How can you sleep when everyone's worried sick?

649
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,600
You aren't in a movie.

650
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,560
Trying to be an actor, are you?

651
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,920
Stupid me.

652
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,240
I can't believe what I did because I was worried.

653
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,960
I took a taxi here all the way from Seoul.

654
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,000
I waited in the freezing cold for a boat.

655
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,920
I also got bitten by a seagull.

656
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,760
Gosh, my money.

657
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,760
I could've fed Jik meat for days with that money.

658
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Do you think this is a dream?

659
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,560
It's not. I really am Eul.

660
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,680
I came all the way here to find you.

661
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,960
You really do think it's a dream, don't you?

662
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,520
It's me, Eul.

663
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Unbelievable.

664
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,840
I should pinch you awake.

665
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,760
Go.

666
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,800
What?

667
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
Go away.

668
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,120
- What?
- Get out of my sight.

669
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,800
(UNCONTROLLABLY FOND)

670
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,480
Didn't I tell you?

671
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,240
I'm weird when I'm drunk.

672
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,560
I really want to apologise.

673
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,960
Hit me until you feel better. Here.

674
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,600
If I ever drink again, I'm a real dog.

675
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,280
A tumour?

676
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,040
It's in a bad location and hard to operate on.

677
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
You saw the photo.

678
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,040
Christmas rose. I have nothing to give you.

679
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,480
I'll make you regret it.

680
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,720
What if it wasn't a joke? What if he meant it?

681
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,120
If he really likes me, what should I do?

682
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,040
I won't let her go.

683
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,400
I plan to keep her.

684
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,080
Stop it, Joon Young.
