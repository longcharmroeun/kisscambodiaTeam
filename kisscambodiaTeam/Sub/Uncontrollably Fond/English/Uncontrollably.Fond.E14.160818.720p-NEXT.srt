2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,259
Whatever you do, I won't get hurt.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,779
I won't get upset or misunderstand you.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,000
Go ahead and carry on.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,280
Do you want to sleep with me?

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
If that's not what you want, tell me now.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,600
I'll open the door for you.

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,970
I'm not going to leave.

9
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,480
I won't budge. I'm going to stick by your side.

10
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,520
Please wait here for your turn.

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Here you go.

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,979
- Bye.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,160
Excuse me.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Yes?

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,509
- What do you need?
- The fire went out.

16
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,200
Did it? Just a second.

17
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,440
- Did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes.

18
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,929
A large bossam, three yukgaejang and dumplings.

19
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,920
(SON)

20
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,120
- I'll call you...
- Give me three reasons...

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,010
why I can't date Eul.

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,680
I gave you a list, but I can't remember any.

23
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,579
Excuse me, but can you hurry?

24
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,089
Okay. I'm sorry.

25
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm so sorry.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
Can we have a bottle of soju?

28
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,840
I'll date her, then.

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,920
If you also can't remember why,

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,480
then let's just pretend like there weren't any reasons.

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll stay with Eul.

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
Five years ago,

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,720
if only Eul had taken that USB to the TV station...

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,169
If only you hadn't taken that USB away from Eul...

35
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,739
Today's my father's memorial day.

36
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,280
Oh, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,499
I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,609
So don't be mad and take this.

39
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,680
Eul.

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,200
Eul still remembers everything.

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
I thought she was okay,

42
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,720
but Eul was still living in darkness.

43
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm Shin Joon Young.

44
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
A few months ago,

45
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,120
my doctor told me that...

46
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't have much long to live.

47
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,400
Well, it's a bit perplexing,

48
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840
but everyone dies anyway.

49
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
So...

50
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,840
(SHIN JOON YOUNG'S FANS ARE NOT WELCOME.)

51
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,520
(SHIN JOON YOUNG'S FANS ARE WELCOME.)

52
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,440
- Why are you here washing the dishes?
- Me?

53
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,360
I quit being Joon Young's manager.

54
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,169
- Why?
- I had pride...

55
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,920
in what I did.

56
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,179
But I don't think I can deal with that kind of...

57
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,899
human being any more.

58
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,339
What did he do?

59
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,939
How did you raise your son to be like that?

60
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,520
It wasn't just anyone.

61
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,000
It was Producer Noh.

62
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,319
No human being should do such a thing.

63
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,680
- What?
- What are you talking about?

64
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,929
If you're still drunk, sleep it off.

65
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,159
Why are you here talking nonsense?

66
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,419
It's not nonsense.

67
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,379
If you'd seen what Joon Young had done,

68
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,299
you'd have beat him for 72 hours and then some more.

69
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,440
- How dare you...
- Wait!

70
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,080
Wait. This isn't what I should be doing.

71
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,200
If I'm going to quit, I might as well say,

72
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,539
"Hey, Joon Young."

73
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,219
"You need to become a decent human being first."

74
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,680
Then I should kick his bottom and then quit.

75
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,059
You punk.

76
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,259
Joon Young doesn't deserve a beating.

77
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,019
You do, though. I might as well get to it.

78
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,579
I need a sturdy piece of wood for a fool like you.

79
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,440
I think this will do nicely.

80
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,920
- Stop it, Dad.
- Say that again.

81
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,640
You little rat.

82
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
Come over here.

83
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,880
Let me ask you this.

84
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,739
If Joon Young and I are both drowning,

85
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,079
will you save Joon Young first?

86
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,250
What are you saying?

87
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,729
You aren't a kid.

88
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,259
He might as well be, Dad.

89
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,739
You always care for Joon Young so affectionately,

90
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,239
so he's being jealous. You're so childish.

91
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,339
What did you say? I'm childish?

92
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,040
When was I jealous? I was not jealous.

93
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,160
I should put you in your place.

94
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,029
Don't hit Man Ok.

95
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,080
Don't hit people. Are you a barbarian?

96
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,679
It hurts. Let go right now.

97
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,979
Be quiet!

98
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,219
Do we have to start the day like this?

99
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,880
Young Deuk, let him go.

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,360
Tell me. What did Joon Young do to that Noh Eul girl?

101
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,040
What did Joon Young do?

102
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,459
I asked to see you because...

103
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,360
your brother said he won't go to college.

104
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,240
My brother...

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
said what?

106
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:10,960
With his grades, he could go to any college he wants,

107
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,920
but he told me he doesn't want to go to college.

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,040
Jik.

109
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,680
Why did you call my sister?

110
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,919
I asked you to keep it a secret.

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,440
It's such a waste.

112
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,889
You're too smart to not go to college.

113
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,469
You wanted to be a doctor.

114
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,179
I won't go to college.

115
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,649
I already made up my mind, so...

116
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,200
Ouch. It hurts.

117
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll have a short chat with him.

118
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,960
Are you crazy?

119
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,939
Why won't you go to college?

120
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,850
Who do you think I slave away at work for?

121
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,560
Have you lost your mind?

122
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,089
You barely earn enough to pay our debts.

123
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,950
You can't afford my tuition.

124
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,709
Medical school costs a fortune.

125
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,319
I have a lot of money. I have loads, so...

126
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,920
If you're that rich, find a place to stay.

127
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,959
I don't care if it's a basement room.

128
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,929
I'm tired of tiptoeing around my friend's family.

129
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,360
Find us a place to stay.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,079
Fine. I'll find us a place.

131
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,579
- I'll...
- If you're that rich,

132
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,080
pay off our debt...

133
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,560
so we won't have to worry about loan sharks coming by.

134
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,679
Let's live in peace.

135
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,999
Fine. I'll find a place and pay off the debt.

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,319
I'll do all that if...

137
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,680
I'll go to college once you do all that.

138
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,040
Let's not talk about college any more.

139
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,960
Noh Jik!

140
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,459
Hello?

141
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm KJ Group's chairwoman, Lee Eun Soo.

142
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,560
You remember me, right?

143
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Eul won't come by any more. You can stay indoors.

144
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,040
What's that?

145
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,560
You should watch how you look.

146
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,560
(DOCTOR KANG)

147
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,960
Hello, Doctor.

148
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
Isn't it a lovely day?

149
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
Did you think about it?

150
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,280
You should get admitted.

151
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,169
I'll end up dying in the hospital.

152
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,639
If you get treated...

153
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll still end up dying in the hospital.

154
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,120
As your doctor, I can't just watch you do nothing.

155
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
I'll call your family.

156
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,720
I considered you my saviour.

157
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,089
Don't make me take you to court.

158
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,480
- Joon Young.
- Something urgent came up.

159
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,360
I'll call you back.

160
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,560
What brings you all the way here?

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
Why did you send me this?

162
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,280
I don't know why you sent me this,

163
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,760
but I'm engaged.

164
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
I know that.

165
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,640
But you're not the only one who got this.

166
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,419
The distributor, production staff...

167
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,360
and directors all got one.

168
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,280
My company president sent them...

169
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,200
to apologise for the trouble I'd caused.

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,680
He spent a bit too much on an apology, though.

171
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
You can leave it here if you wish.

172
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
One more thing.

173
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm grateful and sorry.

174
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
You knelt in front of Yoon Hoo.

175
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,040
If I hadn't, you would have.

176
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,039
I couldn't let a pretty lady kneel...

177
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,720
in front of a guy like him.

178
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,360
I should go.

179
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Sure.

180
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,800
What did you say...

181
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,280
back then?

182
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
I think you said something...

183
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
when you got me out of the pool.

184
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,920
What did you say?

185
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,960
It's a secret.

186
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,040
Tell me.

187
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,120
You said you're engaged.

188
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,760
- So what?
- I said it without knowing you were.

189
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Forget about it.

190
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,520
It's fine.

191
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Tell me.

192
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
Drive safely.

193
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,320
Have a nice day.

194
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Get back to work.

195
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,456
Don't come here if you're going to greet me like that.

196
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,699
I'm no longer a director.

197
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,720
Then...

198
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,810
I'll speak as a friend.

199
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,760
You're such a bad son.

200
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,549
Do you have to go this far?

201
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,160
I was sent here and I obeyed.

202
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,079
No one fired me...

203
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,240
which is why I'm here slaving away.

204
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,050
I do exactly as my parents say. I'm not a bad son.

205
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,720
Must you go on fighting your mother like this?

206
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,050
Being friends with me might ruin your career.

207
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,120
Don't come here again.

208
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,920
I saw Producer Noh in the lobby earlier today.

209
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,240
I think Madam Lee called her.

210
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,570
What for?

211
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,810
You don't look too well.

212
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,810
Did something bad happen?

213
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Yes.

214
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,290
I wonder why.

215
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:43,199
You have a staunch supporter who threatened me...

216
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
never to touch a hair on your head.

217
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,600
I won't leave Korea.

218
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,480
I'm going to stay.

219
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,120
That's fine. Koreans should stay in Korea.

220
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,760
I didn't say anything.

221
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,049
Ms Kim, bring it in.

222
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,160
Yes, Madam.

223
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,480
It's a million dollars.

224
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,840
I'll get to the point.

225
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,680
Take this and send Ji Tae...

226
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,939
back to his fiancée.

227
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,960
She adored Ji Tae for 20 long years.

228
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,120
You can't do this to another woman.

229
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,680
What did she do to deserve this?

230
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,570
You don't even like Ji Tae anyway.

231
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
I thought I told you clearly...

232
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,000
not to do anything to Eul.

233
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
I said I wouldn't stay...

234
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,640
I did nothing but give her money.

235
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,680
Can't I do that much for a poor girl?

236
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,079
I even donate to strangers.

237
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
Mum!

238
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,160
Is this...

239
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,579
- a real cheque?
- Eul.

240
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,579
You can check at any bank.

241
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,960
It'll be fine if it's from you.

242
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,080
I'll use it well.

243
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,160
Noh Eul.

244
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Give me that.

245
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,960
You deserve an apology, not money.

246
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,499
"I'm sorry. I wronged you."

247
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,880
They won't apologise.

248
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,320
Your parents...

249
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,360
won't apologise even if the sky falls down.

250
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
- Eul.
- I can fight them my whole life,

251
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,600
but they'll never apologise.

252
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,160
No one even listens to what I say anyway.

253
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,760
Even if you try to protect me,

254
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,360
they can crush me just like that.

255
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,680
So why should I fight?

256
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,179
I know I'll lose anyway.

257
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,920
This is wrong.
I sold you for a million dollars.

258
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,570
I don't exactly know how big of a money it is yet,

259
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,720
but I got lucky thanks to you.

260
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,050
I'll buy you an expensive drink.

262
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,400
You're still here.

263
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,600
The river's so beautiful.

264
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,760
What made you build a house in such a beautiful spot?

265
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,880
Aren't you cold? The wind's harsh.

266
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,960
What's your relationship with Producer Noh?

267
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,179
Did you stay to ask me that?

268
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,080
I think she likes you very much.

269
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,800
I like her very much, too.

270
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
That's why I beat up Yoon Hoo.

271
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,929
It was for her.

272
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,619
Why were you so cold to her, then?

273
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,400
She's too pretty for me.

274
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,640
That annoyed me so much.

275
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,040
What a joke.

276
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,769
You and Ji Tae are both insane.

277
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,839
How could you fall for a lowlife like...

278
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,520
Watch what you say.

279
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,120
Like I just said, I like her very much.

280
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,920
Are you okay?

281
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,840
No, I'm not okay.

282
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,560
I'll do nothing but help, so stay calm.

283
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,859
You were right.

284
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,880
What?

285
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
The thing you gave me.

286
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,579
You said this would bring me luck.

287
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,899
I just won the lottery.

288
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,320
What are you talking about?

289
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,319
How would you win the lottery?

290
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,239
What would you do with a million dollars?

291
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,560
Don't you see I'm hard at work?

292
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,559
We can talk nonsense at home.

293
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,639
What would you do with a million dollars?

294
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,360
There's a lot I'd like to do.

295
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,079
I'd buy clothes and handbags...

296
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,759
- and shoes.
- Okay.

297
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,280
I'll buy you all that.

298
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,969
I owe you so much.

299
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,320
Today, I'll make it up to you.

300
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,870
What about this?

301
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,590
It's lovely.

302
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,649
It's pretty, but...

303
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,830
Okay. We'll buy this, too.

304
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,670
Are you going to buy all that?

305
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,030
The clothes here cost a fortune.

306
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,470
I have loads of money.

307
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,079
- What about this?
- Are you in trouble?

308
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,070
Beep, wrong answer.

309
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,070
That'll be 8,370 dollars.

310
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,190
No way. What did we get that's so expensive?

311
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,670
Just a moment.

312
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,190
Forget it, Eul.

313
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,630
This scarf. Just get me this scarf.

314
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,150
Don't be silly.

315
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,359
I know what I'm doing.

316
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,910
This store only sells high-quality items.

317
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,670
We'll take everything.

318
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,950
Are you crazy?

319
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,710
People like us can never afford this.

320
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,150
Why not?

321
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,870
In this world,

322
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,190
those with money are those who rule.

323
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,710
- I'll pay with this.
- Sure.

324
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,350
Don't worry, it's not a forgery.

325
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,590
It really is a million dollars.

326
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,110
Stop what you're doing.

327
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,230
I apologise, Miss.

328
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,670
We cannot...

329
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,670
accept this as payment.

330
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,230
Why not?

331
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,910
That's not paper. It's money.

332
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,030
- I'll pay for it.
- Hyun Woo.

333
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,990
He isn't Hyun Woo.

334
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,110
He's Choi Ji Tae.

335
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,150
He's Choi Hyun Joon's son.

336
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,750
He lied to us.

337
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,310
What are you talking about?

338
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,679
Put it on my card.

339
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,150
No, don't.

340
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,590
Leave us alone and go back to your fiancée.

341
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,919
Take this...

342
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,710
right back to my mother.

343
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,199
How dare you sell me.

344
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,870
Am I worth only a million dollars?

345
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,950
And do you think I'm the only one you sold out?

346
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,350
What about your father?

347
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,550
If you want to do it properly,

348
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,230
take everything my parents have.

349
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,990
Then you'll be even!

350
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,950
It seems like you've done this before.

351
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,870
Eul trips often.

352
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,950
She always sprains her ankle.

353
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,470
That's enough.

354
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,150
I think I can walk.

355
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,990
Are you sure you can walk?

356
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,070
Would you mind driving me?

357
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,070
My ankle hurts when I step on the pedals.

358
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,230
Thank you.

359
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,030
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

360
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,790
It's just a sprain. I'll be fine after a while.

361
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,310
The ice pack...

362
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,030
was a huge help.

363
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,990
What do you think of me?

364
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,950
Am I charming?

365
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,590
I guess so.

366
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,590
As much as your love, Eul?

367
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,390
You and Eul...

368
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,150
have different charms.

369
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,710
Would you consider seducing me?

370
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,990
You're engaged.

371
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,750
My fiancé only has eyes for Eul.

372
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,710
He even broke off our engagement.

373
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,310
I'm sure you heard already.

374
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,270
It seems like Eul still only has eyes for you,

375
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,470
but Ji Tae still likes her even when he knows that.

376
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,670
I want to steal you away from her.

377
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,870
I want to make her...

378
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,150
feel the pain I felt.

379
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,399
I also want Ji Tae to realise...

380
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,630
what a great woman he lost.

381
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,070
Could I do that?

382
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,630
I don't have to carry you upstairs, do I?

383
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,470
I can't have photos of me carrying you in the papers.

384
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,310
I know that.

385
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,929
The key's in the car, so the valet can get to it.

386
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,990
I wish you a speedy recovery.

387
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,990
You didn't give me an answer.

388
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,270
I want to steal you away from Eul.

389
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,510
Could I do that?

390
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,350
No.

391
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,990
I don't think you can.

393
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,689
Sorry, Sir.

394
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,630
Could you do a U-turn at the traffic lights?

395
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,150
Why isn't she picking up? She knows I'll be worried.

396
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,950
Eul.

397
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,929
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

398
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,150
Help me with these.

399
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,249
Did you go shopping?

400
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,310
I had the cheque split into 100-dollar bills.

401
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,670
- Come and help me.
- You're crazy.

402
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,910
You've lost your mind.

403
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,070
Thank you, Sir.

404
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,649
Everything here is for you.

405
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,150
That's for Jik.

406
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,529
The dress you liked but said was too expensive...

407
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,989
I bought that, too. Try it upstairs.

408
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,070
Are you even human?

409
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,390
Are you a human being?

410
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,789
Of course I am. Am I a doll, then?

411
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,270
You're unbelievable.

412
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,150
You sold out your dad.

413
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,110
You got it from KJ Group in exchange for backing down.

414
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,999
Yes, that's how I got the money.

415
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,889
I sold out my dad and Ji Tae. So what?

416
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,129
What's wrong with you?

417
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,950
Refusing the money won't bring my dad back,

418
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,239
and we can't catch the real killer.

419
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,639
No one out there will help me out.

420
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,449
Why can't I take the money? What's wrong with that?

421
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,289
This is still wrong.

422
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,319
I don't stand a chance.

423
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,539
Should I keep fighting?

424
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,279
Should I go to the police station, court and then jail?

425
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,109
Must I stay on the run from loan sharks forever?

426
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,070
You still shouldn't have taken their money.

427
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,589
What would your dad say?

428
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,150
He'd say I did well.

429
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,629
I never lived up to my dad's expectations.

430
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,829
He always said I was too busy looking out for others...

431
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,240
and that I'll never manage to survive the cruel world.

432
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,309
Now he can rest in peace.

433
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,110
You really lost it.

434
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,589
How can you say that?

435
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,669
I'll send Jik to college and then abroad.

436
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,150
He can do everything everyone else does.

437
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,030
Are you jealous?

438
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,760
Are you envious that the poor girl suddenly got rich?

439
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,670
It's just money.

440
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,030
You've changed, Eul.

441
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,279
You weren't like this.

442
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,910
I'll buy a house and move out of your place.

443
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,729
Jik and I will live in a mansion.

444
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,350
Fine. Move out.

445
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,030
I don't need such shallow trash for a friend! Get out!

446
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,350
Do you think I won't?

447
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,240
I'll stay in a five-star hotel, okay?

448
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,720
Jeong Eun's a quick learner.

449
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,259
I knew she was a good cook, but she's smart, too.

450
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,209
She learned about investments and how we do things...

451
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,070
in such a short time.

452
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,790
All the executives are impressed that...

453
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,470
Who am I talking to?

454
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,470
Honey.

455
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,839
- What?
- Were you listening?

456
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,910
What?

457
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,430
What did you say?

458
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:30,390
Was I talking to myself?

459
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,720
Sorry. I was thinking about something else.

460
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,240
What did you say?

461
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,030
- Ha Ru.
- Just a moment.

462
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,670
Read your texts, will you?

463
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,790
Haven't you heard about that?

464
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,159
Ji Tae.

465
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,190
Hey, Ji Tae.

466
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,989
I'll get you some food.

467
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,030
Thanks.

468
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,590
"Director Yoon..."

469
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,190
"was given a title she doesn't deserve."

470
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,950
That's what people say behind your back.

471
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,070
That's what everyone said when you were made director.

472
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,350
"Should a young man be given such a lofty position..."

473
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,950
"just because he's the chairwoman's son?"

474
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,550
All that...

475
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:24,720
disappeared when you proved yourself.

476
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,280
It's been a while.

477
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,590
I haven't seen you at the dinner table in a month.

478
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,550
Cut Jeong Eun loose.

479
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,150
I will never go back to her.

480
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,470
You're keeping her hostage.

481
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,870
Stop doing that.

482
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,030
Please.

483
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,030
Where does it hurt?

484
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,510
It must be hard because it's new to you.

485
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,990
Mum gave Eul a million dollars.

486
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,589
How far will she go...

487
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,590
Did she...

488
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,990
refuse the money?

489
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,190
"You got me wrong."

490
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,430
"Do you think I'd give up for money?"

491
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,390
Did she yell and insult your mum...

492
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,720
and leave the money?

493
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,070
She accepted her fate.

494
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,510
What are you trying to protect by stooping so low?

495
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,390
Get some rest.

497
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,639
Hi.

498
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,280
Is this Hyun Woo's... No.

499
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,550
Is this Mr Choi Ji Tae's number?

500
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,110
Yes.

501
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,079
It's me, Na Ri.

502
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,590
Is being rich a right?

503
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,550
Does being rich mean you can belittle people?

504
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,670
Na Ri.

505
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:22,390
Eul never was normal,

506
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,910
but she wasn't that weird, either.

507
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,830
Your money...

508
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,280
turned her into a monster.

509
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,089
Bring her back!

510
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,910
I want the old Eul back!

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,190

- What?

What if...

520
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,510
I had stayed with Hyun Joon and not run away?

521
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,590
What would have happened to him?

522
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,240
I guess...

523
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,830
you'd have had a few more kids...

524
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,280
and lived with them happily ever after.

525
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,470
If I'd stayed with him instead of running away,

526
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,510
would he have not...

527
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,720
become the horrible man he is, like Joon Young said?

528
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,350
If you miss him,

529
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,070
steal him back.

530
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,030
The look on his face told me that...

531
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,910
he'd leave everything for you if you asked him to.

532
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,350
I feel so sorry for Joon Young.

533
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,190
Because of what his father did,

534
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,110
he can't be with the girl he loves.

535
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,390

Be quiet, old man!

Dad.

549
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,630
I just called you.

550
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,230
You did nothing wrong.

551
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,110
You did nothing wrong, Eul.

552
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,910
Eul.

553
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,209
What are you doing here?

554
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,630
You said you'd go to a five-star hotel.

555
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,350
Mum.

556
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,630
Shall I give up everything else...

557
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,750
and just do what I want before I die?

558
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,910
I'll hold Eul's hand...

559
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,670
and kiss her.

560
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,470
I'll hug her tiny shoulders warmly.

561
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,710
We'll watch movies...

562
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,430
and go travelling.

563
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:07,630
We'll laugh...

564
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,310
and be happy.

565
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,550
Shall I do that?

566
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,030
It's not like I need anyone's permission.

569
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,700
I can't concentrate when you're around.

570
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,300
But...

571
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,180
why are you studying this?

572
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,260
I'm studying to become a public official.

573
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,940
I need money.

574
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,900
Gosh.

575
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,540
Does that mean we won't be going to the same college?

576
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,940
Can you even get into a college in Seoul?

577
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,820
Fine. My brain sucks at studying. Happy now?

578
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,700
Ha Ru.

579
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,879
Are you still a member of Joon Young's fan club?

580
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,980
I quit.

581
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,980
And I got told off by the other members.

582
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,420
I got cursed enough to last a lifetime.

583
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,260
Are you jealous?

584
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,700
As if.

585
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,300
I'm worried you might not get into college again.

586
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,940
You're too old to be a fan-girl.

587
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,159
Is that it?

588
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,959
I can't let you worry, can I?

589
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,460
I'll study really hard and get into college.

590
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,260
This question is about substituting.

594
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,079
That equals 2 log 3x.

595

If we were to substitute that with A...

I cooked you some hangover soup, you brat.

603
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,620
Why was I sleeping outside her door?

604
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,780
Did I come home drunk?

I'll take this.

It's a birthday present, so please wrap it up nicely.

Yes, Sir. I'll get you a new pair.

This way, please.

You have a guest.

618
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,700
Today's my birthday, and I have no one to eat with.

00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,620
Take a seat.

620
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,820
- Can I take your coat?
- No, it's fine.

Yes, Ma'am.

I manage this restaurant.

625
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,559
I wanted to see you in private,

626
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,260
so I told them not to accept any guests.

627
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,700
Do you know who I am?

Although, because of you there was no engagement.

637

And now I have to eat alone on my birthday.

- Other than that.

Yes. She's with me.

00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,109
