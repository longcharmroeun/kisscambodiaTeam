00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,100
Eul. Noh Eul.

4
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Who are you?

5
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,220
Don't you recognise me? I'm Joon Young's manager.

6
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,540
Right.

7
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,100
Why...

8
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,140
am I here?

9
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,190
That's what I want to ask you.

10
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,340
I was on a blind date...

11
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,740
when Joon Young called me to run over here immediately.

12
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,540
He said he'd fire me if I didn't come.

13
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,100
And when I got here, you were lying here.

14
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,140
Where's Joon Young?

15
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,420
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,260
You look great.

00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,740
(HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOO NA. FROM JOON YOUNG)

18
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,860
(HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOO NA. FROM JOON YOUNG)

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,420
Tell him to come himself to wish me a happy birthday.

20
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,820
Tell him to bring the flowers himself, too.

21
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,860
You know that Joon Young doesn't party.

22
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,620
Look! It's Shin Joon Young.

23
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,420
- It's Shin Joon Young.
- He's here.

24
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,420
- Wow, this is awesome.
- He came.

25
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,300
Joon Young.

26
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,420
- Look at him.
- It's Shin Joon Young.

27
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,180
I'm sorry for being late. Happy birthday.

28
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,940
If you're really sorry, sing me a song.

29
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,980
I want to hear you sing a song.

30
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
If Na Ri dies, I'll kill you.

31
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,980
Our country is a mess...

32
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,900
because jerks like you want to be prosecutors.

33
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,740
I know that you probably are...

34
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,150
very annoyed with me, but I'm desperate, too.

35
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,780
Did you change your mind?

36
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,060
- Is that why you're back?
- Don't you recognise me?

37
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,270
Do you not recognise me?

38
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
I do.

39
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,460
You scumbag.

40
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,380
Thanks for this.

41
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,150
It'll come in handy.

42
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,740
- What?
- Why did he stop?

43
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,180
- What is it?
- What happened?

44
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,260
- What was that?
- What's going on?

45
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,620
Why did he stop?

46
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,420
Joon Young.

47
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,700
What was that? What happened?

48
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm sorry. I'll buy you dinner next time.

49
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,300
Let me go with you.

50
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,900
I want to be with you tonight, Joon Young.

51
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,460
Let's leave together.

52
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,460
I did nothing to be responsible of you.

53
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,220
And I never led you on.

54
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,660
- Joon Young.
- Don't overreact.

55
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Yoo Na.

56
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,740
You are nothing but a colleague to me.

57
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,580
Why did you come to my party, then?

58
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,380
My head was about to burst because of this girl.

59
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,940
I thought this party would distract me.

60
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,660
But I was wrong.

61
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,460
My goodness.

62
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,340
You can't leave like this. You aren't well yet.

63
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,580
It's okay. I'm fine.

64
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,660
You're not okay.

65
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,700
You're trying to sue Joon Young after leaving, right?

66
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
How low do you think of me, Sir?

67
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,740
Don't call me "Sir". I'm not that old.

68
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,660
Don't post anything on social media...

69
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,980
about what happened with Joon Young.

70
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,300
Instead, take this money.

71
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,140
You like money, right?

72
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,540
You got fired from your last job by taking bribes.

73
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,420
People are watching. Don't do that here.

74
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,700
This isn't a bribe. You gave me this...

75
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,540
to get lost, right?

76
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,740
My goodness, you don't even look that old.

77
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,060
How can you be so bold and blunt?

78
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,340
I have 950 dollars.

79
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,180
You took 50 dollars out, didn't you?

80
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,940
No, it's...

81
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,300
How low do you think of me?

82
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,060
It's not like that.

83
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,780
I'm telling you, I didn't.

84
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,260
Do you know what impudence is?

85
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,220
Of course. That's my nickname.

86
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,140
Have you ever measured how impudent you are?

87
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,580
You got your money, and now you even want a ride.

88
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,060
It's not easy to live such a bold life.

89
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,100
That's my drink.

90
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,300
How can you not even ask...

91
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,740
if you can have a sip?

92
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,780
You were going to throw it out anyway.

93
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,220
It's already flat. It tastes awful.

94
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,500
I wasn't going to throw it out.

95
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,340
I was going to drink it.

96
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,460
You can either buy me a new one, or spit it out.

97
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,860
Wow, you're one of a kind.

98
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,540
I lose. You win.

99
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,780
What are you doing? Why are you taking my stuff?

100
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,060
Then hurry up and pay us back.

101
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm doing the best I can.

102
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,620
How will you pay everything back at this rate?

103
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,060
We'll probably die before you pay it all back.

104
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,980
Take this, and give me my computer.

105
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,100
My brother can't take online classes...

106
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,820
We just took your deposit from your landlord.

107
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,430
- Who says you can?
- I do.

108
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,700
Then what about us?

109
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,550
Where will my brother and I live?

110
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,980
Why are you asking me?

111
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,820
You can't do this all of a sudden.

112
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,020
Hey, you shouldn't have borrowed money, then.

113
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,700
Next time, I won't leave like this.

114
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,980
I'll bring the paper that says you gave up...

115
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,550
- the rights to your body.
- Sure, go ahead.

116
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,620
You can just kill me.

117
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,460
Who are you? Are you her friend?

118
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,620
No, I saw her for the first time today.

119
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,900
Right?

120
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,580
Goodbye, then. Take care.

121
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,190
How can you ignore your son who's sleeping out here?

122
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,310
I don't know what you're talking about.

123
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,500
My son died five years ago.

124
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,020
- Mum.
- My son died a long time ago.

125
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,550
I'm not your mum.

126
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,860
Come play with me, Mum.

127
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,940
Play with me.

128
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,900
Young man.

129
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,500
- Are you ill?
- Yes, I am.

130
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,780
So come play with me.

131
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,340
Mum.

132
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,020
Gook Young, where are you?

133
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,180
Please come and take this fool away from me.

134
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,260
You'll see who it is once you get here.

135
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,740
(I CAN PASS THE BAR EXAM WHILE I'M IN SCHOOL.)

136
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,820
What a fool.

137
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,780
My goodness. Why did you visit your mum?

138
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,780
Did you think she would welcome you with open arms?

139
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,500
I just did. I needed to get things off of my head.

140
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,180
What?

141
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,340
My mum is the one who makes me think the most.

142
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,660
So did you go and make your mum feel frustrated...

143
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,220
just to get things off of your head?

144
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,420
Hey, that crazy girl spat in that coke.

145
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,020
Did you just drink it?

146
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,060
You have a strong stomach.

147
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,380
Then do you want me to throw up in the car?

148
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,220
Stop talking nonsense.

149
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,140
By the way,

150
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,580
it looked like that crazy girl had a miserable life.

151
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,940
I'm going to sleep, so be quiet and drive.

152
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,020
I'm just saying.

153
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,700
I really didn't like her at first, either.

154
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,540
But I understood her after I saw the way she lived.

155
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,220
I understood why she had to be like that.

156
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,100
A while ago, these moneylenders came, threatened her,

157
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,620
and they even took away the deposit from her house.

158
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,260
Can't you just film the documentary for her sake?

159
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,860
It's not like you'll lose anything from filming that.

160
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,260
Just do it to save her life.

161
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,460
It looked like she was going to a bridge in Han River.

162
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,140
What if she jumped in and died already?

163
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,300
Why don't you search for online articles?

164
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,420
I told you, I want to sleep.

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,700
I told you to be quiet!

166
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,580
- Get off.
- Fine.

167
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,740
- I'll be quiet.
- Get off!

168
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,220
Hey, this isn't your car.

169
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,300
It's my car.

170
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,220
You are really cruel. Do you know that?

171
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,900
You're an awful man.

172
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,740
Hey, I need my wallet!

173
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,140
Give me my wallet!

174
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,700
Hey, it's me.

175
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,460
Yes. Let's grab a drink.

176
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,860
Where are you?

177
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,300
Okay.

178
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,540
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

179
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,540
See you soon.

180
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,380
I really didn't like her at first, either.

181
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,540
But I understood her after I saw the way she lived.

182
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,740
I understood why she had to be like that.

183
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,700
A while ago, these moneylenders came, threatened her,

184
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,500
and they even took away the deposit from her house.

185
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,900
It looked like she was going to a bridge in Han River.

186
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,060
What if she jumped in and died already?

187
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,740

Aren't you Shin Joon Young?

192
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,780
Hey, I'm a huge fan of yours.

193
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,740
Hey, wait. Can you take a picture with me?

194
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,140
Hey, wait. I really like you.

195
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,100
What? A bridge?

196
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,020

200
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,750
Have you eaten?

201
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,340
I'm eating right now.

202
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,380
What are you eating?

203
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Meat.

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,750
Stop lying.

205
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,580
You're eating bread again, aren't you?

206
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,820
You're a student, so you should stay healthy.

207
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,700
Why aren't you eating rice?

208
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,820
Other kids take wild ginseng, herbal medicine and more.

209
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,460
You at least need to eat some rice.

210
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,340
My gosh, you're nagging again.

211
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,020

He's not picking up the video call.

My goodness.

217
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,020
He's really eating meat.

Hey.

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,510
Have you been eating all right? My goodness.

220
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,380
- Are we good?
- You should've asked him...

221
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,180
to buy you beef, not pork.

222
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,900
It's not like he owes us anything.

223
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,580
Don't be so cheap.

224
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,700
He's already low on money.

225
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,620
I have enough to buy you two a meal.

226
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,940
Eul, I'll take care of Jik's meals,

227
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,940
so make sure you eat too, okay?

228
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,420
Thanks, Ji Tae.

229
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,990
He'll say it's fine, but buy him more than one serving.

230
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,940
Jik loves meat, so buy him...

- a lot of...
- Are you a beggar?

232
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,940
- Jik.
- I know things aren't great,

233
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,620
but can you at least keep a little bit of pride?

234
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,940
You're embarrassing.

235
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,660
- What was that?
- It's hard to believe,

236
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,220
but my sister really wasn't like this before.

237
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,060
She had her pride.

238
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,510
She was really cool and awesome, you know.

239
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,510

Yes, she is. Have some.

We watched a movie and had dinner together.

315
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,540
I only did that because...

316
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,780
you said you'd lend me money if I did.

Yes.

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,340
I think we do.

I once dated a guy who looked like Zo In Sung.

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,180
I used to look like Son Ye Jin, too.

332
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,780
We used to date.

333
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,940
And very passionately at that.

334
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,300
How sad is this?

335
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,020

336
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,020
you'd become so glamorous,

337
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,980
I would never have let you go.

338
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,140
People say that I grew up very ugly.

339
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,620
Do you think so?

340
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,060
I'm not sure.

341
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,620
Do they say that?

342
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,260
I did become a little sexy, but don't I look the same?

343
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,540
I think you're right.

344
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,780
Didn't it look like that guy was interested in me...

345
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,780
once he heard that we used to date?

346
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,820
By the way,

347
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,420
when did Eul come to Seoul?

348
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,700
Did you meet her?

349
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,500
Yes. She was working for an election camp.

350
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,740
Does she do that now?

351
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,340
She hasn't got any choices to make.

352
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,460
She'll do anything for money.

353
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,300
What about college?

354
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,380
She can't go to college.

355
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,340
She has to look after her brother and make a living.

356
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Why?

357
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,580
Are you trying to be mean to her again...

358
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,900
like you were in high school?

359
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,140
Don't do that.

360
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,220
She already has a million people coming after her.

361
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,940
They're always on her back and bothering her.

362
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,020
So just leave her alone.

363
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,740
Don't bother her, okay?

365
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,340
Dear beloved citizens,

366
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,380
Candidate Choi Hyun Joon is...

367
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,620
the most trustworthy,

368
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,860
righteous, honest, and he's a man of dignity.

369
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,660
- Yes!
- Let's go!

370
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,620
- All right!
- Go!

371
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,500
As you all know,

372
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,380
he also gave...

373
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,180
one of his kidneys for his sick wife.

374
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,940
He is the most romantic and devoted husband.

375
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,060
- Choi Hyun Joon is the best!
- Yes!

376
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,700
As you can see from these stories,

377
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,260
he is someone who will love his country and people,

378
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,780
and he's someone who will work hard for his country.

381
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,820
- Choi Hyun Joon!
- Choi Hyun Joon!

382
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,140
Are you okay?

383
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,780
- I'm fine.
- Are you hurt?

384
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,460
You don't look okay.

385
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,140
I'll get some medicine. Will you wait?

386
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,460
It's okay, I'm fine.

387
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,300
You should look at where you're going.

388
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,540
Ha Ru.

389
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,860
I'm sorry for startling you.

390
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,260
Are you really okay?

391
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,820
Yes, of course.

392
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,500
It's your fault, too. You should've been more careful.

393
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,300
He's so handsome.

394
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,420
Ji Tae, I want to marry him.

395
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
Ji Tae.

396
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,500
Long time no see.

397
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,500
- It's Jeong Eun.
- Are you Ha Ru?

398
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,220
You became such a lady, Ha Ru.

399
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,260
I thought you were in New York.

400
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,900
I came back yesterday to help with your dad's election.

401
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,060
My dad thought I should do that.

402
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:50,300
- Choi Hyun Joon!
- Choi Hyun Joon!

403
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,020
When will you propose to me?

404
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,060
It looks like our parents are talking about it.

405
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,180
My goodness.

406
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,620
Are you marrying Jeong Eun?

407
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,460
It looks like the victim's daughter...

408
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,140
remembers Jeong Eun's license plate number.

409
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,540
So what? Are you going to let Jeong Eun's life...

410
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,140
end here as a criminal?

411
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,540
There are three witnesses.

412
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,020
That's why I ran over to you like an insane person.

413
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,340
If I fall,

414
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,740
it won't be so great for you, either.

415
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,060
Your in-law's company...

416
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,420
would've gone down already if it wasn't for me.

417
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,820
I know.

418
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,260
My wife and I are always grateful.

419
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,180
I don't need your grateful heart.

420
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,020
Humans are different from animals...

421
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,020
because they know when to pay back their favours.

422
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,860
Am I wrong?

- Vote for number one.
- Please vote.

447
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,460
Your fake eyelash fell off.

448
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,140
I see.

449
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,940
And don't work too hard. Number one is a bad guy.

450

454
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,660
I will make sure to fix it. So tell me.

455
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,870
Your eyes, nose, mouth, ears,

456

voice, height, personality and blood type.

457
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,940
Fine. I will fix everything.

458
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,940
Can we really start dating when I do?

459
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,020
I have a girlfriend.

460
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,940
She's a real feisty one.

461
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,220
You'll probably get buried alive for hitting on me.

462
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,740
You don't have a girlfriend.

463
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,540
I'm his girlfriend.

464
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,140
Honey, are your classes over?

465
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,060
You're so handsome.

466
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,100
It's only been 12 hours...

467
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,390
since I last saw you, but I missed you so much.

468
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,910
I missed you a hundred times more than you did.

469
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,140
I missed you so much...

470
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,140
that my eyes melted down.

471
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,910
Eyes.

472
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Nose.

00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Ears.

475
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,780
How can you be so perfect?

476
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,500
There's nothing I'd change on you.

477
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,540
Hey.

478
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,140
Hey, you should be careful.

479
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,500
Joon Young is mine.

480
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,390
If you hit on him ever again,

481
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,980
you'll have your next meal in your next life.

482
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,660
Do you get it?

483
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,740
Do you?

484
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,820
I must be crazy.

485
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,260
This is insane.

486
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm crazy.

487
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Who's crazy?

488
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,660
Me. I'm the crazy girl.

489
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,300
What am I doing with you?

490
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,910
You shouldn't have committed a crime, then.

491
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,260
I think I did enough for the day. I'm going home.

492
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,340
I couldn't sleep during the finals. Give me 10 minutes.

493
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,820
No way.

494
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,060
Among the 99 times, I'll count this as 2.

495
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,340
In that case, make it three.

496
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,940
Count this as three.

497
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
Okay.

498
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,700
I did well today, so make it four.

499
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,780
- Take out four today.
- Are you kidding me?

I suddenly wanted to call Na Ri and tell her this.

Na Ri.

I can't keep that promise I made.

I will keep being mean to Eul.

I will keep on making fun of her.

I will bother her.

532
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,220
You should go to a hospital, then.

Be quiet.

534
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,060
I'll be okay.

535
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,780
You should go and study.

536
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,100
Let's go to the hospital. Get on my back.

537
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,860
That's unnecessary. I'll be fine.

00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,060
Come here.

542
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
Come over here.

543
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,780
My goodness.

544
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,980
Are you insane?

545
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,020
You should be keeping him away from this place.

546
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,340
How can you drag him here?

547
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,700
I did it on purpose.

548
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,660
I wanted him to meet Young Ok and Joon Young.

549
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,140
Joon Young grew up so well.

550
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,740
It's time that he met his father.

551
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,220
Who are you to decide that?

552
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,140
Why are you meddling in their business?

553
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,180
Think about how startled Young Ok would be.

554
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,620
If she has a heart attack, you'll die in my hands.

555
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,580
What are you saying?

556
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,420
Is Young Ok more precious than your twin sister?

557
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,220
If she's so precious to you, why don't you ask her out?

558
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:49,700
"Young Ok, forget about Hyun Joon and live with me."

559
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,460
You fool. I'm going to kill you.

560
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,700
How dare you speak of my precious Young Ok like that?

561
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,020
Your precious Young Ok?

562
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,460
Are you...

563
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,820
What?

564
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,180
Eat up.

565
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,020
Excuse me, young man.

566
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Wait a second.

567
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,980
I think we've met before.

568
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,780
Yes, I think so, too.

569
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,340
- Who's that?
- My mother is ill.

570
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,820
Oh, no. You should hurry.

571
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,780
Right.

572
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,740
My car is out in the front. If you need...

573
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,340
No, thanks. It's all right.

574
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,260
Who is that?

575
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,300
He helped me out once.

576
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,980
He said he'd come visit me when he passes the bar exam.

577
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,540
It looks like his life isn't easy.

578
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,540
Lift your head up, Mum.

579
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,620
Mr Choi isn't here, so you can lift your head up.

580
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,420
I went to meet...

581
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
Prosecutor Choi Hyun Joon a long time ago.

582
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,620
I told him that...

583
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,340
I'd come back to visit him...

584
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,300
once I pass my bar exam.

585
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,620
I will let you boast about me to him...

586
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,900
before this life is over, okay?

587
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,180
"I..."

588
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,180
"raised your son well like you..."

589
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,740
"without any of your help."

590
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,660
I'll let you say that.

591
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Okay.

592
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,580
When something like this...

593
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,540
happens again in your next life, don't run away.

594
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,260
There are no barriers to love.

595
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,820
That's so old and tacky.

596
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,060
Get in.

597
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,780
What is this?

598
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,500
Choi Hyun Joon.

599
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,620
This is the real side of that hypocrite.

600
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,380
How did you tape this?

601
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,740
I caught him while I was working as a driver.

602
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,900
I heard he was crazy for that bar hostess,

603
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,700
so I hid with this camera.

604
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,140
What will you do with it?

605
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,660
He's not someone you can fight.

606
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,260
You'll get hurt.

607
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,700
Still, I'm my father's daughter.

608
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,180
I must do anything and everything.

609
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,780
If I run away, no one will find out the truth.

I don't know if you remember,

628

but I am the daughter of Noh Jang Soo...

who died in a hit-and-run accident five years ago.

630

631
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,580
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,700
You don't?

633
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,020

You're probably too dumb to remember,

but that's when you went to meet Madam Song at the bar.

638

Who is it?

639
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,980
You even went to that hostess bar the day after...

640
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,620
your wife had her kidney transplant.

641
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,860
The most devoted husband? No way.

642
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,620
Stop deceiving innocent citizens,

643
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,060
and resign from the election.

644
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,380
This country will be out of hope...

645
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,580
if someone like you becomes a congressman.

646
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,700
If you apologise...

647
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,340
and admit to your faults, I will stop right here.

00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,820
Who was it?

655
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,860
It's nothing.

656
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,540

00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,180
Can you connect me to KBC Broadcast?

00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,700

00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,340
Eul.

664
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,660
Eul, you can't die.

665
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,060
- Calm down.
- Eul!

666
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,580
When I was young, my mum took me to church...

667
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,260
and prayed a hundred prayers...

668
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,500
to God.

669
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,660
And she asked me...

670
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,260
to say my prayers,

671
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,740
saying that God will be listening.

672
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,940
Her pressure is dropping.

673
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,140
But I replied by saying there is no such thing...

674
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,500
and refused to pray.

675
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,700
I am sorry.

676
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,260
I will believe that you exist.

677
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,820
So...

678
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,820
please let Eul live.

679
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,740
If you let her live,

680
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,900
I will give up...

681
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,940
all of my happiness.

682
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,620
Her vitals are unstable.

683
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,180
Prepare for CPR.

684
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,620
If you let her live,

685
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,340
I will give up...

686
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,540
the rest of my life.

687
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,780
You can take me...

688
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,260
and let...

689
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,540
Eul live.

690
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,020
Is life nonsense to you?

691
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,420
Is it so easy for you to die?

I'll do it, you crazy fool.

694
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,380
Let's do this, Eul.

695
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,580
Seeing you again will hurt me...

696
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,260
more than opening up my wounds again...

697
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,740
and stabbing it with a knife,

698
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,700
but let's see what happens to us.

699
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,940

I think you're mistaken, Doctor.

702
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,660
She wants to look presentable to you.

703
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,700
Are you telling me to hit on him?

704
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,300
I'm going there to work.

705
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,780
Let's call off the documentary.

706
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,060
Forget about our engagement. Let's get married.

707
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,540
You don't even love me.

708
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,420
If you call it off again, she'll go crazy.

709
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,620
She'll probably take out a knife and cause a scene.

710
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,940
Is fainting your hobby?

711
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,380
- What do you want?
- A hundred thousand dollars.

712
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,180
Just that much? I can give you a million dollars.

713
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,740
How much longer do I have to live?

714
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,940
Do I have 6 months? Or do I have 3 months?

715
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,140
Gosh.
