00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,439
(2006)

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,679
Who is it?

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,600
Noh Eul from the hotteok stall.

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,639
- Thank you.
- Grandma.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,600
- Don't freeze to death to look good.
- I'm fine.

7
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
What will you be left with if you give me all this?

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,259
I'm boiling hot.

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,540
I feel terrible now.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,099
I'll get the rest of the boxes.

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,380
Go and enjoy your date with the dry cleaners.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,580
You look way too good to just go straight home.

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,260
3 dollars 10 cents in total.

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,660
Mr Handsome, you have a runny nose.

15
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,340
Blow your nose.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,020
There you go.

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,149
You shouldn't pay.

18
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,630
I told you that anything you want is yours.

19
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,059
Go on home. Don't make your dad wait.

20
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,750
- Thank you.
- Wait.

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,409
You're too generous.

22
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,510
Are you a saint?

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,149
Are we rich? Does money grow on trees?

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,589
Do you know how much debt we're in?

25
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,969
His dad got hurt at a construction site and can't work.

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,349
Do you need his money?

27
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,790
I do. I desperately do.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,409
Your own dad can't afford to buy new clothes.

29
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,030
I lost so much weight because I barely eat...

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,559
If we could get the money you practically gave away,

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,589
I wouldn't have to sell food in the freezing cold.

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,389
I'd be in a building with central heating...

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,369
- sitting in a chair...
- Eul. Noh Eul!

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,729
What happened now?

35
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,509
The bullies called Moon Hee to the gym to beat her up.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,749
How dare they want to beat her up?

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,710
- I should just...
- Stop.

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,659
You can't go.

39
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,309
Didn't I tell you not to get involved...

40
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,699
in a stranger's business?

41
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,910
She isn't a stranger.

42
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,310
Moon Hee's my friend.

43
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,079
- Let's go.
- Okay.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,230
Eul. Eul.

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,919
Do you think you're a cop? Or Wonder Woman?

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,110
Try to care for me as much as you care for others!

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,910
What a brat.

48
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,110
I hope she slips on a sheet of ice.

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,409
(SHIN JOON YOUNG: 10-DAY SUSPENSION)

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,910
What's going on?

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,989
What happened?

52
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,349
A suspension? Why should he be suspended?

53
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,390
Ms Shin!

54
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,919
Sir. Why...

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,589
She's the mother of the student we just suspended.

56
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,150
What did Joon Young do wrong?

57
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,029
A group of boys tried to bully this girl,

58
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,189
so he stepped in and hit them to teach them a lesson.

59
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,349
He got hit as well.

60
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,550
You should reward him instead.

61
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,869
Why did you suspend him?

62
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,070
Ms Shin.

63
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,159
You're a witness, so tell them what you saw.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,070
Tell them Joon Young took the fall for helping you.

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,150
Tell them everything.

66
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,349
Why won't you speak?

67
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,269
Ms Shin, according to her statement,

68
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,709
the boys did not bother her at all.

69
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,219
They were just standing around talking...

70
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,430
when your son barged in and picked a fight.

71
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,590
How...

72
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,590
That's impossible.

73
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,550
Is that...

74
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,270
Is that really what you said?

75
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,270
Why did you lie?

76
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,990
Did your parents tell you to?

77
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,750
Instead of standing up...

78
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,919
for a poor widow's son who saved your life,

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,149
did you decide to defend the rich kids?

80
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,070
And hope you'd get something in return?

81
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,670
- Is that what you were told?
- Ms Shin.

82
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,430
You witch.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,920
You ungrateful brat! How dare you!

84
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,150
- Mummy...
- You can't do that to her!

85
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,800
Please...

86
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,550
cancel the punishment.

87
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,550
My son will become a prosecutor.

88
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,589
This punishment will remain on his records...

89
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,329
and that will ruin his chances and future.

90
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,670
I promise I will set him straight.

91
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,360
I will make sure he never throws a punch again.

92
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,689
Please...

93
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,430
Please take it back, Sir.

94
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,230
Please, Sir.

95
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,750
Hey.

96
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,469
Did you hear Joon Young got suspended?

97
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,790
It was his fault for getting involved.

98
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,849
- Can I ask you something?
- Did he just speak?

99
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,269
Don't you get it?

100
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,149
We are powerful people.

101
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,309
We are nobles that commoners like you must never touch.

102
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,390
So...

103
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,230
a nobody like me...

104
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,939
interrupted something...

105
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,950
you young masters of noble birth were planning.

106
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,409
Don't you think...

107
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,790
it shouldn't have ended with a suspension?

108
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,710
I thought...

109
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,399
I should...

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,359
utterly crush just one of you...

111
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,350
so I can get expelled instead.

112
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,790
Any volunteers?

113
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,149
Sit up straight.

114
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,289
You still haven't got your head on straight.

115
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,689
- What would it change if I did?
- What?

116
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,869
Would the others...

117
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,789
get punished equally regardless of who their dads are?

118
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,630
What? How dare you.

119
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,429
Because you were raised by a single mother,

120
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,990
I was trying to show you some pity...

121
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,830
Why show me pity?

122
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,429
- What right do you have?
- Let go.

123
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,149
What's wrong with you?

124
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,030
- I should just...
- Stop right there.

125
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,590
Stop that if you value your job and your life.

126
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,889
You're beating him like he's a drum.

127
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,429
If you keep beating one that hard, it'll break.

128
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,649
If you keep belittling and mocking him,

129
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,589
I will call his father over.

130
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,289
You wouldn't dare stay sitting if his dad showed up.

131
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,249
You'd be down on the floor...

132
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,029
begging him for your life and his forgiveness.

133
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,070
- Jeong Sik.
- Is that true?

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,950
Call the man so I can finally see him.

135
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,670
I wonder what he's doing...

136
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,349
when his son is such a mess.

137
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,069
- I'm quite curious.
- Very well, then.

138
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,150
He's incredibly busy working for the government.

139
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,149
But if he were to hear his son was getting hit,

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,949
he'd leave everything to come over.

141
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,369
- Stop it, Jeong Sik.
- Keep quiet.

142
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,369
Joon Young's father...

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,529
will crush the other kids' dads.

144
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,990
A member of the city council? A chief of police?

145
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,389
They're all dead!

146
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,790
I said stop it!

147
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,070
A dead man can't come here.

148
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,670
That's just nonsense.

149
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,909
DNA was found on a steel pipe at the suspect's factory.

150
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,369
Other than that of the seven victims we knew about,

151
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,030
we found the DNA of two more female victims.

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,839
We handed the samples over to...

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,959
Eat up.

154
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,200
So you can stay out of prison.

155
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,059
Don't lie about my dad again.

156
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,230
Well...

157
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,529
It might not be a lie.

158
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,029
This was not just a fire.

159
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,510
It was arson, a fire set to destroy evidence.

160
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,310
Do you have evidence to support that claim?

161
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,750
What if...

162
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,750
he were your father?

163
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,990
What if that famous prosecutor were your father?

164
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,150
I'll kill him.

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,080
He abandoned my mum and me.

166
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,470
And he's doing just fine.

167
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,609
- He's even on TV.
- It wasn't deliberate.

168
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,910
Your dad won't even know you exist.

169
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,110
Your mum hid the fact she was pregnant and ran away.

170
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,750
What do you mean?

171
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,200
I mean...

172
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,230
I just meant...

173
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,289
that could be a possibility, that's all.

174
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,510
You know...

175
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,550
I got a bit emotional and carried away.

176
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,310
I just blurted that out without thinking.

177
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,749
Where are you going? You need to eat.

178
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,390
I'll ask my mum.

179
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,710
- About what you said.
- Don't.

180
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,489
You know what she's like. If she heard what I said,

181
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,239
she'd go crazy and kill my whole family.

182
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,080
She'll kill both my kids, I know it.

183
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,910
Sit down.

184
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,390
(SENIOR PROSECUTOR CHOI HYUN JOON IS INVESTIGATING...)

185
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,390
Your father...

186
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,630
hid that he was studying law.

187
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,369
He worked as a waiter in a bar.

188
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,630
Your mum...

189
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,430
peeled fruit in the kitchen.

190
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,030
The two of them fell in love.

191
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,590
Your mother...

192
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,710
had barely graduated from middle school,

193
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,310
but she was incredibly pretty.

194
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,150
Joon Young.

195
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,910
If your mum...

196
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,350
finds out I told you this,

197
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,310
she will kill me, so don't tell her.

198
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,710
Okay?

199
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,089
Then, one day,

200
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,159
Choi Hyun Joon's older brother came by.

201
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,249
He said to your mum,

202
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,329
"Hyun Joon goes to the best university in Korea,"

203
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,630
"and he will become a prosecutor or a judge."

204
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,510
"He's not the kind of man a fruit-peeler"...

205
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,279
"with a middle-school degree should dream of dating."

206
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,390
Mum.

207
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,790
Your mum...

208
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,919
acts like she's all strong and fierce,

209
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,390
but do you know how soft she is inside?

210
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,070
She's also great at knowing where she stands.

211
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,950
If she had to die for your father, she would have.

212
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,910
What are you doing out here?

213
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,670
Were you waiting for me?

214
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,310
Why did they release a bully who beats up other people?

215
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,509
They should have locked you up and thrown away the key.

216
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,350
There were so many criminals, there was no room for me.

217
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,349
I can come back later.

218
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,430
What?

219
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,039
Did you skip dinner?

220
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,390
I'm hungry, too.

221
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,510
I don't have food to give you.

222
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,510
If you're hungry, ask a prison guard to feed you.

223
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,510
Prison guards work in prisons, not police stations.

224
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,870
What should I do with you?

225
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,990
Won't you offer your own son some?

226
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,139
You get the worst grades in your class,

227
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,110
but your mum insists on making you a prosecutor.

228
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,319
It's all...

229
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,150
because of your father.

230
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,630
She wants to make you...

231
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,150
a prosecutor and then introduce you to your dad.

232
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,270
She wants to show him that without his help,

233
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,470
she raised you well, to be just like him.

234
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,230
She wants to show off.

235
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,510
I don't want tutoring.

236
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,110
Fire the tutor tomorrow.

237
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,830
We pay 300 dollars a month in rent.

238
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,510
Why should we pay a tutor 1,500 a month?

239
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,789
Why did you help the girl?

240
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,270
Since when did you care so much about justice?

241
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,470
You wouldn't have cared even if someone died here.

242
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,870
Exactly.

243
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,110
I had lost my mind for a while.

244
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,790
I'd found out you worked at a bar to afford a tutor.

245
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,710
Gosh.

246
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,069
Forget about it. I'm just as dumb as you are.

247
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,030
No amount of tutoring can make me a prosecutor.

248
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,109
Fine. I won't care what you do with your life.

249
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,949
You can fight for a living,

250
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,750
or fight and end up in prison for years.

251
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,910
Do whatever you want. Jerk.

252
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,630
"Hello, I'm so glad that"...

253
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,830
"Thank you."

254
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,190
It's Shin Joon Young. I adore him.

255
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,430
Get out of my way.

256
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,030
Did you see that?

257
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,830
Who is that guy?

258
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,830
Do you get a lot of offers?

259
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,639
You'll find out if you sign with us...

260
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,510
that we're not like any other entertainment agencies.

261
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,030
If you'll spare me some time...

262
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,790
Hey.

263
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,990
Why did you ignore me?

264
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,920
I passed you seven letters asking you to see me.

265
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,640
You...

266
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,270
aren't my type.

267
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,550
You aren't mine, either.

268
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,489
Ever since you rejected her,

269
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,849
Na Ri stopped eating and drinking.

270
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,329
What will you do?

271
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,399
Must I do something?

272
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,749
Because of you, my friend won't eat or sleep...

273
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,830
What does that have to do with me?

274
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,549
She said she wants to die.

275
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,899
Let her die, then.

276
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,160
If she dies, I will kill you.

277
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,129
I'm telling you, it's serious.

278
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,470
She won't eat, sleep or go to school. She just cries.

279
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,670
Can't you help out?

280
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,230
Bring her back to health and then dump her.

281
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,950
- Just until she's ready to...
- Is this your job?

282
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,640
How much do you get for this?

283
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,470
Hey.

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,400
What are you doing?

286
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,230
I think you're sick.

287
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,990
Get some help.

288
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,670
Shall I call your parents?

289
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,160
Stop crying.

290
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,830
You need to eat.

291
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,070
I brought some of my dad's hotteok and tteokbokki.

292
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,070
I won't eat any.

293
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,969
Just let me...

294
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,270
waste away like this and then die.

295
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,809
Why do you want to die over a jerk like him?

296
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,550
Is he the only guy alive?

297
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,590
You're our famous neighbourhood beauty.

298
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,139
Shall I line up all the boys who like you?

299
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,230
I don't care unless it's Joon Young.

300
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,030
Eul, I envy you.

301
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,670
He isn't your type.

302
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,870
I envy you because can choose not to like him.

303
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,350
What are you doing here, getting your hair done?

304
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,350
I'm going to confess.

305
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,310
To whom? The boy you have a crush on?

306
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,510
- Make me look so pretty he'll fall for me.
- Got it.

307
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,510
Hello, pretty Na Ri.

308
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,659
Remember the pink dress you wore last time?

309
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,790
Can I borrow it for just three hours?

310
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,910
It's for an important occasion.

311
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,670
I might just end up getting married soon.

312
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,230
I'll tell you if you lend me the dress.

313
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,070
Okay, I'll come over for it in a bit.

My name is Noh Eul.

316
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,950
I liked you for a long time.

317
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,070
I know you're really popular with the other girls,

318
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,310
but I am your destiny.

319
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,430
You can't get away from...

320
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,990
I'm not actually going to say that.

You little brat.

324
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,990
Are you drunk?

325
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,510
Why would a high school kid get drunk?

326
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,950
Can't a girl try to be cute for her dad?

327
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
What now?

328
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,590
Do you need money?

329
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,030
Do you have a friend who can't pay her tuition?

330
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,509
Are we rich? Does money grow on trees?

331
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,550
Do you know how much debt we're in?

332
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,550
Dad.

333
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,910
Buy me a drink.

334
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,110
You've lost your mind. Go home and sleep.

335
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,190
I guess we're family after all.

336
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,630
He knows I lost my mind right away.

337
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,310
Did I wake you, Jik?

338
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,950
I'm waiting for Dad. It's a surprise.

339
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,790
I'll spend some time with Dad, so go back to...

340
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,470

349
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,910
Just a moment.

350
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,830
Is something wrong?

351
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,870
My daughter is in trouble.

352
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,110
I need your help.

353
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,310
- We have to close now.
- Okay.

355

356
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,339
Are you saying he hit my father?

357
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,630
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

358
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,070
No. It wasn't him.

359
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,679
My father was hit by a female driver.

360
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,449
In a red sports car with plate number Seoul-3G-3126.

361
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,830
I'm sorry. I deserve to die.

00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,790
You didn't hit my father! Why are you lying?

365
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,910
I'm just leaving the subway station.

366
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,670
I thought the roads would be too busy.

367
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,590
I left my car in the office parking lot.

368
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,629
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

369
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,710
Tell the chief prosecutor that for me.

370
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,270
Oh no.

371
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,350
It's raining.

372
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,710
Oh dear.

374
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,999
Are you going to Public Prosecutors' Office?

375
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,389
Yes. How do you know that?

376
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,009
You're a famous prosecutor.

377
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,430
I saw you on TV.

378
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,870
I want to...

379
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,990
become a prosecutor.

380
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,950
I plan...

381
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,030
to go to the university you went to.

382
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,990
You must do very well in school.

383
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,750
So-so.

384
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,510
Your parents must be proud.

385
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,870
You have a goal,

386
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,190
and you have enough determination to reach it.

387
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,190
I have children, too,

388
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,230
and kids these days are useless.

389
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,990
They have no goal or persistence...

390
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,990
and even less motivation.

391
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,550
I envy your parents.

392
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,190
The rain stopped.

393
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,310
It was just a passing shower.

394
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,270
Have a nice day, Sir.

395
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,990
Thank you.

396
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,590
I'd love to see you as a prosecutor one day.

397
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,350
Sure.

398
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,310
Hey.

399
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,329
I hate being in someone's debt.

400
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,470
Can you spare me 10 minutes?

401
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,750
Yes, I think I can.

402
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,190
She vandalised your car, Sir.

403
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,630
Did my car wrong you in any way?

404
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,609
I came here over 20 times,

405
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,790
but you avoided me with excuses that...

406
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,910
you were busy or not in.

407
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,950
I thought this would be the only way to get to see you.

408
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,150
- Send everyone out.
- Yes, Sir.

409
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,110
So,

410
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,790
why did you have to take such measures to see me?

411
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,910
My father's hit-and-run.

412
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,190
The case isn't closed.

413
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,590
You don't have the criminal.

414
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,430
The man who confessed didn't do it.

415
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,390
A rant like that won't really help.

416
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,910
Let's see.

417
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,830
In an organisation,

418
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,310
there are duties, responsibilities and hierarchies.

419
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,950
I don't know why you want to see me,

420
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,149
but I can't interfere with every detail.

421
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,710
The detective said so.

422
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,560
That everything changed after you interfered.

423
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,109
The suspect changed, the car changed,

424
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,470
the statements and the prosecutor in charge changed.

425
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,910
Will you give the detective a message for me?

426
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,270
If he has time to pen a novel,

427
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,909
he should focus on his job.

428
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,429
He thinks someone powerful is behind this.

429
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,439
That we can do nothing.

430
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,749
He said I can't win this fight,

431
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,789
so I should keep quiet and settle.

432
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,270
I don't have enough time to go on...

433
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,950
listening to a third-rate novel.

434
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,710
I'm sorry to send you away when you travelled so far.

435
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,670
I never told you...

436
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,710
where I live or where I'm from.

437
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,790
You knew who I was.

438
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,040
That's why you avoided me.

439
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,470
You hid the real criminal and covered up...

440
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,520
You're wearing a uniform I've never seen before.

441
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,110
I assumed you go to a school far from here.

442
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,710
Go home now.

443
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,110
You're my daughter's age, so I was being nice,

444
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,190
but this is where my patience ends.

445
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,990
I envy your parents.

446
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,670
Are you that happy?

447
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,229
Someone has been starving for days because of you,

448
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,040
- but you seem happy.
- Haven't you seen a doctor?

449
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,369
Someone as dangerous as you shouldn't be unsupervised.

450
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,710
Why on earth does she like you?

451
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,870
I'd have snapped both her legs if she were my daughter.

452
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,229
Our country is a mess...

453
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,950
because jerks like you want to be prosecutors.

454
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,529
You dumped Na Ri because you couldn't concentrate?

455
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,470
Why do you even study when you're 200th in your year?

456
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,349
Don't meet women and don't date women.

457
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,279
Don't even get married. Waste your whole life studying.

458
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,349
If you were to study until you were 80,

459
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,080
then maybe you would pass the bar.

460
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,390
I'm sorry you had to wait.

461
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,430
A gift for keeping me dry.

462
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,910
Oh right.

463
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,110
What's your name? We're bound to meet again.

464
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,950
I should sign it for you.

465
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,560
Some other time.

466
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,110
I'll study hard...

467
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,080
and come back with the pass slip.

468
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,230
I'll give you my name then.

469
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,350
Okay, then.

470
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,470
I'll keep this for you until then.

471
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,870
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,430
Sorry, but could you sit somewhere else? We're friends.

473
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,870
We aren't.

474
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,430
You tempt me, then.

475
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,629
No boy who's madly in love...

476
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,830
would put studying over her.

477
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,710
He'd only do that if he didn't like her that much.

478
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,590
See if you can tempt me.

479
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,590
Make me too crazy to study.

480
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,870
So I'd give up trying to be a prosecutor.

481
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,790
If you won't tempt me, I will tempt you.

482
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,270
Please read this. Thank you.

No, I'm not.

488
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,630
I'm so sleepy.

489
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,870
Did your parents find a part-timer?

490
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,110
- Why?
- If not, can I take the job?

491
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,560
Are you out of money?

492
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,270
Your dad's hospital bills must be huge.

493
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,470
I just have to work.

494
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,560
Why don't you settle?

495
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,079
- He didn't do it.
- Isn't that Shin Joon Young?

496
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,590
Yes, that's him.

497
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,830
- Does he have a girlfriend?
- Is that for her?

498
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,670
It's really him.

499
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,009
Is he here to see Na Ri?

500
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,619
To apologise for dumping her?

501
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,710
Does he...

502
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,559
want her back?

503
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,150
It's none of your business.

504
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,430
You mind your own business.

What? 100th day?

508
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,190
Of what?

509
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,080
Congratulations.

- Na Ri.

00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,430
Na Ri.

We might as well go public.

516
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,449
You did nothing wrong. I'm the jerk.

517
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,019
You moron, what are you on about?

518
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,629
Be quiet. I'll deal with it.

519
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,270
Sorry about it, Na Ri.

520
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,310
Things just happened.

521
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,150
Find a guy way better than me.

522
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:23,470
What got into you?

523
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,350
You never laughed in your life.

524
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,910
Did you see a turd roll by?

525
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,630
Not a turd.

526
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,710
I gave someone a warning.

527
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,390
"You little brat, you picked on the wrong guy."

528
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,750
What are you saying?

529
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,389
- Jeong Sik.
- What?

530
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,859
Why am I such an evil jerk?

531
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,310
Who do I take after?

532
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:59,830
Did you overuse your brain? What's wrong with you?

533
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,089
Something really is wrong with you.

534
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,329
I think you should quit studying for your own sake.

535
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,549
Studying isn't for anyone.

536
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,129
What should we do with you?

537
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,830
Stop laughing.

538
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:18,409

540
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,550
Shin Joon Young.

541
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,190
What should I do about him?

542
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,169
Joon Young?

543
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,689
He's not even human.

Dad, Eul's saying bad words.

546
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,710
I wasn't cursing. I was merely stating a fact.

547
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,509
It looks like...

548
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,070
I stole a friend's boyfriend and now everyone hates me.

549

550

553
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,789
I'm older than you.

554
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,969

555
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,489
Sweet potato and bacon with cheese crust.

- Dad.
- You shouldn't say things like that.

They found out after he died that he had a huge loan.

582
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,409
Her mum was sick for a long time before she died.

583

Why did they disappear?

584
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,509
To get away from the loan sharks.

585
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,790
They interrupted the wake and threatened her.

00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,470
- It wasn't a pretty sight.
- Aren't you dating her?

We all chipped in to pay for this ceremony.

592
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,829
We paid because you wouldn't let the kids pay.

Don't you have a family? Or children?

601

This blows. Why did they borrow from us, then?

602
