1
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,830
I love you, Eul.

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,190
Stop it, Joon Young.

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,510
The entire nation knows that you're a good actor.

4
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,430
So stop it already.

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,510
Think about what you did to her.

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,790
How can you even look at her in the eye...

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,630
and say that you like her?

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,790
I love you,

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,510
Eul.

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,910
Jik kept telling me to be careful.

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,030
He said you and I live in different worlds now.

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,270
He told me not to get confused...

13
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,870
on every little thing you do.

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,510
He told me not to get shaken or hurt.

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,670
He tried to warn me.

16
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,910
I guess I'm the crazy one here! I'm the crazy one!

17
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,270
My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.

18
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,350
Never once...

19
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,030
did I use you or toy with you.

20
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,350
Focus only on me.

21
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,950
Listen only to me.

22
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,990
I love you,

23
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,630
Eul.

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,710
Don't go.

25
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,070
Don't go, Eul.

26
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,390
We were just coworkers who got along well.

27
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,110
But then things just happened.

28
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,140
We're too busy to meet up nowadays.

29
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,390
My gosh, don't say that. Stars always say that.

30
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,830
At your birthday party, I heard...

31
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,270
Joon Young gave you a bouquet of 1,000 roses...

32
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,110
and sang you a song.

33
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,350
Everyone's talking about it.

34
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,910
(JOON YOUNG CONFESSED HIS LOVE FOR HER ON HER BIRTHDAY)

35
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,070
Well, that was...

36
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,130
He's a busy man. I didn't think he'd come.

37
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,120
He just suddenly showed up.

38
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,650
I was very surprised.

39
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,330
But after his concert, Joon Young...

40
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,390
just disappeared...

41
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,910
hand-in-hand with the producer of his documentary...

42
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,390
after proposing to her.

43
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,520
Did that shock you?

44
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,610
No, not at all.

45
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,790
I guess not.

46
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,390
It was a show to shield you from prying reporters.

47
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,470
You knew about it in advance, right?

48
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,230
Yes.

49
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,240
She must be friends with a warlock.

50
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,150
I'm amazed. Your acting was on point.

51
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,790
If so...

52
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,350
Eul.

53
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,990
Did you also know in advance...

54
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,830
that Joon Young used you to cover up the scandal?

55
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,310
Well, first of all,

56
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,660
he's a warm-hearted guy. He's also considerate...

57
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,650
- Of course I did.
- and sincere.

58
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,730
He told me at the concert hall.

59
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,850
He told me what he'd do...

60
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,490
and asked me to react appropriately.

61
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,070
So you're saying you put on an act, as well?

62
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,070
Yes.

63
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,910
What did you think? Wasn't I pretty impressive?

64
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,910
I think should try acting.

65
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,710
I'm really out of words.

66
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,350
Why are you telling me this now?

67
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,230
We were so worried about you because we had no clue.

68
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,250
- Sorry.
- Sorry won't cut it this time.

69
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,690
Because of you, your poor brother skipped school.

70
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,070
He couldn't sleep or eat.

71
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,470
Not to mention Hyun Woo who...

72
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,150
Forget it. You're such a brat.

73
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,170
I'll kill you.

74
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,430
You deserve to die.

75
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,350
I'm tired.

76
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,310
Will you please stop?

77
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,070
Would you like to say anything to our viewers?

78
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,570
Hello, everyone.

79
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,080
I sincerely apologise for confusing you...

80
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,830
and not telling the truth.

81
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,050
To protect my name,

82
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,210
Joon Young went too far and had to take the blame.

83
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,170
I hope you don't blame him for anything.

84
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,630
Again, I would like to apologise to his fans and mine.

85
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,390
Playing the lead...

86
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,110
in a miniseries...

87
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,210
really helped improve her acting skills.

88
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,810
I'll sue anyone who says her acting is horrible.

89
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,460
Sir, you're deceiving the whole nation.

90
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,990
We aren't fraudsters.

91
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,870
What are people saying?

92
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,260
"Korea's Brangelina is born."

93
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,910
"This is the class of a Hallyu star."

94
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,830
"He cares for his woman."

95
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,570
"Joon Young's so chivalrous."

96
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,390
"Is there another one like him?"

97
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,430
"I'm a bit like Yoo Na myself."

98
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,330
That's right.

99
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,270
You'd expect Joon Young to date...

100
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,710
a girl like Yoo Na.

101
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,490
Not a common girl like that...

102
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,730
I see why you'd go on with this.

103
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,770
What does Yoo Na get out of taking part in this con?

104
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,510
Even if she's your cousin's daughter...

105
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,190
She was offered four commercials since the scandal.

106
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,310
After her movie failed,

107
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,030
people complained that a supporting actress...

108
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,760
had stolen the lead role.

109
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,030
But no one's saying that after the scandal broke.

110
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,030
This is what we call, "mutually beneficial".

111
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,550
Still, this is wrong.

112
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,590
What does that make Producer Noh?

113
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,430
"The poor producer."

114
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,230
"Was she bullet bait for the two stars?"

115
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,610
"Ms Bullet Bait."

116
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,010
"If you need protection,"

117
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,650
"hire Producer Noh."

118
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,240
"Call the hotline at 1288-1288."

119
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,650
"Call us now."

120
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,460
See? It worked out for her, as well.

121
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,170
If Joon Young's fans saw her anywhere,

122
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,860
she would've gotten killed by them.

123
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,650
But they don't even call her a gold digger any more.

124
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,610
I still think this is wrong.

125
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,130
The person Joon Young actually likes is Noh...

126
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,130
You little...

127
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,270
But why is Joon Young so quiet?

128
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,860
Right? What with his temper, he should have yelled...

129
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,050
and grabbed Mr Nam Goong's collar by now.

130
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,050
But he's not even showing up. I feel scared.

131
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,100
You're right.

132
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,170
Don't you think that's odd?

133
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,920
He hasn't called once.

134
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,470
This isn't like him.

135
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,490
Maybe...

136
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,050
- he didn't read the news yet.
- That's not possible.

137
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,290
The scandal's the only thing on TV, the net and papers.

138
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,100
What if...

139
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,310
they cut the power to his house?

140
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,690
He'd still have access to the internet.

141
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,530
What's going on?

142
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,490
Talking about it just made me feel worse.

143
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,170
Why did you two have to bring that up?

144
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,680
Hi, old man.

145
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,740
Thanks for the food.

146
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
You're the best.

147
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,760
Isn't it the cheese?

148
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,460
Hey, old man.

149
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,220
Why didn't you say your brother's rich?

150
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
What are you talking about? I don't have a brother.

151
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,620
Thanks, old man.

152
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,500
I love you, man.

153
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,160
Your brother's awesome.

154
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,480
Don't lie.

155
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,160
Your brother bought burgers for the whole school.

156
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,820
Even for all the teachers.

157
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,100
What are you on about?

158
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,160
You're mistaken.

159
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,260
Hey, old man, the dean wants to see you.

160
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,980
See you later.

161
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,340
Thank you so much.

162
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
- Could you sign this for me?
- Sure.

163
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,820
"To the student dean."

164
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,340
Oh, you're the dean.

165
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,960
- Can I also take a photo?
- Sure.

166
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,500
Here's my favourite student,

167
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,550
Noh Jik.

168
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,710
My goodness. How could you?

169
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,640
Why didn't you tell us that you're friends with a star?

170
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,160
Could you say hello?

171
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,340
Hi. Study hard, okay?

172
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,860
It's been a while, Jik.

173
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,800
The whole school, teachers...

174
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,340
and staff adds up to about 930 people.

175
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,660
The burger set costs 6 dollars and 10 cents, right?

176
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,900
You've grown a lot since we last met.

177
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,340
- I wouldn't recognise...
- That's...

178
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,580
a grand total of 5,673 dollars.

179
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,160
Give me your account number.

180
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,340
I heard you're smart...

181
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,600
and that you want to become a doctor.

182
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,020
I can't pay you back right now.

183
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,540
I'll make a transfer every month.

184
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,060
Give me your account number.

185
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,300
Come on, give it to me.

186
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
Jik.

187
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
I...

188
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,620
like your sister.

189
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,340
I like her so much that I'm going crazy.

190
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,340
I can't eat.

191
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,780
I can't sleep or breathe.

192
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm barely living.

193
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,740
So I need your help.

194
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,420
Tell her not to run away.

195
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,540
Tell her to look at me.

196
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,340
Tell her to trust me.

197
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,940
I heard she only listens to you.

198
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,380
I'll send 5,673 dollars...

199
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,380
to your agency as soon as I get the money.

200
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Jik.

201
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,660
Never once...

202
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,580
did I use you or toy with you.

203
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,580
Focus only on me.

204
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,220
Listen only to me.

205
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,220
I love you,

206
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Eul.

207
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,040
I love you, Eul.

208
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,140
No, no, no...

209
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,060
(CHOI JI TAE)

210
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Sir.

211
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,620
I picked up the car you parked outside...

212
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,620
Mr Shin Joon Young's house.

213
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,180
Thank you.

214
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,700
For just one minute,

215
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,260
may I speak freely as a friend, Sir?

216
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,860
Sure.

217
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,460
Stop it, Ji Tae.

218
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,860
You went too far already.

219
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,340
Apologise to Jeong Eun,

220
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,820
and give up on Producer Noh.

221
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,580
Do as I say.

222
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,860
If she finds out who you are...

223
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,060
If Jeong Eun finds out who she is...

224
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,580
If your parents find out who she is, then...

225
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,700
- Your minute's up.
- Ji Tae.

226
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,820
Your time's up, Mr Kang.

227
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,660
Sir.

228
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,870
Yes, Sir.

229
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,380
Ms Kim, did you buy what I told you to?

230
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,270
Who is it?

231
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,420
Na Ri said you hadn't eaten anything.

232
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,820
It already cooled down a little.

233
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,820
Eat up.

234
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Here.

235
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Go on.

236
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,990
She has hands, too.

237
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,580
It's not like she's critically ill.

238
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,220
You don't have to feed her like that.

239
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,680
If you don't want abalone porridge,

240
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,140
I also brought your favourite, green bean porridge.

241
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,220
Do you want that instead?

242
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
I'm fine, so can you please...

243
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,340
If you're fine, eat.

244
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,420
Do you know how you look?

245
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,300
You look like you could die a minute from now.

246
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,860
Open wide.

247
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,040
This abalone porridge's horrible.

248
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,540
Don't eat it. It'll ruin your appetite.

249
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,800
This is my friend's place, not mine.

250
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,380
I can prepare my own food, so please leave.

251
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Eul.

252
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,400
That's right. Don't eat porridge.

253
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,700
You need to eat rice.

254
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,220
We Koreans need to eat rice.

255
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,060
You're really weird.

256
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,620
I heard you rejected her.

257
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,060
Why are you still hanging around?

258
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,510
You don't want her, but can't give her away?

259
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,420
Does Ms Kim Yoo Na know you're here?

260
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,420
How would she?

261
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,940
I don't even have her number.

262
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,060
That tasted really disgusting.

263
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,300
By the way,

264
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
let me...

265
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,990
comment on how you said I have no right to love Eul.

266
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,340
Do we need a permit to be in love?

267
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,380
I can love whoever I want.

268
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,860
What else is free will good for?

269
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,420
Why are you smiling?

270
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,780
You're right.

271
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,220
A man loving a woman...

272
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,900
isn't about having rights.

273
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,740
If you fall for someone,

274
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,140
you just do.

275
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,900
I was confused, but you straightened things out for me.

276
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,220
Thank you.

277
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,500
Who are you?

278
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,430
You're wearing a luxury watch with a cheap jacket.

279
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,060
Who are you and why are you...

280
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,420
hanging around Eul in such mix-matched clothing?

281
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,140
That watch has such a delicate mechanism that...

282
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,060
there are no fakes so far.

283
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,060
Who are you?

284
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,320
Are you a thief or a robber?

285
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,980
Why do you care who I am?

286
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,260
We're just two undeserving men...

287
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,980
who happen to like the same woman.

288
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,100
That's the unfortunate tragedy.

289
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,380
(ONE VOICE MESSAGE)

290
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,340
Why won't you pick up, Ji Tae?

291
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Mum just collapsed.

292
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,380
Mum.

293
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,340
- Ji Tae.
- Why are you here?

294
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,220
She wanted to go to the sauna, so I went with her.

295
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,180
She suddenly complained of chest pains and passed out.

296
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,260
What did you do?

297
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,140
- What?
- What did you do...

298
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,500
that made her pass out?

299
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,820
What do you mean?

300
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,500
Why would she do something?

301
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,980
Mum's still alive because Jeong Eun...

302
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,740
brought her here right away.

303
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,740
Where were you while all this happened?

304
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,300
I called you over 10 times.

305
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,870
Sorry, Ji Tae.

306
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,480
I should have taken...

307
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,260
extra good care of her.

308
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm really sorry.

309
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,740
Why should you apologise?

310
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,820
Dad's on a business trip,

311
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,420
and Ji Tae didn't even pick up.

312
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,020
I'd have died of fear if I didn't have you to rely on.

313
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,800
Don't worry, Ha Ru.

314
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,340
Your mum will be fine.

316
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,840
The doctor said...

317
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,900
it could be a side effect of the kidney transplant.

318
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,060
We'll find out for sure when the test results are out.

319
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,040
She'll be fine.

320
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,820
Don't worry too much.

321
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,120
Jeong Eun's talking to you.

322
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,340
Why won't you answer?

323
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,430
You didn't even thank our mum's lifesaver.

324
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,460
Ha Ru.

325
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,540
Where are your manners?

326
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,260
I'll tell Dad everything.

327
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,910
You shouldn't say things like that.

328
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,660
He didn't answer his phone because he was at work.

329
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,700
It's hard to answer a call when you're working.

330
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,940
Where is she?

331
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,760
Finish your meal and come out.

332
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,900
I'll wait out here.

333
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,340
Eat up.

334
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,460
Excuse me.

335
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,200
Can I have another bowl of rice?

336
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,420
Isn't that Shin Joon Young?

337
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
I don't think so.

338
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,900
What would he be doing here?

339
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,220
- I think it's him.
- It can't be. Let's go.

340
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,760
- Ouch.
- You have an upset stomach.

341
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,360
The tip of your hand is cold and it's lumpy here.

342
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,820
I know a doctor who can help you out.

343
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,420
Shall we go?

344
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,980
Ma'am. We'll pay now.

345
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,420
Let go.

346
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,540
- Am I that easy to you?
- No.

347
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,260
- Am I a pushover?
- No.

348
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,940
Then why are you doing this to me?

349
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,120
What did I do?

350
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,740
I'm just upset because you seem sick.

351
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,020
I feel worse because it's my fault,

352
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,380
so I want to help and make you feel okay.

353
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,940
That's all.

354
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,940
Yoo Na only just helped you shed the gold digger title.

355
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,210
If people notice us fighting in the open,

356
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,500
it'll look really bad.

357
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,900
Come with me quietly.

358
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,700
You just have to let go of my hand.

359
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Don't care whether I'm sick or not.

360
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,900
- Say something that makes more sense.
- What?

361
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,180
I have no intention of letting go.

362
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,740
Shall we stand here all day?

363
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,180
You lunatic.

364
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,100
You got that right. Now come with me.

365
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,460
Do you want to avoid me that badly?

366
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,980
Yes.

367
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,940
My fans wish for a chance to look at me for a minute.

368
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,220
They'd want to kill you if they heard that.

369
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,260
Drop me off at a hospital, and get lost.

370
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Okay.

371
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,940
I'm good at getting lost.

372
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,300
I'll disappear from your sight right away...

373
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,140
without leaving a trace.

374
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,980
But just not right now.

375
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,860
- What?
- I'll go after a minimum of three months...

376
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,500
or a maximum of four months.

377
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,860
I'm going to cling onto Hyun Woo again.

378
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,260
I'll make a scene until he accepts me.

379
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,580
I'll visit him, call him,

380
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,740
- cry, beg...
- Do what you want.

381
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,100
I like him, not you.

382
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,780
- As if I care.
- Hey.

383
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,500
I don't care who you like.

384
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,900
Ego and jealousy?

385
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,180
I have no time for that.

386
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,340
Why is the hospital so far away?

387
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,380
Is it even in Seoul?

388
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,740
(YIHWASU YUKGAEJANG)

389
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,860
Where's the hospital?

390
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,180
(SHIN JOON YOUNG'S FANS ARE NOT WELCOME.)

391
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,260
If my mum tries to chase you out, say you hate me.

392
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Your mum?

393
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,060
Yes. My mum.

394
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,940
She's an expert...

395
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,260
when it comes to folk remedies.

396
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,580
- This time it's on me.
- Don't say that.

397
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,540
(JOON YOUNG AND YOO NA HAVE BEEN DATING FOR A YEAR)

398
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,860
We'll pay now.

399
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Okay.

400
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,840
Did you enjoy your meal?

401
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,180
Yes, we did.

402
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,500
Welcome to...

403
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,120
Goodbye.

404
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,620
Thanks. Goodbye.

405
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,380
(CLOSED FOR PERSONAL REASONS)

406
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,540
Let go. I won't run away.

407
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Let go.

408
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,100
I'm sorry for introducing myself so late.

409
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,940
My name is Noh Eul.

410
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,140
Aren't you...

411
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,780
- the gold digger?
- Oh, that.

412
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,490
I'm not a gold digger.

413
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,500
I'm just a victim of Joon Young's cover-up...

414
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,260
to the scandal.

415
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,140
She has an upset stomach because of me.

416
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,900
Please prick her thumb, Mum.

417
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,920
No, you don't have to.

418
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,460
I'll just go and buy some medicine.

419
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,720
Sorry for intruding.

420
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,740
Goodbye.

421
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,540
You really don't have to worry.

422
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm really not a gold digger,

423
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,860
and your son and I...

424
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,800
are not dating.

425
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,900
That's not true.

426
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,920
There's something between you two.

427
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,620
Whether it's indigestion or not,

428
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,540
you're the first girl that Joon Young...

429
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,340
ever brought over.

430
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
She's the girl I like.

431
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,460
I told you over the phone last time.

432
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,980
His manager told me that...

433
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,210
Joon Young's not exactly in his right mind these days.

434
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,200
People hit him with pieces of wood for a shoot,

435
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,340
so his brain...

436
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,980
Anyway, I'm just trying to tell you that...

437
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,640
he makes poor judgements...

438
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,620
I don't know why I can't stop thinking of her.

439
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,220
She's been on my mind for the last nine years.

440
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,100
And I realised that I'm madly in love with her...

441
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,140
only about two weeks ago.

442
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,580
Joon Young.

443
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,900
This is strange.

444
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,780
Everyone on TV says...

445
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,400
you're seeing someone else.

446
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,460
That's the only thing people seem to care about.

447
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,210
But here you are saying that...

448
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,060
you like the gold digger... I mean, gold miner...

449
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,580
No, this girl with the eyes of a scared rabbit.

450
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,720
No, no.

451
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,120
That's what he says. It's not mutual.

452
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,580
- Noh Eul.
- What's going on?

453
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,070
She doesn't like you, but you like her?

454
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,350
Young Ok!

455
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,580
I think something is wrong with his head.

456
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,060
Young Deuk.

457
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,820
Take the sign off and accept customers.

458
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,320
I can't believe we closed the shop for two clowns.

459
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,740
What nonsense is this?

460
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm good at...

461
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,260
knowing where I stand.

462
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,250
Whatever your son says,

463
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,220
I'll do my best to avoid him.

464
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,460
You won't have anything to worry about.

465
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,590
Nothing will happen.

466
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,620
Hey.

467
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,900
If you don't believe me,

468
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,630
- I can sign a memo.
- Why would you do that?

469
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,100
You're making me angry.

470
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,680
If that's not enough,

471
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,460
- I can just disappear.
- Eul.

472
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,260
I'll disappear to where...

473
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,060
Joon Young can't find me.

475

Wait, wait.

476
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,820
Don't poke too hard...

477
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,140
just because you hate me.

478
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,100
When will you poke?

479
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,280
I didn't do it yet.

480
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,390
I see.

481
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,340
Please don't hate me too much.

482
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,540
I don't hate you.

483
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,500
Why not?

484
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,100
I'd want to kill me if I were you.

485
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,140
I don't. You know where you stand.

486
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,390
What's 7 times 8?

487
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,390
- What?
- The times table.

488
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,060
What's 7 times 8?

489
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,780
- It's 56.
- You're sane.

490
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,820
Your head's fine.

491
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,220
When Gook Young...

492
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,390
fell madly in love with a gold digger,

493
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,430
he said 3 times 3 was 8.

494
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,580
What's 8 times 7, then?

495
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,520
- It's 56.
- Good.

496
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,700
You're fine.

497
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,940
Why would someone who's still sane...

498
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,760
fall for someone who wears cheap sneakers?

499
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,240
Girls who wear sparkly high heels...

500
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,430
must be all around you all the time.

501
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,540
I know, right?

502
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,700
Why did I forego girls who wear expensive heels...

503
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,700
and fall for a girl who wears cheap shoes?

504
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,100
The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree.

505
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,800
Your father...

506
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,300
ignored all the smart and pretty college girls...

507
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,100
to fall for your mother who thought that Gandhi...

508
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,580
was a Korean monk.

509
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,980
When you grow older and learn how the world works,

510
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,540
you'll see that high heels are better than sneakers.

511
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,820
You'll forget all about when you fell for...

512
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,060
cheap sneakers.

513
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,340
Just like that.

514
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,390
Just like Choi Hyun Joon.

515
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,460
With all his connections,

516
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,390
he could've easily tracked down your mum.

517
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,180
But all these years, he never did.

518
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,140
Welcome back.

519
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,870
How about you get changed?

520
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,620
He might find out...

521
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,060
that you've fallen for a lowly girl.

522
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,700
Do you like her that much?

523
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,340
Enough to exchange your expensive suit...

524
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,620
for a cheap jacket to blend into her surroundings?

525
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,540
I want to spend time with my family.

526
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,460
I'll have Mr Kang drive you home.

527
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,300
- Goodbye.
- What?

528
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,940
Ji Tae.

529
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,660
Fortunately,

530
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,300
it wasn't what we feared.

531
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,390
Everything came back normal.

532
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,140
You can leave tomorrow...

533
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,170
No.

534
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,940
I fear for my health and my life.

535
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Pardon?

536
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,750
I received my husband's kidney and it extended my life,

537
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,780
but you can't say I'm cured.

538
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,580
A transplanted kidney lasts about 10 to 15 years.

539
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,390
That's only a statistic.

540
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,300
A kidney can fail at any time.

541
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,260
So you could say I'm terminally ill.

542
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,040
Madam.

543
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,260
"Our staff will do their best,"

544
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,660
"but the family members,"

545
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,340
"especially you, Mr Choi, as her husband,"

546
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,840
"must do your best to help her relax."

547
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,870
"Shower her with care and attention."

548
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,600
"Another surgery..."

549
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,820
"could have drastic results."

550
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,320
Could you say that...

551
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,620
to my husband?

552
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Honey.

553
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Honey.

554
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,240
Are the results back?

555
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,740
How ill is she?

556
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,180
I'm sorry to have to say this.

557
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:58,220
There are some causes for concern.

558
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Is her body rejecting the kidney?

559
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,730
Her condition...

560
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,700
is not that serious yet, but...

561
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,700
What, then?

562
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,780
What can we do?

563
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,980
What must I do?

564
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,180
You and I will become a family in a month's time.

565
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,020
I told your mother at the sauna that...

566
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,780
I would like to become her daughter-in-law soon.

567
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,820
Your parents' wedding anniversary is next month.

568
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
I suggested we get married then.

569
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,060
Your mother looked overjoyed.

570
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,940
You should have...

571
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,140
been there to see her face.

573
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,190
Stop!

574
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,060
How... Why...

575
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,620
You can't pour fish sauce like it's water!

576
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,300
It's salty. It's so salty.

577
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,260
What's the fuss about?

578
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,460
What are you doing, you fool?

579
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,620
You said it's salty.

580
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,700
My goodness.

581
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,300
Isn't Eul pretty...

582
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,220
just like how you once were?

583
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,020
But she won't become like you.

584
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,960
I won't let her live the life you did.

585
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,670
She won't suffer...

586
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,340
or feel discriminated or belittled.

587
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,460
The lettuce tastes terrible.

588
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,980
Did I get a bad batch?

589
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,220
I won't let her run off like you did.

590
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,390
What's wrong with the lettuce you sold me?

591
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,140
You said they were the best, but they're falling apart.

592
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Didn't I say I wouldn't buy from you if you lied again?

593
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,390
How dare they lie about food.

594
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,140
Whatever you say, I won't let her go.

595
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,220
I won't give up on her even if I die.

596
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,780
I'll do whatever I want from now on.

597
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,540
Why is it so quiet?

598
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,820
Did Young Ok kill him or something?

599
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,430
Did you hear everything?

600
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,460
You could hear from here, right?

601
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,260
Not everything,

602
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,820
but I heard most of it.

603
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,450
Joon Young may look like a top star,

604
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,120
but to be truthful, his mum never...

605
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,660
cooked him a warm meal whenever he came by.

606
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,780
All he gets is an earful of curses and complaints.

607
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,910
Why...

608
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,080
did he drift apart from his mother?

609
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,220
Don't even go there.

610
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,820
She expected him to become a prosecutor,

611
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,920
but he quit school to become a celebrity.

612
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,390
His mum lost her mind...

613
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,700
Ask Joon Young to tell you the rest.

614
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,060
What does your father do?

615
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,300
My mum's a single mother.

616
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,140
She had me when she was 22.

617
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,020
My father...

618
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,580
wasn't in the picture from the start.

619
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,460
When I was in high school,

620
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,540
she worked at a bar to pay for a tutor.

621
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,860
Then she got caught trying to bribe my teacher.

622
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,180
I couldn't stand going to school after that.

623
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,820
She used to peel fruit at a hostess bar.

624
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,700
At a picnic in middle school, she gave the teachers...

625
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,420
a box full of pieces of apple in all sorts of shapes.

626
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,020
That wounded her adolescent son more than anything.

627
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,060
She also stole something when I was in second grade.

628
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,180
It's because I said I wanted tangsuyuk.

629
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,940
We couldn't even afford rice.

630
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,100
Do you still think...

631
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,140
I'm out of your league?

632
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,540
Thanks for helping me relieve my upset stomach.

633
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,540
Bye.

634
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,120
Go home.

635
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,890
You just got back from a business trip.

636
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,600
What if you collapse, too?

637
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,390
I'll stay here.

638
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,540
I will stay...

639
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,500
beside your mother.

640
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,390
Ha Ru will be afraid all alone.

641
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,450
Go home.

642
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,990
Father.

643
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:58,550
Mister, do you want noodles?

644
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,760
(FATHER)

645
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,330
Hello?

646
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,640
I'm sorry, Ji Tae.

647
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,900
About what?

648
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,080
About everything.

649
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,800
I'll be good to you.

650
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,160
I promise.

651
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,280
You're doing fine as it is.

652
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,400
Please tell Jeong Eun that I thank her.

653
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,040
I owe her a lot.

654
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Okay.

655
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,400
I'll tell her.

656
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,160
Good. Sleep well.

657
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,800
You too.

658
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,650
I only ordered two acorn jelly noodles.

659
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,400
I know. The rest of this is on the house.

660
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,460
- Why?
- I heard you went from...

661
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,920
a national gold digger to Ms Bullet Bait.

662
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,960
Your parents didn't have you to take shots for someone.

663
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,680
- That's...
- I'm sure you must have...

664
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,520
fallen for him at one point.

665
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,720
Instead, those two stars just used you.

666
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,060
Now eat up.

667
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,740
When you feel empty...

668
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,280
after being dumped, it's best to fill your belly.

669
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,600
Since you set it all out for me,

670
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,440
- I might as well eat.
- Go on.

671
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,600
Tell me.

672
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,280
Were you dumped only by Hyun Woo and Joon Young?

673
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,140
Was there anyone else?

674
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,480
You see, when it rains, it pours.

675
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,080
I know.

676
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,840
You should lower your standards.

677
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,240
Who are you meeting today?

678
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,120
- Hyun Woo.
- Who?

679
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,650
The Hyun Woo I know?

680
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,680
Yes.

681
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Hey.

682
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,920
Some never get to even see a luxury car.

683
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,200
You let a luxury car drive away,

684
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,040
but a sedan still comes for you.

685
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,640
Did you order two noodles?

686
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,000
Yes.

687
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,800

688
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,760

Where were you all day?

692
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,200
I bought gopchang, your favourite.

693
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,120
Gook Young, kneel.

694
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,470
Just me?

695
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,720
I'm too old to kneel.

696
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,280
The idea for the Joon Young and Yoo Na fraud...

697
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,000
came out of your head.

698
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,080
- Sir.
- I'm sorry, Joon Young.

699
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,010
I should've run it by you first, but just know that...

700
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,940
I thought long and hard before going ahead.

701
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,880
If I expected to make even a cent out of it,

702
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,000
I'll scald Gook Young's fingers.

703
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,420
Sir, why mine? I didn't do anything.

704
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,560
You did well.

705
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,600
Did he just say I did well?

706
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,530
Yes.

707
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,640
Why?

708
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,920
I think he's gone crazy.

709
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,940
My goodness.

710
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,720
Look at the state of the noodles. What a waste.

711
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,920
Where's Hyun Woo? It's been over an hour.

712
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,040
He said he'd come.

713
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,200
- But he didn't.
- I doubt he will tonight.

714
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,560
I think you just got rejected again.

715
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,560
Wait here.

716
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,920
I was going to ask him to hold me back.

717
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,530
What?

718
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,500
I don't care now. It's all his fault.

719
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,560
What do you mean?

720
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,880
I know.

721
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,960
No one would be in her right mind after that.

Hello?

Eul?

725
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,380
I didn't hear that. What did you say?

726
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,860
No, don't say it.

727
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,300
I'll come right over. Say it to my face.

728
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,460
You were sorely mistaken.

729
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,860
If you thought...

730
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,900
I would fall or give up or step aside...

731
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,300
over something like this,

732
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,740
then you were wrong.

733
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,500
Come at me with all you have.

734
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,540
I will never despair,

735
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,700
be sad,

736
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,500
or succumb.
