00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,030
Next news on "Entertainment Weekly".

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,950
Last week, we found out that...

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,630
Shin Joon Young is fighting a terminal disease.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,230
Many of his fans fell in despair.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,410
I still can't believe this news.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,590
I really can't believe it, either.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,180
I heard many people are...

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,660
supporting him through social media.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,730
That's right.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,150
An elderly grandmother who's been his fan...

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,110
for a long time, wrote a letter to him saying...

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,990
"Get well, Joon Young."

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,110
It received a lot of attention on social media.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,870
Also, his Asian fan association is raising a fund...

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,090
to build up a forest to wish him a fast recovery.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,370
Why are you watching that?

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,700
Did people always love me that much?

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,170
I thought I only had a million haters.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,230
I didn't know people loved me that much.

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,850
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,810
Some people are even saying that they'll die after you.

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,180
Well, at least...

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,410
you're no longer accused of using drugs.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,130
- Gook Young.
- What?

25
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,220
You should take care of Pororo.

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,940
Don't be hard on him just because he's picky with food.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,100
Stop saying things like that.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,530
You make it sound like you're going to die soon.

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,890
I will die soon.

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,650
Oh, right.

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,410
I forgot to...

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,350
turn the ignition off after parking the car.

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,890
I'll be right back.

34
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,090
By the way,

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,490
I shouldn't have called you a hopeless jerk.

36
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,130
I'm really sorry.

37
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,340
I didn't know that you were sick...

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,730
and that you weren't in your right mind.

39
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,490
My mistake.

40
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,740
(MUM)

41
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,270
What's with you? Did you cry?

42
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,990
No. I didn't cry.

43
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,250
Your eyes are red.

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,370
My eyes are always loud. I mean, they're always red.

45
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,170
Don't go inside if you're going to cry in front of him.

46
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,290
I feel better now,

47
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,530
so I'm going to go inside and see him.

48
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,550
But this is just nonsense.

49
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,430
He's only 28 years old.

50
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,730
Stop it, you fool.

51
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,770
I was doing a good job of holding back my tears.

52
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,330
Why are you making me cry again?

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,250
(NOH EUL)

54
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,570
It's me, Eul.

55
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,370
Can we meet for just a while, Joon Young?

56
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,410
Aren't you Shin Joon Young?

57
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,770
- Do you know me?
- Of course.

58
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,570
You're a top celebrity.

59
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,420
Joon Young, may I get your autograph?

60
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,190
I'm not a star. I'm just a university student.

61
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,970
Stop lying. You are a celebrity.

62
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,820
No, I'm not.

63
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,260
I know that I'm very handsome,

64
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,820
but I'm not a celebrity.

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,210
You should go and play with your friends.

66
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,650
Go on.

67
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,410
My gosh.

68
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,530
I'm sure he's Shin Joon Young.

69
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,450
Well,

70
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,260
I am too good looking to become a prosecutor.

71
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,050
My goodness. Maybe I should just become a celebrity.

72
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,940
Honey, are your classes over?

73
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,680
Hey, you should be careful.

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,970
Joon Young is mine.

75
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,230
If you hit on him ever again,

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,650
you'll have your next meal in your next life.

77
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,930
Well done, Eul.

78
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,460
Did you see the girl's face?

79
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,210
It was a complete success.

80
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,210
She really thought that you're my girlfriend.

81
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,650
Why don't you try acting?

82
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,970
Okay, I'll dock twice more.

83
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,870
I stayed up studying for my exams.

84
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,610
Give me just 10 minutes.

85
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,970
I think I'll get an A for everything.

86
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,090
I'll treat you if I get a scholarship.

87
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,370
- Joon Young.
- I'm going to sleep now.

88
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,170
Don't wake me up.

89
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,610
There he is.

90
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,890
Look. He's Shin Joon Young, right?

91
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,250
Yes, I think he is.

92
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,930
Hey, isn't he Shin Joon Young?

93
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,890
He keeps on saying that he isn't.

94
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,150
What did he say?

95
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,690
He said he's just a student, not a celebrity.

96
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,940
That's right. He's not a celebrity.

97
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,220
He's just a student.

98
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,930
No way. I'm sure he's Shin Joon Young.

99
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,690
Can you keep it down?

100
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,090
He's sleeping.

101
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,070
Now that I look at him, he looks...

102
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,810
uglier than Shin Joon Young.

103
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,610
He's not him. Let's go.

104
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,050
I don't think so. I'm sure it's him.

105
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,210
(DEAR JOON YOUNG WHO'S FIGHTING A TERMINAL ILLNESS...)

106
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,890
Sir.

107
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,890
Sir.

108
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,690
Ji Tae was just moved to the regular ward from the ICU.

109
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,610
Ji Tae.

110
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,210
Don't cry.

111
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,890
They said he'll be fine. He'll wake up soon.

112
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,980
Who did this to him?

113
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,590
Who?

114
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,610
Ji Tae made a mistake while driving.

115
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,310
He ran a red light and was speeding over the limit.

116
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,710
He wouldn't do that.

117
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,610
He drives safer than anyone I know.

118
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,770
Dad.

119
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,010
Ha Ru.

120
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,010
I want to be alone with him for a while.

121
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,690
Will you leave us?

122
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,420
Why? I want to stay here.

123
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,010
He's right. You should go and study.

124
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,910
I'll see her off to the elevator.

125
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,860
No, I want to stay.

126
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,370
However hard I think about this,

127
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,860
there nothing I can do to stop you two.

128
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,410
You two...

129
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,810
have become monsters I can't deal with.

130
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,980
Please, think carefully.

131
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,210
Is there really no way...

132
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,770
to stop you?

133
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,770
Yes.

134
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,250
I'm sorry to say there is no way.

135
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,100
Root for me, Dad.

136
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,980
I'd like to win this fight.

137
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,890
Ji Tae.

138
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,740
I...

139
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,690
really liked you.

140
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,410
Although I'm not your biological son,

141
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,210
I really wanted to be a good son to you.

142
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,810
So...

143
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,530
I'll do anything that would help you.

144
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,210
I'll do anything that would make you happy.

145
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,690
I even did terrible things I hated...

146
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,410
or thought were wrong.

147
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,370
I did it for your sake.

148
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,610
I just went through with it.

149
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,730
If I didn't,

150
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,170
I thought you'd abandon my mother and me.

151
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,890
Just like my biological father.

152
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,810
It's my fault.

153
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,610
I shouldn't have done that.

154
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,260
I should've stopped you from doing anything wrong.

155
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,050
I should've told you that it was wrong and that I won't do it.

156
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,930
Please keep your promise...

157
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,210
that you won't leave Mum.

158
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,690
The person who's disobeying you isn't Mum.

159
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,290
It's me.

160
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,410
You only have to...

161
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,730
abandon me.

162
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,730
(MS KIM)

163
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,770
There's a problem, Madam.

164
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,270
We destroyed the black box in Ji Tae's car.

165
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,810
But a black box from another car recorded everything.

166
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,830
What should we do?

167
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,730
Thankfully, we found it before the police did, so...

168
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,890
Hello?

169
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,290
Madam.

170
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,930
Madam.

171
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,410
Hold on, Ms Kim.

172
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,610
I'll put her on the phone.

173
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,690
Hello? What is it?

174
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,810
Okay. I understand.

175
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,890
Yes, I stopped Ji Tae.

176
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,770
It was me.

177
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,370
I wanted to protect you.

178
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,130
You have to count this as three.

179
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,780
I'll pretend to be your girlfriend from now on.

180
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,490
So count this as three.

181
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,980
What should I do?

182
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,410
Do you want me to shout that I'm your girlfriend?

183
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,130
Or do you want me to write...

184
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,370
"I'm Joon Young's girlfriend" on my forehead?

185
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,050
Do you want to write "I'm Eul's boyfriend"...

186
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,810
on your forehead, too?

187
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,650
I think I have a pen here somewhere.

188
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,330
Will the documentary air two days from now?

189
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,810
You have to air...

190
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,930
everything about Jeong Eun and me.

191
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,530
I know it'll be hard.

192
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,330
People will try to stop you.

193
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,930
But you have to do it.

194
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,690
It's your job.

195
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,690
I'll be gone soon.

196
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,570
But you'll have to continue living your life.

197
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,810
You have to build the world...

198
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,730
you believe in, Eul.

199
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,570
Don't live in despair.

200
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,970
Don't blame other people.

201
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,730
And stop making excuses.

202
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,810
You'll win if you don't give in.

203
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,410
I came to tell you that. Bye.

204
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,610
I'm the one who called you out.

205
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,890
I have something to say to you.

206
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,830
It's not your fault, Joon Young.

207
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,190
I...

208
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,350
thought about it a lot.

209
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,750
And I didn't want to acknowledge it.

210
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,070
But it's not your fault.

211
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,190
It...

212
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,230
just happened.

213
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,950
It just happened.

214
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,520
It's just that you and I...

215
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,240
happened to be there.

216
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,760
It's not your fault, Joon Young.

217

My goodness.

221
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,680
This person really can't spell.

222
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,040
It's not bad for a foreigner.

223
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,490
Why can't I stand misspelled words?

224
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,830
Did anyone in my family die because of that?

225
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,670
Can you pick out what's wrong?

226
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,560
You said you were smart.

227
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,270
You told me you got an A for everything.

228
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,090
Yes, I was the top of my class.

229
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,630
Wait. Let's see.

230
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,760

231

233
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,030
She's in the kitchen.

234
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,000
She's been...

235
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,760
peeling onions in there for days.

236
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,270
This person misspelled...

237
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,000

What are you doing?

239
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,190
I heard you're peeling tons of onions.

240
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,000

242
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,600
Why are the onions so spicy?

243
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,070
They're spicier than garlic and peppers.

244
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,790
Young Deuk.

245
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,190
You said I wouldn't tear up if I put these on.

246
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,670
How dare you lie to me.

247
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,070
Do you take me as a joke?

248
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,950
I'm...

249
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,950
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

250
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,830
How can you lie to your boss?

251
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,030
You said I wouldn't cry if I put those on.

252
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,240
Then what are these falling from my eyes?

253
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,430
I never cried when I peeled onions with goggles on.

254
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Young Ok.

255
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,240
Please stop. You have customers.

256
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,030
This is so frustrating and upsetting.

257
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,350
I don't think I can stay here any more.

258
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,070
I'm going to leave early.

259
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,110
Can you close the store later?

260

Mr Yoon would like to see you.

269
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,310
Do you have time?

270
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,510
I think he's trying to threaten me.

271
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,170
You'll take me even if I decline, right?

272
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,990
Let me take you to him. Please get in.

273
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,470

277
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,230
seeing that someone like you came to pick me up.

278
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,750
Is the video about...

279
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,550
It's a video on Yoon Jeong Eun confessing...

280
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,710
that she killed my father by hit-and-run.

281
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,120
I guess she already told her father about it.

282
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,050
He'll probably threaten the TV station...

283
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,510
to stop it from airing.

284
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
This is the video.

285
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,250
You should take a look.

286
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,630
It'll be aired in two days.

287
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,230
You should check if there are any errors.

288
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,910
I will air this no matter what.

289
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,670
By the way, that's the original. I didn't make a copy.

291
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,550
- does that mean?
- That USB is the only evidence.

Please return it to me so that I can air it.

298
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,830
His charges for drug use were dropped.

299
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,430
That's a relief.

300
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm very glad.

301
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,230
It's because his terminal illness was made public.

Are you wondering why I'm here?

311
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,520
It's because I suddenly became so famous.

312
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,710
So many people want to see me.

313
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,990
This is my refuge.

314
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,920
You have a huge house. Let me stay.

317

I envy them.

318
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,990
I want to take a trip, too.

319
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,730
- Can you drive?
- Why?

320
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,310
I want to make up...

321
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,230
for the promise I broke.

322
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,080
I wanted to become a prosecutor like my father.

323
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,510
And once I become one, I wanted to visit my father...

324
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,550
and tell him that I grew up well even without him.

325
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,270
I wanted to receive his compliment.

326
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,430
So I studied really hard...

327
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,390
and passed my first bar exam.

328

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,230
save Joon Young?

help him cure his illness?

335
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,310
I'll do...

336
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,350
anything you say. So please...

00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,510
save Joon Young.

338
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,830

339
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,790

340
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,790
to live like Prosecutor Choi Hyun Joon.

341
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,690
I told him to help the people in need...

342
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,830
and the falsely accused.

343
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,390
I told him to help people who are weak and powerless.

344
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,070
I told him that his father was like that.

345
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,510
I taught him...

346
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,470
to live like that,

347
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,310
just like his father.

348

349
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,470
I have...

350
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,470
I have taught him wrong.

351
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,230
I think...

352
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,390
he got sick because of me.

354
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,470

355
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,990
for all the wrong things we've done.

Look at those. They look fresh.

369
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,750
Eul.

370
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,370
My gosh.

371
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,010
How can one octopus cost 40 dollars?

372
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,270
Can you give us a three-dollar discount?

373
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,070
How about two dollars?

374
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,590
What about one dollar?

375
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,030
That place over there sold one for 30 dollars.

376
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,870
Go and buy it from there, then.

377
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,720
You're so stingy.

378
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,210
I'm trying to act cute for you.

379
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,650
- My goodness.
- You're so...

380
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,090
Keep the change.

381
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,350
Have a great day. Let's go.

382
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,360
- Hey, this isn't worth 50 dollars.
- Knock it off.

383
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,350
Maybe this will shoot out ink on you.

384
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,320
Let's go.

385
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,490
You two don't have that card.

386
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,160
How can you win 10 rounds in a row?

387
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,870
Didn't you tell me that this card is worth two points?

388
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,810
- No, that's three points.
- Wait here.

389
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,530
- Why?
- How many times do I have to tell you?

390
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,870
Just give me the money.

391
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,110
That card is worth only two points.

392
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,400
That means you only have two points.

393
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,170
You haven't won yet.

394
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,730
Who are you to be so nosy?

395
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,250
You should just go your way.

396
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,870
- My gosh.
- Yes, we should go.

397
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,150
Wait.

398
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,430
Three of those cards don't always make three points.

399
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,150
This one. If this one is included, it's two points.

400
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,470
That means she didn't win yet, and...

401
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,570
My goodness.

402
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,830
- You're the winner.
- What?

403
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,650
My goodness.

404
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,390
Hey, go away.

405
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,430
You should use this card.

406
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,870
See? You won with three points.

407
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,480
Is this worth two cards?

408
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,290
Then does that mean I won?

409
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,350
Yes.

410
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,530
Different regions play with different rules.

411
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,050
That's not worth two cards here in my town.

412
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,290
No, this is a universal rule.

413
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,550
Does that mean she's been fooling us?

414
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,650
I did not fool anyone. My goodness.

415
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,640
- You did fool them.
- Is this Joon Young's number?

416
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,840
- You can't be trusted.
- It's me, Choi Hyun Joon.

417
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,810
- How can you fool us?
- Hey.

418
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,210
- Who are you to say that?
- Joon Young.

419
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,730
- Who is this girl, anyway?
- Are you listening?

420
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,370
I won't play with you two.

421
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,570
I quit.

422
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,490
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

423
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,850
- Give me back my money.
- Hey! Come back here!

424
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,100
You're a fraud.

425
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,830
- My goodness.
- That other card is also worth two.

426
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,110
Hey, you scored five points, okay?

427
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,990
Yes, I'll be there right now.

428
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,310
No, I can go right away.

429
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,190
Okay. Sure.

430
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Ma'am.

431
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,790
How do I look? Do I look handsome?

432
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,190
Why? Are you going on a date?

433
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,480
No, I'm meeting my father.

434
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,670
My father wants to see me.

435
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,790
Goodbye.

436
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,920
Taxi.

437
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,790
Joon Young.

438
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,930
When did you come back?

439
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,240
- Just now.
- Are you leaving again?

440
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,510
I have an appointment.

441
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,230
I tried to reach you yesterday.

442
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,960
I was busy.

443
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,030
Are you mad at me?

444
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,870
Do I even have the right to be mad?

445
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,790
- Honey.
- Ji Tae...

446
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,550
probably thinks that I caused his accident.

447
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,310
Let's keep it that way.

448
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,750
Don't get caught.

449
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,030
Yes?

450
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,710
Mr Yoon is here.

451
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,390
I came here myself...

452
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,230
because it's so hard to meet you these days.

453
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,920
I prepared this wild ginseng just for you.

454
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,230
Give it to Ji Tae once he gets discharged.

455
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,440
Thank you.

456
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
Sometimes in life,

457
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,870
things don't happen the way you want them to.

458
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,480
Things can get difficult once in a while.

459
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,790
Let us forget all about our sour past.

460
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,030
I recommended you again as the secretary general.

461
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,640
What's more important is one's competence,

462
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,870
not one's work experiences.

463
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,870
No matter how hard I think about it,

464
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:54,110
you're the only man I can truly trust.

465
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,520
Thank you.

466
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,920
Oh, and one more thing.

467
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,720
There's a nephew of mine...

468
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,590
who is around Ha Ru's age.

469
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,960
Should we put them on a blind date?

470
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Jeong Eun and Ji Tae just weren't meant to be.

471
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,480
We greatly appreciate the gesture.

472
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,750
But our daughter isn't very presentable.

473
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,270
I heard you quit being a prosecutor...

474
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,440
to become a politician.

475
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,070
Is the election next week?

476
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,550
I told my friends who live in your district...

477
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,990
to make sure they vote for you.

478
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,960
- What date is it today?
- Pardon?

479
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,960
When did we...

480
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,510
last meet?

481
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:27,150
It was back in high school. The umbrella...

482
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,760
Well,

483
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,110
I told you that I'd return to see you...

484
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,870
after I pass my bar exam.

485
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,790
Well, I passed the first exam.

486
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,790
You can give me the law book...

487
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,150
after I finally pass the entire exam.

488
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,920
I hope you become a congressman...

489
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,710
and make this country a better place.

490
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,790
My mum keeps saying that this country is hopeless.

491
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm glad there's someone noble like you.

492
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,510
Are you okay?

493
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,920
I'm fine.

494
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,310
I'm just tired.

495
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,510
In that case, I should leave.

496
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,870
Get some rest.

497
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,030
Stay healthy until the next time we meet.

00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,990
Is that you, Joon Young?

504
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,830
Hello.

505
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,070
What brings you here?

506
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,130
Can you teach us how to play cards?

507
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,800
People keep fooling us because we don't know the rules.

508
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,510
Oh, okay.

509
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,670
Where's your husband?

510
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,110
He had to go somewhere.

511
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,710
He'll be back soon.

512
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,270
Come in.

513
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,070

Yes, this is Joon Young's phone.

516
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,790
Why are you picking up his phone?

517
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,040
He left his phone on the kitchen table.

518
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,830
- Who is it?
- It's Producer Noh.

519
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,570
Producer Noh, where are you?

520
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,460
Aren't you going to bring in the videos?

521
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,840
Producer Yoon can't finish the editing process.

522
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,930
I heard you filmed him instead of Producer Yoon.

523
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,350
I couldn't film anything that day.

524
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,330
Joon Young was too sick.

525
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,350
Is this true?

526
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,250
I'm going to kill you if you're lying.

527
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,920
Why do you hate her so much?

528
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,120
I'm sorry, but right now,

00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,210
Joon Young is busy throwing a birthday party.

530
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,990
A birthday party?

531
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:30,250
Yes. It's my father's birthday.

532
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,480
I'll tell Joon Young that you called.

533
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,200
You're not telling him anything.

534
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,360
You can't let the reporters catch them together.

535
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,270
Also, Joon Young has no time to meet her.

536
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,790
How old are you?

537
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,950
Stop pinching your thigh.

538
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,310
Stop pinching your thigh to keep yourself from crying.

539
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,720
What are you talking about?

540
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,350

Fine. I'll wear mine, too.

00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,430
No.

550
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,690
She's busy.

551
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,730
How can she be busy?

552
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,570
She's such a weird mother.

553
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,840
He doesn't have much time left.

554
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,670
Excuse me, Sir.

555
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,010
I'm just saying...

556
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,530
Like I said, she is quite odd.

557
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,670
She's a huge baby, too.

558
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,170
All right.

559
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,630
Let Jeong Sik's birthday party begin.

560
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:10,530
Blow out the candles and make a wish.

561
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,550
Okay.

562
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,670
May I make a wish, too?

563
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,750
Sure. Go ahead.

564
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,310
Please take good care of my mum.

565
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,710
Don't let her suffer.

566
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,670
Don't let her get lonely.

567
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,630
Please stay beside her.

568
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,750
Okay.

569
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,030
I will...

570
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,670
take care...

571
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,470
of your mum with my life.

572
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,230
So don't worry about her.

573
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,910
Thank you, Jeong Sik.

574
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,670
I'll trust you with her.

575
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,670
I'll leave without worrying about her.

576
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,950
Who is that? Is that Ms Shin?

577
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,590
I came with Na Ri, but she said...

578
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,790
she can't bear to see you, so she's waiting outside.

579
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,630
She also...

580
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,190
wanted me to apologise to you...

581
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,990
on her behalf for something.

582
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:15,870
What?

583
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,790
When you and Na Ri used to date a long time ago,

584
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,830
she said she's partly responsible for the break up.

585
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,350
Na Ri said she cheated on you with another guy.

586
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,790
Na Ri was so confident about her looks back then,

587
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,950
so she thought men were like chips sold in stores...

588
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,330
that were available whenever she wanted them.

589
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,840
But after losing you, she said she finally realised...

590
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,350
what an awesome and cool person...

591
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,230
you really were.

592
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,630
Go Na Ri, you're so dead.

593
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,750
You were once my hero. Do you know that?

594
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:04,070
So am I not your hero any more?

595
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,150
Now, you're...

596
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,710
just a jerk.

597
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,230
If you want to become my hero again,

598
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,390
don't die and find a way to live.

599
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,510
My dad once told me that...

600
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,630
people die...

601
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,030
because they're lazy.

602
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,990
Because they get too lazy to breathe.

603
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:34,910
Okay.

604
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,070
I'll try my best to keep breathing.

605
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,750
Where's Eul?

606
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,090
Why do you ask me?

607
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,570
I called her earlier, and she said she was with you.

608
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,470
No, I haven't seen her...

609
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,670
Where are we?

610
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,310
This is a house I built for us.

611
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,030
Let's live here...

612
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,550
just for 500 years.

613
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,430
I'm so stupid.

614
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,150
How stupid.

615
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,790
I'm going to the US tomorrow...

616
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,630
with Minister Oh's second son.

617
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,750
If he seems okay, I might marry him.

618
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,710
I won't be back for a couple of years.

619
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,830
While you were lying here,

620
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:38,770
KJ Group reported you for embezzlement and malpractice.

621
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,710
You'll be summoned by the prosecution once you get out.

622
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,030
Why did you go down that road like a fool?

623
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,710
Even your own parents abandoned you.

624
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:52,550
Goodbye.

625
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,990
Stay healthy.

626
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,990
I'm sorry, Jeong Eun.

627
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,270
I should've told you to stop.

628
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,590
I am truly sorry.

629
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,750
When you escaped after a hit-and-run,

630
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,750
I shouldn't have just despised you.

631
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,670
I shouldn't have stayed silent.

632
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,710
I should've told you that what you did was wrong.

633
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,030
I should've persuaded you to turn yourself in.

634
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,910
You're getting away with it this time.

635
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,590
But one day, when you realise how wrong you were,

636
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,230
make sure you punish yourself.

637
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,550
You lived...

638
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,910
a wrongful life.

639
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,310
I'd like to sleep.

640
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,470
Please leave now.

642
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,230
Dad.

643
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,990
This will be...

644
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,710
the last time I call you that.

645
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,470
Also,

646
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:47,190
the fact that I'm your son...

647
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,910
I will consider it a disgrace...

648
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,670
and an embarrassment...

649
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,830
and shame until the day I die.

650
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,110
I hope you become a congressman...

651
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,710
and make this country a better place.

652
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,750
My mum keeps saying that this country is hopeless.

653
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:22,350
I'm glad there's someone noble like you.

654
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,230
Thinking that he's still my father,

655
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,350
I wanted to protect him.

656
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,230
So I killed...

657
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,990
my girlfriend.

658
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,710
Hello, this is Noh Eul.

659
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,070
Why did you give me this USB?

660
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,510
I wanted you...

661
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,670
to be the first one to see the video.

662
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,470
How can you trust me with this?

663
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,750
You already know...

664
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,990
what kind of person I am.

665
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,110
I do.

666
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,190
You're Joon Young's father.

667
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:09,990
Come in.

668
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,870
Eul.

669
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,390
Eul. Noh Eul.

670
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,230
Eul.

671
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,030
I'm sorry.

672
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,430
I'm so sorry.

673
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,510
I made a big mistake.

674
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,110
Eul.

675
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,630
You have a fever.

676
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,630
I'm okay.

677
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,070
You're not okay.

678
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,910
Why didn't you call me?

679
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,970
You should've called and said you're sick.

680
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:58,630
You should've told me to come right away.

681
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,110
I'm going to call an ambulance.

682
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,750
Eul.

683
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,450
I'm not going to a hospital.

684
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,510
Then what are you going to do about your fever?

685
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:17,710
- I'm not going.
- You might die.

686
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,270
I don't care.

687
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,110
Why not?

688
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,550
Do you want to die with me?

689
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:30,790
Do you want to go with me?

690
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:36,470
Why?

691
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:38,750
Can't I?

692
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,790
You can.

693
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,070
Let's die together.
