2
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,380
Talk to her one more time, Dad.

3
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,010
Okay.

4
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,290
What did he say?

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,570
She said she won't come no matter how big the award is.

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,010
Did you tell her how important this event is?

7
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,780
Of course I did.

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,170
I said ministers and congressmen would be here...

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,330
and that nothing must go wrong.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,450
I even told her that...

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,130
you might hang yourself if she didn't attend.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,490
I repeated myself more than enough.

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,900
Do you want to switch your mum?

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,650
There are mothers...

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,930
who'd be more than happy to have you as a son.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,810
Go and get me a sedative.

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,050
And tell my wife to bring my blood pressure medicine.

18
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,650
Didn't you say Producer Noh wasn't going to be here?

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,660
Yes, Joon Young told me to tell her not to come.

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,450
But I saw her outside with a camera.

21
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,410
Where is she?

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,690
Don't you remember me?

23
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,850
Do you know me?

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,530
She's a gold-digger.

25
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,810
She tried to get Joon Young, but her face got revealed,

26
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,690
so she failed before she could do anything.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,690
Ha Ru.

28
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,500
Did my daughter do this?

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,750
No.

30
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,010
It wasn't me. It was the kitten.

31
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,530
But it doesn't know any better. It's just a kitten.

32
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,690
Today's my father's memorial day.

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,450
Oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,690
Here.

35
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,390
I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,370
So don't be mad and take this.

37
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,840
Why are you giving her 50 dollars?

38
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,970
- This all costs less than three dollars.
- Ha Ru.

39
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,210
Here. Go on and take it.

40
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,170
You should apologise first.

41
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,530
Instead of giving her money,

42
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,650
you should apologise first.

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,810
I think...

44
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,050
you should apologise to me first.

45
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,930
I don't know how you know this lady,

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,770
but you rudely interrupted us.

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,450
Don't you have any manners?

48
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,530
Is this how your parents taught you?

49
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,890
I only asked you to admit your mistake...

50
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,170
and ask for forgiveness.

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,170
You want me to apologise because of something...

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,790
a stray cat did?

53
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,050
I asked you to...

54
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,530
admit your mistake and ask for...

55
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,290
I was mistaken about you.

56
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,170
I had no idea you were so reckless...

57
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,460
and wasted my time waiting for you.

58
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,850
I had a strange feeling that one day...

59
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,190
you would come for the book.

60
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,210
Because of that, I could never throw it away.

61
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,130
I didn't know you had changed so much.

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,090
Society's moral standards and hierarchy is falling,

63
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,930
but I'm still...

64
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,610
old enough to be your father.

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,850
I don't know how important a star is in Korea,

66
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,170
but learn some manners before fame goes to your head.

67
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,610
Then you can demand an apology.

68
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,970
Let's go, Ha Ru.

69
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,970
I told you not to come here. You never listen.

70
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,130
What are you doing?

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,060
Don't pick that up!

72
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,010
- Then should I throw it away?
- Yes!

73
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,810
I should've asked for more.

74
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,850
About 1,000 dollars more.

75
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,080
Hey.

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,690
You can't tear up money!

77
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,140
Leave it.

78
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,530
I said leave it. Are you a beggar?

79
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,890
Yes, I am. Didn't you know?

80
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,170
Just mind your own business.

81
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,610
What?

82
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,440
Joon Young.

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,090
Why are you out here? We were looking for you.

84
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,290
Wait for me.

85
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,970
President Nam says he'll accept the award...

86
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,130
instead of your mum.

87
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,170
Everyone kept saying that...

88
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,170
Joon Young's mother gave birth to him,

89
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,180
but I'm the one who made him a star.

90
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,110
I never said anything like that.

91
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,130
Me neither.

92
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,010
I know. I wasn't talking about you two.

93
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,890
Who said that?

94
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,010
Right, it was the makeup team.

95
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,910
Ms Jung, I'm ready for some makeup.

96
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,010
Give me your phone.

97
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,530
What for?

98
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,970
I said I won't go.

99
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,730
Are you bored, Gook Young?

100
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,290
Hurry up. Move it.

101
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,410
I'm hanging up. Don't call me again.

102
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,410
What did I do wrong?

103
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,930
What did I do?

104
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,570
Is it that wrong that I became a celebrity...

105
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,530
and not a prosecutor like you wanted?

106
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,410
You hated me for five years...

107
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,410
and disowned me as a son.

108
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,970
Was what I did that serious?

109
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,210
I believe a prosecutor...

110
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,970
should tell only the truth in any situation,

111
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,490
punish the wrongdoers...

112
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,090
and clear the names of the innocent.

113
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,360
But I'm not like that.

114
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,130
I told you dozens of times that I don't qualify!

115
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,770
I'm not cut out for the job.

116
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
If a person like me becomes a prosecutor,

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,440
then powerless and poor people like you...

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,050
can't survive in Korea.

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,610
Why don't you qualify?

120
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,640
Why aren't you cut out for the job?

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,620
You tried to save a girl from the school bullies...

122
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,000
and got suspended once.

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,050
Is it because...

124
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
I used to...

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
work at bars...

126
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,810
a long time ago?

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
Is it because I stole 300g of meat when you were young?

128
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Say I worked at the bar just so I could make a living.

129
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,760
And say that I returned the meat later on.

130
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,720
You shouldn't come.

131
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
I'll refuse the award.

132
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,000
Why would you do that?

133
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,320
Why are you changing? We have to leave soon.

134
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
- Joon Young.
- Joon Young.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
Joon Young. Joon Young.

136
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,560
Where are you going?

137
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,450
Move.

138
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,060
You've lost your mind.

139
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,790
The ceremony starts in 10 minutes.

140
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,930
I said I won't go.

141
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,660
This isn't like not showing up for some TV programme.

142
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,260
You know what kind of people are here today.

143
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,220
There are ministers and congressmen...

144
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,240
I said move.

145
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,800
Right now!

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,870
Gook Young, get help.

147
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,300
Our president just fainted.

148
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,320
What?

149
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
Take him to a hospital.

150
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,720
Joon Young.

151
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
Are you okay?

152
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,600
I felt fine a while ago. I don't understand.

154
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,810
I shouldn't have brought you here.

155
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,960
You're still too weak.

156
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,800
Is something wrong?

157
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,080
She's going home. Get the car.

158
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,120
Yes, Sir.

159
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Eul.

160
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,710
Were you scared?

161
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,830
- Drive safely.
- Yes, Sir.

162
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,720
Aren't you coming with us?

163
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,730
It would look bad if we all left.

164
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,190
It's an official event.

165
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,670
Go home. I'll come home shortly.

166
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,750
Okay.

167
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,270
Ha Ru, look after your mother.

168
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,030
My goodness, Ha Ru.

169
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,910
Ha Ru.

170
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,310
We should go.

171
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,270
Get some rest. Don't think too much.

172
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,350
I don't deserve such a position.

173
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,750
Thank you, Congressman Kim.

174
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,390
You think of me too highly.

175
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,030
Of course I'll buy you drinks.

176
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,230
59th.

177
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,710
Eul came in 59th in her whole year.

178
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,560
Let me see.

179
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,030
You came in 138th in the last exam.

180
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,310
How many kids did you overtake?

181
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,030
That's nothing, Dad.

182
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,520
I just never studied hard before.

183
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,330
Once I put my mind to it,

184
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,390
I realised nothing's easier than studying.

185
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,430
Dad, I want tangsuyuk.

186
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,790
Okay, okay.

187
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,590
I'll buy anything you want.

188
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,350
Just name it.

189
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,150
Sir, can we get a tangsuyuk?

190
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,870
- A small one.
- Don't order tangsuyuk.

191
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,280
Did you want tangsuyuk that badly that you had to fool Dad?

192
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,360
Hey.

193
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,240
What is he talking about?

194
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,360
She lied to you, Dad.

195
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,120
She came in 159th, not 59th.

196
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,990
She scratched off the number one with...

197
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,790
What are you talking about?

198
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,600
It's true.

199
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,670
- Noh Jik!
- Noh Eul!

200
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,360
- Come closer.
- My gosh.

201
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,520
You altered your report card to deceive me, did you?

202
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,280
What will you be when you grow up?

203
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,310
I'm sorry, Dad.

204
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,550
I won't do it again.

205
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,430
Dad, I love you.

206
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,230
Dad.

207
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,430
Stop!

208
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,730
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

209
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,950
No. It wasn't him.

210
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,770
My father was hit by a female driver who drove...

211
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,310
a red sports car with plate number Seoul-3G-3126.

212
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,470
I'm sorry. I deserve to die.

213
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,670
After Prosecutor Choi Hyun Joon stepped in,

214
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,990
everything changed.

215
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,790
A different driver, a different car,

216
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,570
different witness statements...

217
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,120
and a different prosecutor.

218
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,950
Choi Hyun Joon?

219
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,150
Who is he?

220
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,510
An egg can't break a rock.

221
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,230
It's not a fight you can win.

222
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,910
Eul.

223
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,470
Keep quiet and settle.

224
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,750
And just get on with your life.

225
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,070
Are you okay?

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,590
Is there a doctor? Is there a doctor?

228
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,600
Doctor!

229
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,470
Where's the doctor?

230
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,120
Is there a doctor?

231

Where is the doctor?

Is there a doctor?

233

Doctor!

234

Where is the doctor?

235
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,200
Doctor!

236
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,270
I had to let you go

237
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,410
Now my heart feels so empty

238
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,990
Turn it down, Ha Ru.

239
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,290
No one else but you

240
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,490
Mr Park.

Your mum's sick.

243
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,910
So am I.

244
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,910
I'm in way more pain.

245
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,830
Do you know what Dad said to Joon Young?

246
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,430
How am I supposed to face him after that?

247
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,110
The touch of your hand

248
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,240
Is like the wind that never blows

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,790
Hello?

251
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,510
Ha Ru, I'm on the phone.

252
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,550
Speak up.

253
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,110
What?

254
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,630
Turn it off, Ha Ru!

255
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,830
Turn it off.

256
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,550
Say that again.

257
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,190
What happened?

258
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,310
He was almost hit by an oncoming car.

259
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,630
Shin Joon Young saved him.

260
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,190
Why?

261
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,910
Pardon?

262
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,390
The young lady.

263
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,350
Why did she want to hit me?

264
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,430
Did what I say infuriate her that much?

265
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,070
The police will investigate soon.

266
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,430
No.

267
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,990
There's no need to make it big.

268
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,030
I'd say she's younger than Ji Tae.

269
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,550
Let it slide.

270
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,650
Sir.

271
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,110
Call the police and tell them.

272
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,310
Say she was an inexperienced driver.

273
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,910
Yes, Sir.

274
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,910
I also thanked Mr Shin on your behalf.

275
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,710
He saved your life.

276
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,990
It's not a fracture,

277
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,370
but there's a crack in your shoulder bone.

278
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,150
Take things slowly while it heals.

279
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,470
I'm Choi Ji Tae, Director of KJ Group.

280
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,150
Thank you for saving my father.

281
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,790
Congressman Choi is my father.

282
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,470
That's why I gave up on Eul.

283
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,390
Because he's my father.

284
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,510
So what?

285
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,990
Sorry for leaving you there.

286
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,270
I'm sorry.

287
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,670
I'm sorry.

How can I help you, Sir?

290
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,050
I'm still editing.

291
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,830
What kind of show takes a whole week to edit?

292
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,590
You haven't been home for a while now.

293
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,230
I'll find a job. Can't you take some time off?

294
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,510
Okay.

295
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,190
Send me a photo of each of your three meals.

296
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,270
I'm just worried that you might not be eating properly.

297
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,870
Make sure you send me the photos.

298
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,670
If you don't, I'll pack a lunchbox and come over.

299
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,790
This is so upsetting.

300
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,390
Give me the cat, please.

301
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,990
Did you just say "please"?

302
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,830
You said you're older.

303
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,190
Where is it?

304
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,990
Where's the cat?

305
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,790
Gone.

306
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,150
Did you lose it?

307
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,590
Did you get rid of it?

308
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,660
No, well...

309
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,880
It was there when I went to class,

310
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,030
but while I went to get some coffee...

311
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,310
- You got rid of it.
- I did not.

312
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,710
I lost it. I swear.

313
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,750
Do you...

314
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,950
Do you know that you're really handsome?

315
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,110
Hey!

316
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,110
Let's go on a trip, Eul.

317
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,470
Let's go to a place where no one can find us.

318
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,510
Just for one month.

Just tag along.

322
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,390
I'll look only at you.

323
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,550
You'll look only at me.

324
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,510
We'll ignore the world. Plug our ears...

325
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,070
and close our eyes.

326
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,270
I'm sorry, but...

327
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,230
could I borrow your makeup?

328
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,430
Thank you.

329
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,790
Don't think.

330
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,710
Don't listen to anyone.

331
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,270
Let's go away for a month and pretend like...

332
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,910
we're the last ones on earth.

333
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,590
It fits perfectly.

335
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,910
Let's not...

336
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,030
make it a month.

337
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,990
Let's go for a year.

338
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,630
Let's go for 10 years.

339
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,750
I'd love that.

340
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,350
It's a deal.

341
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,350
Will you hit me if I ask for a kiss?

342
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,710
I'll kill you.

343
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,350
This situation...

344
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,870
calls for...

345
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,790
more than a kiss.

346
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,430
Wait here. I'll get the car.

347
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,230
Perfect.

Yes. Who are you?

354
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,900
You have the right to remain silent,

355
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,270
the right to a lawyer,

356
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,340
and the right to refuse to speak in court.

357
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,390
Come with us.

358
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,160
Wait. Just a moment.

359
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,240
Wait.

364
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,630
Find out where they took her.

365
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,280
You're locked in.

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Open up.

373
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,790
Open the door before I kill you!

374
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,310
Over my dead body.

375
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,830
I agree with President Nam this time.

376
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,350
Think of how you got here.

377
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,190
You can't ruin everything for a girl!

378
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,310
Let me out right now.

379
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,470
Get a grip, Joon Young.

380
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,670
Jang Gook Young!

381
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,760
Open the door!

382
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,280
Let me out.

383
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,630
Please let me out.

384
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,990
Open the door.

385
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,670
Open up.

386
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
Open the door!

387
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,790
Let me out!

388
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,630
I have to get out.

391
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,190
You didn't touch it.

392
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,870
Why did you try to kill Congressman Choi?

393
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,310
Why did you try to kill him?

394
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,350
Will you say something?

395
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,470
How is it, Dad?

396
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,550
I should reconsider...

397
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,310
marrying you off.

398
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,600
Why?

399
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,010
Does it taste that bad?

400
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,240
You're pretty, smart and even a great cook.

401
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,760
Giving you to Ji Tae for free is a loss on my part.

402
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,510
I will visit you every day.

403
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,250
I'll have breakfast with you.

404
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,430
And lunch, too.

405
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,650
Maybe even dinner.

406
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,950
You aren't even a politician and you make big promises.

407
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,310
Dad.

408
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,540
Yes?

409
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,310
What happened to that man?

410
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,470
Which man?

411
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,870
The man I hit with my car a long time ago.

412
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,910
Why are you asking?

413
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,430
For no reason.

414
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,590
He appeared in my dream last night.

415
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,280
I felt horrible all day.

416
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,390
He died.

417
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Good.

418
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,990
I heard he was in a coma.

419
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,430
He seemed poor.

420
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,570
If he were still in a coma,

421
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,720
he'd only be a burden to his family.

422
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,910
I guess so.

423
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,310
It's best that he died...

424
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,030
rather than having to live in that state.

425
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,070
Dad.

426
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,590
Where's this wine from?

427
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,870
Can you get me a bottle?

428
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,190
Let me earn some brownie points from Ji Tae's father.

429
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,430
What did you say?

430
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,990
My wife did what?

431
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,670
Haven't you killed it yet?

432
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,770
I can't do it.

433
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,790
It's looking up at me.

434
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,510
You'll never make sushi at this rate.

435
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,430
- Let me do it.
- My goodness.

436
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,370
I can't watch.

437
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,990
Take it outside.

438
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,510
Ji Tae, you're home early.

439
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,380
Have you eaten?

440
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,630
Wait just a bit.

441
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,280
Your mother will make you some sushi.

442
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,050
I told you to take it outside.

443
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,030
Did you sue Producer Noh?

444
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,910
Ms Jang.

445
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,910
Get a bottle of wine from the third row of the cellar.

446
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,910
Sure.

447
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:21,910
Why?

448
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,510
Was it because she tried to hit Dad?

449
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,190
Did that make you angry?

450
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,750
Did you have to vent in such a childish way?

451
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,350
I have no idea what you're talking about.

452
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,630
Your father will be home soon. Get changed.

453
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,350
You crushed her three years ago as well.

454
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,310
She investigated our company's illegal funds.

455
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,470
It was true, but...

456
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,550
you sued her for making false accusations and libel.

457
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,190
She lost the lawsuit that you influenced.

458
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,360
She's still running from loan sharks...

459
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,430
whom she borrowed money from to pay the fine.

460
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,510
I told you to get changed.

461
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,590
Don't you feel any remorse?

462
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,430
- Ji Tae.
- A human being...

463
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,910
If you're a human being,

464
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,710
then you must feel some sort of guilt...

465
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,720
for ruining Noh Eul's life...

466
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,390
alongside Dad!

467
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,230
Noh Eul.

468
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,510
Noh Eul.

469
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,270
I'm Noh Jang Soo's daughter Noh Eul.

470
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,950
Remember me.

471
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,230
Don't ever forget me.

472
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,230
Joon Young.

473
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,030
It's me.

474
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,550
Joon Young!

475
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:41,990
Joon Young.

476
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,070
Joon Young!

477
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,510
Joon Young.

478
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,670
Please help my sister.

479
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,350
The more I think about it,

480
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,110
you're the only one who can help her.

481
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,910
Of the people we know,

482
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,790
you're the only one with power and connections.

483
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,230
Only you can help my sister.

484
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,150
Joon Young, please...

485
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,390
Joon Young.

486
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,150
Joon Young.

487
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,550
Help us.

489
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,600
It's me, your lawyer.

490
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,310
You didn't answer your phone, so I called you at home.

491
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,230
Okay. Do you know...

492
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,870
where she is?

493
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,110
I think she's at Seocho Police Station.

494
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,110
Get her out.

495
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,590
Mr Pyo.

496
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,710
Go and...

497
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,070
Joon Young, are you okay?

498
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,870
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you there.

499
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,550
Why not?

500
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:03,390
President Nam just called me.

501
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,350
He told me not to get involved with Noh Eul's case.

502
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,270
Joon Young.

503
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,510
I'm really sorry.

504
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,030
You need to warm your throat when you have a cough.

505
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,670
Wear my scarf.

506
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,390
It looks delicious.

507
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,670
- My goodness.
- Enjoy your meal.

508
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:10,290
Our yukgaejang is made with the best meat and broth...

509
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,310
Please enjoy your meal. Tell us if you want more.

510
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,830
Let go.

511
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:22,270
- Take this off.
- I won't.

512
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,790
You wore it for three days straight to boil the broth,

513
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,490
broil the meat and cook the stew.

514
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,730
Are you retaliating?

515
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:28,970
Now do you get it?

516
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,910
Young Deuk, go and get my sewing kit.

517
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:31,990
What for?

518
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,790
To sew this onto his skin.

519
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,430
Fine, go ahead.

520
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,400
It's the most expensive outfit I ever wore.

521
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,790
I'd love to keep it on.

522
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,520
- Ms Shin.
- Fine.

523
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,890
Splash water on me.

524
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,510
I won't take it off even if you throw poop at me.

525
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,370
It's Joon Young.

526
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,090
- Don't take it. Don't pick up.
- Let go.

527
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,130
Joon Young, I really meant to go.

528
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,030
I wore the tuxedo you sent...

529
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,270
and even prepared for an interview,

530
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,350
but your mum suddenly went...

531
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,950
Joon Young.

532
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,550
Hello?

533
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,510
Are you sick?

534
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,950
What's wrong? You sound so weak.

535
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,750
Did someone beat you up?

536
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,150
Shall I put your mum on the phone?

537
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,790
Mum.

538
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,470
Mum.

539
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,830
Help me.

540
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,320
I knew that Nam Goong guy was a freak.

541
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,010
That evil president.

542
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,230
How dare he lock Joon Young up.

543
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,110
He only cares about money.

544
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,190
I knew he was weird the day he let out a fake scandal.

545
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,910
I should beat him for three days,

546
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,750
then wake up and continue beating him.

547
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,870
Be quiet and drive.

548
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,190
Okay.

549
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,310
Good for you.

550
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,270
How loving and caring you are.

551
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,230
Dad.

552
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,150
Are you a rescuer? Are you Batman or Superman?

553
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,590
Why give away your coat when you're shivering?

554
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,910
Dad...

555
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,710
Don't you dare cry.

556
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,590
You can't survive the cruel world if you're so weak.

557
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,790
If you're like this,

558
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,870
how will I ever rest in peace?

559
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,310
That's why...

560
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,990
I took the money.

561
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,990
I took the money Choi Hyun Joon offered.

562
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,150
I took it...

563
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,030
and tried to forget about you.

564
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,310
I settled, Dad.

565
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,830
I thought I'd die if I didn't.

566
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,150
I took the money.

567
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,790
Who would care for Jik if I died too?

568
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,030
I wanted to die,

569
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,070
but I couldn't stand the idea of leaving him alone.

570
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,510
So I took the money.

571
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,510
Good job.

572
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,070
You did the right thing.

573
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,750
Dad.

574
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,590
I'm sorry, Eul.

575
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,150
I'm so sorry.

576
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,150
Dad.

577
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,910
It's so hard.

578
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,990
Can't you take me to where you are?

579
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,150
Mum...

580
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,470
How dare they...

581
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,510
lock you up when you're so sick.

582
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,870
Get up. Let's get you to a hospital.

583
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:32,870
Get up.

584
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:35,670
Let's go.

585
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,150
Come with me.

586
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,230
I have to see Eul.

587
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:44,790
Help me.

588
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,150
I need to go to her. Please help.

589
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,790
Mum.

590
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,530
