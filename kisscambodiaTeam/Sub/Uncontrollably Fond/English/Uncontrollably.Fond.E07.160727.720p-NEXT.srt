2
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,260
I came all the way here to take you to that island.

3
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,820
But I'll just go alone.

4
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,700
If I take you,

5
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,460
I'll want to hide you there...

6
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,260
so that you won't be able to go to anyone else.

7
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,660
So don't ever appear before me.

8
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,020
If I ever see you again,

9
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,060
I'm going to take you away.

10
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,220
How can you sleep?

11
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,340
How can you sleep when everyone's worried sick?

12
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,380
You aren't in a movie.

13
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,140
Trying to be an actor, are you?

14
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,060
Stupid me.

15
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,350
I can't believe what I did because I was worried.

16
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,800
I took a taxi here all the way from Seoul.

17
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,710
I waited in the freezing cold for a boat.

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,340
I also got bitten by a seagull.

19
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,580
Gosh, my money.

20
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,580
I could've fed Jik meat for days with that money.

21
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
One.

22
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,700
Do you think this is a dream?

23
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,300
It's not. I really am Eul.

24
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,220
I came all the way here to find you.

25
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
Two.

26
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,740
My goodness.

27
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,220
You really do think it's a dream, don't you?

28
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,020
It's me, Eul.

29
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,060
Three.

30
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
Unbelievable.

31
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,820
I should pinch you awake.

32
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,630
Go.

33
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,950
- What?
- Go away.

34
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,900
- What?
- Get out of my sight.

35
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,980
What should I do?

36
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,020
I guess I really did make a huge mistake.

37
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,900
What else did I do wrong?

38
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,440
If I ever drink again, I'm a real dog.

39
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,580
My goodness.

40
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,700
- Here. You didn't eat breakfast, right?
- Ouch.

41
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,140
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,100
Didn't I tell you?

43
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,140
I'm weird when I'm drunk.

44
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,300
The worst thing is that I don't remember a thing.

45
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Four.

46
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm not sure what I did,

47
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,740
so I don't know what I should be sorry about.

48
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,460
Gosh, I really do want to apologise.

49
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,940
Why can't I remember anything?

50
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Darn it.

51
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,980
Five.

52
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,540
(HUSBAND)

53
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Mister.

54
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,100
Why haven't you been picking up?

55
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
Where are you?

56
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,300
Well, the thing is,

57
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,420
I had an emergency.

58
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm sorry for leaving without saying goodbye.

59
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,460
Are you with Shin Joon Young?

60
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
No.

61
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
Yes.

62
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,540
I made a huge mistake to him.

63
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
I'm sorry, but I'll call you back later.

64
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,940
Going up.

65
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,340
The doors are closing.

66
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,780
Sir, take a look at this.

67
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,660
What's this?

68
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,770
I believe Ms Yoon saw those photos.

69
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,020
I thought you stopped the reporters.

70
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
I'm sorry, Sir.

71
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,220
Did you go to Shin Joon Young's concert last night?

72
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,520
I think she started doing...

73
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,340
a background check on Producer Noh.

74
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,460
Why can't I remember anything?

75
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,260
Stupid.

76
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,740
Stupid me.

77
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,940
I can't even remember a single moment.

78
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,410
Hey.

79
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,110
- Something's on your shoe.
- Six.

80
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,540
Aren't you hungry?

81
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,860
I'll buy.

82
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,080
Let's eat before we go.

83
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,110
Please?

84
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,230
Fine.

85
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
I did throw a fit while I was drunk.

86
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,580
So what?

87
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,200
My dad told me that people who hold grudges...

88
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,660
about being drunk are the pettiest people on earth.

89
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,060
He told me to never befriend anyone like that.

90
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,990
Seven.

91
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,740
Do you want to hit me?

92
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Go ahead.

93
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,740
Hit me until you feel better.

94
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,860
Here.

95
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,990
Eight.

96
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,980
Gosh, you hold your grudges for a long time.

97
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,980
How can you be so unforgiving?

98
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,470
Honestly, you're the reason I got drunk.

99
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,340
You're the contributor.

100
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,860
Shouldn't you be apologising instead?

101
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,240
Get out.

102
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,260
No.

103
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Nine.

104
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Taxi.

105
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,580
I really don't remember.

106
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,980
I really don't know what I did...

107
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,710
to make you this mad.

108
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,880
Nine and a half.

109
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,830
I remember you carrying me on your back.

110
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,000
Nine and a half and a quarter.

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,840
I also remember throwing up on your back.

112
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,440
Nine and a half and a quarter and an eighth.

113
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,740
You changed...

114
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,940
I also remember you helping me get changed.

115
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
I remember you confessing...

116
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Hey.

117
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,240
Your car's right there. Why are you taking a taxi?

118
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,420
Do you have money to burn?

119
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,580
Where may I take you?

120
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,940
To Seoul, please.

121
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,440
Hey, hurry up and wake up.

122
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,740
Oh, hey.

123
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,620
Where's... Where's Joon Young?

124
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,830
He left his car and took a taxi?

125
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,780
What in the world did you do to Joon Young?

126
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,260
Exactly.

127
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,900
What did I do?

128
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,460
What do you think I did...

129
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,460
to make him so angry?

130
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,940
Why are you asking me?

131
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,060
That's true.

132
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm pretty sure I did something very wrong.

133
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,640
I can't remember a thing. I really can't.

134
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,040
My goodness.

135
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,380
That's not going to help.

136
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,750
Doing this helped me remember a few things.

137
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,820
Really?

138
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,660
Then come over here. Come on.

139
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,220
Do you remember anything?

140
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,900
Excuse me, Sir. May I borrow your phone?

141
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,060
Are... Are you Shin Joon Young?

142
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,160
My goodness.

143
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,580
Here you go again.

144
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,170
Stop it. Why are you taking my food?

145
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,920
Give it to me. Hey, Young Deuk.

146
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,030
What were you doing?

147
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,130
Didn't I tell you to take it away...

148
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,510
when she mixes everything in a bowl?

149
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,790
- I forgot.
- Give it back.

150
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,840
Stop.

151
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,660
Hurry up and spit it out.

152
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,130
You already have a small stomach.

153
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,320
How are you going to digest everything?

154
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,480
Come on. Spit everything you have in your mouth.

155
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,880
Who is it?

156
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Hello?

157
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,040
It's me, Mum. You must've been worried.

158
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm sorry, but you have the wrong number.

159
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,160
It's Joon Young, right? It was him who called, right?

160
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,840
It wasn't him.

161
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,940
Really? Let me check, then.

162
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,840
Jeong Sik!

163
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,940
Mum.

164
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,160
It's not your mum. It's me, Jeong Sik.

165
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,640
Hey, Jeong Sik.

166
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Are you insane or what?

167
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,370
Do you know what you've done to your mum?

168
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,280
Goodness, do you know how worried she was?

169
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,680
Stop lying. I wasn't worried about him.

170
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,250
Hang up. Hang up the phone. My goodness.

171
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,600
Joon Young, right now, your mum is eating...

172
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,540
bibimbap in a huge bowl.

173
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,160
You know what that means, right?

174
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,500
- Jeong Sik!
- That means...

175
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,060
your mum is insanely worried about you right now.

176
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,080
You know that, right?

177
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Ouch.

178
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,700
My goodness.

179
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,060
Hang up.

180
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,240
I know.

181
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,040
I know how much Mum's worried about me.

182
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,360
But how did you end up...

183
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,780
getting involved with a gold digger?

184
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,180
My goodness, did you forget already?

185
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,900
Gook Young got involved with a gold digger,

186
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,980
lost all of my assets...

187
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,900
down to a single underwear.

188
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,570
Don't you remember what happened?

189
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,090
Gook Young even went to prison because of her.

190
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,010
Don't you...

191
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,470
remember how you covered for him...

192
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,170
with your front money?

193
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,330
She's not a gold digger.

194
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,360
What?

195
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,920
Is she a silver digger, then?

196
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,740
I thought you were a star.

197
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,360
You said you were amazingly rich.

198
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,800
But how can you have such bad taste in women?

199
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
How dare you let such a...

200
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
I like her, Mum.

201
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,040
What?

202
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,770
I just recently figured it out myself.

203
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,250
I actually love her...

204
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,840
a lot.

205
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,770
My goodness. This is a bad one.

206
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,690
Joon Young, you need to get a grip.

207
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,120
That's why I'm running away.

208
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,320
If I continue to see her,

209
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,320
I wasn't sure of what I'd do.

210
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,850
So I'm running away from her.

211
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,730
He wasn't joking?

212
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,960
Yes. That's what I believe.

213
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,160
I'm sorry to say this, but I think...

214
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,640
Joon Young really likes you.

215
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,780
He even kicked out Pororo...

216
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,760
when he found out you were allergic to dogs.

217
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,660
- Unbelievable.
- Of course.

218
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,070
There are so many better women out there.

219
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,860
This just isn't possible.

220
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,920
Exactly.

221
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,880
He must be insane.

222
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,180
Why would he like me?

223
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,860
My goodness. You're a decent woman.

224
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,680
You actually acknowledge the truth.

225
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,010
That's something I like about you.

226
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,440
I mean, of course,

227
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,720
Prince Charming did marry...

228
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,000
the unfortunate Cinderella.

229
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
But Cinderella was a nice girl.

230
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,540
She was diligent and honest, too.

231
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm nice, too.

232
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,120
I'm diligent...

233
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,680
and honest.

234
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,280
But come to think of it,

235
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,520
he did look a little sick these days.

236
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,440
When he was shooting his last drama,

237
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,250
he got hit hard on the head by a wooden stick.

238
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,760
Maybe his brain swelled up.

239
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,590
I heard that...

240
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,480
you can't think straight if your brain swells up.

241
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,140
I should take him to a doctor soon.

242
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,520
My gosh.

243
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,850
That's enough.

244
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
I'm sitting right here.

245
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Do you really not remember what you said to him?

246
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,240
But...

247
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,090
if Joon Young wasn't joking...

248
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,000
and was telling the truth...

249
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,640
If he really likes me,

250
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,560
what should I do?

251
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,160
I'll take you to a doctor along with Joon Young.

252
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm so sorry, Sir.

253
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,480
Can you go back and drive to the back door?

254
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,240
How have you been?

255
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,120
You must be hungry.

256
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,800
I'm sorry. I'll go and get you some food.

259
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,880
Shin Joon Young is in critical condition?

260
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,620
A brainstem glioma?

261
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes. Apparently, it's in a bad location...

262
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
and hard to operate.

263
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,610
Joon Young himself is also avoiding...

264
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,400
hospitalisation and treatment.

265
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,570
His mum doesn't know about this, does she?

266
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,240
Yes. He asked to keep it a secret...

267
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,440
from his family and company.

268
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
This is sad news...

269
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
for Joon Young and his mum.

270
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,480
He's not qualified.

271
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,000
I understand that you like him,

272
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,010
but he's not helpful to our party.

273
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,860
Mr Choi, you're a bit too much.

274
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,500
Mr Kang, you know this, too.

275
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,540
He was charged with stock manipulation,

276
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,280
embezzlement, malpractice and tax evasion.

277
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,160
He's still being investigated by prosecution.

278
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
It doesn't make sense to recommend someone like him...

279
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,660
as our proportional representation candidate.

280
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,300
He'll soon be cleared of all those charges.

281
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,920
- There's no need to...
- That's just temporary.

282
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,480
This matter will blow up again one day.

283
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,280
I'm sure...

284
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,320
everyone here has made a few mistakes in life.

285
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,440
In the process of achieving big things,

286
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,720
making a few mistakes is inevitable.

287
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,200
Politics is all about helping each other in need.

288
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,920
That kind of politics leaves regrets.

289
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,400
It makes you do things...

290
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,160
even when you don't want to.

291
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,960
Mr Choi, you must have a lot of free time.

292
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,000
How do you have the time to regret?

293
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,720
That scum.

294
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,520
What is it?

295
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,260
What's going on?

296
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,440
Ms Jang, these people keep bashing Joon Young.

297
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,120
My goodness, I thought there was a fire or something.

298
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,680
"He's not everyone's lover."

299
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,800
"How do you feel after betraying your fans for a girl?"

300
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,610
"Joon Young betrayed me. I'm going to sue him."

301
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,950
Unbelievable.

302
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,910
And look at this.

303
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,180
My goodness.

304
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,030
"Same design, different betrayal."

305
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,650
This is Joon Young's movie. Who did this?

306
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,490
"We all got betrayed because of his first love."

307
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,260
My gosh. Why do people make an effort to create these?

308
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,760
They must have a lot of time.

309
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Ms Jang.

310
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
You know that it's my dream to marry Joon Young, right?

311
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,080
I told you, you can't do that.

312
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,220
His past?

313
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,840
I don't care about things like that.

314
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,160
But I have no idea if he's dead or alive.

315
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Ms Jang.

316
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,400
Can you bring me more perfume?

317
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,700
You've already used a lot.

318
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,400
Stop making a fuss and come out.

319
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,300
No.

320
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,720
I still smell like garbage.

321
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,720
You don't smell like anything.

322
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I can only smell flowers.

323
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,280
Come right out before your body swells up.

324
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,180
I still smell bad.

325
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,940
Jik, that jerk.

326
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,480
I'm going to get back at him.

327
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,820
- Who?
- Lee Hyun Woo.

328
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,360
He's preparing for a civil service exam.

329
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,120
Which room is he in?

330
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,040
Lee Hyun Woo?

331
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,980
I've never heard of that name.

332
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,020
That's weird. He lived here for over two years.

333
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Just a second.

334
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,220
This is him.

335
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,500
I've never seen him.

336
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,620
That can't be. Can you take another look?

337
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,640
Let's see...

Where are you?

340
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,460
I'm at your place.

341
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,560
My place?

342
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,160
I actually moved.

343
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,490
Didn't I tell you?

344
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,040
No, you didn't.

345
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,620
Where did you move to?

346
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,890
I'll go there.

347
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,400
It's all right.

348
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Something came up at home, so I'm at Daejeon.

349
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,400
Why? Is this urgent?

350
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,520
I'm on my way back to Seoul,

351
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,920
so I'll go to that store you work at.

352
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,680
Okay. See you.

353
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Hey.

354
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Why were you looking for me so urgently?

355
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
It's nothing.

356
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,920
Here. This is the most expensive drink here.

357
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,320
What's this for?

358
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,180
What is it?

359
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,060
I still have 10 minutes until my shift ends,

360
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,560
so I'll make it short and quick.

361
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Okay.

362
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,120
My sister used to have a crush on Joon Young.

363
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,500
It's when we lived in Suyu-ri.

364
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,960
I saw what she wrote in her diary.

365
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,640
She gave up on him because he was Na Ri's boyfriend.

366
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,300
So she'll probably easily fall for him...

367
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,480
if he starts to show interest in her.

368
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,960
But isn't it a good thing...

369
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,920
if a superstar like him likes Eul?

370
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,480
Joon Young and my sister are...

371
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,660
living in different worlds now.

372
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,920
She needs to meet someone similar.

373
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,160
Someone who lives, eats...

374
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,080
and dresses like her.

375
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,200
Someone who has the same view in life.

376
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
So...

377
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,400
what is it that you're trying to say?

378
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,000
Can you hold her down?

379
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,640
You're the only one who can...

380
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,400
bring her back to reality.

381
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Please?

382
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,620
Ouch.

383
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,840
Where are the gloves?

384
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,060
When did you wake up?

385
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,980
You seemed to be asleep, so I didn't wake you.

387
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,460
Your manager let me in through the back door.

388
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,660
Your front door was filled with reporters.

389
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,280
Nine...

390
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,510
and a half and a quarter and an eighth and a sixteenth.

391
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,920
I'm fine now.

392
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,060
I have thick fingers, so it doesn't really hurt.

393
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,620
Where are you going?

394
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,180
Aren't you going to eat?

395
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,660
My gosh.

396
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,460
I put in so much effort to cook that.

397
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,740
Forget it. Don't eat, then.

398
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,780
I'm going to eat it all.

399
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,900
Whatever.

400
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,060
All that matters is the taste.

401
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,900
Gosh, that's salty.

402
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,220
Come to think of it,

403
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,460
does he think I have a disease or what?

404
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,340
Why does he keep avoiding me?

405
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,020
If he's mad, he can just tell me what he's mad about.

406
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,220
Gosh, how petty.

407
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,580
Hey. What are you doing?

408
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,300
He turned the lights on and turned them off again?

409
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,660
My goodness. What in the world are you imagining?

410
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,020
Reporter Kim, why are you being like this?

411
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,420
I just sent the housekeeper there to feed his dog.

412
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,000
Joon Young really isn't at home.

413
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,200
Stop wasting your time and just go home.

414
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Aren't your kids waiting for you?

415
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,160
Best comments of the day.

416
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,620
"No one has seen Joon Young or Eul for two days."

417
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,310
"Maybe they committed suicide like Romeo and Juliet."

418
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,940
To be honest, Joon Young just called me and said...

419
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,780
he did what he did out of stress.

420
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,740
He acted without thinking, and he regrets what he did.

421
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,790
So I told him that...

422
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,620
anyone in his shoes would've gone crazy...

423
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,840
and that he should go somewhere to take a few days off.

424
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,720
Wow, Producer Noh.

425
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,160
"Will she become a Juliet instead of a gold digger?"

426
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,700
Can't you go through a day without those comments?

427
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,580
Of course.

428
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,420
He's definitely...

429
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,580
not by himself.

430
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
He's with his manager.

431
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,270
Producer Noh is probably already in Seoul.

432
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,420
Call her if you don't believe me.

433
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,500
Hello.

434
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,020
Yes. If Joon Young really likes Producer Noh,

435
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,380
I'll kill myself in front of you.

436
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,800
Yes. If he has that bad of a taste in women,

437
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,250
I will give up my career and my life.

438
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,580
You shouldn't promise him that so easily.

439
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,830
My gosh.

440
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,180
To be honest,

441
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,020
Joon Young actually has a girlfriend.

442
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,420
Who?

443
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,140
Kim Yoo Na.

444
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,510
Yes. Yoo Na, the actress in my agency.

445
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,920
She's dating Joon Young right now.

446
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,790
What are you talking about?

447
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,660
It's been about a year.

448
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,620
Someone reporter kept on...

449
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,360
coming after Joon Young and Yoo Na,

450
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,540
so this was all a performance to draw his eyes away.

451
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,420
Are you satisfied now?

452
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,100
Are these Christmas roses again?

453
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,040
I believe Ms Yoon saw those pictures.

454
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,580
They suit you well.

455
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,220
Thank you, Ji Tae.

456
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,200
I think she started doing...

457
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,070
a background check on Producer Noh.

458
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,180
Do you want another glass of wine?

459
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,740
Forget the wine.

460
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,340
I want something else.

461
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
I want a kiss.

462
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,310
Here?

463
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,790
Why not? We'll get married soon, anyway.

464
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,660
I heard you saw that picture.

465
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,420
The picture of Shin Joon Young, me and that girl.

466
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,400
Her name is Noh Eul, and she's 28 years old.

467
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,200
She's a freelance documentary producer.

468
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,520
She graduated from Korea National Open University.

469
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,660
Her parents passed away, and she has a younger brother.

470
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,830
You don't need to do a background check on her.

471
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,270
What are you getting at?

472
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,200
I wanted to save you the trouble.

473
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,310
What is your relationship...

474
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,540
with that girl?

475
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,270
I won't answer that question.

476
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,660
- What?
- If I answer that question,

477
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,660
I won't be able to keep my promise to you.

478
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,740
Answer me.

479
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,620
Do you like her?

480
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,220
Let's have another glass of wine.

481
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,660
Answer me, Ji Tae.

482
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,700
I'm asking you.

483
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,310
Answer me, Choi Ji Tae!

484
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
I do.

485
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,380
I like her.

486
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,310
I heard that...

487
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,140
a Christmas rose means this.

488
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,220
"I have nothing to give to you."

489
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,830
Is that right?

490
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
It is.

491
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,540
I will make sure...

492
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
you regret...

493
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,270
this moment.

494
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,180
The reporters are still here.

495
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,340
The back door is covered with them, too.

496
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,460
They'll think I'm here if the lights are on.

497
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,060
My goodness. What a situation.

498
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,940
Let's hope they'll leave in about two hours.

499
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,740
You can leave then.

500
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,900
Jik's friend...

501
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,180
came home after midnight after his academy,

502
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,460
and his mum was waiting for him in the elevator.

503
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,980
The elevator went up from the first floor...

504
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,620
to the second floor...

505
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,580
and to the third floor.

506
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,830
It kept on going up.

507
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,420
Suddenly, his mum said this.

508
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,340
"Do I still look like your mum to you?"

509
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,220
What are you doing?

510
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,700
It's a ghost story.

511
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,020
Your fans said that you're scared of it.

512
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,140
I wanted to make fun of you.

513
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,640
"Do I still look like your mum to you?"

514
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,270
- There's a ghost behind you.
- What?

515
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,060
Oh my gosh!

516
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,340
Nine and a half and a quarter...

517
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,020
and an eighth and a sixteenth...

518
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,180
and a thirty-second.

519
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,340
It looks like you're more afraid of ghosts.

520
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,860
Can you turn on the lights?

521
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,980
These curtains are light-proof.

522
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,580
Why are you telling me that now?

523
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,830
I wanted to make fun of you.

524
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,900
Do you want to die? Was that funny?

525
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,580
Did you enjoy making fun of me?

526
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
And 10.

527
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,100
- What?
- I counted to 10.

528
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,900
I tried my best to run away.

529
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,420
What are you talking about?

531
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,740
I tried my best to run away.

532
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,980
You're the one who decided to stay.

533
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,940
What are you talking about?

534
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,940
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

535
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,420
- Let's eat.
- I thought you weren't eating.

536
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,460
I never said that.

537
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,140
Sit down.

538
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,740
Oh, okay.

539
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,270
Why did you change...

540
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,830
- all of a sudden?
- What?

541
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,190
You just changed completely.

542
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,540
You're confusing me.

543
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,860
Me?

544
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,220
Are you Joon Young's twin brother?

545
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,830
How could that be?

546
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,790
Isn't it too salty?

547
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,660
It's good.

548
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
Oh, right.

549
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,830
You have a blister.

550
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,980
I'll bring medicine.

551
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,270
What is this? Who is that?

552
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,620
Is he a ghost?

553
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,660
You spit everything out, didn't you?

554
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,060
No. Why would I spit out something you made?

555
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,020
So you are human.

556
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,420
I thought...

557
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,160
a ghost took you over...

558
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,680
and came back in his form.

559
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,190
Do I still look like Joon Young to you?

560
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,220
My gosh.

561
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,060
What's with the sudden change?

562
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,100
You're scaring me.

563
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,820
You were telling me to go away just a while ago.

564
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,660
Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?

565
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,390
Can I not be nice to you?

566
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,900
If one suddenly changes, that means one will die soon.

567
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,300
Hyun Woo.

568
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,060
Hey.

569
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,740
You waited a long time, didn't you?

570
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,900
I'm sorry for being late.

571
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,280
Were you getting ready to go out?

572
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,260
No, where would I go at this hour?

573
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,860
I thought there would be reporters.

574
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,680
I think they're all gone.

575
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,780
Really?

576
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,480
Gosh, then they should've told me so.

577
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,020
I even blow-dried my hair.

578
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,430
Where's Eul?

579
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,780
Eul's not home.

580
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,870
- She's not?
- No.

581
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,220
Her phone's off too, right?

582
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,940
She said she was almost out of batteries a while ago.

583
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,580
Is she with Joon Young?

584
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,110
Yes. She said she had to take care of something.

585
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,740
She told me to go to sleep first.

586
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,700
- Hey, Dad.
- Where are you?

587
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,080
Let's go and grab a drink.

588
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,020
Mum will get mad if I drink with you.

589
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,000
You should stop drinking, too.

590
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,220
I promise I won't drink after today.

591
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,980
Please be a friend...

592
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,000
and drink with me just for today, Ji Tae.

593
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,020
I'm sorry.

594
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,020
I'm caught up with something right now.

595
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,750
You should go home.

596
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,020
Mum will be worried.

597
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,780
Okay, fine.

598
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,260
You only care about your mother, don't you?

599
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,180
All right.

600
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,180
I'll see you at home.

601

(MADAM SONG)

602
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,340
I'll drive from here.

603
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,860
You can go home.

604
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,960
Stop staring. You'll pierce a hole in me.

605
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,200
I'm sorry.

606
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,320
Should I...

607
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,720
just sit here as always?

608
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,480
Without pouring drinks...

609
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,840
or acting cute?

610
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
Yes.

611
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,600
Are you going to leave again...

612
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,480
without even holding my hand?

613
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,740
Yes.

614
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,860
Are you that afraid of your wife?

615
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,080
Yes.

616
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,900
In that case,

617
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,420
what about Young Ok?

618
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,500
Was she your ex-girlfriend?

619
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,220
That lady who looks like me.

620
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,980
You'd call me Young Ok...

621
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,480
whenever you got drunk.

622
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,880
Yes.

623
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,220
You're right.

624
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,000
She's my ex-girlfriend.

625
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,840
If she's still lingering in your mind,

626
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,940
you must've loved her a lot.

627
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,060
Yes.

628
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,320
I did a lot of wrong things to her.

629
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,220
May I...

630
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,200
like you?

631
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,280
No.

632
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,560
I won't allow any other women in my life from now on.

633
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,020
(SECRETARY)

634
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Hello?

635
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,680
Where did you say he's at?

636
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,000
Can I have some more water, please?

637
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,720
Ma'am?

638
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,060
- Can I have some water?
- I'm so sorry.

639
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,120
Thank you.

640
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Eat up.

641
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,680
That's my favourite, but I'm giving it to you.

642
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,080
I'm sorry...

643
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,240
for making you stay outside in this cold weather.

644
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,960
But...

645
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,960
don't people usually raise dogs outside?

646
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,320
Anyway, I'm very sorry.

647
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,120
I'll try to fix my allergy with medicine and stuff.

648
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360
But...

649
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,880
would I be able to film the documentary at this point?

650
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,480
I'll probably get beaten to death by Joon Young's fans.

651
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,720
My gosh.

652
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,640
I guess the reporters haven't left yet.

653
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,360
What am I going to do?

654
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,160
Should I hold a press conference...

655
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,520
and tell everyone that it was all a huge lie?

656
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,840
Mr Shin Joon Young, you're home, aren't you?

657
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,860
Eul's there too, isn't she?

658
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,520
The reporters are gone, so let her go.

659
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,320
Let her go right now!

660
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,120
Who was that? Was it a reporter?

661
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,640
Do you have an underground passage here?

662
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,640
Huge houses like this in movies and dramas had them.

663
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,280
It's fully charged.

664
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
Rock, paper, scissors.

665
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,000
- I won.
- What was that for?

666
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
- You can do the dishes.
- My gosh.

669
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,680
I should've gone with rock.

670
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,320
Why did I...

671
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,640
even play rock-paper-scissors?

Hey, Na Ri.

674
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,440
Hey, Eul. Have you seen the news?

675
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,720
No, not yet.

676
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,040
Why? Did someone bash at me again?

677
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,440
This is just unbelievable.

678
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,850
Joon Young must be crazy.

679
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:45,880
Why?

680
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,400
I'm not letting her go.

681
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,040
I plan to keep her.

682
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,560
She's not a thing.

683
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,920
You're the one who let go of her hand.

684
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,980
Stop regretting your choice and stay away from her.

685
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,840
I think you're the one who should stay away from her.

686
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,280
- What?
- I'm not worthy of her,

687
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,160
but you're worse than me.

688
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,200
Think about what you did to her.

689
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,000
How can you even look at her in the eye...

690
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,200
and say that you like her?

691
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,280
Joon Young.

692
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,080
Why are you out? The reporters are still outside.

693
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,560
I heard you're dating Kim Yoo Na.

694
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,400
It's been over a year, right?

695
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,040
- What?
- I was...

696
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,440
just a tool to avoid that scandal.

697
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,240
Who said such a thing?

698
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,120
It's already all over the internet.

699
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Your company president did the interview himself.

700
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,400
He said you used me...

701
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,560
to protect Yoo Na.

702
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,940
That's not true.

703
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,960
I knew it.

704
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,320
It just didn't make any sense.

705
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,240
There's no way...

706
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,000
that you'd like me.

707
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,280
I'm not sure what you saw or heard,

708
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,760
but they're all lies.

709
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,320
Well,

710
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,720
thanks to her, I'm no longer called a gold digger.

711
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,560
Now, I can walk around at ease.

712
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,960
I said it's not true.

713
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,760
I'll ask for a compensation on psychological damage.

714
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,240
The least I can do is get money off of this.

715
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,080
I need to at least get something out of this.

716
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,040
It's not like that.

717
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,240
Just listen to me only.

718
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
Don't listen to anyone else.

719
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,920
Please just listen to me.

720
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,440
I love you, Eul.

721
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,440
I love you, Eul.

722
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,880
Stop it, Joon Young.

723
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,400
The entire nation knows that you're a good actor.

724
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,280
So stop it already.

725
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,040
I love you,

00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,080
Jik kept telling me to be careful.

728
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,400
He said you and I live in different worlds now.

729
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,360
He told me not to get confused...

730
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,880
on every little thing you do.

731
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,640
He told me not to get shaken or hurt.

732
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,960
He tried to warn me.

733
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,640
I guess I'm the crazy one here! I'm the crazy one!

734
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,040
My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.

00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,280
Stop.

737
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,770
What are you doing?

738
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,560
I feel so bad for Producer Noh.

739
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,120
She was used to defend those two.

740
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,820
You're wearing an expensive watch with a cheap jumper.

741
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,040
Who are you?

742
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,460
Just go, Ji Tae.

743
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,360
Forget about Eul.

744
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,640
I love you, Eul.

745
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,960
I never used you or tried to fool around with you.

746
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,090
Just look at me...

747
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,970
and listen to me only.

748
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,290
Do we need a permit to be in love?

749
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,650
- Who is it?
- If I like her, I'll like her.

750
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,290
Do you like her that much?

751
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,210
I'll be your family in a month.

752
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,180
Mum?

753
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,200
Isn't she that gold digger?

754
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,580
This is the girl I like.

755
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,440
I won't let go of your hand even if I die.
