1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
Pororo.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Pororo.

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,000
Gook Young, did you take Pororo?

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,800
I can't seem to find him.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
You sent Pororo away a while ago...

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,212
so he could live where the air's fresh.

7
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,240
When?

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,120
Why would I send Pororo...

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,000
My doctor warned me that...

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,857
my memory will slowly fail as the illness gets worse.

11
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:55,920
I remember now.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,760
I sent him away.

13
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,181
- What statute expires in 13 days?
- What?

14
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,160
I'd set an alarm saying a statute expires in 13 days.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,440
Why are you asking me that?

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,280
How would I know?

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,080
"No, that won't happen."

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
"This world can't be that cruel."

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,160
That's what I said as I ignored my doctor's warning.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,160
I left my engagement ring behind.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,920
Can I come in now?

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,880
But as always,

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
the world never forgot to be cruel...

24
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,640
towards...

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,000
Eul and me.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,080
Aren't you glad to see me?

27
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,690
Why are you looking at me like you don't know me?

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
Who is the real criminal behind the hit-and-run case...

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,520
that Choi Hyun Joon covered up?

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,640
It's Daehan Jeil Party's representative...

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,080
Yoon Seong Ho's daughter,

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Yoon Jeong Eun.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,680
I will give up on Ji Tae.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,800
Mother, you should give up, too.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Ji Tae won't ever change his...

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,800
It's too late.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,520
There's no evidence or witness.

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
There's nothing you can do.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,040
Have you sobered up?

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,068
Let go.

41
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,292
Let go of my arm, you scumbag.

42
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,656
Lose the engagement ring when we kiss next time.

43
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,056
I'm not kind or strong enough to welcome a woman...

44
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,920
wearing another man's...

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
engagement ring.

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,532
I will get her no matter what it takes.

47
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:29,680
You just wait and see.

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,960
You came earlier than expected,

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,240
Ms Yoon.

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
I haven't eaten yet.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
Can you make me ramyeon?

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Sure.

53
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,612
So I decided...

54
00:03:58,612 --> 00:03:59,920
to become more cruel...

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,640
than this world.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Shall we kiss?

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,840
For real?

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Compared to the pain I've given her,

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,560
I hope I'll have to go through a thousand times more.

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,840
Compared to the misery I've put her through,

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,770
I hope I'll be 10 thousand times more miserable.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
You know, don't you?

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
You know who Jeong Eun is dating.

64
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
I don't.

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
Ji Tae.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
I don't know.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
It tastes...

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,104
just like the ones I had freshly caught before.

69
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm always blessed with such great dishes.

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,520
All right.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Let's drink this...

72
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,160
and end things between our two families.

73
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
- Mr Yoon.
- No matter...

74
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,720
how much I try to control the press,

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,296
everyone already knows.

76
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:02,736
They know that Jeong Eun got stood up...

77
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,720
by her fiance on her engagement day.

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,828
I'm tired of telling excuses to everyone I meet.

79
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,280
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, right.

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,280
I'm thinking about letting Congressman Baek...

81
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,760
take over the secretary-general position.

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,776
You've only been in this field for five years.

83
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:27,220
Think about it. I can't let a five-year-old take over.

84
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,640
This is between us,

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,760
but it didn't make sense from the beginning, anyway.

86
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,680
But you've already made the announcement.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
Sadly,

88
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,040
I don't think I can help you out either, Ms Lee.

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,628
What do you mean by that?

90
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm saying KJ Construction won't be...

91
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,800
in charge of next year's government project.

92
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Who is this girl...

93
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,600
that you chose over my Jeong Eun?

94
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

95
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
Then why is Jeong Eun...

96
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
seeing a guy like him?

97
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm also just asking out of curiosity.

98
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,656
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,520
I guess you're not aware of it yet.

100
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,920
Jeong Eun is dating someone else.

101
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,780
She even ran over to him after visiting us a while ago.

102
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,800
Honey.

103
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,880
Do you have evidence?

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
Who is this?

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,440
It's Shin Joon Young. He's a celebrity.

106
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,960
- What's this?
- You can have it.

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,120
- Is this a present?
- No, it's not a present.

108
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,160
I found it on the street.

109
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,960
- It's new.
- Exactly.

110
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,988
Whoever had it must've been rich.

111
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,868
Why would anyone throw away a new hat?

112
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:48,101
I don't like used things. Give it to someone else.

113
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,160
Hey.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,640
It's not used.

115
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Then did you buy it yourself?

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,736
- Yes.
- For me?

117
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,760
Yes.

118
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,960
So just put it on, will you?

119
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,712
Do you really like me?

120
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,720
Yes.

121
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
No.

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,240
Do you think I'm crazy?

123
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Look, isn't she...

124
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
the girl who asked me out a while ago?

125
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,810
What are you doing here?

126
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,930
I just walked, and I ended up here.

127
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,480
You can just ignore me. I'm sorry.

128
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,452
If you want Joon Young back, you should go to him.

129
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,320
There's no use in coming here.

130
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,918
You're only making Young Ok feel bad.

131
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,080
I know.

132
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm just...

133
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,520
not in my right mind right now.

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,708
I'm sorry for worrying you.

135
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,948
If you're sorry, you shouldn't be doing this.

136
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:59,828
If you keep this up, you'll only stress out Young Ok.

137
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:00,880
- Jeong Sik.
- What?

138
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,536
You can go.

139
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,560
Okay.

140
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,185
Are you crying?

141
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:18,280
No.

142
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,336
I'm so dumbfounded and shocked...

143
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:25,628
that I can't even cry.

144
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:26,976
Then why are you like this?

145
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:29,280
You're not even looking at me when I'm talking to you.

146
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Have you eaten?

147
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,480
- No.
- Great job.

148
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,440
I just closed, and we're also out of yukgaejang.

149
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,800
Do you want to come over to my house?

150
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
Why was Noh Eul...

151
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
in front of your house?

152
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm not sure.

153
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
Poor kids must have no pride.

154
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,040
Why does she keep coming back...

155
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,080
when you keep rejecting her?

156
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Do I need to explain her to you?

157
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,080
- No.
- Let's stop talking about her.

158
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,480
Who is it at this hour?

159
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,120
Could it be Eul?

160
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,776
I'm Mr Yoon's aide.

161
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,520
Is this Shin Joon Young's house?

162
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,040
Mr Yoon wants to meet you.

163
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,440
- I'll be back.
- I think...

164
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
my dad found about you and me.

165
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,948
Don't go. He's a scary man.

166
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,040
I'll be fine.

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm not scared. I'll take care of this.

168
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,000
He's not someone you can fight against.

169
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,868
I'll take care of this.

170
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:13,840
I'll resolve this and return to you.

171
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,560
Leave it to me.

172
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,680
I love you.

173
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
It's hard to believe myself,

174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,360
but I truly love you.

175
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,560
Okay, then.

176
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,800
Don't be too late.

177
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,240
If you take too long,

178
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll go over myself.

179
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,120
I could've cooked you a meal. Why did you want ramyeon?

180
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,440
I heard Joon Young cooks ramyeon for someone.

181
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,280
That's why I suddenly craved it.

182
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,948
Joon Young cooks ramyeon for someone?

183
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:15,440
Yes. For this woman.

184
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
A woman?

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,520
Is he dating someone?

186
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,160
I think so.

187
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
He must be crazy.

188
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Who is it?

189
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,120
She's this really awesome woman.

190
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,868
She's rich, from a good family, sexy and smart.

191
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,160
She's someone who I can't even dream of competing with.

192
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,320
I hope she gets sick after eating that ramyeon.

193
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Hey, stop.

194
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,200
I brought this soju for myself.

195
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Did I just drink that?

196
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,280
Gosh, it really is alcohol.

197
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,944
Then did you think this was water?

198
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:10,080
Yes.

199
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm not supposed to drink.

200
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm going to cause trouble again.

201
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
Hey.

202
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,320
Yes?

203
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,736
Why don't you and I have a drink?

204
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,500
Go ahead and cause some trouble.

205
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,960
Let's see how bad it can get.

206
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
I don't know when...

207
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,040
or how...

208
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,520
my memory will start fading again.

209
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,800
So I'm leaving this video.

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,080
My mum is...

211
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,440
Shin Young Ok.

212
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,600
She's an owner of a yukgaejang restaurant.

213
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,280
She's...

214
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,800
a middle school graduate.

215
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,320
She gave birth and raised me as a single mother.

216
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
I do not...

217
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
have a father.

218
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,880
I never had one.

219
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,800
My father is...

220
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
Choi Hyun Joon.

221
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,960
He's a former prosecutor,

222
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,880
and he's currently a congressman.

223
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,160
He doesn't know I exist.

224
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,640
When he was a senior prosecutor,

225
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,080
he fabricated Eul's father's hit-and-run accident.

226
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,480
(MUM)

227
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,040
What's up, Ms Shin? It's pretty late.

228
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,360
If you called because you missed me, I'll run over.

229
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,280
The chair leg broke?

230
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,380
Is there anything else that needs to be fixed?

231
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,104
What about your table?

232
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,176
How's your washing machine?

233
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:32,280
I hope your drain isn't clogged.

234
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,010
Eul is in your room.

235
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,560
I thought your chair leg broke.

236
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,040
I didn't think you'd come if I told you she was here.

237
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,080
- Mum.
- Are you dating someone?

238
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Why would you do that when you're crazy about Eul?

239
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,200
Eul's the one you really like. Why are you dating...

240
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,040
Mum.

241
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,056
Why? Do you not like her...

242
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,428
because she isn't well-off...

243
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,770
and well-educated like the girl you're seeing?

244
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,960
Then you must not like me, either.

245
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,160
Eul's sleeping.

246
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,010
She said she didn't sleep for three days,

247
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,120
so I got her drunk.

248
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,160
She said she causes trouble every time she drinks,

249
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,770
but she just knocked out.

250
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,800
Too bad I didn't get to see her drunk.

251
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,100
Anyway,

252
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,745
something urgent came up at the restaurant.

253
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:38,233
I'll be back after a while, so take care of Eul.

254
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,010
- Mum.
- What if...

255
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,960
she starts causing a scene after she wakes up?

256
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm going to the sauna with a few of my friends.

257
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,470
I may sleep over if it gets too late,

258
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,790
so go home whenever you want.

267
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,310
Did you sleep well?

268
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,270
Where's Joon Young?

269
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,950
Was he here?

270
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,850
I should feed you some hangover soup before you go.

271
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,070
Just wait a little.

272
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,350
Joon Young did everything he can.

273
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,470
- Pardon?
- He was a law school student...

274
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,670
who passed his first bar exam.

275
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,310
But he quit it all.

276
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,750
I'm just saying.

277
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,550
He's a man of conscience, unlike his parents.

278
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,470
So don't resent him.

279
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,510
If you keep badmouthing him, you're a bad person, too.

280
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,430
Wash your face.

281
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,310
You have sleep in your eyes.

282
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,470
Was Joon Young really here?

283
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,070
You have a great view.

284
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,350
May I talk to you outside?

285
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,910
What's your purpose?

286
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,150
You threatened me with that USB.

287
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,030
And I'm sure you knew that Jeong Eun...

288
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,830
was to be my future daughter-in-law.

289
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,270
You're playing such an absurd game.

290
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,590
What is it that you want?

291
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,650
A just society.

292
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,600
Stop joking around.

293
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,110
Do I look like I'm joking?

294
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,070
It's not...

295
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,150
that hard for me to destroy someone like you instantly.

296
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,650
Are you threatening me?

297
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,570
Then...

298
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,230
are you saying you'll keep playing this absurd game?

299
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,330
You're the one who started it.

300
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,210
Have you already forgotten...

301
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,290
what you did as a prosecutor...

302
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,530
just to gain fame and prestige?

303
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,290
If your purpose is to ruin my life,

304
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,610
then aim only for me.

305
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,170
Leave my wife and children out of this!

306
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,570
No.

307
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,570
Your family needs to be equally wounded and hurt.

308
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,010
They need to learn that it's a big sin...

309
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,850
to have a person like you as a husband...

310
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,610
and a father.

311
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,490
I'm going to warn you once again.

312
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,610
Destroying a person like you is a piece of cake for me.

313
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,970
Stop your game while you can.

314
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,690
Don't you dare touch anything that belongs to me.

315
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,810
Let me give you some advice in return for your warning.

316
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,690
Don't just warn me. Destroy me.

317
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,010
I plan on spending the rest of my life...

318
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,770
as an obstacle on your road to success.

319
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,570
Go on and knock me down before I knock you down...

320
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,210
and start becoming more of a jerk.

321
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,890
Please wait just a little bit more.

322
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,730
I'll run over to you in a bit, Joon Young.

323
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,450
Give me my phone.

324
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,570
Did you decide to live a reckless life...

325
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,370
after your engagement has been broken off?

326
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,510
No. I've lived a reckless life until now.

327
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,190
But I'm going live properly from now on.

328
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,550
I knew you were childish,

329
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,430
but of all people, you chose this petty celebrity.

330
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,110
He's someone I love.

331
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,570
- What?
- He makes me happy.

332
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,570
What's the earliest flight to the United States?

333
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,910
I'm going to send Jeong Eun to the United States today.

334
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,930
- Dad.
- Okay. Get the ticket ready.

335
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,750
Leave tonight.

336
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,770
Don't even think about returning before I tell you to.

337
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,890
No, I'm not leaving.

338
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,210
Do as I tell you!

339
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,530
You're not in a state to make a rational judgment.

340
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,930
It's just like how it was 10 years ago.

341
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,010
Come in.

342
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,090
Choi Ji Tae is here.

343
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,930
Tell him to come in.

344
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,290
May I have a word...

345
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,330
with Jeong Eun?

346
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,490
I know...

347
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,010
that I don't have the right to say this.

348
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,090
- Then don't.
- Find someone else...

349
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,090
other than Shin Joon Young.

350
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,710
There are great guys who are standing in line for you.

351
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,330
But what if I choose Joon Young over all of them?

352
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,490
I don't even remember liking you thanks to him.

353
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,750
Will you move away?

354
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,740
I have to put on a suicide show saying that...

355
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,250
I'll kill myself if Dad continues to disapprove.

356
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,370
Shin Joon Young...

357
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,690
approached you with a purpose.

358
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,430
- What?
- He doesn't like you.

359
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,370
- Ji Tae.
- He just wants...

360
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,050
to get back at my father.

361
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,170

Yes.

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,130
Right now?

366
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,890
So who is this girl that's been hitting on Jik?

367
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,330
She's the daughter of that galbi restaurant nearby.

368
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,020
I mean, if things go well with her,

369
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,210
Jik can eat all the galbi he wants.

370
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,030
Also, she's their only daughter.

371
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,090
He may inherit their restaurant.

372
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,090
It's great news for Jik.

373
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,610
Gosh, you're making me tell you more than I should.

374
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,410
I haven't told Jik about who I really am yet.

375
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,500
If he marries me, he won't just get galbi.

376
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,460
I can buy him a cow farm.

377
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,390
I can tell my mum to build him hundreds of...

378
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,930
I understand that's your wish.

379
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,050
But Jik needs to be with a rich girl.

380
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,570
He suffered so much because of his family.

381
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,990
He should at least meet a rich wife.

382
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,210
Exactly.

383
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,730
If he marries me, he can live a rich life.

384
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,610
To be honest,

385
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,730
I'm the daughter of KJ Group.

386
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,750
That's amazing. You're very rich.

387
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,890
Exactly.

388
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,620
I haven't mentioned it because I knew you'd...

389
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,010
If you're KJ Group's daughter, I'm Mansour's daughter.

390
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,170
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

391
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,030
This is my mum, and this is my dad.

392
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,590
I'm sure you saw him on TV.

393
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,770
Do you believe me now?

394
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,690
There's no need to get intimidated.

395
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,140
Just treat me the way you always did.

396
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,590
- Go home.
- My gosh.

397
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,330
Rich people are nothing different.

398
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,650
We eat three meals a day,

399
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,930
drink water when we're thirsty and go to the toilet...

400
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,460
Delete Jik's number right now.

401
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,780
From this point on, don't ever contact him again.

402
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,010
What's wrong, Na Ri?

403
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,890
I thought you wanted him to date a rich girl.

404
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,010
Forget that. You can never be with him.

405
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,930
Leave before Jik gets here.

406
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,930
No way.

407
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,070
My gosh. Why?

408
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,070
- I'm not leaving.
- You're persistent.

409
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,530
- Leave.
- No way.

410
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,290
- I'm not leaving.
- I'm telling you to leave.

411
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,130
- Why?
- Ha Ru.

412
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,170
Jik.

413
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,930
Na Ri says you and I can never be together.

414
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,530
Jik, you have to end it with her.

415
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,950
Why? Why do you say that?

416
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,190
Exactly.

417
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,130
Who are you to make us do that?

418
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,770
You're not even his real sister.

419
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,130
If I was, you wouldn't be standing here.

420
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,570
End it with her before Eul finds out. Right now!

421
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,570
What's with her?

422
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,160
Who is she to tell us to break up?

423
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Things at home are already complicated enough.

424
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,740
She doesn't have to add to this.

425
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,160
I won't break up with you, so don't worry.

426
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
What?

427
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,880
No matter what Na Ri says,

428
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,570
or no matter what my sister says,

429
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,960
I won't break up with you, so don't worry.

430
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,610
Are you sure?

431
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,920
So hush. Stop crying.

432
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,240
You have to hold onto me.

433
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,140
That galbi restaurant girl is nothing compared to me.

434
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,260
- Hey, Jik.
- Yes?

435
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,500
You just...

436
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,300
hugged me.

437
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,220
Very tightly, too.

438
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,980
So stop crying.

439
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,790
Seeing you cry makes me worry.

440
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,810
No.

441
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,610
I'm going to cry.

442
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,610
I'm going to cry through the night like this.

443
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,050
Why did Na Ri say that?

444
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,530
Shin Joon Young...

445
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,610
approached you with a purpose.

446
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,370
He doesn't like you. He just wants to...

447
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,170
get back at my father.

449
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,940
I heard something unbelievable from Ji Tae.

450
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,690
But if you say it's not true,

451
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,810
I'll believe you.

452
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,490
So tell me it's not true.

453
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,830
Tell me that Ji Tae is lying.

454
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,570
We didn't meet by chance.

455
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,130
I approached you...

456
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,770
with a purpose.

457
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,610
It was all planned.

458
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,770
I wanted to get back at my father who abandoned me.

459
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,370
Is this the unbelievable story you heard...

460
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,170
from Choi Ji Tae?

461
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,810
You're making things difficult for me.

462
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,790
I said I'd believe you.

463
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,790
I told you to tell me that it's not true!

464
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,010
You should run away.

465
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,370
I might come up with another scheme to fool you...

466
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,980
and keep you around.

467
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,730
You should run away from me, Jeong Eun.

468
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,980
How can you show up there so unexpectedly?

469
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,420
Where's your pride?

470
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,420
What's pride?

471
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,890
Do they sell it at the grocery store?

472
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,470
If you show up at the documentary shooting again,

473
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,730
the president of Joon Young's agency will kill you.

474
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,090
Then should I get plastic surgery?

475
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,610
No one will recognise me.

476
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,850
You're so persistent.

477
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,650
Yes, this is Yoon Jun Woo speaking.

478
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,890
Pardon? Who is this?

479
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,770
Shin Joon Young?

480
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,810
What makes you call me directly like this?

481
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,290
Yes.

482
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,810
I see.

483
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,890
Okay, sure.

484
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,530
- What did he say?
- He wants you to come...

485
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,050
- for tonight's shooting.
- Don't lie.

486
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,490
You just heard me talking to him.

487
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,530
He's so unpredictable.

488
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,010
Is he joking or what?

489
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,250
Stop frowning.

490
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,980
You can leave if you don't want to do it.

491
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,650
I haven't exactly heard about the shooting.

492
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,170
What exactly are we shooting today?

493
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,570
It's the first item on my bucket list.

494
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,610
I'm going to propose...

495
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,650
to the woman I love in front of the camera.

496
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,210
Are you really not going to get admitted?

497
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,460
It's a very important day for me,

498
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,210
so please cooperate.

499
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,850
If you're going to frown like that, call Producer Yoon.

500
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,050
- Should I call him?
- I'm not frowning.

501
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,690
Satisfied?

502
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,530
So...

503
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,460
who's this woman you're going to propose to?

504
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Noh Eul.

505
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,460
Stop frowning, seriously.

506
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,730
Yoon Jeong Eun of KJ Group.

507
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,490
Let me...

508
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,210
go and get a glass of water.

510
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,940
He's so cruel.

511
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,730
How can he ask me...

512
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,530
to film his proposal...

513
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,980
to another woman?

514
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,090
That jerk.

515
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,290
- Hello?
- Did you have a good talk with Joon Young?

516
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,370
If you two are finished talking, come back.

517
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,970
Come back and marry Ji Tae.

518
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,900
I no longer love Ji Tae.

519
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,530
Marriage isn't about love.

520
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,460
I'm going to hang up now.

521
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,570
10 years ago,

522
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,530
when you fled after a hit-and-run,

523
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,450
there was a CCTV footage of the entire act.

524
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,350
I was going to destroy it,

525
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,810
but I kept it because I thought it'd come in handy.

526
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,930
You're lying.

527
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,010
You can check for yourself if you'd like.

528
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,370
If that goes public, it won't affect just me.

529
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:34,930
Congressman Choi will also...

530
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,330
Of course, we'll have to pay for helping you.

531
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,010
But between...

532
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,050
a presidential candidate...

533
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,810
who has a murderer for a daughter...

534
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,930
and a mere senior prosecutor who gave into power,

535
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,530
I wonder who'll shed more blood.

536
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,180
Come back, Jeong Eun.

537
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,490
I'll be waiting.

538
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,380
Didn't you run away?

539
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,450
How far were you planning to go?

540
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,330
If you didn't get caught,

541
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,530
how far would you have gone?

542
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,140
I would've married you.

543
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,250
I wanted to take the one thing...

544
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,620
that my father longs and yearns for.

545
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,140
You're willing to marry someone you don't even love...

546
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,990
just to get revenge on your father?

547
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,890
Feelings can always change.

548
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,330
Just like how you came to me to get back at Ji Tae,

549
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,730
but started to like me instead. You're even hesitant...

550
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,690
even when you found out that you've been deceived.

551
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,050
Stop getting my hopes up and leave.

552
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,250
You really are a player.

553
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,140
You really know how a woman thinks and feels.

554
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,610
Let's do this together.

555
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,890
I think you and I may share...

556
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,410
the same destination.

557
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,410
Let's do it together.

558
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,770
I'll decide if I want to kill you or spare you...

559
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,090
when this is all over.

560
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,210
I'm sorry I'm late. I had people tailing me.

561
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,690
I had to lose them.

562
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,650
Can you really air this?

563
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,060
I don't know.

564
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,650
My producer is weak when it comes to powerful figures.

565
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,250
We can change the producer if you want.

566
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,460
No, I'm fine.

567
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,090
I like her.

568
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,610
Hello, I'm Producer Noh Eul.

569
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,330
We must have a strong tie.

570
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,210
Please make it look great.

571
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,490
Please smudge out my blemishes.

572
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,210
Hyun Woo?

573
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,170
It's you.

574
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,130
It's you, Hyun Woo.

575
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,810
Have you been well?

576
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,430
My goodness. You mean person.

577
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:17,430
Do you know how desperately I've waited for you?

578
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,690
I've been busy.

579
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,410
But why do you look like this?

580
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,570
Why did you become so handsome? You're just my type.

581
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,250
What kind of a person do I seem like?

582
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,250
You're handsome, cool,

583
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,910
sexy...

584
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,130
I thought I was...

585
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,570
very rational,

586
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,690
reasonable,

587
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:44,490
fair and good.

588
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,460
That's hard for me to say.

589
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,020
I don't know that much about you.

590
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,490
That's why we should meet more often.

591
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,730
You should invite me over to your house, too.

592
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,910
Ji Tae, this is bad.

593
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,820
I think you have the wrong person.

594
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,450
This is Hyun Woo.

595
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,810
Here's the latest rumour on Joon Young.

596
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:17,690
Unbelievable.

597
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,410
- Unbelievable.
- What?

598
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,090
This is about Joon Young, right?

599
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,570
Yes, definitely.

600
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,870
I can't believe this.

601
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,730
I caught you two.

602
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,170
Will you two continue to be like this at work?

603
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,090
It's not that. This is bad, Gook Young.

604
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,770
Did you get caught writing awful comments?

605
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,010
My goodness. I'm glad you got caught while writing...

606
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:45,810
What's this?

607
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,350
- Is this about Joon Young?
- Yes.

608
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,490
Who wrote this?

609
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,310
This is nonsense.

610
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,810
I'll get these jerks.

611
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,050
Joon Young would never...

612
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,490
You should all...

613
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,210
keep your mouths shut.

614
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,050
And you should...

615
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,590
go and check on Joon Young.

616
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,130
- Did you see this?
- I did.

617
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,270
You should call your company's president...

618
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,350
and find out what's going on.

619
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,630
Dad, Joon Young's going to be fine, right?

620
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,730
This is all over the internet.

621
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,010
This is nonsense, so don't mind it.

622
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,970
Also, Young Ok can never find out about this, okay?

623
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,460
If any of you tell Young Ok about this,

624
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,970
I'll make sure I kill...

625
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,290
What?

626
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,290
What is this about?

627
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,530
- Young Ok.
- What is it?

628
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,010
Is this about Joon Young?

629
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,130
Joon Young.

630
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,610
I'm sorry.

631
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,540
May I ask you some questions?

632
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,800
Of course.

633
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,680
It must've been hard for a person like you...

634
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,300
to decide to go public with this proposal.

635
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,340
What made you decide...

636
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,340
It's on my bucket list.

637
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,100
I want Ms Yoon to answer.

638
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,120
I wanted to publicly tell people that I have chosen...

639
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,100
Joon Young as my life-long partner, and that...

640
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,020
they should stop swaying or threatening me.

641
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Do you two...

642
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,580
truly love each other?

643
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,180
Of course.

644
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,420
How about you answer that, Joon Young?

645
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,380
Of course I love her.

646
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,500
Since when did you love her?

647
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,880
- What?
- Since when did you start loving Ms Yoon?

648
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,060
Tell me the exact date and year.

649
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,820
I don't exactly remember the date.

650
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,740
How can you not remember?

651
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,900
Do you remember...

652
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,520
every single moment you fell in love?

653
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,580
Do you remember the exact date and year?

654
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,580
Of course.

655
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,320
It was on March 15, 2005...

656
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,660
at a playground in my neighbourhood.

657
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,820
Some kids made fun of my brother because he had no mum,

658
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,700
and this is what he said to him.

659
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,940
Hush. Stop crying.

660
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,140
Big boys shouldn't cry.

661
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,180
Jik, kids used to make fun of me...

662
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,920
for not having a dad when I was your age.

663
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,280
But I never cried.

664
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,860
- Why?
- Why?

665
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,860
Because that's what they wanted me to do.

666
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,940
I didn't want to give them their way.

667
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,620
I won't cry from now on. Just like you.

668
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,660
That's the spirit, Jik. You're the man.

669
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,660
You're so cool, Jik.

670
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,380
After that day,

671
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,460
my brother never cried no matter what anyone said.

672
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,100
After that day,

673
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,140
I fell in love with him.

674
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,980
How do you love, Joon Young?

675
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,950
I'm not sure if I understand the question.

676
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:39,560
Didn't you love another woman before Ms Yoon?

677
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,700
Excuse me.

678
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,560
Yes, I did.

679
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,460
Did you even love her?

680
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,940
I don't remember.

681
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,340
- You don't remember?
- I don't.

682
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,220
I'm the type that erases past memories...

683
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,100
and starts on a clean slate...

684
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,180
when I start loving someone.

685
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,880
I'm sorry.

686
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,340
We'll take a five minute break.

688
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,700
You're a scary man, Joon Young.

689
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,900
What a great camera.

690
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,660
What's the model?

691
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,900
When everything is over,

692
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,460
should we begin again?

693
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,340
What was your dream?

694
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,900
Pardon?

695
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,500
I wanted to become a prosecutor like my father.

696
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,860
And once I become one, I wanted to visit my father...

697
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,420
and tell him that I grew up well even without him.

698
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,060
I wanted to receive his compliment.

699
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,460
Didn't you resent your father who abandoned you?

700
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,460
I thought you wanted to get revenge.

701
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,540
He doesn't even know that I exist.

702
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,740
That's why I studied so hard...

703
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,380
and passed my first bar exam.

704
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,820
But one day,

705
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,060
I found out about my father's true colours.

706
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,940
My father, whom I respected more than anyone,

707
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,340
was cruel, scary and a cheating fraud,

708
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,540
who'd do anything...

709
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,380
to get his hands on what he wanted.

710
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,940
Why?

711
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,780
What did your father do?

712
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,580
He covered up...

713
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,780
a hit-and-run case with a request from a powerful man.

714
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,790
He destroyed the CCTV footage, appeased the witness,

715
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,420
changed the driver for a false assertion.

716
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,500
He relegated his junior who wanted to reveal the truth.

717
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,780
Are you okay?

718
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,300
I have to go to the bathroom.

719
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,020
- Do you want me to escort you?
- No.

720
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,380
I'll go alone.

721
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,940
I'm sure I turned it off. Why is it still recording?

722
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,700
Did you touch this?

723
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,700
From this point on,

724
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,900
don't take your eyes off this monitor.

725
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,180
What are you talking about?

726
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,660
Did you do this?

727
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,820
What are you talking about?

728
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,460
The rumour about Shin Joon Young's drug usage.

729
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,980
Is it your work?

730
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,860
Shin Joon Young did drugs?

731
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,780
Read it again.

732
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,660
Mr A, a renowned actor and singer,

733
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,060
shockingly has been using illegal drugs...

734
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,180
on a regular basis.

735
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,420
According to his friends,

736
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,500
he used illegal drugs in a private room in clubs and...

737
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,970
had hallucination parties with the girls he came with.

738
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,060
This is...

739
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,860
not Joon Young, Young Ok.

740
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,780
Who would begin...

741
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,460
such a rumour...

742
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,660
about our dear Joon Young?

743
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,300
I will go...

744
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,140
and rip this guy into pieces.

745
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,030
Just wait until I catch this jerk.

746
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,540
People already assume this person is Shin Joon Young.

747
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,180
The police and prosecutors will...

748
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,500
soon begin their investigation on this case.

749
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,540
Okay.

750
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,310
Great job.

751
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,820
Was this the only way?

752
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,020
He's still your son.

753
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,980
Your father called.

754
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,060
Thank you.

755
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,900
Prosecutors are people, too.

756
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,860
They can't always live their lives like moral police.

757
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,340
They can sometimes be cowardly, get easily tempted,

758
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,740
and they can also make mistakes.

759
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,660
People are all like that.

760
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,980
Not the prosecutors I know.

761
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,300
Even if they're at a disadvantage...

762
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,500
and get stigmatised as a bad father and husband,

763
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,260
they still try their best to stick to their principles,

764
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,950
justice and conscience.

765
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,860
Is that the petty reason why you wanted...

766
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,980
to get back at your father?

767
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,860
That man who died from the hit-and-run accident...

768
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,620
was my girlfriend's father.

769
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,860
And I interfered...

770
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,100
when she wanted to get the truth out there.

771
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,580
Thinking that he's still my father,

772
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,540
I wanted to protect him.

773
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,300
So I killed...

774
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,020
my girlfriend.

775
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,460
I killed...

776
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,220
her.

777
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,300
