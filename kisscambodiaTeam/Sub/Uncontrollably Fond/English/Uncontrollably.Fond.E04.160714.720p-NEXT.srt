3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,450
It looked like she was going to a bridge in Han River.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,410
What if she jumped in and died already?

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,050
What? A bridge?

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,090
I'm a fool for believing Gook Young.

00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,890
My goodness. That's Jun Ho and Lee Yu Bi.

9
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,410
Did they actually get together after filming the movie?

10
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,690
What a treat. I can get something off of this.

11
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,970
Let's take a photo.

12
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,610
One...

13
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,850
Is life nonsense to you?

14
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,010
Is it so easy for you to die?

15
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,130
Let's film that documentary.

16
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,610
I'll do it, you crazy fool.

17
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,450
- Defibrillator.
- Ready.

18
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,050
200 joules. In 1, 2, go.

19
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,570
Once more. In 1, 2, go.

20
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,930
We have a pulse.

21
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,490
Okay.

22
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,130
The worst is over and the surgery went well.

23
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,690
Your sister won't die. Don't worry.

24
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,770
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Doctor.

25
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,090

27
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,170
You want to quit school?

28
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,610
Yes.

29
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,970
Why?

30
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,450
You passed the first round of the bar exam.

31
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,810
Why quit now?

32
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,170
If someone like me becomes a prosecutor,

33
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,010
then this country will really be out of hope.

34
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,050
This...

35
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,410
is me?

36
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,050
I knew it.

37
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,050
The power of cosmetics really is amazing.

38
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,970
Since we're doing a makeover,

39
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,610
let's put some gold dust under your eyes like a singer.

40
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,850
Gold dust? Do we have money to waste?

41
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,530
Hey, don't.

42
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,090
I spent the whole morning painting your face.

43
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,010
- Should I meet Joon Young looking like this?
- Yes.

44
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,530
Are you telling me to hit on him?

45
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,410
I'm meeting him for work.

46
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,730
Good for you. Go and work.

47
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,930
It's not like he'll fall for you anyway.

48
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,090
Young ladies from rich families...

49
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,050
and celebrities a thousand times prettier than you...

50
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,970
are all waiting for a chance to meet him.

51
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,130
A girl like you won't even enter his scope.

52
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,010
Then what's all the make-up for?

53
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,490
Joon Young has become someone of a different level,

54
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,210
but I won't have you showing up in a cheap jacket...

55
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,610
looking pitiful.

56
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,610
He can think what he wants.

57
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,250
Who cares? I don't care.

58
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,170
I care. My pride won't allow it.

59
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,490
At one time in life, we used to be his equals.

60
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,770
Don't you feel bad for us?

61
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,210
Where's the gold dust?

62
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,090
Be generous with it.

63
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,690
Not too shabby.

64
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,730
I look great.

65
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,290
- Come on outside.
- What for?

66
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,530
The documentary lady's outside.

67
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,530
You'll see something very interesting,

68
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,890
more than what you can imagine.

69
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,090
Come and look.

70
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,090
My goodness.

71
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,490
She pushed herself to look good for you.

72
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,650
But why do I feel sorry for her?

73
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,330
Is it because I know you still won't go lightly on her?

74
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,930
The neighbours might report her for acting crazy.

75
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,490
Why isn't she coming in?

76
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,530
Don't. Just go and feed Pororo.

77
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,170
The more I look at myself,

78
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,810
the prettier I seem.

79
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,170
To think that I had to...

80
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,810
hide this beauty all these years.

81
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,570
Sorry for making you wait.

82
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,370
Why did you tell me to wait outside?

83
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,090
Your earrings and handbag.

84
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,850
They're all fake and it bugged me.

85
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,970
I borrowed the real deal from a friend.

86
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,650
- What?
- Your ears.

87
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,770
- Hey.
- Guys like Joon Young...

88
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,890
can tell fakes from the real thing in just a glance.

89
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,410
Who cares if I wear or carry fakes?

90
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,330
It'll be deadly embarrassing.

91
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,210
He might think you're a fake person.

92
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,770
He'll mock and belittle me whatever I do.

93
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,330
He has a horrible temper.

94
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,010
He's way worse than how he was before.

95
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,290
I can't believe he lives in this kind of place alone.

96
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,250
The door alone makes me feel small.

97
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,940
Eul, there's no need to feel intimidated, okay?

98
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,570
So what if he has a temper?

99
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,820
You're a mad dog when you get angry, too.

100
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,970
I know. Don't you worry my friend.

101
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,730
If he starts getting all mad at you,

102
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,570
ignore him like you would a barking dog.

103
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,770
You went through so much to get this job.

104
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,060
You even pretended to kill yourself.

105
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,940
It's not like I did it on purpose.

106
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,690
I never said I'd kill myself.

107
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,570
He misunderstood and took it the wrong way.

108
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,820
I can't leave my brother behind.

109
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,570
Of course, you can't.

(JOON YOUNG'S MANAGER)

111
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,130
Hello, Mr Jang.

112
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,890
It's me, Noh Eul.

113
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,530
I'm outside Joon Young's house.

114
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,450
I rang the bell for 10 minutes, but there's no answer.

115
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,010
Oh, really?

116
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,650
I wonder why. I'll check and get back to you.

117
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,770
Okay.

118
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,060
All right.

119
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,050
It's obvious what's going on.

120
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,370
Joon Young's mean streak must've resurfaced again.

121
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,130
Joon Young.

122
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,490
Joon Young.

123
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,970
Are you in?

124
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm freezing to death here.

125
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,890
Let me in.

126
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,690
What's going on?

127
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,890
Is he toying with me?

128
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,610
Hi.

129
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,650
Hello.

130
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,170
Hello.

131
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,170
I think your doorbell's broken.

132
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,810
- The filming crew will...
- They won't come.

133
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,810
- I told them not to.
- Why?

134
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,370
I'm not going to film the documentary.

135
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,930
You said you'd do it just yesterday.

136
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,170
That's because you deceived me.

137
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,770
I thought you were going to jump off a bridge.

138
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,410
I didn't try to deceive you.

139
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,930
You just got the wrong idea.

140
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,730
Then you should've told me that...

141
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,370
I was mistaken and that you weren't trying to die.

142
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,650
Well...

143
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,130
I was going to tell you.

144
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,130
I forgot.

145
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,570
Well, the whole documentary thing is off.

146
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,890
Pororo, let's go for a walk!

147
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,850
I lost a scoop because of you.

148
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,610
I almost got a video of Jun Ho and Lee Yu Bi dating.

149
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,530
Were you filming them in secret?

150
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,690
I was.

151
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,130
I could've earned two months' worth of living expenses.

152
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,290
Text your account number to my manager.

153
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,930
I'll wire you double the living expenses...

154
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,090
that you lost out on.

155
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,810
How much?

156
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,290
Do you know how much I spend?

157
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,890
Don't give me chump change. I want 100,000 dollars.

158
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,130
Is that all you need?

159
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,610
I could give you a million dollars if you want.

160
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,050
I could also give you a house, a car and a building.

161
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,330
I could give you all I own.

162
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,570
Go on and ask for more.

163
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,690
I'm loaded and all you ask for is 100,000 dollars?

164
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,250
You must be so pleased that you're rich.

165
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,290
I barely have enough to live off.

166
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,890
But because you're rich, you disregard people...

167
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,450
and easily break promises. It must be great to be you!

168
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,010
Pororo!

169
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,290
What happened? Did you do this to her?

170
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,890
Pororo jumped on her for kicking me.

171
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,250
Did he bite her?

172
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,970
He just barked and jumped and she passed out.

173
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,650
She fainted at a bark and a jump?

174
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,010
It's just another show to get something from me.

175
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,130
I'm off to exercise.

176
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,450
Play along for a while, then send her home.

177
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,050
I think she's really sick.

178
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,730
Joon Young, something's really wrong.

179
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,170
Come back here!

180
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,010
I don't think she's putting on a show.

181
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,650
Call Doctor Kang.

182
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,330
The sudden shock caused her veins to expand.

183
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,170
That lowered her blood pressure,

184
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,330
and she went into shock.

185
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,570
Did she say she couldn't breathe as she fainted?

186
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,170
Yes.

187
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,730
Her skin is blotchy, and her breathing is ragged.

188
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,090
I would say an allergy to dogs is the biggest cause.

189
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,770
An allergy to dogs?

190
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,090
The shots will reduce inflammation...

191
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,410
and bring up the blood pressure.

192
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,490
She'll be fine by tomorrow.

193
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,850
Thank you for coming by on your day off.

194
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,290
Could you sign an autograph for my daughter, then?

195
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,290
You seem to be doing well.

196
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,650
Yes. I feel fine.

197
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,370
I think you misdiagnosed me.

198
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,290
You helped me out today, so I won't sue you.

199
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,970
Stay here for now.

200
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,050
You made her sick.

201
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,330
Thanks for protecting me,

202
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,890
but don't do it again.

203
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,330
If you'd bitten her or something,

204
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,290
I'd have kicked you out.

205
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,090
Okay?

206
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,570
(HUSBAND)

207
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,380
Your call cannot be connected.

208
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,490
Ji Tae.

209
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,010
Did you take a look around?

210
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,380
Isn't this place perfect for you and Eul?

211
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,690
This place is for us?

212
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,210
We can't afford it.

213
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,170
A friend of mine is emigrating and...

214
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,620
he doesn't want to sell or rent the place long-term.

215
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,010
You guys just have to keep it clean.

216
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,090
- For free?
- Yes, for free.

217
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,530
Isn't it great?

218
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,650
- No thanks.
- Why not?

219
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,690
All Eul thinks about...

220
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,210
are ways to leech off others.

221
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,010
She'll do anything for a free ride.

222
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,410
She dreams of turning a dollar into 10,000 dollars.

223
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,530
That's all she thinks about nowadays...

224
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,930
whenever she has any free time.

225
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,250
If we move in here for free,

226
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,140
she'll say, "See? It's all about luck."

227
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,930
"There's no need to work hard."

228
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,170
She'll just dream harder and wish for a windfall.

229
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,570
Thanks for trying to help us out,

230
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,970
but I don't want anything for free.

231
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,530
I can stay with a friend for now,

232
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,570
and Eul's staying with Na Ri.

233
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,140
I work part-time, and Eul also has a job.

234
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,620
We'll find a place to live in no time.

235
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,380
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

236
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,530
My gosh.

237
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,140
What goes on in that head of yours?

238
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,050
You always make me feel bad.

239
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,210
- What's this?
- I tutor this kid.

240
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,050
His grades went up, so his mum gave me a bonus.

241
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,620
You should get a new jacket at a department store.

242
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,900
My jacket's just fine. Buy one for yourself.

243
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,620
Why is there a hole?

244
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,170
It wasn't there earlier.

245
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,850
My sister's very materialistic.

246
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,050
I'd like it if you married her,

247
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,930
but she doesn't think of you that way.

248
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,810
It's because you're poor like us.

249
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,850
She likes rich people.

250
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,490
Get yourself a new jacket so you can...

251
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,770
look good and impress her.

252
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,450
Okay?

253
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,410
Hello.

254
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,330
Okay, I'll be there on time.

255

256
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,970
My goodness.

257
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,850
Did Jeong Eun cook all this?

258
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,140
Yes, Ma'am.

259
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,210
I knew she was smart and pretty,

260
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,050
but she's a great cook, too.

261
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,490
I didn't do much.

262
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,900
I see why you're the expert.

263
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,140
Your mother taught you so well.

264
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,900
We weren't even away for that long.

265
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,050
Ha Ru, has this taught you anything?

266
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,290
Yes.

267
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,450
I hate her guts.

268
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,290
Ha Ru.

269
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,410
How dare you.

270
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,530
I'm really sorry.

271
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,930
Don't be.

272
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,930
My friends say that, too.

273
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,770
They all hate my guts.

274
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,290
There has to be a flaw.

275
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,140
What do you mean?

276
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,010
A human being can't be that perfect.

277
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,650
Her family's too great, she did too well in school,

278
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,930
she's too pretty,

279
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,850
she's too sexy, and she's also too nice.

280
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,650
She even cooks too well.

281
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,970
Who? Jeong Eun?

282
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,250
She might not be from our planet.

283
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,570
What if...

284
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,800
she's from another planet?

285
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,890
Maybe, when she goes home,

286
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,410
she eats snakes, rats...

287
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,650
and cockroaches.

288
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,930
And at midnight, she might go to a cemetery...

289
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,650
to dig up a coffin and suck the blood of a new corpse.

290
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,330
My goodness!

291
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,970
Ji Tae.

292
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,610
Hello, Father.

293
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,610
What was that? You scared me really bad.

294
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,130
Why were you being so nasty?

295
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,650
Jeong Eun's here.

296
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,330
I know. I heard.

297
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,210
She got here early and prepared the food...

298
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,530
for your grandfather's memorial.

299
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,530
Tell her she did a good job.

300
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,690
I will after I freshen up.

301
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,810
I'm telling you. Jeong Eun really might have a secret.

302
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,170
She may look and act all sweet,

303
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,930
but she could be a sociopath or a psychopath.

304
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,210
Ha Ru.

305
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,490
I was kidding. It's just a joke.

306
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,450
Why do you have to scold me so seriously?

307
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,970
You just startled your precious daughter.

308
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,450
You silly thing.

309
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,050
Come on, Dad.

310
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,410
I don't like Jeong Eun.

311
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,650
You and her parents set it up without our consent.

312
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,890
Please cancel the engagement.

313
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,570
She's a lovely lady.

314
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,210
Other well-known families...

315
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,330
would love to have their son marry her.

316
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,530
Without love...

317
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,610
I mean, I can't marry a woman I don't even like.

318
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,090
You two got married because you were madly in love.

319
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,570
- Why should I...
- Are you...

320
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,370
seeing someone?

321
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,850
No. Not really, but...

322
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,930
I know how close...

323
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,010
you and Mr Yoon are.

324
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,010
I also know that to reach your goal,

325
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,330
you need his help.

326
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,130
But...

327
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,650
this is about choosing who I'll spend my life with.

328
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,250
It's about the rest of my life.

329
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,010
I understand.

330
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,530
I'll call Mr Yoon tomorrow...

331
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,890
and tell him that the engagement is off.

332
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,090
Honey.

333
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,130
My dream is important.

334
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,370
But to a father,

335
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,930
his son is more important.

336
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,090
Nothing in this world...

337
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,770
can be more valuable...

338
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,290
than you, Ji Tae.

339
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,370
The wine has a lovely aroma.

340
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,410
You chose it, didn't you?

341
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,250
Ji Tae.

342
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,490
You must be tired.

343
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,850
Well done.

344
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,330
Then give me a kiss.

345
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,930
You're warm, but not passionate.

346
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,860
You're seeing me and treating me well...

347
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,700
only because of our parents, right?

348
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,670
You don't love me.

349
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,010
I guess it's true.

350
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,890
That really hurt my pride.

351
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,410
Let's get married.

352
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,970
Let's skip the engagement ceremony and get married.

353
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,770
Do you...

354
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,890
- love me?
- Unless you push me away,

355
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,170
I won't leave you.

356
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,490
You just won't say you love me.

357
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,930
I don't mind.

358
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,250
I'll just love you...

359
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,970
for the both of us.

360
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,530
I was so hungry when I woke up.

361
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,770
I'll pay for the ramyeon.

362
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,850
I mean...

363
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,290
I'll give you the money.

364
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,930
I'll speak freely since we won't be working together.

365
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,650
Is fainting your hobby?

366
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,850
My immune system's out of order.

367
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,770
I had three huge surgeries after a car accident,

368
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,610
and my body got weird after that.

369
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,330
Do you have...

370
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,890
any leftover rice?

371
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,090
About...

372
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,650
that thing...

373
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,690
you said earlier.

374
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,370
Is it...

375
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,530
still valid?

376
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,770
I mean...

377
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,450
So what I'm saying is...

378
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,170
You said you'd give me a house,

379
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,530
a car and a building.

380
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,970
You said you'd give me anything.

381
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,770
I know you won't give me anything. I just asked.

382
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,450
What do you want?

383
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,210
Can I tell you?

384
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,410
100,000 dollars.

385
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,530
That's the biggest amount I can think of.

386
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,010
It's too much, isn't it?

387
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,290
Then 50,000 dollars.

388
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,770
30,000 dollars.

389
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,770
10,000 dollars.

390
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,770
Give me 10,000 dollars,

391
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,970
and I won't bug you about the documentary.

392
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,690
I won't show up ever again.

393
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,450
If you can't just give it to me, lend it to me.

394
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,850
82 months, interest-free.

395
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,410
60 months, interest-free.

396
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,730
Can't you even give me a loan?

397
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,450
- You're rich anyway.
- I can't.

398
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,770
Why did you make me tell you, then?

399
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,130
The rich are even stingier. You're the worst.

400
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,410
You can work.

401
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,170
Why ask for a handout when you're physically able?

402
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,850
I don't have work.

403
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,970
Your temper lost me the one job I'd finally landed.

404
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,810
Let's do the documentary, then.

405
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,730
There you go again.

406
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,090
Let's do it.

407
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,010
Yes, fine, why not?

408
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,730
What do you want?

409
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,050
Write up a new contract for the documentary.

410
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,370
You said you wouldn't do it.

411
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,330
Gook Young called to say you called it off.

412
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,850
I changed my mind. I'm doing it.

413
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,090
Okay.

414
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,370
But you might want to change your mind again,

415
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,170
so think about it carefully tomorrow morning.

416
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,770
I won't change my mind.

417
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,530
Add an article in the contract saying that I'll pay...

418
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,290
1,000 times the cancellation fee if I back out again.

419
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,410
Are you serious?

(FROM NOH EUL)

422
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,770
Ji Tae.

423
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,410
What's this?

424
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,610
A gift to celebrate my new job.

425
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,890
My brother and I leeched off you for so long.

426
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,210
You couldn't even buy new trainers.

427
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,810
Did you get a job?

428
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,610
Weren't you blacklisted by the whole industry?

429
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,650
Well done.

430
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,490
Shin Joon Young agreed to film the documentary.

431
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,450
Isn't that huge?

432
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,450
Are you shocked?

433
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,930
People just don't know how talented I am.

434
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,170
I'll make everyone pay for ignoring me.

435
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,570
Hello?

436
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,170
Why are you so quiet?

437
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,090
Did he fall asleep?

438
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,050
It's way past 3am.

439
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,450
Are you really asleep?

440
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,210
Sleep well.

441
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,770
Are you upset?

442
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,690
I'm not kicking you out forever.

443
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,890
Pretend you're at a country villa,

444
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,290
and stay here for just three months...

445
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,010
until the filming's over.

446
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,290
You can see the clouds and the sky.

447
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,050
At night, you can see the moon and stars.

448
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,610
This is a great spot.

449
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,770
Do you want me to live here while you live indoors?

450
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,330
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

451
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,410
Please make sure that...

452
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,090
none of Pororo's fur is on the carpets and floor.

453
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,770
- What?
- You see,

454
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,450
Pororo's fur caused an allergic...

455
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,770
Never mind. I'll do it.

456
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,170
Ta-da.

457
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,730
It's taro bubble tea, your favourite.

458
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,650
It's nice and sweet and full of ice.

459
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,770
I even ordered extra coconut jelly.

460
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,210
I also asked for milk foam on top.

461
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,370
It's their jumbo size. Do you like it?

462
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,370
Oh, and the milk foam...

463
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,690
symbolises my love for you.

464
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,650
Why are you doing this to me?

465
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,850
Your skin is extra smooth today.

466
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,410
You see? This is why people need a break.

467
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,610
- Aren't you glad you listened?
- What do you mean?

468
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,690
Now that you're recharged, shall we get to work?

469
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,770
- What work?
- The Ministry of Culture and Tourism...

470
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,570
commissioned a documentary.

471
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,170
I was hoping you would take the project.

472
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,170
Oh, I get it.

473
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,130
- Get what?
- I guess you already heard...

474
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,890
that I'm directing Shin Joon Young's documentary.

475
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,170
Are you?

476
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,810
I haven't heard anything like that.

477
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,610
You shouldn't have fired such a great talent like me.

478
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,060
You're a terrible judge of skill or character.

479
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,890
I'll pay you double of whatever you're getting.

480
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,210
Plus, a permanent position with insurance.

481
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,250
- Really?
- Really.

482
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,450
I need to take this. Sorry.

483
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,850
No way.

484
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,570
Hello, Sir.

485
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,290
She's in my office.

486
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,730
I'll talk her into it. Don't worry.

487
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,210
Thank you.

488
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,330
If you get her on board,

489
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,170
I'll proceed with the investment I promised.

490
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,850
What's with the flowers?

491
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,930
He got new cushions and carpets.

492
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,370
Will you look at that?

493
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,290
He's smooth and sly.

494
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,130
After all that complaining about the documentary...

495
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,250
He actually cares a lot about his image.

496
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
- Where is he anyway?
- I don't know.

497
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,410
Joon Young, are you in there?

498
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,500
What are you doing? Pooping?

499
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,290
Be strong. Good luck.

500
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,410
I wanted to ask, "Why now?"

501
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,540
I was doing fine until now.

502
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,690
I ate well...

503
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,370
and slept well.

504
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,130
I even beat my record of...

505
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,650
climbing Mount Cheonggye by three minutes.

506
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,170
Eul's supposed to come today.

507
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,090
I looked forward to this day for so long.

508
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,810
So why now?

509
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,930
But suddenly,

510
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,090
I remembered the promise I'd made long ago.

511
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,330
"Please let Eul live."

512
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,330
"If you let her live,"

513
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,250
"I will give up..."

514
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,370
"all of my happiness."

515
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,570
"I will give up..."

516
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,610
"all of my happiness."

517
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,290
Thank you for inviting me back...

518
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,770
and for offering me a generous pay package.

519
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,090
I should be thanking you.

520
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,410
I was worried that you might be too upset...

521
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,130
to work here again.

522
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,330
But I was mistaken. You're really something.

523
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,690
You don't hold a grudge.

524
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,090
I do.

525
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,570
I hold grudges forever.

526
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,650
- What?
- I'm not going to return.

527
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,060
What do you mean?

528
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,500
You love money.

529
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,210
I said I'll pay you double.

530
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,970
Plus, a permanent position with insurance.

531
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,650
Eul.

532
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,570
Double the pay, a permanent position and insurance...

533
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,690
It all sounds very tempting.

534
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,500
But if I betray him, Joon Young will kill me.

535
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,770
I'm sure of it.

536
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,450
I'm sorry, Sir.

537
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,250
She'd do anything for money, but for some reason she...

538
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,330
This country will be out of hope...

539
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,570
if someone like you becomes a congressman.

540
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,020
If you find the real criminal for my dad's case...

541
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,210
which you have forged before,

542
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,610
I will burn away all of these data.

543
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,370
Hey!

544
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,540
Stop!

545
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,210
Stop right there!

546
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,810
Stop!

548
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,050
Find out who this belongs to.

549
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,570
Who is it?

550
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,130
He almost killed his own girlfriend...

551
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,410
to save my father.

552
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,250
The person you asked about.

553
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,850
His name is Shin Joon Young.

554
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,570
I think he's your father's son.

555
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,930
Congratulations, Doctor.

556
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,970
I guess you weren't lying.

557
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,610
Your disease is progressing faster than we anticipated.

558
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:53,570
Then how much longer do I have to live?

559
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,810
Six months?

560
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,610
- Three months?
- Why don't you get admitted?

561
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,130
You can get cancer treatment and radiation.

562
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,450
- We'll do what we can...
- But...

563
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,650
that doesn't mean I won't die.

564
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,930
But it could extend your life.

565
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,130
Forget it.

566
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,970
Please prescribe a great painkiller to numb the pain...

567
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,010
so that no one can tell...

568
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,450
that I'm dying.

569
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,930
If possible,

570
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,530
I'd like to forget about it, too.

571
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,410
I'll give you 100 autographs...

572
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,890
if I can stay pain-free until I die.

573
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,290
Isn't that Shin Joon Young?

574
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,410
I believe it is.

575
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:58,490
What's he doing here?

576
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,410
You should hurry. You'll be late for your appointment.

577
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,930
Okay.

578
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,650
(MUM)

579
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,690
Your call cannot be connected.

580
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,370
Please call again.

581
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,210
(MUM)

582
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,290
(I CAN'T PICK UP. I'M IN A MEETING.)

583
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,890
She's lying again.

584
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,770
Who holds a meeting at a yukgaejang restaurant?

585
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,530
She'll never say she loves him anyway.

586
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,690
(PRETTY SPY, IRON-WILLED MS OK, SLANG DRAGONS)

587
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,850
Isn't Shin Joon Young a bit overrated?

588
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,170
Don't say things like "a bit".

589
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,410
You don't sound confident enough.

590
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,570
"He's totally overrated."

591
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,930
You have to sound sure to get other people's attention.

592
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,170
Okay.

593
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,970
People with his looks are a dime a dozen.

594
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,130
They're everywhere.

595
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,370
Like this?

596
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:25,930
Let me see.

597
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,650
Honestly, his looks aren't really that common.

598
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,130
See for yourself if you can find anyone like him.

599
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,010
If you start typing such nonsense,

600
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,610
people will just think you're jealous.

601
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:41,610
They'll mock you instead.

602
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,730
They won't even click "like".

603
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:44,890
Okay.

604
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,530
Shin Joon Young should just retire.

605
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,690
Whenever he's on TV, I switch the channel...

606
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,650
You really do switch channels right away.

607
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,810
You always switch to channels that he appears on.

608
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,410
What are you all up to?

609
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,210
Are you leaving malicious comments online...

610
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,730
so you can get Joon Young to retire?

611
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,890
Lift your faces up.

612
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,570
I'll take your photos...

613
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,570
and report you for slander.

614
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,210
Hey, Young Deuk.

615
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,370
I said I need to make pickles.

616
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:27,090
Did I tell you to peel the garlic and onions or not?

617
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,650
Is this all you peeled in two hours?

618
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,210
Were you busy badmouthing Joon Young?

619
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,970
Our boss prefers to badmouth him than peel garlic.

620
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,610
I have to do what I'm told, don't I?

621
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,490
Man Ok.

622
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,330
You're his stylist.

623
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,730
- How can you do this to him?
- What did I do?

624
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,170
Ms Shin was so pleased when he went to law school.

625
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,810
But he quit without a word to anyone.

626
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,130
How could he do that?

627
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,090
No human being would do that.

628
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,130
He was ahead of his time.

629
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,810
You just don't know what you're talking about.

630
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,010
You don't know the trend.

631
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,250
That's enough.

632
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,050
You're the worst.

633
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,610
Who is Choi Hyun Joon?

634
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,930
Do you think he'd care if you showed up...

635
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,210
with a prosecutor son?

636
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,370
"Well done, Young Ok. You raised him well."

637
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,050
Do you think he'd leave his wife...

638
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,490
to return to you?

639
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,050
Joon Young didn't become a celebrity by choice.

640
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:38,010
Your son caused an accident...

641
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,370
and needed money to get out of trouble.

642
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,650
That's why Joon Young signed the contract.

643
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,690
How...

644
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,490
How did she find out?

645
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:57,050
Did she put up with us knowing all that?

646
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:08,410
(SHIN JOON YOUNG'S FANS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.)

647
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,610
Joon Young knows that you leave horrid comments...

648
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,010
about him online.

649
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,610
He won't sue anyone for slander because...

650
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,410
he's afraid he might see you at the police station.

651
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:25,970
That lunatic.

652
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,850
Our data team got screenshots...

653
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,650
of the malicious comments,

654
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,690
and we also got a million people to petition that...

655
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,570
these people be punished.

656
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,410
These are screenshots of the worst of the worst.

657
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,250
They're horrible.

658
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,890
They should be imprisoned for life.

659
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,850
I know this person.

660
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,450
They change IDs and IP addresses,

661
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,450
but they type the same thing.

662
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,810
Hang on.

663
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,410
Joon Young's documentary will be directed by a woman?

664
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,850
A woman...

665
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,850
who looks like this...

666
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,610
will be around our Joon Young all the time?

667
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,690
Is this woman...

668
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,730
even a real producer?

669
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,210
She looks really young and really inexperienced.

670
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,330
- It smells fishy, doesn't it?
- Yes.

671
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,210
I think we should look into her first.

672
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,450
You're right.

673
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,770
Her name is Noh Eul.

674
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,850
What kind of a name is that?

675
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,290
I uploaded her photo on our chat room.

676
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,010
- Find out about her.
- Okay.

677
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,690
Is she a producer? Which school did she go to?

678
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,610
Where does she live? Does she have family?

679
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,090
Find out everything you can about her.

680
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,210
- I'll see what I can dig up.
- Okay.

681
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,130
Excuse me.

682
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:04,970
Are you talking about a producer named Noh Eul?

683
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,650
- The one who films documentaries?
- Yes.

684
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,170
- Do you know her?
- Kind of.

685
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,170
Do you really know her?

686
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,930
How do you know her?

687
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,250
Are you her boyfriend?

688
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,810
I'm at work, so I can't talk for long.

689
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,610
Give me your number, and I'll call you later.

690
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,570
Are you trying to con me?

691
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,290
Forget it, then.

692
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,050
Don't think of using my number to sell stuff.

693
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,970
My dad used to be a very famous prosecutor.

694
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,130
What should I save you as?

695
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,690
- What's your name?
- Noh...

696
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,650
Oh Jik.

697
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,650
- What's yours?
- Choi Ha Ru.

698
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,850
Is your name really Oh Jik?

699
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:11,250
Out of all the OECD member countries,

700
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:14,850
Korea has the unfortunate title of...

701
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,330
the most suicides for 10 years in a row.

702
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,540
The Ministries of Education and Health and Welfare...

703
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,930
put together an anti-suicide campaign for this.

704
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,970
They will reveal the bucket lists of 10 people...

705
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,970
with much influence on the youth.

706
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,970
Through this, they can learn how to live...

707
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,330
and how to set detailed and realistic goals.

708
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,130
If they can learn about life...

709
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,410
and realise the fun and meaning...

710
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,370
- of what to cherish...
- Stop.

711
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,330
Turn on the lights.

712
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,290
I can't understand a word you're saying.

713
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,050
Can you make it simple?

714
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,570
Simple?

715
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,410
That was the simple version.

716
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,730
I'm a little dumb.

717
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,450
It's easy.

718
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,610
Some young people want to die because life's so tough.

719
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,330
Tell them not to. Tell them to live.

720
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,730
Tell them not to die.

721
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,610
That's what you need to say through your bucket list.

722
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,970
Tell them that life is worth living,

723
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,050
whatever the price may be.

724
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,770
Tell them how beautiful life is.

725
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,290
It's a blessing from above.

726
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,770
They should have hope and courage...

727
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:40,510
You didn't tell me this was the concept.

728
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:41,930
I did.

729
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,360
I gave the printouts to Gook Young.

730
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,930
I put it on your desk.

731
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:49,850
Didn't I?

732
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,730
It was for you to read.

733
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,850
Didn't you read it?

735
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:21,250
Do you think he'll back out of the documentary again?

736
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,610
I'm dead if he does.

737
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:26,130
If he does, then that woman,

738
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:29,490
Producer Noh, will come at us all with a knife.

739
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,850
It'll be a huge mess.

740
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,410
I vote that he'll back out and ruin everything.

741
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,290
You have my vote.

742
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,210
Count mine as well.

743
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,210
Pack up.

744
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,930
- This won't happen.
- I'll talk to him.

745
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,010
Let's start filming.

746
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:09,250
What's the first thing on your bucket list?

747
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:27,890
Let's assume that you only have one year to live.

748
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,930
What do you think you'll want to do first?

749
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:39,410
Do you want to go somewhere or do something?

750
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,890
Or see someone?

751
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,090
Nothing?

752
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,690
Let's say you only have a year to live.

753
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,690
A year is all you have left.

754
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,530
Wouldn't you want to do or see...

755
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,850
A year is too long.

756
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,290
Let's say I have three months.

757
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,410
Okay.

758
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,890
Let's say you have three months.

759
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,090
I'll do what I want. I'll sue people who slander me...

760
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,210
and kill everyone I hate.

761
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,090
That goes against the purpose of this documentary.

762
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,050
We want to send a message saying that life is valuable.

763
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,210
- That it's beautiful...
- I'll flirt at clubs...

764
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,290
- Excuse me.
- and sleep around.

765
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,890
Okay, stop, stop.

766
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,370
The interview's over.

767
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,930
Keep the camera rolling.

768
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,890
Do you think this is all a joke?

769
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,130
I'm not joking.

770
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,450
I'm serious.

771
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,210
I'm dying. What can't I do?

772
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,770
Why don't you do drugs?

773
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,170
You should drink and drive.

774
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,090
Why not gamble and cause a scene in public?

775
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,970
Will you go out with me?

776
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,010
Let's say I have three months to live.

777
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,210
For just three months.

778
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,170
Passionately.

779
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,770
(UNCONTROLLABLY FOND)

780
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,850
Can I mention on social media that we're dating?

781
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:01,610
- Everyone knows who she is.
- You witch.

782
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,530
Now, I owe you nothing.

783
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,690
Could you hire me as your wife?

784
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,130
I want you to be with him.

785
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,610
He'll make you happy.

786
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,770
Instead of that crazy producer,

787
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,210
another producer will take the project.

788
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,650
Are you her husband?

789
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,330
Are you Eul's husband?

790
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,850
- Am I your husband?
- Yes.

791
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,130
Have you never seen me before? Is he jobless?

792
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,290
He sounded like he'd look hideous.

793
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,450
A boyfriend.

794
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:29,690
It's my concert.

795
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,530
Wear this to his concert.

796
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,450
Joon Young lives in a completely different world now.

797
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,570
Don't fall for him.
