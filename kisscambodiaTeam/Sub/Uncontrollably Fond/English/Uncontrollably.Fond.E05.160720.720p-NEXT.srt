Let's assume that you only have one year to live.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,610
Let's say you only have a year to live.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,720
A year is all you have left.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,920
Wouldn't you want to do or see...

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,120
A year is too long.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
Let's say I have three months.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,360
Okay.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,640
Let's say you have three months.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,840
I'll do what I want. I'll sue people who slander me...

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,800
and kill everyone I hate.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,720
That goes against the purpose of this documentary.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
We want to send a message saying that life is valuable.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,400
- That it's beautiful...
- I'll flirt at clubs...

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,560
- Excuse me.
- and sleep around.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,960
Okay, stop, stop.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,360
The interview's over.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,640
Keep the camera rolling.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,770
Do you think this is all a joke?

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,240
I'm not joking.

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm serious.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm dying. What can't I do?

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,600
Why don't you do drugs?

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,080
You should drink and drive.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,840
Why not gamble and cause a scene in public?

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,600
Will you go out with me?

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,440
Let's say I have three months to live.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,960
For just three months.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
Passionately.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,680
Just for three months.

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,600
Let's date each other like there's no tomorrow.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,520
It was just a test run today.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,560
I think Joon Young's throwing a joke to break the ice.

35
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
I told you, I'm not joking.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,810
I clearly said that I wasn't joking.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,530
- Joon Young.
- Do you not want to, Producer Noh?

38
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,040
How can I say no to that? I'm so thankful.

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
A huge celebrity just asked me out.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,280
- I'd be crazy to say no.
- Producer Noh.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
- Producer Noh.
- When do we begin? Today?

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,480
Will you make this public? I don't mind.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,760
Can I announce that I'm dating you on my social media?

(GOPCHANGGO)

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Hello.

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,440
Bong Sook, what's with her?

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
I don't know. She must've done something wrong again.

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,080
She's been like this for 30 minutes.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
You won't die like that.

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
Did you do something wrong?

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
What?

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,120
I think I might get fired...

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
from Joon Young's documentary crew.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,760
Why?

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,600
Joon Young made a joke, but I took it seriously.

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,600
Wait, he was serious, but I made it into a joke.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,840
Wait, no.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,400
He was serious, and I took it seriously, too.

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,610
- What are you saying?
- I think she's crazy.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm not crazy.

61
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,560
Why are you always so harsh on me?

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Everyone in this world looks down on me,

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,080
and it's all because you look down on me.

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,200
No one says anything to Joon Young,

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,730
but they say I'm crazy for putting up with him.

66
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,480
Do I look that stupid to you?

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
My goodness.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
Hey!

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
I never stayed silent about Joon Young.

70
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,170
What's with you? Do I look like a fool?

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
Exactly.

72
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,240
I must be crazy.

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,730
That's good news.

74
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,170
You should quit filming his documentary...

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
and continue filming exploratory documentaries.

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
I'll help you look for a job.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
Look who's talking. You're unemployed, too.

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm going to get a job soon, too.

79
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,440
Once you get a job,

80
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,080
I should just marry you.

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm so fed up with everything.

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

83
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,760
You won't...

84
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,240
starve Jik and me.

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
Can you give me a job...

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,760
as your wife?

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
- What did you say?
- I said, someone else...

88
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,440
will come to film your documentary tomorrow...

89
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,920
instead of that crazy woman.

90
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,960
I know that you joked around by asking her...

91
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
to date you so that you could get rid of her.

92
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,480
Our company president got so mad and said...

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,680
that she responded to you absurdly.

94
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,200
He told the production crew that we can't...

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,640
let her work with you.

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
Are you satisfied, Joon Young?

97
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,960
What should she have said, then?

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,160
"Youâ€™re trash. Are you insane?"

99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,000
"I will kill you." Should she have said that?

100
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
If she did, things would've been worse.

101
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
She can't possibly say that to a celebrity like you.

102
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,320
Think about it.

103
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,800
The production crew is pretty harsh, too.

104
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Just because she's a temporary worker, they said,

105
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
"Yes, we were thinking about replacing her, too."

106
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,680
What a play, right? How can they be so cruel?

107
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,440
How can they treat her like that?

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,560
I was about to stop talking right now. I'm sorry.

109
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Call President Nam and tell him that...

110
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,640
without Eul, I won't film a second of that documentary.

111
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,160
If he doesn't want me to quit,

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,760
tell him that he'd better get her back to work.

113
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,840
Mister, here's some food.

114
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,120
Fine, I take it back.

115
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,760
I take back my proposal.

116
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,360
You could just say that you don't want me as your wife.

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,280
You don't have to drink a lot. You can't even drink.

118
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,040
"It's not like that, Eul."

119
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,160
"Why would I turn down a lovely girl like you?"

120
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,360
"I just can't believe how great this is."

121
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,640
I guess that's not how you feel.

122
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,120
You're really turning me down?

123
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,400
I didn't like you that much, either.

124
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,360
He's not even coming after me.

125
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,040
It's not like he's so great. Why is he so stubborn?

126
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,360
That was embarrassing. I lost my job and got dumped.

127
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,960
What a day.

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,330
It's just a bad year, that's all.

129
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,120
She really doesn't know her place.

130
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,400
How can she even think about getting you?

131
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,680
Do you think...

132
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm better than Eul?

133
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,560
Of course. You may be unemployed, but you're better.

134
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
Eul is in huge debt,

135
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,720
and she has a bad temper. She even takes bribes.

136
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,330
So let me tell you something.

137
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,760
There's this woman I know who cooks well,

138
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,960
has enough money and doesn't look so bad.

139
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm...

140
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,120
not good enough for her.

141
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,600
How could I dare to have her?

142
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,090
That's why I didn't say yes.

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What?

144
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
My gosh, Eul left her cell phone here.

145
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,880
She's so clumsy.

146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,600
He's not sane, either.

147
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Eul.

148
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Noh Eul.

149
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Who is this?

150
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,440
Yes? This is Eul's phone.

151
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,160
Hello?

152
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,880
Why are you picking up her phone?

153
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
I was with her, and she left her phone behind.

154
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,800
Who is this?

155
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
Who are you?

156
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,120
I asked you first.

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,920
You should introduce yourself first before you ask.

158
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
Can't you read Korean?

159
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,080
My name must've come up on the screen.

160
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,360
There was only a picture of a dog and a bird.

161
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,760
A dog and a bird?

162
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,960
Are you serious?

163
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Anyway, Eul can't take your call, so you should call...

164
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,080
If you're Joon Young by any chance,

165
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,440
I don't think you should call her again.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
Eul just got fired from the documentary crew.

167
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,680
Who are you?

168
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Who are you to tell me what to do?

169
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,320
Oh, right.

170
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,720
Are you her husband?

171
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Where's my phone?

172
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
Are you Eul's husband?

173
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,000
Hello? Answer me. Are you her husband?

174
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
Why did you pick up my call?

175
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,520
Hello?

176
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
Hello?

177
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,920
Hey, you jerk! Learn how to drive!

180
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,440
Am I your husband?

181
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Yes.

182
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,560
You always like to take other people's sides.

183
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,120
Just like a typical Korean husband. That's why.

184
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,280
Goodbye.

185
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,400
Eul.

186
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,720
You will meet someone worthy.

187
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,360
You'll meet someone who truly cares about you,

188
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,440
loves you,

189
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,600
and someone who'll make you happy.

190
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,360
You will meet him.

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
Wow, this is surprising.

192
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,360
I didn't think you were like this.

193
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
You're really awful.

194
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,400
If you want to say no, just say it. Don't play nice.

195
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,080
- Eul.
- I'm not going to see you any more.

196
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,960
Don't ever call me again.

197
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,960
Why did he call me, anyway?

198
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,840
I can never tell what this crazy guy is up to.

199
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,280
Why did you call me, you crazy fool?

200
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,040
Did you want to see me angry?

201
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,520
If I ever meet you again, I'll change my name to Dog.

202
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,760
I am sorry for not picking up the phone right away.

203
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,560
I am sincerely looking back on myself...

204
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,800
and am seriously reflecting on the rash joke that I made.

205
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
Please talk to the president...

206
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
and grant me one more chance.

207
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,920
Forget about it. I can make a living without you.

208
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,880
I will get double the salary,

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,360
insurance, and work as a permanent employee.

210
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,760
I think that's Joon Young's car.

211
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,960
Why are you shocked? Haven't you seen this jerk before?

212
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,000
How did you find me?

213
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
I asked your production crew.

214
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,280
How can they give out my personal information...

215
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,880
Why do you live with Na Ri if you have a husband?

216
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,560
Well, that's...

217
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,960
Are you married now? Do you have a kid, too?

218
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,120
Is he unemployed? Did he lose his job?

219
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Did he ask you to make money no matter what?

220
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,960
What kind of a crazy guy would marry someone like me?

221
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,840
I don't have a husband, and I don't have kids.

222
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,760
I live at my friend's house because...

223
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,170
I've got no home, money or pride.

224
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,720
And thanks to this psycho, I got fired again.

225
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,920
So I'll remain penniless, homeless and husbandless.

226
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,320
Is this funny to you?

227
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,960
Are you having fun?

228
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,240
Why am I telling you this?

229
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,650
I must be out of my mind.

230
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,650
(PRODUCER YOON OF SKY PRODUCTION)

231
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,840
- Hello.
- This is Producer Yoon.

232
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,680
We need you to take this documentary to the end.

233
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,680
I thought you were changing the producer.

234
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,240
Joon Young said he won't film a second without you.

235
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,280
He also wants less of the crew to be around.

236
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,000
We need you here for a meeting. Can you come now?

237
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,920
Hello? Producer Noh.

238
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,120
Producer Noh, are you listening? Hello?

239
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,650
We are in a hurry. Hello? Producer Noh?

241
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,170
Here you go.

242
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,840
What are all these?

243
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,320
I started working, so I won't be around for a while.

244
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
She couldn't sleep yesterday from making all these.

245
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,960
It tastes awful, so keep that in mind.

246
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
It's too salty.

247
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,890
This is so sad.

248
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,320
Look at your face.

249
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,200
Doesn't your friend give you food?

250
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,410
- Eul, come on.
- My goodness.

251
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,600
If you're that worried,

252
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,680
you should follow him around all day long.

253
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,120
Should I do that?

254
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,720
Should I quit everything and follow you around?

255
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,360
Sure. Quit your job and come follow me around.

256
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,800
You can come to school with me.

257
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,040
Let's go to school.

258
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Jik.

259
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I do want to follow you around, but...

260
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,650
You do know about Joon Young's fans, right?

261
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,600
What?

262
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
His fans are the most extreme among all celebrity fans.

263
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
They're now doing a background check on you.

264
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,960
You'll probably get in trouble...

265
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,410
(NEW MESSAGE)

266
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,650
Is this Oh Jik's phone?

267
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,360
You said you'd tell me about Eul, but you never called.

268
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,840
You won't pick up your phone, either.

269
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,280
You'll die in my hands if everything was a lie.

270
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,720
She's the president of his fan club.

271
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,720
Do you remember that my father's a famous prosecutor?

272
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,200
If you were personally interested in me...

273
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,560
What will you do with Eul's personal information?

274
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,040
Do your parents know about this?

275
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Unbelievable.

276
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,320
Eul, you've matured.

277
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,040
What are you doing?

278
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Eul.

279
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,720
She should do something better with her life.

280
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,360
- Give me your phone.
- Give it to her.

281
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
(THE WORST OF THE WORST)

282
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,400
It's her, right?

283
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,160
I'll take care of her. Give me your phone.

284
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Noh Jik!

285
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,000
Your call cannot be connected.

286
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,000
- Please try again.
- My goodness!

287
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,160
What's wrong?

288
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,200
Give me that girl's number.

289
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,560
Why is she messing with a student?

290
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,720
- Is Joon Young so special?
- Yes, he is.

291
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,480
She's not a weird kid, either. She's completely sane.

292
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,360
Joon Young is special enough to make anyone go crazy.

293
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,400
That's not the point.

294
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't fall for him, Eul.

295
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,240
- What?
- Because you'll be around him all the time,

296
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,600
you'll start to have feelings for him.

297
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,160
But don't even think about it.

298
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,480
Who do you think I am?

299
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,520
Joon Young lives in a different world now.

300
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,960
If you begin to put meaning in everything...

301
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,160
he says or does, you will end up...

302
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,760
getting hurt.

303
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,600
Are you sick or something?

304
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,800
I guess those ribs did taste a little weird.

305
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,480
I told you to stay away from it, didn't I?

306
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,520
I wish you'd date Hyun Woo.

307
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,680
He doesn't have much, but he's a really good guy.

308
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,920
He's a good match for you.

309
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,120
I think you'd be happy that way.

310
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,280
That's all for today.

311
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
Goodbye, Eul.

312
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,360
Have fun at work.

313
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,760
What a little brother.

314
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,040
Hyun Woo dumped me already.

315
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,680
You don't even know anything.

316
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,760
It's so embarrassing.

317
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,440
Once you get a job,

318
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,480
I should just marry you.

319
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
I'm so fed up with everything.

320
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,560
- What?
- You won't...

321
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
starve Jik and me.

322
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,440
Can you give me a job...

323
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,640
as your wife?

324
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
Am I your husband?

325
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Yes.

326
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,680
You always like to take other people's sides.

327
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,360
Just like a typical Korean husband. That's why.

328
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
All right, Ji Tae.

329
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Yes?

330
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
Ji Tae, your father wants you.

331
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,760
- My father?
- Yes.

332
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,400
You're thinking for too long.

333
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,800
Your next move will end up as a bad one.

334
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,480
It looks like you're hoping for me to make a mistake.

335
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,520
That won't happen.

336
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,440
Let's see.

337
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
All right.

338
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,880
I'll get both at once.

339
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
Yes!

340
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,240
Hey, one more round.

341
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,680
No way.

342
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,640
Give me what you promised.

343
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,920
That's too precious. I'll give you something else.

344
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,640
- Come one, one more round.
- My gosh, Father.

345
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,320
Will you be like this? I'm telling Mum.

346
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,080
Do you want to win your father so badly?

347
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,440
My gosh, unbelievable.

348
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,560
Where did you learn to speak like that?

349
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
Come on. One more round.

350
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,360
- I can't.
- Dad.

351
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,960
Oh, my.

352
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,760
Ha Ru.

353
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,840
- Today was a bad day for me.
- My goodness.

354
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,960
Where have you been?

355
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Today's Joon Young's concert.

356
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,240
Wear this and come to his concert.

357
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,040
It's at 6pm in the Olympic Hall.

358
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,360
How could I go there?

359
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
Haven't you heard? That one politician posted...

360
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,640
a picture of him and his daughter at a concert...

361
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,040
on his social media account and it became very popular.

362
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
I didn't know.

363
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,480
He's a busy man.

364
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,840
Also, you should be studying.

365
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,440
You'll fail your college entrance exams again.

366
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Fine.

367
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,200
Come on, let's go. Please?

368
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,840
Right, I heard they're filming his documentary, too.

369
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,960
Wouldn't it be so awesome to see you there?

370
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,160
Ha Ru, stop.

371
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,320
Do I look like I'm joking?

372
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Ji Tae.

373
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,080
Other students are using all their time to study.

374
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,080
You don't have time to go to a concert.

375
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,960
I'm telling you, quit that fan club thing.

376
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
No.

377
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,560
To me, Joon Young is more important than college.

378
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,120
My life is dead without him. Don't tell me what to do.

379
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,040
Don't talk back to your brother.

380
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Ha Ru, he's your brother.

381
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,760
It's because he's acting weird. He's so scary.

382
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,680
He must be insane, Dad.

383
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled in front of you.

384
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,400
This Joon Young guy...

385
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,320
I suddenly like him a bit.

386
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,800
"Why is Ji Tae never angry?"

387
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,960
"He has a million reasons to be angry,"

388
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,840
"but he never gets angry."

389
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,640
"Is something wrong with him?"

390
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,600
I even thought about taking you to a doctor.

391
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,560
But I guess I don't have to be worried.

392
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,480
You do know how to be angry.

393
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,640
You also know how to lose your temper.

394
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,920
I learned that you're fine thanks to him.

395
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,360
Maybe I should buy him a meal.

397
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,160
How can you change the password?

398
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,960
You said you'd call.

399
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,320
"I'm in a meeting. I will call you right back."

400
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,560
You sent me that text when I called you.

401
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,400
The meeting isn't over yet.

402
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm doing a concert today.

403
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,960
I got you the best seats, so come with Jeong Sik.

404
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,920
This is your last chance to see your sexy son.

405
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,640
This is really your last chance.

406
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,960
Soon, you won't be able to see me like this.

407
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
What a great news.

408
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,360
Thanks for the good news.

409
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Move.

410
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,640
Mum.

411
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,520
Let go. I'm not your mum.

412
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,400
You never treated me like your mum.

413
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,040
You quit school all by yourself without telling me...

414
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,240
and became a celebrity without asking me.

415
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,880
What's so bad about being a celebrity?

416
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,960
A celebrity is far better than a prosecutor.

417
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,320
Mum, do you know how rich I am?

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,120
I have buildings, houses, three fancy cars...

419
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,960
Oh, sure. Good for you.

420
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,320
You wanted to help poor people like us as a prosecutor.

421
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,880
You made yourself sound so grand.

422
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,080
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

423
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,240
Guys like me shouldn't become a prosecutor.

424
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,280
If I became a prosecutor,

425
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,520
poor and needy people like you...

426
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,320
probably couldn't live in this country.

427
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
What?

428
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,320
Those seats will remain empty. You should come.

429
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm not going. You'll probably die before I go there.

430
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,760
What a bold woman.

431
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,040
She almost made me cry.

432
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,080
(FIND YOUR MAP HERE.)

433
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,120
(LET'S GO TOGETHER.)

434
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,960
Stop crying. It's not like your parents are gone.

435
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,770
I was so hurt.

436
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,160
Ms Jang, how can Ji Tae do that to me?

437
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,200
How can he scream at his only sister?

438
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,520
And he glared at me like this.

439
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,330
I have a weak heart just like my mum.

440
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,200
Your mum has weak kidneys.

441
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,120
Same thing.

442
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,080
My brother must really be insane.

443
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,360
My goodness. Good for you.

444
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,000
He worries about you, but you talk behind his back.

445
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,640
- Dad.
- Congressman Choi.

446
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,810
He has every right to scold you as your family...

447
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,600
for not studying and doing this fan club thing.

448
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,810
Stop talking behind his back, Ha Ru.

449
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,560
- How did you get here?
- I texted him.

450
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,770
I told him that you were really hurt by Ji Tae,

451
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,960
and that you're crying a river in this concert hall.

452
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Are you here for Ha Ru?

453
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,000
Here.

454
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,920
Look at this.

455
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,520
This is a secret to Ji Tae and Mum.

456
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,720
Dad.

457
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,960
I'm bringing her up the wrong way, right?

458
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,720
It's between us, but Ha Ru isn't the studying type.

459
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,120
Her scores won't go up by sitting in front of a desk.

460
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,290
That's true.

461
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
It's not like I'm doing anything bad, either.

462
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,770
I'm just busy following Joon Young around.

463
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Sure.

464
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,080
Great job, Ha Ru.

465
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,560
Congressman... I mean, Mr Choi.

466
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,330
You've made a difficult move today,

467
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,720
so why don't we all gather up and take a picture?

468
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,240
No, Ms Jang. I'm fine.

469
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
Okay, here we go.

470
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,480
In 1, 2, 3.

471
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,000
- We love you, Joon Young!
- We love you, Joon Young!

472
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,880
- You're the best!
- You're the best!

473
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,440
- Be healthy, Joon Young!
- Be healthy, Joon Young!

474
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,120
- We love you, Joon Young!
- We love you, Joon Young!

(VIP SEATS: SHIN YOUNG OK, JANG JEONG SIK)

476
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,840
Don't fall for him, Eul.

477
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,290
Because you'll be around him all the time,

478
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,440
you'll start to have feelings for him.

479
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,290
But don't even think about it.

480
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,920

- Okay.

Are you going to the Public Prosecutors' Office?

484
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,770
I want to be a prosecutor, too.

485
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,960
I'd love to see you as a prosecutor one day.

486
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,480
Yes.

487
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,720
What's your name?

488
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,480
You're my future colleague. I'll sign it for you.

I'll study hard...

491
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,600
and come back with the pass slip.

492
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,680
I'll give you my name then.

Joon Young,

494
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,640
I guess you won't be coming back for your book.

495
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,680
Where did he go?

496
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,770
Shin Joon Young's concert?

497
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
Why did he go there?

498
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,080
It seems like he went there because of Ha Ru.

499
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,160
What?

500
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,080
Aren't you supposed to be peeling onions?

501
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,440
I was watching Joon Young's concert to bash him.

502
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,560
What?

503
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,080
But I couldn't find anything bad.

504
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
He's so cool.

505
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,520
Go in and peel onions...

506
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,880
- and garlic.
- My gosh.

507
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,840
Hey, what did you say?

508
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,120
Did you just curse at me?

509
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,360
Why are you taking your anger out on Young Deuk?

510
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,600
Where have you been all day long?

511
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,400
What is this?

512
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,770
What is this?

513
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,840
It's what Gook Young owes Joon Young.

514
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,400
- Jeong Sik.
- I told him...

515
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,400
to give it to Joon Young...

516
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,330
three years ago, but he kept it for himself.

517
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,160
That's why it's late.

518
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,200
Where did you get this money?

519
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,770
I went and made people who owe me money pay me back.

520
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,200
Then I took out the deposit from my place.

521
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,800
- Take the interest from my paycheque.
- Jeong Sik.

522
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,160
All the frustration that I've had for five years...

523
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,000
is all gone now. What a relief.

524
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,160
I owe you nothing now.

525
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,520
Okay? We are completely equal by all means.

526
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,440
Financially, psychologically and as a man and a woman.

527
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,440
Also, let's clear this out.

528
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,160
He didn't quit law school because of Gook Young.

529
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,840
Number one, for some reason, he quit school first.

530
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,800
Number two, Gook Young got into an accident.

531
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,360
Number three, Joon Young then helped him...

532
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,200
with the front money from his agency.

533
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,320
Can you remember that order? Good.

534
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,200
- All right, he's here.
- Great job.

535
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,960
That was the best you've ever done.

536
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,880
- Give him some water.
- Okay.

537
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,200
- Here you go.
- Okay.

538
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,360
You'll sing the last song after the guest singer.

539
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,360
Let's finish this to the end.

540
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,960
Let's go!

541
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,800
Yes, let's go!

542
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,640
You haven't done concerts in a while, right?

543
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,760
- Yes.
- How do you feel right now?

544
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,720
Who's that guy?

545
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Sorry?

546
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,560
The guy who picked up your phone yesterday.

547
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,800
The guy who you saved as "Husband" on your cell phone.

548
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,960
What's wrong with him?

549
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,440
He's hitting on her.

550
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,960
Is he your boyfriend?

551
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,320
It looked like some of your fans came...

552
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,200
from the other side of the globe to see you.

553
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Could you say hello to...

554
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,200
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

555
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,760
What did you eat today?

556
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,920
What do you usually eat before...

557
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,920
How long have you been dating him?

558
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,760
Joon Young.

559
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,560
What do you usually do after a concert?

560
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,080
- What's...
- His voice wasn't very attractive.

561
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,240
How does he look?

562
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,840
It sounded like he'd be very ugly.

563
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,640
Your boyfriend.

564
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
He's not my boyfriend.

565
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,720
Good job.

566
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,040
(THERE'S SOMEONE I LOVE IN THIS PLACE.)

567
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,600
(THERE'S SOMEONE I LOVE IN THIS PLACE.)

568
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,880
(THERE'S SOMEONE I LOVE IN THIS PLACE.)

569
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,840
(I WANT TO CONFESS MY LOVE TO YOU TODAY.)

570
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,520
(I WANT TO CONFESS MY LOVE TO YOU TODAY.)

571
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,080
What if it's me?

572
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
Happy 100th day.

573
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,800
I love you, Eul.

575
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,840
Ha Ru, look at this.

576
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,520
My gosh.

577
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,640
Unbelievable.

578
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,360
(JOON YOUNG'S GIRL IS FINALLY REVEALED.)

579
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,640
My goodness. What is this?

580
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,680
This is a picture that went viral...

581
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,680
as soon as an article was released about...

582
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,480
how Joon Young proposed to Producer Noh.

583
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,160
- Where's Joon Young?
- He's over there.

584
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,120
He proposed in front of his fans, but got rejected.

585
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,920
He probably wants to die out of embarrassment.

586
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,760
What is this?

587
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,800
What is this situation?

588
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,280
Eul's high school friend uploaded this picture.

589
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,720
That person took and uploaded this a long time ago.

590
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,040
I didn't ask you.

591
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,320
What is this? Is she your ex-girlfriend?

592
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,080
"Eul stole her friend's boyfriend, Joon Young."

593
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Eul's personal information is all over the internet.

594
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,320
Look at these comments.

595
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,800
"Everyone in Suyu-ri knows this story."

596
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
"Eul's friend became a mess."

597
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,680
"She even tried to kill herself."

598
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,280
"Why would Joon Young date someone like her?"

599
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,480
"Unbelievable. She's definitely a gold digger."

600
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,960
This is driving me crazy.

601
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,720
Who is that? Who wrote that stupid...

602
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,960
"I feel bad for his fans."

603
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,160
"He shouldn't have done that in front of his fans."

604
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,240
"How can I leave his fan club?"

605
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
Keep reading.

606
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,640
"The gold digger and the fool are the same."

607
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,440
"You're filming a documentary, not a movie."

608
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,200
"What does he see in her?"

609
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,440
"He has low standards."

610
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,120
Take a screen shot and report these to the police.

611
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,440
Tell them I will meet these jerks in person...

612
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,320
and kill them with my own hands.

613
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,320
I don't think that's the problem right now.

614
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,200
If things went this far,

615
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,240
Producer Noh is probably facing bigger problems.

616
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,480
That's Noh Eul, right? Unbelievable.

617
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,640
She's scary.

618
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,600
- What's with her clothes?
- I know.

619
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,120
- What's she doing?
- Who does she think she is?

620
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,560
She probably hit on him first.

621
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,280
Is she listening?

622
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,600
I hate you.

623
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,360
Are you talking to me?

624
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,200
You're a gold digger.

625
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,680
Hey, I'm not a gold digger.

626
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,120
I see.

627
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,960
You all must be angry because of that proposal event.

628
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,360
It's all a lie. It was just a part of the show.

629
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,960
Did you all buy that?

630
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,440
What are you doing? Stop filming me.

631
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,240
Congratulations. Joon Young's such a romantic.

632
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
It's not like that.

633
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,320
I heard you two dated since high school.

634
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,800
Who said that?

635
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,880
Stop speaking nonsense, and move the camera.

636
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,240
The internet turned upside down with your story.

637
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,080
(JOON YOUNG'S GIRL IS FINALLY REVEALED.)

638
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,520
Stop this.

639
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,880
This is all but a rumour. You're violating her rights.

640
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
Hey.

641
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,560
Are you her husband?

642
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,800
I don't care, anyway.

643
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,880
They're filming this right now. Are you okay with that?

644
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,640
From this point on, people will think it's real.

645
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,880
I don't care.

646
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,960
But will you be all right?

647
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,720
I'm already a celebrity, so everyone knows who I am.

648
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,200
If you reveal yourself on camera,

649
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,360
everyone will find out about you in no time.

650
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,400
Hey! There's Joon Young.

651
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,600
- Joon Young!
- Joon Young!

652
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,920
(UNCONTROLLABLY FOND)

653
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,480
Say his name once more, and I'll throw you in the sea.

654
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,440
Have you see my phone?

655
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,000
Could you please reconsider?

656
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,000
Let's go out with each other.

657
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,080
I can't be with Eul...

658
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,760
because of what you've done.

659
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,520
I'll just drown to death. I don't want to live anyway.

660
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,080
She's crazy.

661
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,560
Let go of me.

662
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
Hey!

663
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,920
My gosh.

664
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,960
Eul, are you really in a trouble?

665
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,040
I heard your boyfriend is missing.

666
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,720
Joon Young, where are you?

667
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,240
What if he drowned?

668
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,800
Joon Young's fans will kill Eul.

669
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,520
You're the nation's most famous gold digger.

670
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,920
People even know about what underwear brand you wear.

671
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,520
Eul.

672
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,920
Should I give up on you...

673
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,680
and send you off to that guy?
