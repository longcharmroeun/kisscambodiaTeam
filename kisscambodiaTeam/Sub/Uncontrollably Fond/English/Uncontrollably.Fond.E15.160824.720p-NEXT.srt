1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
- I'm sorry.
- Are you?

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,449
For what?

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,480
How sorry are you?

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,760
How dare you...

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,280
How dare someone like you...

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,840
You don't even deserve my jealousy!

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
I really am.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm really...

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,800
If you're that sorry, die.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,080
If you feel that bad, go and kill yourself.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,680
Take your own life so that Ji Tae...

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,720
can't go back to you!

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,920
Joon Young.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,560
I had a dream last night.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,640
And in that dream,

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,000
I met you.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,480
Unfortunately, I met you in the most miserable,

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,080
most embarrassing...

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
and most awful moment of my life.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
The doors are closing.

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,890
Did your coat eat all of your food?

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,720
What an awful coat.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
You must be hungry.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
I knew it was only a dream,

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,760
but I was still excited...

28
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,720
and my heart fluttered.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,320
And your hand was unbelievably warm.

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,560
You were hungry, weren't you?

31
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Try it.

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,840
It may look awful, but it'll taste good.

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm serious.

34
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Come on.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't eat it.

36
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm serious. Don't eat it.

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,360
You might die from eating that.

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,720
It's the first meal you ever cooked for me.

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
How could I not eat it?

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
Although, I knew it was a dream,

41
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,040
and it really tasted awful.

42
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,640
Do you have kimchi?

43
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Of course I do.

44
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,680
You wouldn't know how desolate,

45
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
lonely and empty it feels...

46
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
to be in a dream...

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,600
when you already know it's a dream.

48
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,180
I think I have a cold.

49
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,809
Stop it.

50
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,379
- It's because of my cold.
- I said, stop it.

51
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,380
Hey.

52
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,960
Come here.

53
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Come over here.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you okay?

55
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,520
Morning, don't come.

56
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,180
Please don't come.

57
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,250
If anyone dares to wake me up from this dream,

58
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,930
I'll follow them around forever to get my revenge.

59
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,290
At least let me feel sorry and guilty towards you.

60
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,709
- Please.
- I'll make sure I kill her.

61
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,810
- Jeong Eun.
- I'll kill her with...

62
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,010
my own two hands.

63
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,899
Do you think I can't do it?

64
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,850
I'll do anything to get you back, Ji Tae.

65
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,690
Wasn't once enough?

66
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,449
- What?
- Because of your immature behaviour...

67
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,650
and selfishness, you once put someone's life in danger.

68
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,690
Wasn't that enough?

69
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,169
What are you talking about?

70
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm saying you shouldn't...

71
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,740
talk so easily about killing someone.

72
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,610
You can't go.

73
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,119
- Jeong Eun.
- You can't go to her.

74
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,740
- Let go.
- It's my birthday, Ji Tae.

75
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,489
Stay with me.

76
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,570
Let go!

77
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,930
- I can't.
- Just let him go.

78
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,410
Let him go. You can hang out with me.

79
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,980
Tell him to leave...

80
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,450
and celebrate your birthday with me.

81
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,250
Eul.

82
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,530
(JI TAE)

83
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
This is...

84
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,360
to make up for your broken shoes.

85
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,480
And this is your birthday present.

86
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,480
Thank you for saving me...

87
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,800
- every single time.
- I know.

88
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,000
It's like I'm your guardian angel.

89
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,139
Aren't you going to take your birthday present?

90
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,410
Why are you doing this to me?

91
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,729
I thought you didn't want to seduce me.

92
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,040
Why are you stirring my heart?

93
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,880
How did you even know it was my birthday?

94
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,280
What if I am trying to stir your heart?

95
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,360
Will that work on you?

96
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,339
Not because you want to take revenge on Eul...

97
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,609
for stealing someone you love.

98
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,960
And not because you want to show Ji Tae...

99
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,120
what he's losing out on.

100
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
Just purely, with no other conditions,

101
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,520
are you interested in being seduced by me?

102
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
No, wait.

103
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
How about you seduce me instead?

104
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,259
But you like Eul.

105
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,520
That's why I'm asking you to seduce me.

106
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,760
I want to forget everything...

107
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,600
about Eul.

108
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
I want you to fill my head...

109
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
with only thoughts of you.

110
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,920
Can you do that?

111
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,960
(CHOI JI TAE)

112
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,059
Hello?

113
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,270
What are you trying to do?

114
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,169
Why did you approach Jeong Eun?

115
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,790
To help you, Ji Tae.

116
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,710
I'll help you get rid of that woman.

117
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,310
Aren't you thankful?

118
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,150
Are you?

119
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,150
It's nothing. We should help each other out like this.

120
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,029
I should do something good before I die anyway.

121
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,289
Hey, Joon Young!

122
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,230
If you're that thankful, buy me a drink later.

123
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,929
Hey, what are you going to do?

124
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,150
They took everything.

125
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,790
You little...

126
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,070
It's the stuff you threw away.

127
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,670
People took everything from clothes, bags to shoes.

128
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,209
They only left these empty bags behind.

129
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,079
Now we can't even sell them or get a refund.

130
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,230
What are you going to do?

131
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,190
Do you want me to buy them again?

132
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,289
- You're still talking nonsense.
- Ouch!

133
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,110
Do you even realise what you've done?

134
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,309
We're not talking about just a dollar or 10 dollars.

135
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,430
You spent 10,000 dollars overnight.

136
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,409
I said I'll buy them again for you. I'm really rich.

137
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,550
You little...

138
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,830
I'm going to tell Jik about this.

139
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,749
I'm going to tell him that you received...

140
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,909
a million dollars just so you could...

141
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,750
pay for his college and send him abroad.

142
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,449
Are you trying to cut him out of my life?

143
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,849
Then hurry up and return the money before he finds out.

144
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,289
Fall into debt if you have to, but make sure...

145
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,350
you return all the money you got from them.

146
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,830
Who is it?

147
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,270
It's Hyun Woo. No.

148
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,750
It's Ji Tae.

149
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,270
Tell him to go. I'm not meeting him.

150
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,749
Eul just told you to get lost...

151
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,750
and that she doesn't want to ever see you again.

152
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,790
My gosh, what's this?

153
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,270
Hey, you didn't have to.

154
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,599
Try it.

155
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,830
Should I?

156
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,710
Do I look pretty?

157
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,609
Of course.

158
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,630
Stop what you're doing.

159
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,179
What are you two doing?

160
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,990
- Well...
- Stop right there.

161
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,310
Hey.

162
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,510
I heard this place is run by Shin Joon Young's mum.

163
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,489
Do you know that he's a womaniser?

164
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,790
Yes, I heard.

165
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,030
I heard he can't sleep without a woman by his side.

166
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,950
I heard he switches girlfriends...

167
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,079
every 10 hours. No, every 3 hours.

168
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,750
Why do women even like him?

169
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,279
You need to stop caring, Gook Young.

170
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,230
You're no longer Joon Young's manager.

171
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,239
You're the manager of this restaurant.

172
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,270
Stop caring.

173
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,550
Hey, I heard Shin Joon Young...

174
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,870
got taller through plastic surgery.

175
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,209
My brother said he saw him at a hospital.

176
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,790
My goodness, is that right?

177
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,889
I'm his mother, and even I didn't know that.

178
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,049
Did he get plastic surgery for his entire face...

179
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,209
including his height, too?

180
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,409
Well...

181
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,789
I'll give you some money so that...

182
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,670
you can get plastic surgery yourselves.

183
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,229
You can change your ugly face into...

184
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,030
a good looking one like Joon Young.

185
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,249
And you can stop living as a midget...

186
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,199
and become tall through surgery like Joon Young.

187
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,649
You stupid jerks.

188
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,669
How can you talk like that to your customers?

189
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,990
My gosh. Take a picture. It's Shin Joon Young.

190
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,649
Is that really him? He's better looking in person.

191
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,550
- That's his mother.
- Really?

192
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,169
You should sue her for offending you...

193
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,550
by filing a report...

194
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,830
to the Consumer Protection Board.

195
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,129
And that plastic surgeon you were talking about...

196
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,910
Can you tell me which hospital he works at?

197
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,649
Can you?

198
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,520
Can I get plastic surgery to look like Joon Young?

199
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,910
If what you two said was a lie,

200
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,319
may I sue you both for defamation?

201
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,499
What? We didn't say anything.

202
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,969
Didn't you?

203
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,779
You guys said that Joon Young is a womaniser...

204
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,579
and that he can't even sleep without women.

205
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,529
You said he changes his girlfriend every three hours.

206
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,469
Did they say that?

207
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,039
Oh, wow.

208
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,030
Did you just stand around even after hearing that?

209
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,430
You're Shin Joon Young's manager.

210
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,910
Of course not.

211
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,539
I was just about to say something,

212
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,289
but Ms Shin suddenly came on the scene.

213
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,550
Stop it.

214
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,790
Also, you shouldn't talk to my customers like that.

215
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,390
You could've upset these jerks.

216
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,710
Apologise to these jerks right away.

217
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,030
My mum's the only person who cares for me.

218
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,830
From now on,

219
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,520
you can get out of my life.

220
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,390
You can continue working here forever.

221
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,830
Hey, Joon Young. Wait.

222
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,710
Thank you for the ride.

223
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,590
Mum, can you do acupuncture on my hand?

224
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,519
I've had an upset stomach for a while now.

225
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,630
I've already taken medicine, but it doesn't help.

226
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,550
Did you lose weight?

227
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,310
Oh, yes.

228
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,390
It felt like I've become fat lately.

229
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,240
So I'm on a diet.

230
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,489
You're insane. How can you go on a diet?

231
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,630
You only have bones and skin.

232
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,909
You must be out of your mind to...

233
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,950
If you love me, just say that you do.

234
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,910
- What?
- Stop pretending to be mad at me.

235
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,390
Look at me in my eyes and say,

236
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,350
"Son, how have you been?"

237
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,310
"Why haven't you visited me more often?"

238
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,390
"I almost got upset at you."

239
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,270
Tell me the truth like that.

240
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,430
Make it sexy.

241
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,670
You're insane.

242
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,000
If you like her, then just show it to her.

243
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,110
I heard from Gook Young...

244
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,550
that you've been quite mean to that girl.

245
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,310
Are you a kid or what?

246
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,390
You can't go around bullying the girl you like.

247
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,569
You'll get sick if you keep doing that.

248
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,150
Your stomach is probably upset because of that, too.

249
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,710
Choi Hyun Joon is...

250
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,430
a stranger to us now.

251
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,790
We won't ever have to see him again.

252
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,350
You don't need to...

253
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,670
stop doing what you want because of him.

254
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,110

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,630
Thanks, Mum.

257
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,550
Thank you for saying that...

258
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,270

Although, I'm much better.

267
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,350
I came to say goodbye.

268
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,150
We've known each other for so long.

269
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,390
I thought we deserved a proper goodbye, my friend.

270
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,270
And this is...

271
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,030
one last thing I want to ask before I leave.

272
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,310
Why are we breaking up?

273
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,950
Aren't you going to say anything?

274
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,110
Okay.

275
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,430
You can just listen.

276
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,430
I'll say what I want and leave.

277
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,910
No matter how hard I think about this,

278
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,910
I don't think I did anything bad.

279
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,030
I didn't cheat on you.

280
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,670
I didn't gamble.

281
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,830
I think the reason is on you.

282
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,030
Either you don't like me any more,

283
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,910
or you have another woman.

284
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,190
I want compensation...

285
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,310
for getting hurt, humiliated and becoming miserable.

286
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,230
Also for wasting my heart, time and energy.

287
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,350
I want compensation for all of that.

288
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,990
You're rich, aren't you?

289
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,870
Ji Tae paid me a million dollars to get lost.

290
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,670
I want just 10,000 dollars from you.

291
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,870
Just 10,000 dollars.

292
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,069
I thought about asking you to lend me that money...

293
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,430
without interest,

294
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,390
but then we'd have to meet again...

295
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,550
for me to pay you back.

296
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,670
So let's just end everything today.

297
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,630
Just give it to me here so that I'll at least be...

298
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,870
too embarrassed to appear before you.

299
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,550
Okay.

300
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,750
Wait here.

301
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,110
You can write the amount you want.

302
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,270
You can write 10,000, 100,000 or a million dollars.

303
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,390
You can write as much as you want.

304
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,510
What if I ask for all of your assets?

305
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,670
You can have it all.

306
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,430
Is that what you want?

307
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,850
No thanks.

308
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,690
I'm not a thief.

309
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,090
I'm really going to write 10,000 dollars.

310
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,530
Don't report this to the police as a stolen cheque.

311
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,490
Can you leave if you're done? I'm a bit tired.

312
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,890
Okay.

313
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,090

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,660
It's the million dollars you gave me.

366
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,439
Are you kidding?

367
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,660
I'm not kidding.

368
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,629
How would someone like me...

369
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,140
joke around with someone like you?

370
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,740
It's not like I want my life to end.

371
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,780
Even without this money,

372
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,340
I still won't meet Ji Tae.

373
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,510
I won't try to find out the truth or get revenge.

374
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,380
Even if I die at a young age because of anger,

375
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I won't say a word until the day I die.

376
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,489
Do you expect me to believe you?

377
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,740
Whether you trust me or not...

378
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,990
is up to you.

379
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,380
If there is a divine being,

380
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,619
for once, they may side with someone like me...

381
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,300
who's falsely accused, powerless and connectionless...

382
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,340
and may actually punish the evil.

383
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,380
That's what I think.

384
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,510
But then again, you shouldn't worry about that, either.

385
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,420
It feels like...

386
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,620
that divine being has died a long time ago.

387
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Eul.

388
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,380
I was about to call you.

389
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,380
I just gave back the million dollars to Madam Lee.

390
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
Good job.

391
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,740
You did a good job.

392
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,260
- Thank you.
- And I'm never going to...

393
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,100
meet you again, Ji Tae.

394
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,030
I'm no longer seeking for revenge.

395
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,140
You're of no use to me, Ji Tae.

396
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,780
What did you say? Tell me again.

397
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,740
Ji Tae just called an emergency board meeting.

398
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,300
An emergency board meeting?

399
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,519
Yes, I think he's planning to talk about...

400
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,260
your dismissal at the next general meeting.

401
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,340
Ji Tae is planning to dismiss me?

402
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,860
That's nonsense.

403
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,100
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

404
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
Ms Jang.

405
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
Ms Jang.

406
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,470
Hey, Ji Tae.

407
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,399
Did you prepare the suit I asked you about?

408
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,510
Of course. It's on your bed.

409
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Thank you.

410
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,180
You didn't even knock.

411
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,420
That's unlike you.

412
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,510
I think you're the one...

413
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,380
who forgot to knock first.

414
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,470
I would've appreciated it...

415
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,999
if you had knocked and told me in advance...

416
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,220
before holding an emergency board meeting.

417
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,060
I'm disappointed.

418
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,580
Why are you disappointed?

419
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Mum...

420
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,999
Madam Lee, your hopeless and lax management has...

421
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,990
done much damage to our shareholders and subsidiaries.

422
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,740
I don't think...

423
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,620
you should be disappointed.

424
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,700
Hopeless and lax management?

425
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,739
- On what grounds are you...
- Construction,

426
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,540
finance, telecommunication and entertainment.

427
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,279
Think about the projects you pushed ahead...

428
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,900
despite the opposition of most of the board members.

429
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,940
How were...

430
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,740
their results?

431
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,859
They were awful. The teams were disintegrated,

432
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,479
the person in charge was fired, subsidiaries stumbled,

433
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,030
stock prices went down and shareholders lost money.

434
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,500
But the person who was in charge of everything...

435
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,709
is still doing fine in her position.

436
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,740
So...

437
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,380
are you going to put your own mother up for a trial?

438
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,639
What would people think?

439
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,880
They'll think I'm an awful son.

440
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,900
They'll think I'm blinded by success.

441
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,140
That's how they'll gossip.

442
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,819
But once they find out the truth, they'll also think...

443
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,470
that KJ isn't such a corrupt company.

444
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,860
I'm sure some people would cheer me on.

445
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,580
See you at the board meeting.

446
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,060
Why are you doing this to me?

447
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,540
You were such a good son.

448
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,860
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

449
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
Is that girl...

450
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,559
more important to you than your own mother?

451
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,580
No.

452
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,620
It's not because she's important.

453
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,990
It's because you and Dad are wrong.

454
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,340
I want to talk to my son.

455
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,500
Will you step outside for a while?

457
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,829
Are you finally confident enough...

458
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,030
to reveal the truth in front of everyone?

459
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
No.

460
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,580
I am not yet confident enough to shout,

461
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,860
"My parents are awful and scary people."

462
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Then what?

463
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,879
You can't change the past,

464
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,959
but I want to stop both of you...

465
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,180
from violating and crushing more people...

466
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,470
using the power and money you both have.

467
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,580
I want to stop you before things get worse.

468
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,180
Okay.

469
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
That's a very grand thought.

470
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,030
You can try as much as you can...

471
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,580
to stop us.

472
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,780
I will support you...

473
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,580
so that you'll win this fight.

474
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,349
Do you have an aspirin?

475
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,790
I'll get it for you right away, Sir.

476
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,030
I looked into Shin Joon Young's family.

477
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,620
He has no father. He's registered under his mum's name.

478
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,420
- He doesn't have a father?
- No.

479
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,539
That's why his last name is his mother's.

480
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,740
He's registered under his mum's name.

481
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,030
She said she was married and had a husband.

482
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,620
There aren't any legal records of her marriage.

483
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,740
I also talked to some reporters,

484
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,860
and they said she's always been a single mother.

485
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
How is it?

486
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,380
This is my new menu.

487
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,140
If you wrap this around siraegi,

488
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,580
it'll taste a lot more savoury. Ouch!

489
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,990
What are you doing?

490
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,079
Well, I found a grey hair.

491
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,380
Gosh, look.

492
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,239
Here we go. I got two.

493
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,079
It's natural for hair to turn grey. Leave it alone.

494
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,519
My gosh, your hair was all black 25 days ago.

495
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,799
But now, you not only have 1 or 2,

496
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,819
but you have three grey hair strands.

497
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,420
Have you been looking out for my grey hair?

498
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,140
I think this is because of stress.

499
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,539
It's because of Joon Young, right?

500
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,900
Do you have feelings for me?

501
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,580
What?

502
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,180
Do you like me?

503
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,990
Why can't you answer me?

504
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,030
Do you really like me?

505
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,780
- No.
- Come on.

506
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,399
I think he's lying.

507
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,620
When did you come?

508
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,990
Just now.

509
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,549
He likes you.

510
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,619
It's been a while since I've noticed. Didn't you know?

511
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,269
You're more clueless than I thought.

512
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,359
- What?
- Hey, you fool.

513
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,499
What are you talking about?

514
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,420
What? Nobody likes anybody here.

515
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,599
I know I haven't dated in a while,

516
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,839
but still, why would I like her?

517
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,990
Are you crazy?

518
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,769
How can you say that?

519
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,489
What's so bad about me?

520
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,159
There are still a lot of men coming after me.

521
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,919
You're the only one who doesn't think of me as a woman.

522
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,119
No, it's not like that. It's...

523
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,479
Anyway, what brings you here?

524
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,159
Is something wrong with Joon Young?

525
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,900
I'm not here because of Joon Young.

526
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,140
My goodness. I'm here for Gook Young.

527
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,900
He's inside. Take him.

528
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,860
You're the one who's crazy!

529
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,980
Young Ok. Young Ok.

530
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,599
I thought she was sharp,

531
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,909
but she's rather clueless.

532
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,989
You must be disappointed.

533
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,260
You've been showing her your feelings so much.

534
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,439
How can she be that clueless? Right?

535
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,459
Shut it.

536
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,060
Dad, do you really like her?

537
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,479
No. Do you think I'm crazy?

538
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,999
I think you like her, too.

539
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,420
I told you I don't.

540
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,340
Why is everyone still going on about this?

541
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,759
There is friend of mine who's a single father.

542
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,380
May I set him up with Joon Young's mum?

543
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,780
I hope you don't get mad later on.

544
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,220
Look at you.

546
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
Young Ok.

547
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,809
You had another grey hair.

548
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,659
Just pluck out everything. Just make me bald.

549
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,259
- Go on.
- I'll stop.

550
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,429
- Pluck everything out.
- No, it's okay.

551
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,789
- I'll pluck all your hair out.
- No, don't.

552
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,080
There's a lot to pluck out.

553
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,920
Someone gave me expensive wine.

554
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,960
I wanted to share.

555
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,739
That sounds great, but I have to run out right now.

556
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,580
Would it be okay if I come back in 30 minutes?

557
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,880
Sure. I'll take a tour of your house, then.

(THE STORIES WE DIDN'T KNOW)

559
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,379
You should come in. Why are you standing around?

560
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,000
Why did you want to see me?

561
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,280
You filmed these, right? Please organise them.

562
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,129
I was fired from Shin Joon Young's documentary project.

563
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,639
That's your problem.

564
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,449
You need to at least finish up what you were doing.

565
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,139
You labeled them all wrong,

566
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,009
and the audio levels are a mess.

567
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,289
Darn it.

568
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,319
"Darn it"?

569
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,409
I'm not here to get cussed at.

570
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,880
You can't do this to someone who got fired.

571
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,360
I'm a professional. I can do this.

572
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,680
I can't do this.

573
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,120
Will you go out with me?

574
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,200
Let's say I have three months to live.

575
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,480
For just three months.

576
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Passionately.

577
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,000
The board members show up even if you wait.

578
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,280
Madam Lee must have done something.

579
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,499
Did you think she wouldn't do anything?

580
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,520
No.

581
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,520
I just wanted to check and see...

582
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,200
how powerful Mum was.

Your call cannot be connected. Please leave...

586
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Who's that guy?

587
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,360
The guy who picked up your phone yesterday.

588
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,640
The guy who you saved as "Husband" on your cell phone.

589
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,720
Is he your boyfriend?

590
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,040
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

591
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,760
How long have you been dating him?

592
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,520
His voice wasn't very attractive. How does he look?

593
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,489
It sounded like he'd be very ugly.

594
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,520
Your boyfriend.

595
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,480
He's not my boyfriend.

596
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Good job.

597
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,760
Have you thought about your bucket list?

598
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,869
Yes.

599
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,720
Could you tell me one item on that list?

600
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,880
Hearing "You're just my type"...

601
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,960
from the person who just questioned me.

602
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,880
I'll edit that out.

603
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,640
I'll ask you again.

604
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,959
Tell me one of the items...

605
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,480
Hearing "I love you" from the woman...

606
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,160
standing in front of me.

607
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,759
- Do this one first.
- What is this?

608
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,659
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

609
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,400
You should've checked the audio level.

610
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,520
What is he saying?

611
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,360
He didn't make a sound on purpose.

612
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,000
Are you making fun of me?

613
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,360
Joon Young, did you talk behind my back?

614
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,520
I thought you said 30 minutes.

615
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,240
I'm sorry. Things got complicated.

616
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,600
I thought you'd be gone.

617
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,120
How dare you make me wait?

618
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,000
How dare someone like you make me wait?

619
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Hey.

620
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,400
I have a visitor at home and she's very drunk.

621
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,879
I can't call a chauffeur, so could you come?

622
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,079
Hey, Shin Joon Young.

623
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,640
Yes, come to my house.

624
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,160
My manager will be here in 20 minutes. Just wait here.

625
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,520
Hey. Hey, you jerk!

626
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,080
I don't have...

627
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,880
a lot of time right now.

628
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,240
What does that mean? Why wouldn't he have time?

629
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,320
I don't have much time...

630
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,120
to be around you.

631
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,160
I...

632
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,880
don't have much time...

633
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
to be...

634
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,960
around you, Eul.

635
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,400
Come out, Shin Joon Young.

636
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,000
Come out this instant!

637
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,280
Apologise.

638
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,280
Come out and apologise!

639
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,200
Apologise, you jerk.

640
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm sorry.

641
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,080
I shouldn't have done that to someone like you.

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,760
Jeong Eun. Hello?

645
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,560
Hello? Jeong Eun.

646
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
Jeong Eun.

647
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,360
Mum.

648
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,299
If you're here to give up, wait.

649
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,079
I'll call Jeong Eun. Let's have dinner with her.

650
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,280

652
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,080
You should've cleared things up before coming to me.

653
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,840
I wasn't born rich like you, but I have my own pride.

654
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm Shin Joon Young.

655
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,360
You can go to your mother-in-law.

656
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,400
Make sure you come up with a scheme to get Ji Tae back.

657
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,200
Hello, Mother.

658
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,480
I'm away right now.

659
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,480
I will...

660
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,280
give up on Ji Tae.

661
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,960
You should give up, too.

662
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,560
Ji Tae won't ever change his...

663
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,240
