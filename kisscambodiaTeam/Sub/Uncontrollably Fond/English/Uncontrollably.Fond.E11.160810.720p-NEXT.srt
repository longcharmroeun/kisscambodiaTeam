1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,090
- Come here. Come.
- Ouch.

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,050
Let's go and tell your mother that...

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,410
she shouldn't have given birth to a son like you.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,450
You're making no sense.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,290
I was born 30 years ago. It's too late for that.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,570
You little...

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,610
It's not like Joon Young hit someone...

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,690
or betrayed his country.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,450
Why did you lock him up when he's sick?

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,250
If it wasn't for him,

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,210
you'd be living in a prison cell somewhere.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,090
How ungrateful can you be?

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,010
I'm doing this because I am grateful.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,370
What?

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,570
Do you even know where Joon Young is trying to go?

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,410
He's trying to go to jail to find Producer Noh.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,410
- To jail?
- Yes.

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,730
Producer Noh is in jail for attempted murder...

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,770
because she tried to hit Congressman Choi with her car.

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,130
Mum...

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,490
How dare they...

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,690
lock you up when you're so sick.

23
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,370
Get up. Let's get you to a hospital. Get up.

24
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,890
Let's go. Come with me.

25
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,690
I have to see Eul.

26
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,290
Help me.

27
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,650
I need to go to her.

28
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,730
Please help, Mum.

29
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,090
Mum.

30
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,210
What did you just say?

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,620
Congressman Choi Hyun Joon?

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,730
Yes.

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,900
What do you think will happen if people find out...

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,810
that he's friends with someone who tried to kill...

35
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,210
a congressman?

36
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,730
That's why I locked him up.

37
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,970
Okay?

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,490
Hey.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,850
I don't think I understood correctly.

40
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,620
Did...

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,810
Did you say his name was...

42
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,890
Choi...

43
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,650
Choi Hyun Joon? Are you sure?

44
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,570
Help me.

45
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,170
No, no.

46
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,530
You can't go anywhere in this state.

47
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,890
Mum.

48
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,370
You stay right here.

49
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,810
I'll go and get some medicine first.

50
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,170
Choi Hyun Joon.

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,250
If you stayed by his side,

52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,410
he wouldn't have become such a horrible person.

53
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,090
If you stayed with him instead of running away,

54
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,290
he wouldn't have fallen into corruption.

55
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,090
It's all because of you.

56
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,450
It's your fault.

57
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,090
It's because of you.

58
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,170
It's all on you!

59
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,370
It's your fault! Everything's your fault!

60
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,770
It's your fault.

61
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,490
What do you think you're saying?

62
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,860
How dare you talk to your mum like that...

63
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,770
just because you're crazy over some girl.

64
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,570
Hey, do you have any idea how your mum raised you?

65
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,730
Do you know what she had to go through...

66
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,810
to raise you decently even when you had no father?

67
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,890
She did her best to raise you well.

68
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,540
But is that all you have to say to her?

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,050
Jeong Sik.

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,690
You ungrateful fool.

71
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,010
Do you even know how she feels inside?

72
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,540
What an ungrateful child.

73
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,770
Wait outside.

74
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,210
You may be a star, but you aren't a star to us.

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,650
Do you think you're something great just because...

76
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,170
people praise you all the time?

77
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,210
You jerk. If you were my son, you would've been dead.

78
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,980
I told you to go outside, Jeong Sik.

79
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,890
Go and wait outside.

80
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,540
Listen carefully.

81
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,860
If you hurt your mum,

82
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,210
it'll all come back and hurt you more.

83
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,540
Make sure you remember that.

84
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,530
I'll go and get some medicine.

85
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,450
I'll crawl there if I have to.

86
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,490
If you don't help me,

87
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,130
I'll crawl over to Eul.

88
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,810
My goodness.

89
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,210
Eul.

90
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,050
Joon Young.

91
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,490
Why are you so late?

92
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,290
I waited so much for you.

93
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,170
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,690
I'm really sorry.

95
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,290
I...

96
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,610
I wasn't trying to kill him.

97
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,530
I'm serious. I wasn't trying to kill Choi Hyun Joon.

98
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,170
I was going to forget about everything...

99
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,410
and live like nothing ever happened. I'm serious.

100
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,810
I know.

101
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,170
I'm so scared, Joon Young.

102
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,410
Why are you scared?

103
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,970
I'm here for you.

104
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,770
- Let's go.
- Where to?

105
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,090
We have a trip to go on.

106
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,330
We promised to come back after 10 years.

107
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,850
Let's go.

108
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,850
Right now?

109
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,570
Yes, right now.

110
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,570
Come on.

111
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,090
Let's return...

112
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,130
after staying here for 100 years.

113
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,250
Let's live here where no one can find us.

114
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,170
We can return after living here for 100 years.

115
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,130
Everything turned cold.

116
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,050
I'll heat it up again.

117
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,930
So?

118
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,370
Has he not eaten anything since yesterday?

119
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,650
That's not all. I don't think he's even breathing.

120
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,330
- What if Joon Young dies, Dad?
- My goodness.

121
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,250
How can a man die just because of a girl?

122
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,970
I should go there with a shovel.

123
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,090
Tell him to wait. I'll shove food down his throat.

124
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,690
My goodness.

125
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,050
You little...

126
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,370
Jik.

127
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,410
Why are you here? Don't you have a test today?

128
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,610
I walked out in the middle of the test.

129
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,610
I understand. You probably can't focus on anything.

130
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,610
I wish Hyun Woo was with us right now.

131
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,610
He studied law, so he probably knows a few lawyers.

132
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,810
Where on earth did he disappear to?

133
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,250
Forget him.

134
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,730
Both Hyun Woo and Joon Young can get lost.

135
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,970
We can take care of ourselves.

136
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,650
But...

137
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,370
what if Eul cries?

138
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,650
I've never seen her cry after I grew up.

139
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,490
If I see her cry right now,

140
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,130
I think I might go insane.

141
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,610
What do I do, Na Ri?

142
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,930
I'm letting you do this only because he's sick.

143
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,170
Thank you.

144
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,290
This one middle-aged lady came in this morning.

145
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,610
She got caught running away with lodge money.

146
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,770
Do you know who Lee Mario is?

147
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,330
She was a lady, but she looked exactly like him.

148
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,170
I was so shocked.

149
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,170
It's not the time for you to laugh.

150
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,690
You're right. It's not.

151
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,850
When I saw her, I said,

152
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,450
"Look, it's Lee Mario."

153
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,810
"What brings you here?"

154
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,330
I even greeted her like this.

155
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,730
- Isn't this funny?
- Eul.

156
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,570
Jik, don't you know who Lee Mario is?

157
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,690
Don't you remember?

158
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,410
The guy who used to dance like this.

159
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,730
Don't you know?

160
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,530
- Eul.
- Na Ri, you must know.

161
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,210
Don't you remember the guy who danced like this?

162
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,930
Eul, what's with you? You're embarrassing me.

163
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,970
That's not right.

164
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,770
This is Lee Mario's dance.

165
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,690
Like this. Do you understand?

166
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,450
You're right. That's it.

167
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,290
It's this.

168
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,450
Stop frowning, Jik.

169
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,130
It's not like I'm dying.

170
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,370
I'll be out soon, so find a great tofu place for...

171
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,330
Eul, you weren't really...

172
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,090
trying to kill that congressman, right?

173
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,130
Of course...

174
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,450
not.

175
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,210
I knew it.

176
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,050
I'm good, then.

177
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,730
I heard Joon Young was there, too.

178
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,450
Why doesn't he visit?

179
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,130
He can bear witness and say that you weren't...

180
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,410
I told you not to even...

181
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,770
mention his name.

182
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,610
Jik went to Joon Young...

183
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,490
and asked for help.

184
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,210
But apparently, he didn't even open the door.

185
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,010
Don't trust him, Eul.

186
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,570
I'll take care of everything.

187
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,730
I'll prove your innocence and...

188
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,530
If you're a student, you should go to school and study.

189
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,770
Eul.

190
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,610
By the way, Joon Young just called me.

191
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,290
He said he's soon going to come and pick me up.

192
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,730
He may even be on his way.

193
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,730
Joon Young.

194
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,370
Go to the parking lot.

195
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,130
Get on a car.

196
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,850
Start the car.

197
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,570
Take off.

198
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,530
You have 59km left until your destination.

199
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,700
And 58km.

200
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,530
This is your mum's yukgaejang.

201
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,980
It's what you've always wanted.

202
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,250
At least have a bite.

203
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,090
If you're threatening me by not eating,

204
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,650
you should give up.

205
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,490
I'm supposed to keep you in here even if you starve.

206
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,460
Your mum ordered me to do so.

207
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,130
I knew this would happen.

208
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,890
I was waiting around for this.

209
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,410
Here.

210
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,890
You can't even put this on yourself.

211
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,090
Why are you getting yourself hurt in the first place?

212
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,370
You should be more careful when using a knife.

213
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,130
Choi Hyun Joon.

214
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,460
If you stayed by his side,

215
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,490
he wouldn't have become such a horrible person.

216
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,980
If you stayed with him instead of running away,

217
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,980
he wouldn't have fallen into corruption.

218
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,330
Young Ok.

219
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,220
Young Ok.

220
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,250
Young Ok, where are you going?

221
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,610
What brings you here?

222
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,330
Please let Producer Noh out.

223
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,050
Do you like her?

224
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,850
Since when?

225
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,570
The moment you and mum began to ruin her life...

226
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,460
by fabricating and hiding the truth.

227
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I see.

228
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,930
Ji Tae, ever since you were young,

229
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,980
you were always full of compassion.

230
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,250
When you saw someone crying,

231
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,930
you'd stop and ask, "What's wrong? How may I help?"

232
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,700
- Father.
- But...

233
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,850
don't you have too much to lose...

234
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,770
to risk it all on pity?

235
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,370
I'm not scared.

236
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,770
I see.

237
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,490
Then you can go out and tell everyone this.

238
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,700
"Choi Hyun Joon received an undeniable request..."

239
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,370
"while serving as a prosecutor..."

240
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,700
"and thus, covered up a hit-and-run case."

241
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,250
"His wife, Lee Eun Soo, played along..."

242
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,930
"and destroyed a little girl's life."

243
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,700
"In return, the couple received..."

244
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,330
"everything they ever dreamt of..."

245
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,090
"and are on a roll without boundaries."

246
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,010
"These two are my parents."

247
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,650
Tell that to everyone.

248
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,330
Why?

249
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,290
Do you think you can't?

250
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,570
If you don't have the courage to say this,

251
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,410
shut your mouth and become a coward,

252
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,570
just like how I was before.

254
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,410
Ms Shin, I'm so upset.

255
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,930
I was going to call you.

256
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,090
I'm afraid that he might really die.

257
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,490
He wouldn't sleep or drink a drop of water.

258
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,050
He wouldn't even eat your yukgaejang.

259
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,970
This is so frustrating.

260
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,690
What about him?

261
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,490
What did he do?

262
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,970
He is an honourable man.

263
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,330
He is incomparable to us.

264
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,370
Who said something that absurd?

265
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,010
Who's been spreading such nonsense?

266
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,050
Tell me who so that I can sew up that person's mouth.

267
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,410
Tell me who said such a thing.

268
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,450
I saw him.

269
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,730
What?

270
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,970
I saw him with my own two eyes.

271
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,810
I saw how terrible,

272
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,450
selfish...

273
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,850
and brutal...

274
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,650
that man is.

275
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,810
Why did you love someone like him?

276
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,770
You're probably mistaken.

277
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,650
You probably mistook him.

278
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,330
He is someone...

279
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,530
who would give everything for the poor...

280
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,970
even when he didn't have enough money for himself.

281
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,770
When everyone else...

282
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,370
disregarded me for being uneducated and poor,

283
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,570
he was so considerate that...

284
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,890
he hid the fact that he's a law school student...

285
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,050
and told me that he was also uneducated and poor.

286
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,330
Eul's father...

287
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,250
died from a hit-and-run accident.

288
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,210
Why are you bringing that up now?

289
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,890
Choi Hyun Joon was a senior prosecutor at that time.

290
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,570
He fabricated the suspect...

291
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,810
for his way to success.

292
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,770
What?

293
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,930
I thought she was okay.

294
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,370
Time has passed,

295
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,410
so I thought she put everything behind her.

296
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,650
But Eul still remembers everything.

297
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,650
I thought she was okay,

298
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,250
but Eul was still living in darkness.

299
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,850
Choi Hyun Joon, the assailant,

300
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,650
forgot about everything he did...

301
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,530
and is living in paradise.

302
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,890
But that's not right, Mum.

303
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,690
That's not how this world should be.

304
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,010
Jeong Sik was right.

305
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,330
You are out of your mind...

306
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,930
because of that gold-digger.

307
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,250
- Mum.
- He is...

308
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,330
the most fabulous,

309
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,610
the most wonderful...

310
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,290
and the nicest man...

311
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,410
I know in this world.

312
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,970
He is someone...

313
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,370
you can never dare to be compared to.

314
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,490
You crazy fool! You don't know anything!

315
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,090
And stop calling him by his name.

316
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,330
- He's your father.
- That's why...

317
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,970
I almost killed Eul.

318
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,890
I considered that dirty man as my father.

319
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,490
I tried to cover up his embarrassment,

320
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,570
and I ended up almost killing her.

321
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,370
Is that why...

322
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,490
you quit school?

323
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,010
Is that why you said...

324
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,610
you don't deserve to be a prosecutor...

325
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,970
and that you're hopeless?

326
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,530
Yes.

327
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,130
How can I judge other people's sins after doing that?

328
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,130
He's running 2 hours and 30 minutes late...

329
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,730
because his fans caught him on the way.

330
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,570
The traffic light must be broken.

331
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,290
So that must take him about an hour and 50 minutes.

332
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,290
He ran out of gas, so he went to get some.

333
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,970
Then he changed the engine oil.

334
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,370
While he's at it, he got a car wash.

335
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,370
And now,

336
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,610
he has 43km left.

337
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,650
And 42.9km.

338
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,970
And 42.8km.

339
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,570
How can this happen?

340
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,010
I have really good ears,

341
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,370
so I heard everything you two said.

342
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,170
That's why...

343
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,450
after I take you home,

344
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,450
I'm planning to...

345
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,690
go back and unlock his room.

346
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,250
If we leave him like that,

347
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,450
he could really die.

348
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,690
They said you can't meet her even if you leave now.

349
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,290
My name is Shin Joon Young.

350
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,210
I'd like to meet Congressman Choi Hyun Joon.

351
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,730
Is he not home?

352
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,170
He's not here at the moment.

353
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,410
Dad came home just a while ago.

354
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,330
Why? Is someone here?

355
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,330
- No, it's...
- It's Joon Young, Dad.

356
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,290
That hurts, Mum.

357
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,170
What do you mean, Joon Young?

358
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,330
It's nothing. They found the wrong house.

359
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,050
Go in and study.

360
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,730
Hurry.

361
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,530
Are you...

362
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,770
talking about Shin Joon Young,

363
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,570
the celebrity that Ha Ru likes?

364
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,850
Yes, you're right, Dad.

365
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,050
Why would he come looking for me?

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,850
We can't deal with everyone looking for him.

369
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,290
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

370
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,050
Did you eat dinner?

371
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:33,930
Yes.

372
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,610
Honey, you can go to your room.

373
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,690
Ha Ru, you should go and study.

374
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,610
I have to talk to him,

375
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,610
so don't come near the study.

376
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,370
This way, please.

377
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,610
Mum, I'm not seeing things, right?

378
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,530
Shin Joon Young is really at our house, right?

379
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,890
Ha Ru, will you hold me?

380
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,450
You don't look so well.

381
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,650
Were you sick?

382
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,370
Yes, I was.

383
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,010
That's not good.

384
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,890
Well...

385
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,090
what brings you here this late at night?

386
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,130
Is it because of Producer Noh?

387
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,210
Yes.

388
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,650
I thought so.

389
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,130
However,

390
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,450
attempted murder isn't a crime subject to complaint,

391
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,530
so things won't change even if I drop charges.

392
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,690
Isn't this something you know, as well?

393
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,010
At first, the case was considered as poor driving.

394
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,130
A week later, it changed into an attempted murder case.

395
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,850
Why did you change your mind?

396
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,730
Because I know for a fact...

397
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,290
that she tried to kill me.

398
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,610
Why do you think Eul tried to kill you?

399
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,690
That's what I'd like to know, too.

400
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,290
I heard she's been remaining silent.

401
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,890
Will you ask her...

402
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,330
why she tried to kill me on my behalf?

403
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,090
If she really wanted to kill you,

404
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,890
she would've taken a chance to do so five years ago.

405
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,810
If she really wanted to kill you,

406
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,290
she wouldn't have made a turn.

407
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,690
Excuse me, Joon Young.

408
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,290
Of course, if I was her,

409
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,090
I would've...

410
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,770
never made that turn.

411
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,250
Young Deuk.

412
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,170
Call...

413
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,620
Call the doctor...

414
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,770
and tell him...

415
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,410
to stay open...

416
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,050
because a patient will be there soon.

417
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,580
You came a long way in the midst of your busy schedule,

418
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,210
but I'm sorry. I can't help you.

419
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,970
I'd like to thank you again for risking your life...

420
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,100
- to save me.
- I regret that.

421
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,620
I don't have any hard feelings against you.

422
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,450
I can't explain it,

423
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,210
but I do feel a certain fondness towards you.

424
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,580
Can you believe that?

425
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,530
My daughter is a huge fan of yours.

426
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,530
Will you dine with her...

427
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,970
What is this?

428
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,890
I hope...

429
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,370
to never see you again.

430
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,890
I hope...

431
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,730
this is the last time I see you in this life.

432
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,810
What brings you here?

433
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,970
I came to threaten Congressman Choi.

434
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,530
So...

435
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,580
did you succeed?

436
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,140
I'm not sure.

437
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,250
Hello, Mr Lim. It's me.

438
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,730
It's about Noh Eul.

439
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,770
No.

440
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,290
You can't let her go.

441
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,530
If you do,

442
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,650
she'll try to kill you again.

443
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,850
- Honey.
- You're Choi Hyun Joon.

444
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,730
Don't give in to Shin Joon Young's threat.

445
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,330
Honey, please.

446
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,170
Five years ago,

447
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,330
if only Eul had taken that USB to the TV station...

448
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,050
If only you hadn't taken that USB away from Eul...

449
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,210
Hey, stop!

450
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,850
Stop right there!

451
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,450
If everyone paid for their sins at that time...

452
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,890
If everyone paid for what they were responsible for,

453
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,530
Eul would've lived a different life.

454
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,770
So...

455
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,100
you don't have any rights, either.

456
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,890
You don't have the rights to be happy with her, either.

457
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,730
Because like me,

458
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,810
you're also Choi Hyun Joon's son.

459
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,250

461
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,140
Eul.

462
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,890
You must be worn out.

463
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,140
I'm fine.

464
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,170
I had fun thanks to Ms Lee Mario.

465
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,530
My goodness.

466
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,620
First, have this.

467
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,450
Don't go near Choi Hyun Joon from now on, okay?

468
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,170
Are you waiting for someone?

469
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,930
Are you waiting for Joon Young?

470
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,650
He's not going to come.

471
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,650
If he was going to, he'd be here already.

472
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,170
Where's Jik?

473
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,050
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

474
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,250
Yes.

475
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,010
My goodness, you should go see a doctor.

476
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,810
Your call cannot be connected.

477
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,530
Please leave...

478
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,210
Why isn't Jik answering his phone?

479
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,370
I told you, Joon Young isn't coming.

480
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,770
Don't wait for him.

481
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,330
Can't you see?

482
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,930
Joon Young is avoiding you because...

483
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,130
you're someone who's been in jail.

484
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,330
Just give me 10 minutes.

485
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,210
Hey.

486
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,290
This isn't good. Let's go home.

487
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,890
I'll tell Jik to come straight home. Let's go.

488
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:04,850
Come on.

489
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,450
Okay, fine.

490
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,210
- Jik.
- Jik.

491
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,130
- Hey, Eul.
- Are you hurt?

492
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,930
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

493
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,770
I sprained it, that's all.

494
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,090
I'm so sorry. I got distracted...

495
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,770
and didn't see him coming.

496
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,970
I'm really fine, Eul.

497
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,090
Are you okay?

498
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,530
I'm sorry.

499
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,050
I wanted to take him to a doctor,

500
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,210
but he insisted on coming here.

501
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,450
I'm truly sorry.

502
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,770
Ms Kim isn't someone who makes a mistake like this.

503
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,730
Things could've been much worse.

504
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,130
What if she stepped on the brakes a little later?

505
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:15,610
I don't even want to think about it.

506
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,530
Go.

507
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,570
Go.

508
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,450
Go.

509
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,370
Producer Noh was cleared and released today morning.

510
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,330
Also, your engagement suit fitting is at 4:30pm.

511
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:14,930
Go.

512
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,050
What... What is all this?

513
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,870
You told me you didn't want anyone to visit.

514
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,990
Were you just drinking and playing games all that time?

515
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,590
Fine, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for what I did.

516
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,270
If you tell me that you want me to die,

517
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,630
I could die right here.

518
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,230
But I don't regret what I did.

519
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,870
I think I did my best...

520
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,270
by keeping you intact in the midst...

521
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,070
of all this yellow journalism.

522
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,030
You didn't keep him intact.

523
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,870
I was the one who resuscitated him...

524
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,070
when he was as good as dead.

525
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,390
But all he does is play games right now.

526
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,390
By the way,

527
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:13,910
Producer Noh was cleared and released earlier today.

528
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,830
Aren't you going to visit her?

529
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,030
Why would he go there?

530
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,430
He should, though.

531
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,710
He's been longing for her for so long.

532
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,990
What are you talking about?

533
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,590
Stop talking nonsense.

534
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,470
Five years ago,

535
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,110
if only Eul had taken that USB to the TV station...

536
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,430
If only you hadn't taken that USB away from Eul...

537
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,070
If everyone paid for their sins at that time...

538
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,510
If everyone paid for what they were responsible for,

539
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,350
Eul would've lived a different life.

540
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,630
- You foolish jerk.
- Let go.

541
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,990
I'm going to kill you.

542
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,030
- Joon Young.
- Joon Young.

543
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:22,470
So...

544
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,950
you don't have any rights, either.

545
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,750
You don't have the rights to be happy with her, either.

546
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,950
Because like me,

547
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,390
you're also Choi Hyun Joon's son.

548
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,790
How dare you come here?

549
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,910
What trouble are you trying to get him into now?

550
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,630
Joon Young isn't going to deal with you any more.

551
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,950
So get lost...

552
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,710
while I'm being nice.

553
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,310
No.

554
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,750
What?

555
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,870
I won't get lost.

556
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,910
Why would I get lost?

557
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,190
Joon Young never visited you, did he?

558
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,990
You know how he is.

559
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,350
If he really missed you, he would've...

560
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,830
visited you a thousand times already.

561
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,910
I mean, he can walk, and he also has a car.

562
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,350
Aren't you smart enough to understand the situation?

563
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,790
Joon Young got drunk and told me this.

564
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,270
"I don't think love is about staying loyal."

565
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,670
"Eul will come looking for me when she gets released."

566
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,710
"Just thinking of seeing Eul again is killing me."

567
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,190
You liar.

(NA RI)

570
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,430
It's me, Na Ri.

571
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,910
Go Na Ri.

572
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,630
I have a question.

573
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,070
Why didn't you visit Eul?

574
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,390
- Just because.
- What?

575
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,470
How... How can you do that to her?

576
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,830
Do you know how eagerly she waited for you?

577
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,070
I'm sorry, Na Ri.

578
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,590
But I can't stay on the phone for...

579
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,790
I don't want to talk to you for long, either, you jerk.

580
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,790
I was just going to ask you...

581
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,510
to persuade her from leaving.

582
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,750
What are you talking about?

583
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,110
Where is she going?

584
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,670
Stop crying and tell me.

585
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,950
Na Ri.

586
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,070
I was hoping I'd never see you again.

587
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,430
Do you remember? After the trial,

588
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,830
I asked you to never appear before me and that...

589
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,430
we should end our ill-fated relationship here.

590
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,670
But why are you still hanging around like this?

591
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:29,310
Did you want to see how far I would go?

592
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,030
Your brother seems like a smart kid.

593
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,150
He looks like a person...

594
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,470
that would take...

595
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,990
good care of his only sister if he's kept alive.

(SHIN JOON YOUNG)

597
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:21,990
What brings you here this late?

598
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,270
Congratulations on your engagement, Jeong Eun.

599
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,670
Thank you, Dad.

600
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,430
I thought it wasn't possible to have...

601
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,910
a happy ending with one's first love.

602
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,790
It's all thanks to you.

603
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,830
I'll be forever grateful.

604
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,990
Her fiance, Choi Ji Tae,

605
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,030
is my daughter's first love.

606
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:05,070
People say that this engagement is...

607
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,750
all about politics and business,

608
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,470
but they don't know what they're saying.

609
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:11,230
Dad, don't say that.

610
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,390
When her friends wanted to become...

611
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,350
a lawyer, a doctor, a famous pianist and whatnot,

612
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,110
my daughter wanted to be...

613
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,750
What was it again?

614
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,710
My goodness.

615
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,550
I wanted to be Ji Tae's wife.

616
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,030
That's how she is.

617
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,030
Unlike how she looks, she's been...

618
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,190
hopelessly in love with one man for almost 20 years.

619
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,470
I'm so nervous.

620
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,830
I'm so nervous right now.

621
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,430
Dad, do you have a sedative?

622
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,030
Come on. Get in the car.

623
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,870
Aren't you going to tell me?

624
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,070
What is it that we have to run without telling Na Ri?

625
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,390
Did the loan sharks threaten to kill you?

626
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,750
We don't have time. Get in.

627
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,270
We can't leave our parents here.

628
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,710
How will you live overseas...

629
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,350
when you can't even speak a word of English?

630
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,230
How will you make a living?

631
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,150
- It's better than here.
- What?

632
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,710
Wherever it is, it's a thousand times better than this.

633
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,430
Eul.

634
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,950
If you aren't coming, I'm leaving alone.

635
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:32,830
Eul.

636
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,710
To Incheon Airport, please.

637
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,150
Is he insane?

638
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,190
Hey, what's with you?

639
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,390
You are not going anywhere.

640
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,310
Get off right now, Eul.

641
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,660
Didn't it go through?

642
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,610
- Doesn't that work, either?
- You know it doesn't.

643
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,410
Don't you have cash?

644
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,050
I do.

645
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,220
I probably do.

646
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,010
How can a lawyer not even have 10 dollars?

647
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,210
Here. I'll pay.

648
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,610
- Who are you?
- Are you Lawyer Cha Taek Joong?

649
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:42,550
I am. Who are you?

650
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,110
You were also the prosecutor who was in charge of...

651
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,310
the hit-and-run case of Mr Noh Jang Soo in 2006, right?

652
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:50,910
Who are you?

653
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,750
Who's the real criminal that Choi Hyun Joon...

654
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,940
tried to cover?
