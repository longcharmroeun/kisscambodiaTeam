2
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,420
She's the girl I like.

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,220
I told you over the phone last time.

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,832
I don't know why I can't stop thinking of her.

5
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,740
She's been on my mind for the last nine years.

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,060
And I realised that I'm madly in love with her...

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,980
only about two weeks ago.

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,540
They're filming this right now. Are you okay with that?

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,460
From this point on, people will think it's real.

10
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,350
I don't care.

11
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,980
Don't you see me?

12
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Think of what I did for you!

13
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,060
Don't you see me?

14
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,740
What should I do?

15
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,340
The weird girl who turned her back to me...

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,620
won't even cast me a glance.

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,660
Instead, she wants the guy who abandoned her.

18
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,220
Don't listen to anyone else.

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,060
Please just listen to me.

20
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,420
I love you, Eul.

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,260
I love you, Eul.

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,940
I love you,

23
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,580
Eul.

24
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,316
- Hello?
- Yes?

25
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:08,540
Is that Joon Young's house?

26
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Eul?

27
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,340
I decided...

28
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,180
to trust you just once.

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Hello?

30
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Joon Young.

31
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
Are you listening?

32
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,480
I didn't hear that. What did you say?

33
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,140
- I decided to trust you...
- No, don't say it.

34
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
Say no more, Eul.

35
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,260
I'll come right over. Say it to my face.

36
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,500
Let's stay like this just for a minute.

37
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,164
I don't like tripe. They're smelly.

38
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:50,916
Honey.

39
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,880
Our tripe is pre-cooked, so it doesn't smell. It's really savoury.

40
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,920
You should try it.

41
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,370
Oh, hey.

42
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,770
Eul was waiting for you, but she left a while ago.

43
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,930
- I came to see you, not Eul.
- What?

44
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,330
Me?

45
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,890
You came to see me?

46
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,930
You should've told me. I didn't even shower today.

47
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,170
What is this?

48
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,170
What? A thousand dollars?

49
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,540
I don't need this kind of money.

50
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,940
I don't care if you're completely bankrupt.

51
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,290
Please keep this...

52
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,770
and count off whatever Eul has from that money.

53
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,410
What? What are you saying?

54
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,010
I won't ever come back here.

55
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,890
I'm not going to see Eul from now on, either.

56
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,810
I think...

57
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,090
it's been over a minute.

58
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,650
Just one more minute.

59
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,140
When did you get here?

60
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,930
Just now.

61
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,570
It's really late.

62
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,330
Why? What's going on? How's your...

63
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,050
Are we going to spend the night like this?

64
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,730
- That'd be great for me.
- My goodness.

65
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,770
Tell me what you were going to say over the phone.

66
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Well...

67
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,140
I was saying...

68
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,090
What I meant by trusting you is that...

69
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,570
Well, I'm not saying I'm really going to trust you.

70
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,410
So what I'm saying is...

71
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm making a living off of you right now.

72
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,650
And it'd be my loss to not trust you.

73
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,380
- Why are you smiling?
- Because you're so pretty.

74
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,290
You're even prettier.

75
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,260
You're so adorable.

76
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,190
You'll hit me if I ask you for a kiss, right?

77
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,260
I'll kill you.

78
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,770
What a pervert.

79
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,530
See you tomorrow, Eul.

80
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,610
And the day after tomorrow.

81
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,970
And the day after that.

82
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,810
And the day after that.

83
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,900
I'll see you whenever and wherever.

84
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,150
- Why is it so loud?
- Pardon?

85
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,190
Hey, aren't you going to control the scene?

86
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,060
It's because of Joon Young and Yoo Na.

87
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,880
There are a lot of reporters here.

88
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm sorry, Sir.

89
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,830
- My gosh.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.

90
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,950
Reporter Kim.

91
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,170
Hey, Gook Young. Let us get his interview.

92
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,390
Reporter Kim.

93
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,290
I'll make sure to set up an interview...

94
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,250
with both Joon Young and Yoo Na...

95
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,710
after they're done with the shooting.

96
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,430
So could you all please wait a little?

97
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,760
- I'm freezing right now.
- I'm sorry.

98
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,300
Also, we're in the middle of a shooting,

99
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,430
so please keep it low. Thank you.

100
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,000
Everyone, be quiet.

101
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,390
- Please be quiet.
- Let's begin.

102
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,580
- What?
- What's that?

103
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,830
What's that? Hey.

104
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,470
Hey, what's with the drone?

105
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,830
Who is that?

106
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,070
- Hello.
- Go on and begin.

107
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,110
Okay, let us begin.

108
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,790
It's your first time being out in public...

109
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,670
after you opened up about your relationship.

110
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,510
Could you share a word?

111
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,350
I'm so sorry you had to come all the way here...

112
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,990
just for us.

113
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,160
We'll continue to cherish each other.

114
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,190
Thank you.

115
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,030
Nice.

116
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,390
Joon Young, what about you?

117
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,350
Joon Young, say something.

118
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,910
We're both...

119
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,310
celebrities...

120
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,030
and public figures.

121
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,030
But before that,

122
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,390
I believe we have...

123
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,430
the rights to have our personal lives protected.

124
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,590
I don't understand why...

125
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,150
everyone has to gossip about my love life...

126
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,350
and why the person I love...

127
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,950
needs to be hated and receive unnecessary comments...

128
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,510
when she did nothing wrong.

129
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,190
I don't understand why...

130
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,030
I have to be in this position.

131
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,230
I'm a bit confused about this.

132
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,430
This is all I have to say about this issue.

133
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,430
Also,

134
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,630
I won't be doing any more interviews.

135
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,600
If you still want me around as a celebrity,

136
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,480
please refrain from showing too much interest...

137
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,150
in my private life from now on.

138
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,910
Joon Young. Hey, Joon Young.

139
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,710
Producer Noh.

140
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,370
You were stigmatised as a gold-digger...

141
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,880
due to Joon Young's actions.

142
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,390
Could you share a word?

143
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,310
Please say something.

144
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,830
I have nothing to say.

145
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,310
Maybe he's using Yoo Na as a shield.

146
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,870
Joon Young might've agreed to his agency's plan...

147
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,080
just so that he could protect you, Producer Noh.

148
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,870
He may be fooling everyone again.

149
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,570
Excuse me. Don't you think you're crossing the line?

150
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,150
Am I wrong?

151
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,770
Yes, you're wrong. I have someone else that I like.

152
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,070
He's much cooler than Joon Young.

153
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,710
Do you expect us to believe that?

154
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,080
I'm sure Joon Young's a huge celebrity,

155
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,720
but he's not my type.

156
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,910
And for your information,

157
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,870
I'm a huge fan of Seo Yoon Hoo.

158
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,230
What's all this?

159
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,870
(PRODUCER NOH IS A HUGE FAN OF SEO YOON HOO.)

160
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,430
Why did I have to mention Seo Yoon Hoo?

161
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,160
You shouldn't have said that, you fool.

162
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,310
So you're Yoon Hoo's fan?

163
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,690
He's really crazy. He's a player, too.

164
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,380
Get off the car. What if people see you?

165
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Am I not your type? What's your type?

166
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,110
Get off, please.

167
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,950
What's your type?

168
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,040
I'll try to become your type, so tell me.

169
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,920
We might get caught.

170
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,250
With what?

171
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,750
The fact that I'm actually your type?

172
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,790
- Hey.
- The fact that you like me, too?

173
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,830
Hey, it's me, Eul. Joon Young is in my car.

174
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,920
Hey.

175
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,030
Hello?

176
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,840
What was that?

177
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Hello?

178
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,010
Where did he go?

179
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,470
Everything that happens to me from now...

180
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,790
is in your hands.

181
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,350
What?

182
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,550
What a baby.

183
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,160

184
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,550
(TO EUL)

185
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,590
May I help you?

186
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,230
I don't know much about women's rings.

187
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,490
I'll make a recommendation if you tell me the occasion.

188
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,030
It's for my mother who's getting discharged...

189
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,640
from the hospital. Any recommendations?

190
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,110
Sure. Please wait.

191
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,110
Hello?

192
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,430
I know you can't trust people,

193
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,270
but I never thought he'd be the one to betray me.

194
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,110
He and I've been friends for 50 years.

195
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,990
It's been less than a month since I sent you money.

196
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,520
My goodness, don't say that. You're making me upset.

197
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,690
Today, I'm not here because of money.

198
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,870
I was just curious how Hyun Joon, you and...

199
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,920
my nephew and niece are doing.

200
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,950
I almost cut ties with Hyun Joon...

201
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,710
because of how he acted last time.

202
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,990
If his nephew got drunk and accidentally beat someone up,

203
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,900
he could've put in a word to the police chief.

204
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,000
But he persistently declined to do so.

205
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,920
Because of that, my son was imprisoned for a month.

206
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
The times have changed now.

207
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,410
If anyone finds out that a congressman asked...

208
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,910
a police chief to do him a favour...

209
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,510
My goodness. Is that so?

210
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,850
You're such a knowledgeable woman.

211
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,870
I'm so dumb that I haven't even thought that far.

212
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,310
This is why people should hang out with similar people.

213
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,510
Joon Young's mum used to be a good friend to me.

214
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,940
Why are you mentioning her again?

215
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,070
Because I feel bad.

216
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,840
She was carrying Hyun Joon's child.

217
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,690
She was such a nice person.

218
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,380
It just kills me to think that I had to...

219
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,010
send her off just because you asked me to do so.

220
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,550
I think you drank a bit too much, Hyun Gil.

221
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm not drunk.

222
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,710
I only had half a bottle of soju.

223
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm sorry.

224
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,070
I forgot that I had another appointment.

225
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,110
You can take your time before you leave.

226
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,040
(ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS)

227
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,320
Do you think I'm a beggar?

228
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,310
My poor brother, Hyun Joon.

229
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,870
He doesn't even know that his own son...

230
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,070
is a huge celebrity...

231
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,760
who's right in front of his eyes.

232
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,570
Instead, he's raising someone else's kid,

233
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,010
calling him his own son.

234
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,430
- What a sad...
- Hyun Gil!

235
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,670
You don't have to shout.

236
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,950
Mr Kim.

237
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,910
Transfer 300,000 dollars to Hyun Gil's account...

238
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,230
by tomorrow morning.

239
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,230
Don't let my husband know about any of this.

241
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,510
- That's not necessary, Mr Kim.
- Ji Tae.

242
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,470
If you send even a cent to him,

243
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,790
I won't stay silent.

244
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,870
How much do you know?

245
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Everything.

246
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,450
I know as much as...

247
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,250
you know.

248
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,720
I even know that...

249
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,800
Joon Young is his son.

250
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
Tell Dad the truth.

251
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
Tell him how...

252
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,600
Uncle Hyun Gil threatened you until now.

253
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,760
Tell him everything.

254
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,860
No.

255
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,090
Your father will leave me.

256
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,120
Mum.

257
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,050
I liked him first.

258
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,970
I liked your father...

259
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,490
before Young Ok liked him.

260
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,770
I made your father into who he is today.

261
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,220
I did it all.

262
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,010
If your father...

263
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,480
stayed with Young Ok,

264
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,020
he would never have escaped that bottomless pit.

265
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,620
You're right. I agree.

266
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,340
So whatever you tell him,

267
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,120
he'll understand.

268
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,800
So tell him everything and...

269
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,480
He'll go back to Young Ok.

270
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,590
He never forgot about her even in his dreams.

271
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,670
If he finds out that she had his child,

272
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,950
he'll probably run over to his son.

273
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,350
I am...

274
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,950
his son, too.

275
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,170
We may not be related by blood,

276
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,200
but I am still his son.

277
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,900
(SON)

278
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,890
- Good afternoon.
- Have you eaten?

279
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,130
Of course I did.

280
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,690
It's odd for you to call at this hour. Aren't you busy?

281
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,090
I love you, Dad.

282
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,050
I love you.

283
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,050
I still can't give you Greg Norman's autographed ball.

284
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,650
I found a great bar.

285
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,410
Do you want to grab a drink? I won't tell Mum.

286
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,730
Sure. I actually wanted a drink.

287
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,290
My son, you really know me well.

288
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,460
Give me a call when you get off work.

289
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,610
I love you, son.

290
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,450
I'll tell him everything.

291
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,580
We're a family.

292
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,610
Until when are we going to live under threats and lies?

293
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,250
He will...

294
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,490
never leave you.

295
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,730
Even your biological father left us.

296
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,330
He left you and me...

297
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,210
to live with the woman he liked.

298
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,530
Your father will leave me, too.

299
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,130
He will despise me...

300
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,850
and hate me.

301
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,570
That won't happen.

302
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,250
Just give me three months.

303
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,790
I'll take care of everything, so give me three months.

304
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,090
Why three months?

305
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,730
Just tell him as soon as possible.

306
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,810
Tell him everything and live...

307
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,170
After three months, Joon Young will be dead.

308
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,690
What...

309
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,930
are you talking about?

310
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,730
Mum.

311
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,450
Joon Young...

312
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,130
is sick.

313
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,050
Have you thought about your bucket list?

314
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,770
Yes.

315
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,250
Could you tell me one item on that list?

316
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,170
Hearing "You're just my type"...

317
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,210
from the person who just questioned me.

318
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,690
I'll edit that out.

319
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,890
I'll ask you again.

320
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,250
Tell me one of the items...

321
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,810
Hearing "I love you" from the woman...

322
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,410
standing in front of me.

323
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,130
Stop joking around.

324
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,690
I wasn't joking.

325
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,610
Did you even wash your hair?

326
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,030
How can you shoot the guy you like with oily hair?

327
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,130
I did wash my hair.

328
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,570
I see.

329
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,010
That means you do like me.

330
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,210
You even washed your hair to impress me.

331
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,850
Are you kidding me?

332
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,110
To be honest, I didn't wash my hair.

333
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,900
It's oily and smelly.

334
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,010
Do you want to smell it? It's awful, right?

335
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,610
Right, I haven't showered for a week, either.

336
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,570
No wonder my body's been itching lately.

337
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,370
I can even fart in front of you, Joon Young.

338
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,620
Joon Young.

339
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,290
We'll do the photo shoot soon, so please stand by.

340
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,610
You should come along.

341
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm leaving for Seoul.

342
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,830
He's been saying weird things. He must be tired.

343
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,450
I don't think he has much to say today.

344
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,530
What's wrong with him? Is he sullen?

345
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,820
My gosh. What a baby.

346
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,380
Don't call him a baby.

347
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,570
He's a top star in Korea.

348
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,690
I'd say he's more like a child. I'll get going.

349
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,010
(TO EUL)

350
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,750
That's great.

351
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,090
Try being more intimate. That's nice.

352
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,970
Wow, you two make a wonderful couple.

353
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,530
It looks great.

354
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,930
I guess we really do look great together.

355
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,290
Shall we go out for real?

356
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,770
What's your relationship with Producer Noh?

357
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,730
I knew you had a unique taste,

358
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,930
but she's a bit too low, don't you think?

359
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,170
You're a top star, you know.

360
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,650
Now, try to act...

361
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,370
as if you're whispering your love to each other.

362
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,730
Good.

363
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,220
Let's just focus on the shooting.

364
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,250
That's great.

365
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,250
What does she have that I don't?

366
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,010
Why are you making me feel so awful?

367
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,390
You started it.

368
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,510
That's nice.

369
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,490
You did an interview to play along with the president.

370
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,610
That looks great.

371
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,170
Just take what you'd like out of this and leave.

372
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,490
I'm thankful that you helped me protect Eul.

373
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,090
Wait.

374
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,050
Let's stop for a bit.

375
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,490
Okay, sure.

377
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,370
Wait. Wait a second.

378
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,610
Producer Noh, hurry up.

379
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,410
- What is it?
- What am I going to do?

380
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,450
Joon Young just got hurt.

381
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,570
- Why?
- The light stand fell on him.

382
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,930
I hope he's not badly hurt.

383
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,970
Where is he?

384
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,010
He's at the hospital.

385
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,340
One of our managers is waiting in our van.

386
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,330
I have to clear things up here,

387
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,370
so could you please run over to him?

388
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,970
- Okay.
- Please, hurry.

389
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,410
Take good care of her. Don't speed too much.

390
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,250
Let's go.

391
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,290
Is Joon Young...

392
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,530
badly hurt?

393
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,330
Yes.

394
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,930
How bad is it?

395
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,950
I'm not sure,

396
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,610
but I heard that his life may be in danger.

397
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,250
Unbelievable.

398
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,730
Why did you stop?

399
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,990
I want to grab a cup of coffee.

400
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,010
Hey.

401
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,370
Are you crazy?

402
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,610
How can you think about getting coffee...

403
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,460
when Joon Young's life is in danger?

404
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,780
I'll only take five minutes.

405
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,250
What are you talking about?

406
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,370
Just keep going.

407
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,330
I have something to say to him.

408
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,110
Hurry up and go!

409
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,030
It'll only take five minutes. I'll be right back.

410
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,490
What kind of jerk are you?

411
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,450
Get off right now.

412
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,850
I'll drive.

413
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,530
Give me the address to the hospital and leave.

414
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,940
Get out of the car, you jerk! Get off!

415
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,940
Why are you crying?

416
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,170
Were you that worried about me?

417
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,460
What did you want to say to me?

418
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,850
Did you want to confess your love...

419
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,530
after hearing that I might die?

420
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,460
- You jerk.
- Hey.

421
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,940
It wasn't completely a lie.

422
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,770
I have a bump in my head.

423
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,890
I'm serious.

424
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,730
Why did you pretend you didn't care?

425
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,250
Why did you pretend you didn't like me...

426
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,650
when you were going to be this worried?

427
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,850
My gosh.

428
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,980
Did you fall again?

429
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,980
Why do you always fall down?

430
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,850
Is your leg okay?

431
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,980
Hey.

432
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,690
- You...
- What?

433
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,770
Look at you.

434
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,170
Oh, right.

435
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,210
My face got torn, and I have a bruise.

436
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,420
The inside of my mouth is torn, too.

437
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,290
It's also hard to move my shoulders.

438
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,310
I wanted to go on a date before going to the hospital,

439
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,670
but that's all ruined.

440
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,650
The coffee over there is excellent, you know.

441
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,250
Yes.

442
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,460
You're my type.

443
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,250
Okay?

444
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,130
And yes.

445
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,010
I like you.

446
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,330
Are you happy now?

447
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,370
You crazy fool.

448
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,330
How can you go on a date...

449
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,610
when you're this hurt?

450
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,420
What a bunch of nonsense.

451
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,370
How can you think about getting coffee?

452
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,850
Dad, you're going to the K-Pop Festival today, right?

453
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,850
Can you take me with you?

454
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,420
Dad, come on. Take me, please?

455
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,850
Can you stop the car?

456
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,910
You were a high school student?

457
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,940
Yes.

458
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,310
Then does that mean I get fooled by a minor?

459
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,130
- You little...
- I never fooled you.

460
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,570
You never asked if I was in high school.

461
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,290
Wait.

462
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,490
- Do you have money?
- Why?

463
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,570
Are you trying to rob me now?

464
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,530
By the way, I'm older than you.

465
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,890
You're a bold one.

466
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,770
Watch your manners.

467
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,670
Eat slowly.

468
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,980
You'll get sick.

469
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,030
Did you starve it for days?

470
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,730
I wouldn't know. This isn't my cat.

471
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,330
- Someone must've abandoned it.
- Really?

472
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,090
That's so sad.

473
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,150
- Why?
- Please take care of this kitten.

474
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,210
I have to go to school, so stay with...

475
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,440
I mean, can you please look after it?

476
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,670
No way.

477
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,730
Why would I take care of a stray cat?

478
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,490
Because pretty people are usually nice.

479
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,370
Your eyes

480
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,170
Your touch

481
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,830
Blow around me like the wind

482
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,010
- It feels like
- Be quiet.

483
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,690
Stop singing that stupid song.

484
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,090
Okay.

485
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,980
Ms Shin.

486
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,330
- This is bad.
- Why? What is it?

487
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,530
Joon Young... Joon Young is...

488
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,250
- You have to come with me.
- Why?

489
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,130
Hey, go and get her jacket.

490
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,330
- Hurry.
- What?

491
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,490
- What is it?
- Just come along.

492
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,490
- Please drop this.
- What's with you?

493
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,870
Why are we here?

494
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,980
I thought he was hurt. Let's go to the hospital.

495
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,490
We called the doctor here.

496
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,670
Ms Shin, hurry up.

497
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,090
You have to hurry. He's dying.

498
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,310
I knew this would happen. I knew it.

499
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,850
You're a fraud.

500
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,950
This wasn't my idea. It was Joon Young's.

501
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,850
He seems to have had a lot of fun...

502
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,670
when he fooled Producer Noh.

503
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,130
Move. Move away.

504
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,590
What are you doing? Let go.

505
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,050
- Can you grab her?
- Okay.

506
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,730
What are you two doing?

507
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,010
The minister of culture and sports is giving awards...

508
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,460
to mothers who brought up K-wave celebrities today.

509
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
What?

510
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,010
Why don't you give her a big hand?

511
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,650
Congratulations.

512
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,630
My goodness.

513
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,390
You're so pretty that everything looks great on you.

514
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,090
I can't pick one. I'll just take everything.

515
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,210
Yes, Sir.

516
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,010
No, I'm not going to buy them, so don't bother.

517
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,130
Just ignore her.

518
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,340
You must feel like we're on good terms...

519
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,460
just because I let you by a couple of times.

520
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,700
Politicians will be there with their families today.

521
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,350
Ministers will be there...

522
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,980
and so will congressmen.

523
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,070
I heard Congressman Choi is coming, right?

524
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,490
You're right.

525
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,590
People in Africa sing my songs,

526
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,470
and people in Brazil cry over my dramas.

527
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,820
Isn't this enough...

528
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,170
for you to be proud of your son?

529
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,610
How do I look?

530
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,700
Wow, people say the tailor makes the man.

531
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,090
Are you really my twin brother, Jeong Sik?

532
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,210
You should hold your tummy in, Dad.

533
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,090
- Is that good?
- Excellent.

534
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,290
Will Ms Shin be on TV, too?

535
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,130
- I'm not sure.
- Joon Young sent...

536
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,650
a tuxedo for you...

537
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,890
to accompany her.

538
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,610
Maybe he thinks of you like a father.

539
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,570
What... What are you talking about?

540
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,610
He's asking me to accompany her because...

541
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,420
she'd feel awkward sitting alone.

542
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,870
I'm a handsome man, you know.

543
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,710
Dad, I'll ask you questions like a reporter.

544
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,810
Try to answer them.

545
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,610
I heard you've been...

546
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,770
acquainted with Joon Young...

547
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,540
and his mother for a long time.

548
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,850
Could you say something about his mother?

549
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,170
Joon Young's mum is...

550
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,390
much like Mencius's mother.

551
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,530
To make Joon Young a world-renowned star,

552
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,330
she... Well...

553
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,210
- What did she do?
- Nothing.

554
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,570
To be honest, she was only mean to him...

555
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,150
saying that he's not her son.

556
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,310
Excuse me, more radish kimchi, please.

557
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,330
Sure.

558
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,530
Where is she?

559
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,210
What's he saying? I can't hear anything.

561
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,370
I don't think it's a technical problem.

562
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,690
What's wrong with this?

563
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,530
Why are you still here?

564
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,330
Where else would I be?

565
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,110
Aren't you going to the K-Pop Festival?

566
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,590
His manager called me and told me not to come.

567
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,890
What are you talking about?

568
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,860
His mum is receiving an award from the minister.

569
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,890
Hurry up and go.

570
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,790
You'll have a lot to put on camera.

571
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,810
But still,

572
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,690
he told me over and over again not to come.

573
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,950
We're not a PR agency that makes their PR videos.

574
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,970
Get up and go.

575
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,090
At least brush your teeth before you leave.

576
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,170
Over here, please.

577
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,090
Over here, please.

578
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:39,930
Over here.

579

(MY NUMBER ONE TREASURE)

580
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,170
Hey, Jik.

581
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,710
When are you coming home?

582
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,690
I have an urgent shooting. I'll be late.

583
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,650
- Why? Is something wrong?
- No, I just called.

584
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,730
Will you be very late?

585
00:47:58,850 --> 00:47:59,950
Okay.

586
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,810
Make sure you eat something, okay?

587
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,290
Hello?

588
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,410
Did you forget what day it is today?

589
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,010
What day is it?

590
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,380
It's not Jik's birthday,

591
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,610
and it's not your birthday, either.

592
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,370
It's the anniversary of your father's death, you fool.

593
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,830
I don't understand what's so important...

594
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,570
that you'd forget about today.

595
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,530
Give it to me, Na Ri.

596
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,210
I'm sure Dad will understand that you're busy.

597
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,090
Don't worry about it.

598
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,020
He's right.

599
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,490
You have to make a living...

600
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,310
before you remember a day like this.

601
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,740
We'll take care of everything here, so don't worry.

602
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,730
Just make some time to come and say your prayers, okay?

603
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,570
Hello?

604
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,010
Can you hear me, Eul?

605
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,250
What's going on?

606
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,010
Did she hang up?

607
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,490
I guess you'll just have to do it on your own.

608
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,290
I'm fine. I can do it alone.

609
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,050
You're such a grown up.

610
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:19,460
How can you two be...

611
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,930
so different?

612
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,250
Are you waiting for a call?

613
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,010
You've been looking at your phone all day.

614
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,050
I'm waiting for Hyun Woo.

615
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,210
Oh, right.

616
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,340
Why isn't he calling?

617
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,170
He always came on your dad's memorial day.

618
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:43,530
You should give him a call.

619
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,730
The number doesn't exist any more.

620
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,970
- What?
- I've been calling him,

621
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,290
but it says the number doesn't exist any more.

622
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,810
I hope nothing happened to him.

624
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,290
Why did you bring Ha Ru along?

625
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,010
Dad asked me to come along because he thought...

626
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,850
I needed a break from my studies.

627
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,810
He wanted me to eat good food...

628
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,130
and relieve my stress by watching celebrities perform.

629
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:57,930
Right, Dad?

630
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,770
She's right.

631
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,170
Please let her off just for today.

632
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,230
Will there be celebrities there?

633
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,450
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

634
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,610
Like who?

635
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,610
You don't even watch TV. How would you know?

636
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,370
I don't know most of them, either.

637
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,170
I rarely watch TV.

638
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,570
Will Shin Joon Young be there?

639
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,850
How do you know him?

640
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,450
Come on, Dad. Everyone knows who he is.

641
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,930
That's what my friends say.

642
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,880
My friends were surprised that I didn't know him.

643
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,290
Will he be there?

644
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,850
- No.
- No.

645
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,610
He's on an overseas tour.

646
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,050
My friend's a fan of his,

647
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,650
so she told me.

648
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,830
Why? Are you his fan, too?

649
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,140
No.

650
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,570
But I wanted to see him, though. That's too bad.

00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,790
You can take Ha Ru home.

653
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,250
- Mum.
- Why?

654
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,010
She's already here. Let's go in together.

655
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:30,890
I heard today's a very important occasion.

656
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,770
People would think she's not studying for college...

657
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,510
if they see her here.

658
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,310
Why bother caring about what others would think?

659
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,330
Exactly.

660
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,710
Ha Ru, go home. Okay?

661
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,770
No. I didn't even get to see Joon Young.

662
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,930
I can't leave like this.

663
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,530
My goodness. Hey! Stop!

664
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:48,890
Stop.

665
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,170
Let's go.

666
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,890
Ha Ru, leave the cat and come here.

667
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,930
Is Shin Joon Young here?

668
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,710
Yes, I heard he is.

669
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,610
Why did you lie, then?

670
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:06,730
I was afraid you'd send Ha Ru back.

671
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,130
You already know that she's his fan.

672
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,790
Like she said,

673
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,740
she's too busy following him to get into trouble,

674
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,330
so let's be thankful about that.

675
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,930
Come here. Let's go.

676
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,410
Dad. I'm sorry.

677
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,650
Go away.

678
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,690
I said, go away.

679
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,730
Hey.

680
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,130
Do you know whose this is? It's my Dad's.

681
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,570
Why are you hitting my cat?

682
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,890
It's the gold-digger.

683
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,210
Is that your cat?

684
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,890
Do you see this?

685
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,390
You should train...

686
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,570
I'll pay for it.

687
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,290
I can pay for that.

688
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,010
It won't cost much anyway.

689
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,170
What did you say?

690
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,450
Here. Are we cool?

691
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,690
- You little...
- Ouch.

692
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,450
- Why did you hit me?
- How old are you?

693
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:50,570
Where did you learn your manners?

694
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,050
Didn't you learn to apologise for your mistakes?

695
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,210
Ha Ru.

696
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,450
Dad.

697
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,090
She just hit me.

698
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,370
Did my daughter do something to you?

699
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:18,090
Did my car do something to you?

700
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,410
What's going on?

701
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,300
What did you do wrong?

702
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,810
I didn't do anything wrong.

703
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,090
She just hit me for no reason while I was passing by.

704
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,050
Did you hit her?

705
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:50,850
Don't you...

706
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,690
remember me?

707
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,810
Do you know me?

708
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,530
She's a gold-digger.

709
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,100
She tried to get Joon Young, but her face got revealed,

710
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,570
so she failed before she could do anything.

711
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,690
Ha Ru.

712
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,450
Did she do this?

713
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,070
No.

714
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,410
It wasn't me. It was the kitten.

715
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,010
But it doesn't know any better. It's just a kitten.

716
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,930
Today's my father's memorial day.

717
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,610
Oh, I'm sorry.

718
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:45,570
Here.

719
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,190
I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.

720
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,210
So don't be mad and take this.

721
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,100
Why are you giving her 50 dollars?

722
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,970
- This all costs less than three dollars.
- Ha Ru.

723
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,450
Here. Go on and take it.

724
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,530
You should apologise first.

725
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,370
Instead of giving her money,

726
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,410
you should apologise first.
