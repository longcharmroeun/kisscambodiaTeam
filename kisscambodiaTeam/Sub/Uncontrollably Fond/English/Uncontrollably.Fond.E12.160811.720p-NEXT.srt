1
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,310
In 1, 2, 3, go.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,710
On a green field

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,110
I'll build a picturesque house

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,070
And live with my love

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,480
- Let her sing.
- For 100 years

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,470
For 100 years

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,950
We'll sow seeds in the spring

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,140
Flowers bloom in the summer

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,650
Whenever my mum was in a good mood,

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,690
she sang this song.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,590
In winter, I'll be happy

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,090
"On a green field,"

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,170
"I'll build a picturesque house."

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,490
"And live with my love..."

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,010
"for the rest of my life."

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,250
That's how the song began.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,770
I don't know since when it was,

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,850
but I naturally ended up with a dream.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,290
A dream to build a picturesque house...

20
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,170
on a green field...

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,250
and live there happily...

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,710
for a long, long time with my love.

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,090
Live with my love for 100 years

24
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,290
Even when I found out I didn't have much time left,

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,690
I didn't give up on my dream.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
I only...

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,160
shortened the time from 100 years...

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
to 3 months.

29
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,350
(NOH EUL)

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,030
Now,

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,190
there's 5m left.

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,870
Now,

33
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,030
there's 4m left.

34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,550
(NOW, THERE'S 3M LEFT.)

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,550
(NOW, THERE'S 2M LEFT.)

36
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,070
(NOW, THERE'S 1M LEFT.)

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,550
It may not be 100 years,

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,710
but I will spend...

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,680
the time I have left...

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,590
loving the person I love.

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,630
So let's not be sad...

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,750
or upset.

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,230
(NOW, THERE'S 20KM LEFT.)

44
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,400
(NOW, THERE'S 19KM LEFT.)

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
(NOW, THERE'S 17KM LEFT.)

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
(NOW, THERE'S 16KM LEFT.)

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,230
(NOW, THERE'S 1M LEFT.)

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,710
Now, there's zero distance left.

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,910
Let's give up.

50
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,870
Joon Young won't show up.

51
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,430
It's over.

52
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,350
It's really over.

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,510
(LET'S GIVE UP. JOON YOUNG WON'T SHOW UP. IT'S OVER.)

54
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,710
What do you mean? Where are you going?

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,430
I'm planning to leave Korea.

56
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,810
But now,

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,770
I'm going to give up on...

58
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,930
the last dream I ever had.

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,330
I won't spend the rest of my life...

60
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,820
living in a picturesque house with Eul.

61
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,170
Instead, I will return the truth and justice...

62
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,170
that I took from her.

63
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,090
Lend me 10 dollars. I'll pay you back tomorrow.

64
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,730
What about the 50 dollars you took last time?

65
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,970
I'll pay you everything back tomorrow.

66
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,290
You might as well lend me 30 dollars.

67
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,770
Hey, I'm not an ATM.

68
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,850
Here. It's for the food you bought me.

69
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,050
Who really hit Mr Noh Jang Soo?

70
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,530
Who do you think it was?

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,570
They caught the culprit.

72
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,810
I don't mean the man Choi Hyun Joon offered up.

73
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
Who's the real culprit?

74
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,570
What's the matter with you?

75
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,410
Go before I turn nasty.

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,970
I can sue you for obstruction and invasion of privacy.

77
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,450
So when I'm gone, I hope Eul will have overcome...

78
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,170
the long, cold winter...

79
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,210
and start living...

80
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,850
a warm, clear and springlike life.

81
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,730
You are not going anywhere.

82
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,570
Get off right now, Eul.

83
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,370
Get out, Eul!

84
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,410
Mister.

85
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,130
I'm sorry about this.

86
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,370
Can you open the trunk, please?

87
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,850
Sure.

88
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,050
No, don't unload my bags.

89
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,010
Unload her stuff.

90
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,570
Mister.

91
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,670
Jik, can you take her suitcase upstairs?

92
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,450
- Mister.
- Now.

93
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,970
Okay.

94
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,530
Do explain later why you disappeared for so long.

95
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,050
I will.

96
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,860
Jik, wait.

97
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,140
See you.

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,170
Jik!

99
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,830
What are you doing?

100
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,170
Where were you until now?

101
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,290
You don't have to run away.

102
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,930
Stay here.

103
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,690
Did Na Ri tell you?

104
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,810
I found out somehow.

105
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,690
I heard Congressman Choi's wife threatened you...

106
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,650
and that she's the reason why you're running away.

107
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,130
Then don't stop me.

108
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,410
Losing my dad was enough.

109
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,250
I won't lose Jik, too.

110
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,650
Will you take responsibility if I miss my flight?

111
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,130
Jik, bring back all the bags!

112
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,130
Eul.

113
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,470
You should also leave and stop being my friend.

114
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,750
If you end up getting hurt, then...

115
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,770
I'll stop it!

116
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,970
I'll stop it.

117
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,340
Those people are much scarier than you think.

118
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,650
They aren't the kind of people we can deal with.

119
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,770
They're my parents!

120
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,450
Congressman Choi's my father.

121
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,210
Madam Lee's my mother.

122
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,090
I am their son.

123
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,690
That one was funny.

124
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,690
Your jokes are usually really lame.

125
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,930
Wait.

126
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,250
Was it not a joke?

127
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,290
No.

128
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,370
It wasn't.

129
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,570
But your name is...

130
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,530
Lee Hyun Woo.

131
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,790
Your last name should be Choi.

132
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,810
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,050
I deceived you.

134
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,430
Eul.

135
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,650
Don't come closer.

136
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,810
- Eul.
- Don't come closer.

137
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,130
Don't come any closer.

138
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,980
What did you do?

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,770
- What?
- I took her USB...

140
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,820
and almost got her killed.

141
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,730
It was terrible, but at least that's what I did.

142
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,980
But what did you do?

143
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,980
What did you do...

144
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,130
when your parents...

145
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,250
threatened her...

146
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,290
and tried to send her abroad?

147
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,980
Where's the fiance? He's 10 minutes late.

148
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,730
It must be the traffic.

149
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,050
(MUM)

150
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,730
He won't pick up?

151
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,050
Has he gone insane?

152
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,370
Ta-da.

153
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,810
It's your daughter's birthday, right?

154
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,290
Go away.

155
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,330
I won't until you tell me who really did it.

156
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,970
What do you mean?

157
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,490
I told you that...

158
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,410
the real culprit turned himself in.

159
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,050
This coat of yours.

160
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,370
It doesn't suit you at all.

161
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,770
It's ruining your handsome looks.

162
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,410
Would you like all my coats?

163
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,980
I told you not to come here.

164
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,370
I'm her dad.

165
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,490
Her dad?

166
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,540
You're not a dad.

167
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,740
You have no right to call yourself that.

168
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,020
Bo Ram doesn't consider you her dad, either.

169
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,050
So go away.

170
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,230
- I don't believe this.
- What?

171
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,480
Give me my cell phone.

172
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,610
Shin Joon Young's in room 6101.

173
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,930
- Really?
- Yes.

174
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,760
He said he's Shin Joon Young,

175
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,390
but he's way more handsome in person.

176
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,130
- My goodness.
- Let's go.

177
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,570
Come on.

178
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,010
- Is it really him?
- Unbelievable.

179
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,330
Happy birthday, Bo Ram.

180
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,450
It's really me.

181
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,290
What should I do to convince you all?

182
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,800
"Hello, Chester."

183
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,750
- You sounded like him.
- Right?

184
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,010
- It must be him.
- You're right.

185
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,450
Didn't you watch any of my dramas?

186
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,290
You have to know this, then.

187
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,370
"Don't give me that look."

188
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,390
"It makes me nervous."

189
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,170
"Hello, new kid."

190
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,540
I knew it.

191
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,010
I knew you were the smartest the second I came in.

192
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,090
- Wow.
- But how does a famous person like you...

193
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,090
know Bo Ram?

194
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,210
I'm a fan of...

195
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,330
Bo Ram's dad.

196
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,530
Her dad used to be a prosecutor,

197
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,090
and I respect him more than anyone.

198
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,130
Is that true?

199
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,010
Do you really respect him more than anyone?

200
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,410
You bet. Of all the people I know,

201
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,750
your dad is the bravest, most just,

202
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,690
most handsome and greatest man.

203
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,490
His only flaw is his poor sense of fashion.

204
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,610
If only my father were...

205
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,170
as great a guy as Bo Ram's dad.

206
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,410
Bo Ram.

207
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,610
I envy you so much.

208
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,370
Here you are.

209
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,570
That's gross.

210
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,410
Why are you eating something that fell on the floor?

211
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,610
Why did you lie to her?

212
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,570
I didn't lie.

213
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,850
I do respect you more than anyone,

214
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,850
other than my mum.

215
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,210
"About Noh Jang Soo's hit-and-run."

216
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,890
"Someone else will take the fall."

217
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,010
"So cover up the investigation..."

218
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,290
"and follow my orders from now on."

219
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,210
"Then your sick daughter..."

220
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,580
"will get operated at the best hospital in Korea..."

221
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,350
"and it'll all be paid for."

222
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,010
- Stop it.
- That is what...

223
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,370
the then senior prosecutor, Choi Hyun Joon, said...

224
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,610
to you, the then prosecutor in charge.

225
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,860
- Look, Mr Shin.
- "Look, Mr Choi."

226
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,310
"Must I cover up the truth to save my daughter's life?"

227
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,530
"I can't do that."

228
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,610
That is what you said.

229
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,770
For that, you got demoted to a regional office.

230
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,590
You couldn't stand the stigma and ridicule,

231
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,310
and so you quit your job.

232
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,290
What little conscience you had bothered you so much,

233
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,580
so your wife divorced you and your child distrusts you.

234
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,650
Take your dramatisation to the set.

235
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,890
I don't have...

236
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,010
much longer to live.

237
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,050
When I die,

238
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,870
the truth will die with me.

239
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,890
So...

240
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,490
share the burden you must carry forever.

241
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,580
Give it to me.

242
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,610
What do you take me for?

243
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,930
Keep that stupid plot for your next drama.

244
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,860
You insane jerk.

245
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,770
Congressman Choi...

246
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,770
is my father.

247
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,530
He doesn't know...

248
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,580
I'm his, though.

249
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,450
And...

250
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,490
Mr Noh Jang Soo, the victim of the hit-and-run,

251
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,050
is the father of the woman I love.

252
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,950
I'm well-known for holding grudges...

253
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,210
and never letting things go.

254
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,130
If I die without doing anything,

255
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,650
I'll become a ghost and haunt you every night.

256
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,100
That's not a lie.

257
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,010
Who is it?

258
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,050
My name is Noh Eul.

259
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,840
Please let me in.

260
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,930
No one's at home.

261
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,970
That's a lie.

262
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,100
Let me in.

263
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,740
It's true. No one's at home.

264
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,340
I must speak with the congressman and his wife.

265
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,000
Let me in.

266
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,770
I promise you that no one's here. Go home.

268
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,410
I know that this is pointless,

269
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,450
and I know that you can crush me like I'm nothing.

270
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,580
That's why I told my dad...

271
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,610
to hold back...

272
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,050
and to forget about it all and die in peace.

273
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,370
If it bothers him that much,

274
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,050
he can be born again as a rich and powerful man.

275
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,890
That's what I told him.

276
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,890
I meant to disappear from your lives.

277
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,770
You wanted me gone, so I was going to get lost.

278
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,370
I was going to live in silence and out of sight...

279
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,580
as if I were dead, just like you wanted.

280
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
But why are you doing this?

281
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,130
Why did you send your son to spy on me?

282
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,200
Did I scare you that much?

283
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,620
What's so scary about me?

284
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm such a coward.

285
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,650
You could walk all over me, and I'd never make a sound.

286
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,280
People like you are the scary ones, not me!

287
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Eul.

288
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
Are you okay, Mum?

289
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,920
Should we go to the hospital?

290
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,640
I'm fine.

291
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
I'll be fine.

292
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,920
How could Ji Tae do this?

293
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,770
Him of all people.

294
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,440
How could he insult you and Dad so badly?

295
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,000
Is he on something?

296
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,680
Ms Kim.

297
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,120
He could have been in a car accident.

298
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,740
Check with the police and hospitals again.

299
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,920
Yes, Madam.

300
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,200
- Where's Dad?
- He's probably with Mr Yoon.

301
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,280
Jeong Eun looked really scary today.

302
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,320
Do you think he'll hit Dad?

303
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,920
I don't know what to say.

304
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,700
I should've raised him better.

305
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,880
Is Ji Tae...

306
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
seeing someone else?

307
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,440
No, Sir.

308
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,360
He wouldn't do something like this.

309
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,840
- I'm sure something urgent...
- Send...

310
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
Ji Tae...

311
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,480
to Jeong Eun before the day ends.

312
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,760
This marriage...

313
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,120
is up to Jeong Eun, not you or anyone else.

314
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
We'll be the ones to end it.

315
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,680
However late it is, as long as he comes by,

316
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,480
the two can still get engaged.

317
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,760
Mr Yoon.

318
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,080
How did the ceremony go?

320
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,760
What do you take me for?

321
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,230
How dare you put me in a dress like this.

322
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,360
What do you mean?

323
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,160
Did something go wrong?

324
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,820
I couldn't get engaged because of this cheap dress.

325
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,400
All because of this dress!

326
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,480
Everyone saw me get stood up. There was no ceremony!

327
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,100
Ms Yoon.

328
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,620
Don't. Ms Yoon.

329
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,280
- Don't do that.
- Ms Yoon.

330
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Stop her.

331
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Are you okay?

332
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,000
Are you hungry? Shall we eat?

333
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Mister.

334
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
What?

335
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
If I were to see you,

336
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,000
would that upset your parents?

337
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
I guess so.

338
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
If I were to date you or something,

339
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
your parents...

340
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
would feel devastated.

341
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Right?

342
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
I think so.

343
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,320
It could be...

344
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,960
the greatest way ever...

345
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,480
to get back at them.

346
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Right?

347
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,880
Then let's date.

348
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,880
You drank too much, Ms Yoon.

349
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Ms Yoon.

350
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,840
How dare you boss me around.

351
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
Know your place.

352
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Why can't I get drunk today?

353
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
Hey, wake up.

354
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,080
You still have a lot to do.

355
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
You can't die without my permission.

356
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Okay?

357
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,800
Ms Yoon! Ms Yoon.

358
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,120
- Ms Yoon.
- My goodness.

359
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,080
- What happened?
- Get her inside.

360
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Careful.

361
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
It's too late.

362
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
There's no evidence or witness.

363
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,660
There's nothing you can do.

364
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,800
I told you that...

365
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,140
I'll do whatever it takes to catch the person.

366
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,720
Just tell me who did it.

367
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,120
Please tell me before it's too late.

368
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
It's Daehan Jeil Party's representative...

369
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880

372
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,320
I have one now.

373
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,760
A bucket list I want to fulfil before I die.

374
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,560
Shin Joon Young's bucket list.

375
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,360
This is exciting.

376
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,960
Shall we begin, then?

377
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,440
Sure. Let's begin.

378
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,120
Cut. That was great.

379
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,180
Producer Yoon's a veteran for a reason.

380
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,140
The show jumped to a whole new level.

381
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,960
The camera angle and movement is just perfect.

382
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,800
Don't you think, Gook Young?

383
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,840
Yes, everything's different for sure.

384
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,480
Go, Producer Yoon.

385
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,320
Go, Producer Yoon.

386
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,680
Nothing's changed.

387
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,340
Producer Noh and him are pretty much the same.

388
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,650
Man Ok.

389
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,280
Why did you hit me?

390
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,000
You must be hungry. You skipped lunch.

391
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
Yes.

392
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,370
I can get something to eat on the way back.

393
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,730
If you aren't in a hurry, you can eat with us.

394
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,320
Let's order Chinese food.

395
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
I'll have jjamppong.

396
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,960
Okay, I'll have jjajangmyeon.

397
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,610
Order tangsuyuk, too.

398
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,760
Okay...

399
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Jjamppong.

400
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,280
Producer Yoon.

401
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,060
- Good job.
- Pardon?

402
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,120
I guess you prefer to dip it in the sauce, too.

403
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,680
Sorry. I reacted instinctively.

404
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
President Nam is so selfish.

405
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
I told him many times that I prefer to dip tangsuyuk.

406
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,880
You did. Sorry.

407
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,620
I'm a birdbrain.

408
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm too stupid to run a talent agency.

409
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,840
Gook Young, I'll retire. Do you want to take over?

410
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,320
I don't think I'm cut out for this job.

411
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
Man Ok, have you ever seen...

412
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,020
someone become so awkward and sincere...

413
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,400
over whether tangsuyuk should be poured or dipped?

414
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
Someone I know...

415
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,480
even wants to resign from being a president.

416
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,340
I think he's overreacting because...

417
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,340
he feels bad that he replaced Producer Noh with Mr Yoon.

418
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,520
Correct.

419
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,440
Was that a whisper?

420
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,040
It was too loud.

421
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,730
Speak freely.

422
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,240
Everyone here knows about it.

423
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,720
President Nam, just act like you normally do.

424
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,100
You're new here, Producer Yoon.

425
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,120
Let's all shoot a great show.

426
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,850
We have the same taste in tangsuyuk.

427
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,720
We'll get along very well.

428
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,530
Let's do this.

429
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,200
- Sir.
- Hi, can I come in?

430
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,460
The place reeks of a jobless person.

431
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,800
Why are you here?

432
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,020
Did you eat jjajang ramyeon?

433
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,960
- How did you know?
- Down here.

434
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,200
- Producer Noh.
- Yes?

435
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,570
I'm here because Director Choi sent me,

436
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,920
but I can't do it.

437
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Can't do what?

438
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,840
The next time you see Director Choi,

439
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,920
tell him that I really tried to make you take the job,

440
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,900
but that you refused. Could you tell him that?

441
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,640
- Please.
- What?

442
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,200
Please.

443
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Wait.

444
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,640
What's the job?

445
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,720
It's something you can't do.

446
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
Reporting on Seo Yoon Hoo's movie.

447
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,200
Why can't I do that?

448
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,530
Haven't you heard the rumours?

449
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,390
He's mean, meticulous...

450
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,370
and a hygiene freak.

451
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,600
He even restricts the perfumes his staff wear.

452
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,050
The basic measurements of the women around him...

453
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,420
are all 34, 24, 35 inches in body size,

454
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,120
and they have to be pretty enough to debut themselves.

455
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,110
Plus, they have to shower at least twice a day.

456
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,600
Why? Because Yoon Hoo hates dirt and bad smells.

457
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,740
So what?

458
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,760
What?

459
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,400
You must not look into a mirror at all.

460
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,800
Up here, too.

461
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Take a break while you're at it.

462
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,530
I'll find a job that's perfect for you.

463
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,580
Talk to Director Choi for me.

464
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,640
Please help me. See you.

465
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,200
She should at least wash her face.

466
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,010
Sir.

467
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,640
It's Eul.

468
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,200
I'll be Seo Yoon Hoo's reporter. Sign me up.

469
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,840
I'll stay and fight instead of running away.

470
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,320
If they threaten to kill me...

471
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,760
Well, it's hard to kill a human being.

472
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
Let's discuss it again tomorrow afternoon.

473
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,900
Resign, Choi Hyun Joon!

474
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,820
- Resign, Choi Hyun Joon!
- Resign, Choi Hyun Joon!

475
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,140
We have a right to live!

476
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,140
- We have a right to live!
- We have a right to live!

477
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,940
You said you'd fight for justice and the common people.

478
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,340
You just got rid of the shop I owned for 20 years.

479
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,960
How is that justice?

480
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,340
Do you think this is why we voted for you?

481
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,320
Resign, Choi Hyun Joon!

482
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,240
- Resign, resign, resign.
- Resign, resign, resign.

483
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,160
Let me ask you one thing.

484
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
The stores you're talking about...

485
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,400
Were they licensed by the local government?

486
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,080
Well...

487
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,500
We didn't need a licence to do business.

488
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,920
Don't say that.

489
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,600
It's illegal to operate an unlicensed street stall.

490
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,250
You could be jailed for two years...

491
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,680
or fined less than 7,000 dollars.

492
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,480
The city and the local lawmakers, including me,

493
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,920
tried our best to prevent this.

494
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,960
We gave you time...

495
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,600
- and tried to...
- Are you sure...

496
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,880
you did your best and gave them time?

497
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,710
Maybe you hired as many contractors as you could...

498
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,950
to chase those people out...

499
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,350
without incurring a loss for your government.

500
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,750
It was the legal use of governmental authority...

501
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,230
for the majority of citizens' convenience and...

502
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,230
Is romanticising violence for convenience...

503
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,350
and ruining their livelihoods...

504
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,390
for the sake of the majority...

505
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,630
what you call justice, Congressman?

506
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,630
What about...

507
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,800
the rent and tax that they never paid for years?

508
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,610
What about the damage that will be done to...

509
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,790
the legal store owners who paid all of that?

510
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,560
If those who obey the law incur a loss,

511
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,350
who would want to abide by it?

512
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,750
Would that society be just?

513
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,540
They'd want to obey the law if only they could.

514
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,790
Then they wouldn't have to deal with the insults...

515
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,430
and constant threats of losing their income.

516
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,710
Stop trying to pretend you have an open mind, Mr Choi.

517
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,120
You've never experienced what their life is like,

518
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,310
so pretending to know and care...

519
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,510
makes me very uncomfortable.

520
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,910
You were once like them yet you pretend you never were.

521
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,290
You ignore their plight.

522
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,560
Is that not a discomfort?

523
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,750
From what I know, your parents owned a street stall.

524
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,630
How could he do this to us?

Sort what out?

528
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,270
A man can get distracted before a life-changing event.

529
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,150
I did, too.

530
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,390
You're probably not sure if it's the right thing to do.

531
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,870
You'll feel nervous.

532
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,830

00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,470
I won't marry Jeong Eun.

535
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,600

I will no longer live my life for you or Mum.

00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,630
I will not do anything that will benefit you,

please you or make you smile.

539
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,670

We're family now.

550
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,150
I was...

551
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,710
dumped.

552
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,150
When?

553
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,390
We never called it off.

554
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,350
- Madam.
- That day,

555
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,670
the engagement went as planned.

556
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,390
Your dress was beautiful,

557
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,910
and you, even more so.

558
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,490
You are my daughter-in-law no matter what.

559
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,120
So from now on,

560
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,510
I will share my company's workload with you.

561
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,870
I will also tell you the secrets and disgraces...

562
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,710
that only our family knows.

563
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,270
(SEO YOON HOO)

564
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,480
Get changed.

565
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,070
I'm playing a detective.

566
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,110
I can't wear a tracksuit. Is there anything else?

567
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,510
How about this?

568
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,470
Give it to your boyfriend.

569
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,390
Find me something else.

570
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,150
Where's my cell phone?

571
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,190
You didn't take me seriously.

572
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,030
I got the producer who got axed from...

573
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,070
Joon Young's documentary.

574
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,850
I do take you so very seriously.

575
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:07,190
I go around saying you're the biggest Hallyu star...

576
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,870
There's a reason she left the documentary.

577
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,910
She's the best in the field,

578
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,150
but Joon Young kept trying to make a move on her.

579
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,750
She got sick of it and quit.

580
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,830
Is she that amazing?

581
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,910
Joon Young has incredibly high standards.

582
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,390
Not at all.

583
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,830
See for yourself.

584
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,670
You heard Joon Young has a weird taste, right?

585
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,070
Almost everyone knows about it.

586
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,350
The producer's great at what she does,

587
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,150
but don't expect or hope for anything more.

588
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,120
Someone stopped her from entering the set...

589
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,110
thinking she was a homeless woman.

590
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,290
Another person tossed her a coin...

591
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,430
thinking she was a beggar.

592
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,670
Who are you?

593
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,720
Hello.

594
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,120
I'm Noh Eul and I'm here to film you behind the scenes.

595
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,910
Nice to meet you.

596
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,150
Are you standing watch?

597
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,910
Yes, I am.

598
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,870
Get lost.

599
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,750
Clap once when Jeong Sik comes in.

600
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,080
What are you doing in secret...

601
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,040
that you had Young Deuk stand guard?

602
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,030
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

603
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,230
Step aside.

604
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,670
You're packing a lot of food.

605
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,550
Who is it for?

606
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,130
Are you seeing someone?

607
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,270
As if.

608
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,800
Move. Get out of the kitchen.

609
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,630
- Get out.
- Then...

610
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,910
is it for Joon Young?

611
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,910
As if it would be.

612
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,110
Don't go.

613
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,890
All he does is scream at you.

614
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,610
Why should you bring him food?

615
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,780
Whether he eats ramyeon...

616
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,750
or fills his belly with water is none of your concern.

617
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,870
"Whether he eats ramyeon or drinks water"?

618
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,210
Don't say that about my son.

619
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,390
Whether I take him food...

620
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,790
or visit him is none of your concern.

621
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,630
- Stop...
- Young Ok.

622
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,070
I'll start the car.

623
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,090
It looks so heavy.

624
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,230
You can't take all this in a taxi.

625
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,590
Is this all there is? Shall I take it to the car?

626
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,670
Come on out.

627
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,160
Stay right here until you hear a clap.

628
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,990
I'll unload everything, okay?

629
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:32,950
Whatever.

630
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,550
My goodness.

631
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,390
You never listen, do you?

632
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,560
I'll be in the sauna across the road.

633
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,870
Call me when you're done.

634
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,030
It's fine.

635
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,470
Let's go.

636
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,480
You came all the way here. Say hello.

637
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,270
Watch him eat your food.

638
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,790
I said it's fine. I want to go home.

639
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,060
Are you ashamed to see him?

640
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,700
Are you embarrassed to see your son?

641
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,060
What are you talking about?

642
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,180
Go on inside.

643
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,900
Young Ok.

644
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,970
Stop it, will you?

645
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,950
You deserve a beating.

646
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:08,520
- Go on inside.
- I don't want to.

647
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,930
Let's just go.

648
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,020
- I told you already.
- Shin Young Ok.

649
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Is it you?

651
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,140
Let's go.

652
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,740
Bye.

653
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,340
What are you doing here?

654
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,740
Jik.

655
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,740
There are some scary people out there.

656
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,660
Someone might hurt you.

657
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,740
You're the scariest-looking person here.

658
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,780
Who would hurt me? I'm not a kid.

659
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,260
Well, you know...

660
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,260
I'm not saying someone will,

661
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,080
but I'm scared someone might try to hit you with a car.

662
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,320
Let's go. Shouldn't you be at work?

663
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,660
I will go back after I walk you home.

664
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,280
Let's go.

665
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,460
Stop right there.

666
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,420
Who's the weirdo?

667
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,380
What weirdo? Me?

668
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,380
- Why are you here?
- To see you.

669
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,780
Why did you ignore me? Can't you text me back?

670
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,940
Do you have to ignore me this much?

671
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
I thought you hurt your fingers or something.

672
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,980
We aren't close enough to text each other.

673
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,500
Are you putting up a wall?

674
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,500
I thought we'd gotten quite close.

675
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,340
- No?
- Not at all.

676
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,500
- Dream on.
- Who are you, lady?

677
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
Why are you holding my Jik's hand?

678
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Me?

679
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,140
We're close enough to hold hands.

680
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,620
- What?
- And we're close enough to do this.

681
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,870
What?

682
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,480
I can even...

683
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,340
- What?
- do this.

684
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,700
So tell me, who are you?

685
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
Why are you...

686
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,860
I like him, okay?

687
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,020
No! No. No.

688
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,380
No.

689
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,220
Cut. Okay.

690
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,660
Well done, everyone. You did great.

691
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,440
Let's pack up.

692
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

693
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,900
Thank you.

694
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,460
Mister.

695
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,220
You don't have to overdo it like this.

696
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,740
I'll do it.

697
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,020
Aren't we dating?

698
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,860
Don't try too hard.

699
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,460
You can work for people other than Seo Yoon Hoo.

700
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,140
This should be illegal.

701
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,420
An engaged woman shouldn't be this pretty.

702
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,100
You're still charming.

703
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,960
Thanks so much for agreeing to be in the movie.

704
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,380
It's a great script.

705
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,220
I felt bad it was put aside due to the lack of funding.

706
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,260
So...

707
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,420
aren't you being...

708
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,860
too good of a fiancee?

709
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,220
Can't I be?

710
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,580
Who's the other actor?

711
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,260
It's not easy playing a psychopath.

712
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,560
Kim Soo Chan. He'll join the team tomorrow.

713
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,620
Really?

714
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,100
That's great.

715
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,440
He's not as big of a star as Joon Young,

716
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,020
but his acting's on par.

717
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,100
I heard he's a decent guy, too.

718
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,660
Joon Young's such a jerk that...

719
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,980
Is someone badmouthing me?

720
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,020
Why are you here?

721
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,060
To shoot a movie. With you.

722
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,420
I'm the psychopath.

723
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,820
You turned it down.

724
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,140
I'm not that irresponsible.

725
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,500
I finish up what I started.

726
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,220
I might be a jerk,

727
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,340
but I'm not as bad as you.

728
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,180
- You little...
- Yoon Hoo.

729
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,260
Answer your phone.

730
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,620
Yoon Hoo speaking.

731
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,820
Hi, Hye Jin. I'm in Namhae for a shoot.

732
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,260

I apologise for the intrusion. Bye.

737
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,940
