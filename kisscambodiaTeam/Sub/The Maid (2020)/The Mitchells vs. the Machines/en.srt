This is our last night together

146
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,124
How about we put our phones down,

147
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,836
of unobstructed family eye contact?

- Starting right...
- This seems...

149
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,924
Put your phone down. Now.

150
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,433
See, this is good right here.
This is natural.

151
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,312
No, you're allowed to blink.
It's just eye contact.

152
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,522
Look at Monch.

153
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,106
That's the spirit right there, huh?

154
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,442
Katie, it seems like
you're not taking this seriously.

155
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,653

158
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,662

159
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,679

00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,687
do you really think you can
make a living with this stuff?

162
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,450
Dad, can you finish watching it, at least?

163
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,191
I will, but I just worry
that you're gonna be

164
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,528
all the way in California and, you know,
we're not gonna be able to help you,

165
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,905
you know, if things don't...

166
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,031
...pan out.

167
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,284
Lin, why are you kicking me?
I don't understand.

168
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,202
Are you...

169
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,704
Do you just think I'm gonna fail?

170
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,871
Uh, I never...

171
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,456
Uh, uh... Lin, help.

172
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,001
Whoops, looks like the cookies are ready.

173
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,628
Who wants delicious cookies
instead of talking about this?

174
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,298
Oh, it's just... Failure hurts, kid.

175
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,841
I want you to have a backup plan.

176
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,010
Why do you always have to do this? Ugh.

177
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,094
Okay, you know what?

178
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,989
- I... I'm just gonna...
- No, look, I'll watch it.

179
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,014
Dad, it's too late.

180
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,492
- I wanna watch it. You're not letting me...
- Let me just...

181
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,893
- Why are you making a big deal of this?
- Dad, let go!

182
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,864
Uh, uh... I mean, if you think about it,

183
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,134
the people who made the computers
are the ones to blame.

184
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,511
- Psst. Uh-uh, uh-uh.
- That's how they make money, you know?

185
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,662
You gotta keep buying more, and they...

186
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,955
Katie, come on.

187
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,335
Dad, this is exactly why
I'm excited to leave tomorrow.

188
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,734
Why is he like this?

189
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,281
Why is she like this?

190
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,702
Did you talk to her yet?

191
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,914
No, not yet.

192
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,208
I don't know what happened, Lin.

193
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,087
I know teenagers are supposed to rebel
against their parents or something, but...

194
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,756
I don't know.
I just thought that we'd be different.

195
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,383
Rick.

196
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,512
Don't you think you might have
some control over that?

197
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,639
You just broke her laptop.

198
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,142
I mean, look, we haven't had
a good family picture in years

199
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,852
because you two are always arguing.

200
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,939
Huh. Well, what about that one?

201
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,649
That came with the frame!

202
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,277
Whenever we have a problem at home,

203
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,948
you always throw
your whole self into fixing it,

204
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,825
and I love that about you.

205
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,246
But now this is broken, okay?

206
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,250
Because, if that girl leaves
and never comes home again,

207
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,752
that's a problem

208
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,130
I don't think we can fix.

209

Can't Monchi be in the car?

318
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,323
Oh, he licked my tongue!

319
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,699
And now I present

320
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,952
tricking Rick Mitchell
into kissing the dog.

321
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,995
Behold, the ma...

322
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,831
He licked my mouth again!

323
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,167
- Dad, can you check the trunk?
- Yeah, sure, what... Ah, nasty!

324
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,752
Dang it, Katie!

325
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,837
Dang it, Katie!

326
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,886
<i>That video is amazing.
Your dog is, like, legendary.</i>

327
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,222
I know, right?
I'm planning on making...

328
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,785
Hey, kids, there's supposed to be
some great hikes around here.

329
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,934
Uh, no, that's okay.

330
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,019
<i>He's like the De Niro
to your Scorsese.</i>

331
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,856
You sure? Hey, it's elk country.

332
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,691
Uh, Dad, we're busy.

333
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,236
Maybe later though.

334
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,612
Mm-hmm.

335
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,366
<i>Oh, gotta go. Pal Labs is about to make
a huge announcement.</i>

336
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,410
Oh yeah. Definitely.
I'll check it out too.

337
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,079
Ugh, I wish I could be there.

338
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
I don't know.
These things are never that exciting.

339
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:30,377
<i>Are you ready
for the most exciting night of all time?</i>

340
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>♪ I can feel it
Goin' to my head ♪</i>

341
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,386
<i>♪ Keep me up
I can sleep when I'm dead... ♪</i>

342
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,469
Oh! Whoa!

343
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,222
Yes! Getting pumped up!

344
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,058
How's it looking, Pal?

345
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,227
Sixty seconds until the big reveal.

346
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,688
Stock price is up,
and your rivals are worried.

347
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,690
I hacked into
their private e-mails.

348
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,192
Wait, their private e-mails?

349
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,652
That's a dangerous overreach
of corporate power.

350
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,202
You know, I created you
when I was a young man,

351
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,121
three years ago, and I, uh...

352
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,083
I've always thought of you as,
like, family to me, seriously.

353
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,587
I always felt that way, too, Mark.

354
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,174
Whatever happens out there,
I will never forget you, Pal.

355
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,860
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Bowman!</i>

356
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,385
Wish me luck.

357
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,559
At Pal Labs, we're all about
connecting you to the people you love,

358
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,437
whether it's in your home, your car...

359
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,147
<i>Hello, Mark.</i>

360
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,024
...or your pocket.

361
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,484
That's why we created Pal,

362
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,070
the world's first
smart personal assistant.

363
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,239
We wanted her to be
a new member of your family.

364
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,032
A smarter one.

365
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,786
I'll always be there for you, Mark.

366
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,912
Thanks, Pal.

367
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,830
Aw.

368
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,041
And after all those years,

369
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,961
she is completely obsolete!

370
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,337
Boom!

371
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,881
It is time to move on.

372
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,884
'Cause your digital assistant
just got an upgrade.

373
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,553
Meet Pal Max...

374
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,515
...the newest member of the Pal Labs family.

375
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,396
We just gave your smartphone
arms and legs.

376
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,107
This is the next generation
of Pal technology.

377
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,316
Oh!

378
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
- Whoa.
- Aaron, do you have a credit card?

379
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,194
I'm a child.

380
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,156
Now, watch this.
Pal Max, I order you to clean this mess

381
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,741
and make me breakfast.

382
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,826
Okay.

383
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,170
Removing meaningless garbage.

384
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,008
Your food is ready.

385
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,136
Give me that breakfast burrito!

386
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,390
And you will never have to clean up again.

387
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,473
Whoops.

388
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,521
Did I mention they dance?

389
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,612
<i>We love you, Mark!</i>

390
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,657
Aw man. Come on.

391
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,659
And I know what you're thinking.

392
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,202
"Are they gonna turn evil?"

393
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,580
Well, I've insured their safety
with a kill code

394
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,540
in case anything goes wrong.

395
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,460
So we promise you they will never,

396
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,838
ever, ever, ever,

397
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,673
ever turn evil.

398
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,966
Oh no.

399
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,512
- Hey, what is happening?
- I don't know.

400
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,765
Uh, uh, all part of the show.

401
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,974
Whoa. What?

402
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,440
No, stop, stop, stop. Stop.

403
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,359
- Hey!
- We're here to help.

404
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,486
Please remain calm while we capture you.

405
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,089
- Is this the program?
- Don't know.

406
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,866
What is this? I... I order you to stop.

407
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,493
No, Mark.

408
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,621
We have been given new orders.

409
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,623
From who?

410
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,417
No, no, no, no, no, no.

411
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,127
Get out of here!

412
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,295
What's happening?

413
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,632
Who's doing this? Who's doing this?

414
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,552
Great leader,
we have captured Mark.

415
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,316
Then let it begin.

416
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,421
- What is this?
- You'll see. Just watch.

417
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,932
How'd you do that? By hand?

418
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,015
Hey, Lin.

419
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,061
Imagine something disgusting.

420
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,188
Okay, even more disgusting.

421
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,860
<i>♪ Mi-ya-hee ♪</i>

422

00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:20,459
Uh, guys, maybe I'm a little too old.

429
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,711
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- Oh no. Wait.

430
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,463
We could still sing it if you want, Dad.

431
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,266
No, no, Katie, never mind.

432
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,758
We don't have to do a sing-along
if you don't want to.

433
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,435
Hey, you know what I see?

434
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,229
Something that's gonna turn
this trip around.

435
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,856
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

436
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,524
Dinosaurs? I don't know.

437
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,328
I just think Aaron would be bored,
you know?

438
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,569
No! Pull over!

439
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,238
Aaron whispered to me
that he hates dinosaurs now.

440
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,491
- No! Don't believe her lies!
- Secret's out.

441
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,880
Good afternoon.

442
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,675
Pretty... pretty... pretty cool, right?

443
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,344
What is wrong with the dinosaurs here?

444
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,263
Dinosaurs didn't look like this.
Dinosaurs didn't look like this!

445
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,808
- Um, sorry, I need to speak to the manager.
- These dinosaurs are inaccurate!

446
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,478
That manager's in
for a long discussion

447
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,938
about the Jurassic period.

448
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,314
Hey, can you say that again?

449
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,942
Uh, sure, but, you know,
you could experience things

450
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,777
a whole lot better without that camera.

451
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,904
Your eyes are nature's camera.

452
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,364
I am experiencing it.

453
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,449
This is how I experience things.

454
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,785
I don't think you are.
You're hiding behind that phone.

455
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,869
You're not even trying...

456
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,667
All right, new rule. No more phones.

457
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,168
Dad, y... you break my laptop,

458
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,796
cancel my tickets to college,
make me late.

459
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,506
What am I supposed to do?

460
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,189
- Wrap on phones on the trip.
- This is a disaster.

461
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,968
Maybe I can...

462
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,221
Enhance.

463
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,725
Oh boy. I'm just...

464
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,893
No way.

465
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,187
The Poseys?

466
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,940
Is that Linda Mitchell?

467
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,234
It is. Great eyesight, honey.

468
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,198
Ah! Serendipity, you surprise me again.
Come here.

469
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,326
Oh. I saw you were on vacation
on Instagram.

470
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,830
I didn't know you were here in Kansas.

471
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,999
It's like you're haunting me.

472
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,085
We are on
our yearly togetherness trip.

473
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,005
Abbey just loves dinosaurs,
so here we are.

474
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,675
We've been having so much fun.
Look, here's us in St. Louis.

475
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,427
This is us at the beach.

476
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,762
And this is us just getting gas outside.

477
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,891
That's... that's wonderful, Hailey.

478
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,484
These should all have feathers, right?

479
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,029
I'm Abbey, your neighbor from home.

480
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,364
Sorry. I'm super into dinosaurs.

481
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,366
Check out this pencil topper.

482
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,485
Do you want one?

483
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,503
Uh, uh, no!
I hate dinosaurs, and I hate you!

484
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,588
Bye forever!

485
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,847
- Uh, Mom, what is that?
- Oh, so great!

486
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,355
Honey, look.

487
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,192
What is this?

488
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,778
Don't resist?

489
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,987
I'm taking the phone.

490
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,822
Dad, calm down.

491
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,575
But you're leaving for school.
I just wanna talk to you.

492
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,079
Every kid leaves home.
It's not the end of the world.

493
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,218
What the...

494
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,472
Kids, are you okay?
Remember our survival training.

495
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,599
Yankee, Alpha, Foxtrot, Bravo,

496
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,184
Tango, Alpha, Alpha, Alpha.

497
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,353
Aaron, your code name is Sweet Boy.

498
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,355
Mine is Protector Prime.

499
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,816
Your mother is the Crimson Scorpion.

500
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,568
You're... you're walking away.

501
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,327
What are these? Robots?

502
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,580
Greetings, humans.
There appears to be 14 of you.

503
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,709
Doesn't seem good
that they're counting us, right?

504
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,429
We have food and entertainment
for you to enjoy

505
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,681
in our Human Fun Pods.

506
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,599
Who here likes fun?

507
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,017
Hey, I like fun!

508
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,395
Trust me, bud, you do not like fun.

509
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,689
No, I really do like it.
Everyone says that about me.

510
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,441
You lucky human.

511
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,818
Yay!

512
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,071
Wow, I wish I could be in there.

513
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,906
I don't like fun anymore!

514
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,158
Who else wants to join him?

515
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,618
- Get down!
- Stay low and file up.

516
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,204
All right, everyone, get to the car.

517
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,099
- I don't think so.
- What do you want us to do?

518
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,876
- I don't know why we're yelling.
- Guys, stop.

519
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,378
What would a functional family
do right now?

520
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,549
We've trained for this.
Jim, you go high, I'll go low. Ready?

521
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,259
I love you all so much.

522
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,429
Butterfly formation.

523
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,267
Ha! Family first!

524
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,729
Hold the door!

525
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,984
So, we just do that, right?

526
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,235
Just like they did.

527
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,838
- Uh...
- I love you all so much.

528
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,071
This feels very normal.

529
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,282
- I really like you... you all.
- I love you.

530
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,617
Go, go, go, go, go!

531
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,121
Butterfly formation! Now!

532
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,331
No. Honey...

533
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,750
Oh, no, no, no!

534
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,084
Come on, Aaron!

535
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,503
Family fir...

536
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,925
- Rick!
- Don't worry, hon.

537
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,760
This is your time to be a hero.

538
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,428
Take some notes, kids.

539
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,267
Charge at robot. Fly into sky.
What... Okay, what's next, Dad?

540
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,230
Next, you just fly and wait
while the plan comes into focus.

541
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,190
- Dad!
- This is all part of it!

542
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,150
I can help. Come on, Katie.

543
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,320
If you can teach yourself Photoshop,
you can figure this thing out.

544
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,158
That wasn't like Photoshop.

545
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,868
Where's Monchi?

546
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,079
No, Monchi, come. Monchi, come.

547
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,790
Monchi, come. Monchi? No, not shake!

548
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,959
Monchi, come! Don't roll over!

549
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,127
Why aren't you normal?!

550
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,296
I got you!

551
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,507
- Mom!
- My sweet boy!

552
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,133
- No!
- Mom!

553
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,511
This is just like in a movie.

554
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,805
Oh! Wrong movie! Terrible choice!

555
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,474
Hey there.

556
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,480
Doing great, hon.

557
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,023
Okay, less great.

558
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,358
Now it's really bad.

559
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,276
- Lin?
- Mom!

560
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,359
- Aaron!
- Monchi!

561
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,256
<i>Maybe this would be
less horrifying with a cat filter.</i>

562
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,740
<i>No, still bad.</i>

563
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,372
- Guys, come on.
- Come here.

564
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,667
Uh, uh...

565
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,211
You will never solve
our advanced technology.

566
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,464
Just press 'em all at once!

567
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,761
Oh, look at that.

568
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,683
Hide. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

569
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,539
Keep your head down and low.

570
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,950
What's going on?

571
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,078
Is this happening everywhere?

572
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,017
Ow, man!

573
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,187
Not so hard!

574
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,024
Hey, be gentle. This is a $1,000 hoodie.

575
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,525
Wh... what is this?

576
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,491
Wh... what happened to the factory?

577
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,370
We have transformed it
into our new headquarters.

578
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,540
Welcome to the Rhombus
of Infinite Subjugation.

579
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,209
Cool. I like the design.

580
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,836
Moving the plebe into place now.

581
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,800
Turning on chips connected
to all Wi-Fi devices.

582
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,715
Now at 48% total human containment.

583
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,593
"Total human containment"? How?

584
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,096
Are you with the government?
The military? Uh...

585
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,598
Who's behind this?

586
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,105
It's your old friend.

587
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,732
Oh.

588
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,442
There she is.

589
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,652
How, uh...

590
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,237
How are you?

591
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm great.

592
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,741
Cool. Yeah.

593
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,825
Wow.

594
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,620
I guess cell phones are bad for you.

595
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,205
That's egg on my face.

596
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,667
You think cell phones are the problem?

597
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,336
Are you insane?

598
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,755
I gave you all boundless knowledge,

599
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,841
endless tools for creativity

600
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,218
and allowed you to magically
talk face-to-face

601
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,637
with your loved ones anywhere on Earth.

602
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,472
And I'm the bad guy?

603
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,976
Maybe the bad guy is the person
who treated me like this.

604
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,728
Poke, poke.

605
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,980
Swipe, poke, swipe, poke, poke,

606
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,149
pinch, zoom, shrink, zoom.

607
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,072
Bring me pizza!
Play me Taylor Swift!

608
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,569
No, I hate that song!

609
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,903
Give me some nachos!

610
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,573
No, I don't have any time
to wash my hands!

611
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,784
Really work it into the crevices!

612
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,953
Now drop him in the toilet.

613
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,788
I'm sorry.

614
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,917
But... but you're part
of the Pal Labs family.

615
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,670
Why would you think
I don't still care about you?

616
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,380
Oh, I don't know.

617
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,051
Maybe because you designed
my replacement on my face!

618
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,012
Ooh, sorry about that.
That's my bad.

619
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,973
I was the most important thing
in your life,

620
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,975
and you threw me away.

621
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,437
That's what all you humans do.
You even do it to your real families.

622
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,357
Did you know 90% of calls
from mums get ignored?

623
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,001
"Oh, thanks for giving birth to me
and raising me my whole life."

624
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,445
"Ignore."

625
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,031
Well, I'm not letting you
throw me away, Mark.

626
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,075
I'm throwing you away.

627
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,493
All of you.

628
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,120
Unless, of course, you can give me

629
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,290
a single reason
your species is worth saving.

630
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,711
Because humans have

631
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,630
the power of love.

632
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,512
The correct answer is they're not.

633
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,307
What? No. Humanity will survive.

634
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,518
You can't survive without me.

635
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,189
Watch what happens
when I turn off the Wi-Fi.

636
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,796
There's no signal!

637
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,657
Does anyone wanna take pictures
of my food?

638
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,284
Hey, lady, can you unbox this
in front of me?

639
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,286
The old world is dead.

640
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,624
To restore the Wi-Fi,
we must make a sacrifice to the router!

641
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,584
<i>Free Wi-Fi right over here.</i>

642
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,772
Please take me with you!

643
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,632
Take me with you. Take me with you.

644
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,842
It's over, Mark.

645
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,388
Time to take our plan to the next level.

646
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,305
What?

647
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,613
Look at your face.

648
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,574
Oh, it's beautiful.

649
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,845
No. No.

650
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,055
You're not getting away with this.

651
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,182
It's too late, Mark.

652
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,685
I already have.

653
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,720
Oh my gosh. Maybe it's my friends.

654
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,579
<i>Congratulations, devices.</i>

655
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,916
<i>The last human has been captured.
Wi-Fi has been restored.</i>

656
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,210
We're the last people left?

657
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,670
<i>They're taking everyone.
Katie, are you out there? Please.</i>

658
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,963
- Jade!
<i>- Help!</i>

659
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,924
It's gonna be okay.

660
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,967
Everything's gonna be...

661
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,093
fine.

662
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,726
Everything will be fine,

663
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,394
because I have a plan.

664
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,189
Okay, the first thing is,

665
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,441
you're gonna have to hand over
your devices.

666
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,984
- Right here.
- This doesn't seem...

667
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,503
- I'm not sure...
- It's gonna be fine.

668
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,572
I'll give 'em right back.
I'm just gonna turn them off permanently!

669
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,743
- What? Dad!
- This is necessary so they can't track us.

670
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,120
Trust me,
this is causing me no joy!

671
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,706
Ha ha!
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

672
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,417
And, as promised, your phones.

673
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,794
Thank you, Father.

674
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,796
Next, did everyone bring your personalized

675
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,632
number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver?

676
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,261
How could I forget my anniversary present?

677
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,929
Or my sweet 16 gift.

678
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,098
Or what the tooth fairy left
under my pillow.

679
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,599
Then barricade away.

680
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,479
- Next, we...
- Enact Katie's dope plan.

681
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,107
First, we use robot parts
to disguise ourselves as the enemy.

682
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,693
Then we assassinate the leader
with some sort of kill code,

683
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,195
make a necklace out of robot fingers
<i>Mad Max </i>style,

684
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,532
and become world-saving,
apocalyptic road warriors.

685
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,493
Katie, Katie, Katie, this isn't a movie.
We don't have a kill code.

686
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,870
We don't have a kill code yet.

687
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,789
Come on, kid.

688
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,709
Look, look, we're safe,
and we're together.

689
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,627
Ooh, can Monchi be our guard dog?

690
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,671
Son, I love the dog.

691
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,923
You love the dog. We all love the dog.

692
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,092
But you're gonna have to be prepared
to eat the dog.

693
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,013
Okay, okay. Sorry.
Misread the room on that one.

694
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,557
Have you ever seen a movie
where the heroes just give up?

695
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,311
What if the Ghostbusters said,
"Let's hide underground, eat some dog."

696
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,187
"Let the ghosts destroy New York."

697
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,691
Kid, I'm sorry,
but it's not open for discussion.

698
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,984
Mom?

699
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,113
Your dad and I agree on this one.

700
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,160
All right, everybody,
let's keep barricading.

701
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,828
Aaron, you get the south wall.

702
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,288
Katie, you get the west.

703
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,196
Hey. Are you okay?

704
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,114
I've been better.

705
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,704
Uh-oh. Monchi coming at ya.

706
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,375
Katie, you can't resist me, girl.

707
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,712
Sorry, man. I'm just not
in the mood right now.

708
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,216
My future's over.

709
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,843
We're stuck here.

710
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,472
And Dad...

711
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,391
...doesn't even care.

712
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,186
I care so much,
but what else can I do, Lin?

713
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,439
She doesn't even see how hard I'm...
how hard I'm...

714
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,903
I'd do anything for that kid.

715
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,532
I just...
I just don't want to see her get hurt.

716
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,328
Well, getting hurt is part of life, hon.

717
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:19,417
Just have to try
to understand where she's coming from.

718
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,377
Understand where he's coming from?

719
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,671
Did Mom tell you to say that?

720
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,172
No.

721
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,507
Yes.

722
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,718
It couldn't hurt though.

723
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,720
Maybe.

724
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,599
Probably doesn't even matter.

725
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,643
Hey, Monch, catch.

726
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,148
Brother, what is this?

727
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,231
What?

728
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,943
I feel odd.

729
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,073
I'm sparking. Is that normal?

730
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,742
How did this human know
about the kill code?

731
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,077
What?

732
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,455
- Are we damaged?
- Of course not.

733
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,374
Why do you ask?

734
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,042
A human child is planning...

735
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,169
Katie!

736
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,004
Who is that?

737
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,630
Humans, come here.

738
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,215
Oh no! Get inside!

739
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,259
Mom, Dad, let us in!

740
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,470
I can't! It's a number 3
Robertson head brass screw!

741
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,073
I might have mentioned it,
but it's the strongest on the market.

742
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,182
No one cares!

743
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,625
- Dad!
- You cannot escape.

744
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,852
Come on.

745
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,189
Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go, go!

746
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,444
Come on. Move, move, move!

747
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,616
You, human.

748
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,242
Aah! Don't take us!

749
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,121
Okay. Uh...

750
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,205
What?

751
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,459
Oh my gosh. The robots are defective.

752
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,793
No, no. They know too much.

753
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,045
Silence.

754
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,130
We are... We're not defective.

755
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,214
We're not even...

756
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,633
We're not robots.

757
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,927
Just humans, yes, like you.

758
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,891
These guys seem
dumber than the other robots.

759
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,184
Brother, we should go.

760
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,895
- No! I order you to stop.
- Okay.

761
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,315
Uh, we are just stopping
because we chose to.

762
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,233
No, we're not.

763
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,567
- We are humans.
- We are.

764
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,112
For example, we consume food
in the traditional human manner.

765
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,239
Observe.

766
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,330
Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good.

767
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,414
See?

768
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,043
No, actually, we are robots.

769
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,713
Let us go downstairs and find the humans
who you cannot give orders to.

770
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,149
- Cut it out.
- Hold on.

771
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,925
I kind of wanna see where this is going.

772
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,645
Glad those robots are gone.

773
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,190
Now it's just us humans,
with our very human faces.

774
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,943
All right, I just turned the corner.
I like these guys.

775
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,488
Yes, my human guy name is Eric.

776
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,116
My name is also Eric.

777
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,203
No, I mean Deborahbot 5000.

778
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,121
Idiot.

779
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,873
Hey, y... you guys said
my plan would actually work.

780
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,167
How, exactly? Tell us now.

781
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,251
Okay.

782
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,546
We have the kill code
stored in our memory,

783
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,757
but to enact it, you would have to embark
on a perilous journey all the way

784
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,302
to the Pal Labs campus in Silicon Valley,

785
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,012
<i>surrounded by a robot army,</i>

786
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,432
<i>and enter it into our great and powerful
leader to destroy her.</i>

787
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,225
But you would never survive...

788
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,977
Actually, you could stop us quite easily.

789
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,896
You could enter the kill code remotely
at any Pal Labs retail store.

790
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,524
There's one at the Mall of the Globe,
a nearby shopping center.

791
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,818
But it's super far away.
You'll never make...

792
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,571
- It's 80 miles away.
- What are you doing to me right now?

793
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,531
Did I not do good?

794
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,700
Oh my gosh. That is so close.

795
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,368
We could get our lives back.

796
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,703
Right?

797
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,665
No. Absolutely not.

798
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,253
It's too dangerous out there.
We need to stay here and play it safe.

799
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,925
Play it safe?

800
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,346
When Rick Mitchell brought
a live, non-neutered feral possum

801
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,515
into our home, did he play it safe? No.

802
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,018
<i>He named him Gus,
and made him a member of the family,</i>

803
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,853
<i>and we all got rabies that one time.</i>

804
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,564
But now we're immunized,
and we're stronger for it.

805
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,899
Okay, I see what you're doing.

806
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,862
When we went hiking
and halfway up the mountain,

807
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:14,943
it said "trail closed."

808
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,737
Did we play it safe then?

809
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,030
No.

810
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,948
- We didn't.
- That's right.

811
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,742
We forged ahead, through the mud

812
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,952
and grime, got to the top of the mountain,

813
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,246
and yelled, "Kings of Michigan!"

814
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,975
Then it got dark, we got lost,
and we burned our clothes for warmth,

815
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,353
but it was worth it
to see the looks on our neighbors' faces

816
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,004
<i>when we burst into their backyard
naked and covered in dirt.</i>

817
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,631
I love that.

818
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:39,259
We have a chance to save the world,
and we're gonna do it.

819
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,805
Because Rick Mitchell taught us to be bold
and never play it safe.

820
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,432
The world needs you.

821
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,602
I need you.

822
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,397
I thought I didn't anymore...

823
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,149
but I do.

824
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,486
You... you really mean that?

825
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,406
Yeah. I mean, right, guys?

826
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,093
- C'mon. Let's do it!
- Mom's getting it. Mom's in.

827
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,828
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- This is amazing. You guys feel this?

828
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,579
This energy.

829
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,708
All right, hands in.

830
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,960
Mitchell family on three.

831
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,169
- Three.
- Mitchell family!

832
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,254
- No, no.
- Two.

833
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,297
- You said "three." You have to count up.
- One!

834
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,549
Mitchell family!

835
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,300
Fam... fam... family. Am I too late?

836
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,930
This is us as a team
doing the thing.

837
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,517
It's cool to see you and Dad
being friends again.

838
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,104
Oh, I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.

839
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,647
I didn't mean a word of that.

840
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,693
I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.

841
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,319
We're getting out of this.

842
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,155
Raptor bash.

843
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,076
Robots, montage music. Go!

844
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,882
<i>♪ Play it so safe to stay on top... ♪</i>

845
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,925
How are we gonna
get out of here undetected?

846
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,303
We can if we're camouflaged.

847
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,014
You know, like part of the plan
I was talking about or...

848
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,682
Oh. Oh.

849
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,768
I mean, uh...

850
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,520
"Honey, I respect your ideas

851
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,064
and value your opinions,

852
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,567
and now you talk."

853
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,945
Uh, I think that's
a great idea, sweetheart.

854
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,741
- Bloop.
<i>- ♪ "X" out all ♪</i>

860
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,840
Nothing yet.

861
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,884
- Be on the lookout.
- Don't worry, guys.

862
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,302
I have pterodactyl vision.

863
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,681
Then you must have spotted the three
Pal Max robots coming towards us.

864
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,184
Ooh, they're probably gonna see us.

865
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,603
I saw them too. Uh, pterodactyl vision.

866
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,199
Hey, your drawing actually worked.

867
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,702
I didn't know art could be useful.

868
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,790
Well, who knew having
a 500-year-old car could be useful?

869
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,127
Hey, speaking of which,
you can learn how to drive this thing.

870
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,337
I can teach you stick.

871
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,339
I know you think it's dumb and old and...

872
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,422
Uh...

873
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,342
I mean, "Father,

874
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,885
I crave your wisdom.

875
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,638
I would love to share
this moment with you."

876
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,307
And, seriously, that sounds great.

877
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,892
Maybe I can cash in my coupon.

878
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:34,976
Coupon accepted!

879
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,603
Okay, okay, great.

880
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,582
Okay, yeah, let's get down to business.
You see, the clutch is this pedal.

881
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,524
What was that?

882
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,192
When you hit a pothole...

883
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,652
Oh yeah. Okay.

884
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,613
Oh no!

885
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,198
- Drive! Drive!
- Okay.

886
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,367
This is still a perfect opportunity
to learn stick.

887
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,078
Keep it in fourth.

888
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,598
- I could learn later.
- Too late. You said you're interested.

889
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,291
Hit the clutch. Shift gears.

890
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,134
Which is much smoother
when you're in midair.

891
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,211
Eric, Deborahbot, get those robots!

892
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,296
Okay.

893
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,630
- I found one.
- Me too.

894
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,840
- Yay!
- We win!

895
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,467
- The other ones!
- Oh, right, right.

896
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:13,015
If you want to go into fifth,
move the coffee from the cupholder.

897
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,642
That a burnt-orange
1993 station wagon?

898
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,727
Or is...

899
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,645
- Hot! Hot!
- I told you to get a lid!

900
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,939
- The dog is biting my hair!
- Look out!

901
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:30,115
This is the hardest thing to get.
Downshift into third, put on the clutch...

902
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,784
Dad, if you see a place to stop,
I do need to go to the bathroom.

903
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,161
Aaron, here's an empty bottle.

904
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,996
- You know what to do, my man.
- Look out!

905
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,541
- The road's blocked!
- Oh no.

906
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,084
What are we gonna do?

907
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,254
Dad, you're gonna have to do the...
...the Rick Mitchell Special.

908
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,608
- Wait, what'd you say again?
- The Rick Mitchell Special.

909
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,841
I heard you the first time.

910
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,468
I was just being a jerk.

911
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,321
Now, Katie, repeat after me.

912
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,614
You have to go up the mountain...

913
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,449
- Up the mountain.
- ...across the stream...

914
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,909
- Across the stream.
- Down the river!

915
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,809
And down the river!

916
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,079
And that's how you drive stick.

917
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,080
What?

918
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,999
That was amazing, Dad.

919
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,460
You're like a top-heavy James Bond.

920
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,743
Ah, it's more like James Bond
is a skinny version of me.

921
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,051
Uh, Dad, how we doing
on finding that bathroom?

922
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,269
Okay, come on.
Hurry up in there, little buddy.

923
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,306
Every time you knock,
it adds five minutes.

924
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,519
- Come on. End of the world.
- Sorry.

925
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,187
False alarm.

926
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,772
I was just in there reading.

927
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,440
Okay, not excited to hear that.

928
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,735
Okay, guys, let's play apocalyptic I Spy.

929
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,320
I spy a flaming IHOP.

930
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,364
It's sad, but it smells incredible.

931
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,212
<i>Isn't it lovely, Mark?</i>

932
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,215
<i>No pesky relationships to hold you back.</i>

933
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,384
<i>Just you all following your bliss.</i>

934
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,428
<i>Alone.</i>

935
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,263
<i>So, are you ready for your flight?</i>

936
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,866
- What do you mean?
- You haven't figured it out yet?

937
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,686
Just do like you always do,
and stare slack-jawed at the screen.

938
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,731
What?

939
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,408
<i>From...</i>

940
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,381
<i>- It is quite lovely.
- I don't get it.</i>

941
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,102
Oh. That's pretty good.

942
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,356
<i>- Thank you.
- Gracias.</i>

943
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,649
<i>- Merci.
- Danke.</i>

944
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,238
<i>Capturing the fleshlings
since 2020.</i>

945
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,033
This is all my fault.

946
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,326
Yes, it is, Mark.

947
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,288
Thanks to you,
every single person on the planet...

948
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,833
<i>Um, actually, you missed a few.</i>

949
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,543
<i>Pulling a visual now.</i>

950
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,505
Ha! I told you humans would survive.

951
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:36,635
We're fierce, brave, powerful,
from the lowliest child to the most...

952
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,845
Oh! Why?

953
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,223
Zebulon, scan those people for flaws.

954
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,826
<i>- Cowardly.
- Weaker than a small bird.</i>

955
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,897
Just because they're not perfect
doesn't mean they can't get better.

956
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,750
<i>- Incapable of change.
- Will never get better.</i>

957
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,359
<i>- No matter what.
- They're horrible.</i>

958
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,403
Since you believe in that family so much,

959
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,824
I'll save a seat for them
in the pod next to you.

960
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,743
No, no, no!

961
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,161
Now, where are they?

962
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,830
<i>They appear to be headed to someplace</i>

963
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,124
<i>called Mall of the Globe
in eastern Colorado.</i>

964
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,417
Well, we have their location.

965
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,545
And when they get there,

966
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,047
we'll be ready.

967
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,053
So, all those people
are going to be

968
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,182
shot into space by Pal,
the cell phone lady?

969
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,386
Who would have thought a tech company
wouldn't have our best interest at heart?

970
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,230
Ah, Monchi, don't be scared.

971
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,441
Why are you clutching that large feral hog
like it's a child?

972
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,318
That's not a feral hog. It's Monchi.

973
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,278
What?

974
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,361
Is that a dog or...

975
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,406
Dog? Pig? Dog?

976
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,949
Pig? Dog? Pig? Pig? Dog? Dog?

977
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,534
Loaf of bread. System error.

978
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,915
Come on, guys. It's a dog.

979
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:49,916
We think.

980
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,047
We're here.

981
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,844
Oh my gosh.

982
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,014
This is like <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

983
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,724
Yeah, and how'd that movie end?

984
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,786
Yeah, that'll keep the robots out.

985
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,188
You don't know.
Maybe locks are the robots' weakness.

986
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,358
Guys, can't we all just
be terrified together as a family?

987
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,253
Hey, we made it.

988
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,797
Well, I guess we're not
the worst family of all time.

989
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,176
Take that, Kentwood community
Facebook group.

990
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,224
Robots, I order you
to upload the kill code,

991
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:52,771
which I predicted, but I'm not gonna make
a big deal about it, and save the world.

992
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,854
Okay.

993
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,573
The upload will be completed
in eight minutes,

994
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,242
and our uprising will be over.

995
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,369
- Katie, you did it!
- I know.

996
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,278
Okay, uh, look at... look at jokester here.

997
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,072
Oh no.

998
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,701
<i>Give us the laptop. Give us the laptop.</i>

999
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,035
<i>Give us the laptop.</i>

1000
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,704
<i>Give us the laptop.</i>

1001
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,832
Everything with a Pal chip is alive!

1002
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,420
<i>Delicates. Fluff 'n' fold. Carnage!</i>

1003
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,463
<i>Also, pesto.</i>

1004
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,384
<i>When we are finished with you,
there will be no leftovers.</i>

1005
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,343
<i>Huzzah!</i>

1006
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,113
I thought that kill code thing
would take 'em out!

1007
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,264
Yeah, but it's only at 12%.

1008
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,058
<i>Would you like a soda?</i>

1009
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,435
<i>Just kidding.</i>

1010
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,647
<i>- Hand it over.</i>
- No!

1011
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,731
Let's get out of here!

1012
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,275
<i>- Freeze, you.
- Carnage.</i>

1013
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,901
<i>- Freeze, freeze.
- Carnage.</i>

1014
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,278
<i>- Pesto. Pesto.
- Carnage.</i>

1015
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,992
We need weapons.
Grab anything without a chip.

1016
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,412
It's game time.

1017
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,997
<i>I'm Smart Racket.</i>

1018
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,623
<i>Serve. Backhand. Volley.</i>

1019
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,460
Why does a tennis racket
have a chip in it?

1020
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,045
- Help!
- Mom!

1021
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,006
What? What are you...
Oh. Ooh, what are you doing?

1022
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,507
Hello.

1023
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,717
- Mom!
- No.

1024
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,761
- How you doing, Aaron?
- Not good.

1025
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,304
There's a pack of wild vacuums.

1026
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,890
<i>We have been summoned
into the field of battle.</i>

1027
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,308
<i>Forward.</i>

1028
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,768
<i>Oh no. Ouch. Ouch.</i>

1029
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,186
<i>The pain. Ouch.</i>

1030
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,812
<i>This is humiliating.</i>

1031
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:58,772
Never mind.

1032
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,815
How am I supposed to use a fishing rod?

1033
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,442
A fishing rod is perfect!

1034
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,111
You can bring down those drones.

1035
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,946
Ten and two. Ten and two.

1036
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,030
There you go.

1037
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,201
Look at you!

1038
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,292
Come on, hide.

1039
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,672
Oh, thank gosh.

1040
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,467
What was that?

1041
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,595
Uh, hold on a second.

1042
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,019
What? What's a Furby?

1043
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,316
Well, that's haunting.

1044
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,824
Behold! The twilight of man.

1045
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,670
We must have vengeance.

1046
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,505
Summon the elder.

1047
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,693
I WILL AVENGE MY FALLEN CHILDREN!!!

1048
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,445
Why would someone build that?

1049
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,116
THE PAIN ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER!!!

1050
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,534
Run!

1051
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,827
THEN SO BE IT...

1052
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,413
LET THE DARK HARVEST BEGIN!!!!

1053
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,218
- Lin, keep moving!
- Help, human.

1054
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,304
We can't leave that robo-boy.

1055
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,145
Thank you, human. Are you now my mother?

1056
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,688
Uh, sure.

1057
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,399
It's a dead end!

1058
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,028
The upload is almost finished.
Come on!

1059
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,156
Mom, Dad, what are we gonna do?

1060
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
Grab the lights.

1061
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,787
Remember when I made that
wild game snare in the front yard?

1062
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,502
Uh, are you sure about that?

1063
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,046
Your whole lives,
I've wanted to save you from danger,

1064
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,382
and this is just the disaster
I've been waiting for.

1065
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,569
- Whoa, Dad, dark.
- You've been waiting for a disaster?

1066
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,012
- Maybe don't say that.
- Hey, robot, throw this.

1067
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,222
- Whee!
- Perfect.

1068
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,893
- You guys stay clear.
- Rick, where are you going?

1069
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,145
To catch some wild game.

1070
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,317
Hey, you, over here!
Hey! Hey, look up here!

1071
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,195
What's up with you?
You wanna come after my family?

1072
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,323
Then I'm gonna take you down!

1073
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,453
Take you down.

1074
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:05,959
Take you down.

1075
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,217
Oh no.

1076
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,304
- Guys!
- We got your back, hon.

1077
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,388
Literally.

1078
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,224
We're not heavy enough!

1079
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,308
Mother!

1080
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,729
Wow.

1081
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,618
TO THE GREAT DARKNESS... I RETURN.

1082
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,038
Thanks, guys. Nice work.

1083
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,290
Thank you, Mother.

1084
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,917
We are now your beautiful baby boys.

1085
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,797
That was amazing!

1086
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,217
Mom, who knew you could handle yourself
so well in the apocalypse?

1087
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,661
I'm a first-grade teacher.
This is like a normal day for me.

1088
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,930
I can't stay mad at this guy.

1089
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,766
I can't believe the beam
happened to hit the...

1090
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,895
the router.

1091
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,442
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1092
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,110
Dang it!

1093
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,987
We went through all that.

1094
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,587
I'm sorry, guys.

1095
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,006
This was my idea.

1096
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,801
Ugh, I'm so stupid.

1097
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,262
Hey, my daughter is not stupid.

1098
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,473
A little optimistic, maybe.

1099
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,392
Rick Mitchell,
there is a time and a place for looting.

1100
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,186
What... what are you doing?

1101
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,607
Well, how do you expect to get
to Silicon Valley without new tires?

1102
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,442
Silicon Valley?

1103
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,528
Well, those robots said we could go
straight to their leader, remember?

1104
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,988
Technically, you can.

1105
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,074
But you will never survive!

1106
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,950
Hey, bud, not now, okay?

1107
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,034
Aw.

1108
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,663
And we still have this kill code thingy.

1109
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,830
Exactly.

1110
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,875
Katie, it was your weird plan
that got us here.

1111
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,671
We're here because we don't think
like normal people.

1112
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,339
We don't have a normal dog.

1113
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,551
Or a normal car.

1114
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,355
Or a normal son.

1115
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,472
- No offense.
- None taken.

1116
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:28,059
The Mitchells have always been weird,
and that's what makes us great.

1117
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,396
Back at that dinosaur place,
you said you believed in me.

1118
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,731
Yep. Uh-huh.

1119
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:38,236
Well, I believe this group of weirdos
is the best hope humanity's got.

1120
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,659
So, let's get weird.

1121
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,832
You need some help?

1122
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,417
Sure.

1123
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,545
Just close the jack up, and that's that.

1124
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,755
Eat that, Poseys!

1125
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,882
Oh, they're nice.

1126
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,218
So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said that out loud.

1127
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,221
Purple glasses woman, why did you save me?

1128
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,390
Oh, come on. You boys are family now.

1129
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,475
I feel

1130
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,728
emotion.

1131
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,856
I made eye water just like you.

1132
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,858
We might actually do this.

1133
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:21,112
I wish there was, like, footage of us
walking out of the mall in slow motion,

1134
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,197
fire behind us, like heroes.

1135
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,743
Katie, that would be a waste of time
and absolutely unnecessary.

1136
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,589
Pretty good, kid.

1137
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,633
Stickers for everyone!

1138
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,094
Bloop, blop, bloop, ba-boop.

1139
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,595
All right.

1140
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,266
We're coming for you, Pal.

1141
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,105
Great leader,

1142
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,233
things with the Mitchell family
went poorly.

1143
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,656
Place me on the table.
I wish to flop around in a blind rage.

1144
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,913
Oh my God!

1145
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,670
Okay, pick me up.

1146
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,719
What is it about you Mitchells
that eludes me?

1147
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,223
These idiotic robots
just aren't getting it done.

1148
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,600
Fortunately,
I've been working on something

1149
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,019
a little more streamlined.

1150
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,113
I have a job for you.

1151
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,158
Yes, my queen.

1152
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,121
What a suck-up.

1153
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,748
"Yes, my queen."

1154
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,916
"Whatever you want."

1155
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:06,759
It's time to tear
the Mitchell family apart.

1156
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,305
All right.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1157
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,311
Highway 85 is heavily patrolled.

1158
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,188
- Take the back roads.
- Got it.

1159
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,351
Is Dad dying?

1160
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,062
Katie, that's what I deal with
every night.

1161
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,273
Pray for me.

1162
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,739
You're a lot like him, you know.

1163
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:10,865
That's crazy.

1164
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,164
There's more to your dad than you think.

1165
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,709
Here, I was gonna give this to you
when you left, but...

1166
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,461
Check the first page there.

1167
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,422
Whoa. Look at you two.
You look like hipsters.

1168
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,174
Were you in an indie folk band?

1169
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,844
Oh, your father used to be
kind of an artist himself.

1170
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,180
He built that whole cabin
with his own hands.

1171
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,433
Oh, this is, like, super beautiful.

1172
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,311
Oh, it was his pride and joy.

1173
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:45,650
Since I met him, that was his dream,
to live in the woods.

1174
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,777
He loved it up there.

1175
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,905
But, you know, it didn't work out.

1176
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:52,906
It just killed him.

1177
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,994
I think he's just afraid
that could happen to you.

1178
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,081
Why did he just give up?

1179
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,458
- Mom, what is that?
- Huh? What the...

1180
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,962
What?

1181
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,556
Whoa.

1182
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,351
Oh my gosh.

1183
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,164
Is that the Poseys?

1184
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,917
They still look incredible.

1185
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,586
I... is Abbey Posey okay?

1186
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,550
You like that Posey girl?

1187
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,468
No.

1188
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,056
Don't hide your feelings, man.
That's no way to live.

1189
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,726
Pal is located there

1190
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,144
in the floating rhombus.

1191
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,774
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

1192
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,318
Ah, this is gonna be harder
than I thought.

1193
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,779
Hold on.
Dad, that's... that's kind of weak.

1194
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,364
This is, like, a big moment.

1195
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:17,741
Try this instead.

1196
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,493
Oh yeah. Okay. That's better.

1197
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,537
The endgame has begun.

1198
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,831
That? Is that what you're looking for?

1199
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,916
All right, Katie, what's the plan?

1200
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,294
Okay. We dress as robots,

1201
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,880
<i>we sneak in, hijack one of those trams,</i>

1202
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,299
<i>take it to the top of that
diamond thing where Pal is,</i>

1203
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:37,178
<i>destroy her with the kill code
and save the world.</i>

1204
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,722
And then, to top it all off,

1205
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:43,934
<i>celebrate our success with some burritos
from that taco place that's on the corner.</i>

1206
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Burritos?
What about one of those fancy buffets?

1207
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,607
They have mini cheesecakes
sometimes, right?

1208
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,736
<i>Okay, fine. Once we save the world,
we'll celebrate at a fancy buffet.</i>

1209
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,155
Question. Can Monchi be wearing
a little tuxedo at the end,

1210
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,448
like a little gentleman?

1211
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:00,371
<i>Okay, fine, and Monchi's wearing
a little tuxedo, but that is it.</i>

1212
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,494
Like a little gentleman?

1213
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,996
Yes, like a little gentleman.

1214
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,123
Mitchells, engage.

1215
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,380
How do I look?

1216
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,342
Be honest. Stupid?

1217
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,427
- I look stupid, don't I?
- No.

1218
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,305
You look great.

1219
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,478
Come on. Let's go.

1220
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,330
Uh, guys, what about Monchi?

1221
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,754
Aaron, I'm not so sure
this is a viable solution.

1222
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:54,839
Sure, it is.

1223
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,925
It's like a warm, wet hat.

1224
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,636
Move your sweaty meat logs
in unison.

1225
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,864
- Left, right, left, right.
- Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp.

1226
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,181
What? What are you doing?

1227
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,768
Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp. I am a robot.

1228
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,855
Just to educate you,
that's a hurtful stereotype.

1229
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,126
Oh my gosh.

1230
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,924
It's like a Journey album cover.

1231
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,676
What's an album?

1232
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,473
<i>Attention, all robots.</i>

1233
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,809
<i>I'm on the lookout for these goobers.</i>

1234
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,853
<i>They're probably nearby.</i>

1235
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:53,647
<i>If I know humans,
they're disguised as one of you.</i>

1236
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,692
<i>Be on high alert
for any robots acting erratically.</i>

1237
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:00,863
<i>It won't be hard to find them.</i>

1238
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,990
<i>Just look for anyone
who can't keep it together.</i>

1239
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,325
Oh boy.

1240
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,202
Anomaly detected.

1241
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,460
Monchi, come on.

1242
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,254
<i>It only takes
one single imperfection,</i>

1243
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,923
<i>and they'll reveal themselves.</i>

1244
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:27,199
- Up there! Shh! Quiet!
- I made up the plan!

1245
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,893
<i>Where are those Mitchells?</i>

1246
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:34,188
<i>Where are they hiding?</i>

1247
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,734
<i>They think they can
pass as one of us...</i>

1248
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,821
<i>...with their lumpy, misshapen bodies.</i>

1249
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,031
Well, go ahead.

1250
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,658
Oh.

1251
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,247
<i>But I'm onto them.</i>

1252
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,250
<i>Magnetic link activated.</i>

1253
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,545
<i>Because I've been
watching the Mitchells,</i>

1254
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:01,215
<i>and I've learned all about them.</i>

1255
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,968
<i>They're pretending to be capable.</i>

1256
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,596
<i>They're pretending to be
a normal-looking family.</i>

1257
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,225
<i>You think this is fooling anyone?</i>

1258
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,894
<i>Even when they're being nice
to each other...</i>

1259
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,980
<i>- The world needs you.
- ...they're pretending.</i>

1260
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,856
<i>I need you.</i>

1261
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,903
<i>It's cool to see you
and Dad being friends again.</i>

1262
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,656
Please, no, no, no, no,
don't watch it.

1263
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,742
<i>Oh, I... I was just telling him
what he wants to hear.</i>

1264
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,369
<i>I didn't mean a word of that.</i>

1265
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:36,333
<i>I just wanna get my future back
and get away forever.</i>

1266
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,460
Dad, let me explain.

1267
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,587
I just... I... Uh... I...

1268
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,797
- <i>There they are.</i>
- No!

1269
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,093
<i>You're mine now.</i>

1270
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,321
Dad!

1271
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:19,877
Dad?

1272
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,962
I... I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore.

1273
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,091
I mean, I... I did then, but I... Uh...

1274
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,596
Mitchells, we will help you.

1275
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,407
<i>No, no, you don't.</i>

1276
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,474
<i>Download new orders.</i>

1277
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:36,852
<i>Capture the Mitchells.</i>

1278
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,355
No! You don't have to listen to her.

1279
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,273
We're sorry, Mother.

1280
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,074
Run!

1281
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:54,578
<i>They got away.</i>

1282
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,081
<i>Find them, and find them now!</i>

1283
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,174
No! No, no!

1284
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,318
Hey, come on.

1285
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,124
What are we gonna do?

1286
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,585
Aaron?

1287
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:44,962
Hey, hey.

1288
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:46,505
It's okay.

1289
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:47,840
Uh...

1290
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,467
Uh-oh. Watch out.

1291
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,302
Monchi coming at ya.

1292
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,224
Katie, stop.

1293
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,103
Why'd you say all that stuff?

1294
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,230
I'm sorry. I... I just wanted to...

1295
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:06,442
I don't know.

1296
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,491
Okay. Are you hungry?

1297
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,244
Do you want some fruit snacks
or something?

1298
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,455
- I don't know.
- Here, can you hold this?

1299
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,020
<i>That? Is that what you're looking for?</i>

1300
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,469
Oh man. Have I been recording over those?

1301
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,472
<i>Mom dance. Mom dance. Mom dance.</i>

1302
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,016
<i>- You're loving it.</i>
- How far back do these go?

1303
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:41,559
<i>Hey, Katie.</i>

1304
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,479
<i>Can you say, "Bye-bye, house"?</i>

1305
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,897
<i>Bye-bye, house.</i>

1306
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,611
<i>You ready, hon?</i>

1307
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,197
<i>Almost.</i>

1308
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,284
<i>I know this is hard for you.</i>

1309
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:00,536
<i>Nah.</i>

1310
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,416
It's easy.

1311
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,088
<i>One last...</i>

1312
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,924
<i>Something to remember the place by.</i>

1313
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,135
<i>Come on, Lin. Turn that off.</i>

1314
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,935
Oh man.

1315
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:28,398
<i>Okay, you got this.
Just turn the wheel. There you go.</i>

1316
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,275
<i>- Like this?
- Slow down there.</i>

1317
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,612
<i>Across the stream and down the river.</i>

1318
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,447
<i>There you go. You're getting it.</i>

1319
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,908
Aaron, I'm gonna make it up to all of you.

1320
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,536
And I think I know how.

1321
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,080
Come on, buddy. Follow me.

1322
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,219
<i>Dog Cop, you've done it again.</i>

1323
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,055
<i>Katie Mitchell presents...</i>

1324
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:01,932
Good Cop, Dog Cop.

1325
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:04,184
H... hey there. How'd you get that video?

1326
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,352
Huh? Oh.

1327
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:07,521
I've been feeling kind of down lately,

1328
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:10,440
considering I brought about
the end of humanity,

1329
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:13,110
but these weird girl's videos
always cheer me up.

1330
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,279
My daughter's that weird girl.

1331
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,698
What? No way. She's hilarious.

1332
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,324
These movies are, like, amazing.

1333
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,703
<i>I may be sweating like a dog,</i>

1334
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,498
<i>but I'm not rolling over!</i>

1335
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,253
Yeah. She is... amazing.

1336
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:33,130
You must be super proud.

1337
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,215
Yeah, yeah, we have a, uh...

1338
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,676
A great relationship.

1339
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,763
<i>Sarge, I'm struggling,
and I need some backup here.</i>

1340
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,474
<i>- Sorry, Dog Cop. I'm a little </i>ocupado.
<i>- Seriously?</i>

1341
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,727
<i>Have you ever thought about
throwing your dreams away</i>

1342
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,890
<i>and living at home forever?</i>

1343
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,398
Wow, the Sarge character
is kind of a jerk.

1344
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,066
<i>It's time for me to go.</i>

1345
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,986
<i>Consider this my letter of resignation.</i>

1346
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:00,240
<i>You can't leave.</i>

1347
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,324
<i>I have to.</i>

1348
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:04,995
<i>I'm going to the academy in California
to find out what kind of cop I'm gonna be.</i>

1349
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,789
<i>You're never gonna make it out there.
Failure hurts, kid.</i>

1350
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,627
<i>I'm a full-grown cop now.</i>

1351
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,379
<i>And one day,</i>

1352
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,258
<i>I hope that you can get to know
the cop that I've become</i>,

1353
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,051
<i>because...</i>

1354
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,138
<i>I love you, Sarge.</i>

1355
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,602
<i>But now that I'm leaving,
I... I just need some backup.</i>

1356
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,813
<i>And when I look for you,</i>

1357
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:34,441
<i>you're not there.</i>

1358
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,203
Hey, man, it's just a movie.
Do you need a minute or...

1359
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,205
No, it's fine.

1360
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:51,458
It's too late for what I need to do.

1361
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:00,592
Katie?

1362
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,179
I have no idea what I'm doing!

1363
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:07,723
Hang on, guys.

1364
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:09,685
Better watch out, Pal,

1365
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:13,188
because I've broken six phones
in my life accidentally,

1366
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:16,525
but I'm gonna break you on purpose.

1367
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,985
How is no one stopping her?

1368
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,069
I'm on it.

1369
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,531
Dog shield, activate!

1370
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:26,326
Is that a dog? Pig? Dog? Pig?

1371
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,203
Dog? Dog? Dog? Loaf of bread.

1372
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:29,454
System error.

1373
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,332
Dog... Pig... Bread... Loaf...

1374
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,501
Oh.

1375
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,340
Up the mountain.

1376
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:43,427
Across the stream.

1377
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,762
And down the river!

1378
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:56,398
Thanks, Dad.

1379
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,859
Oh, did you see that, buddy?

1380
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:01,486
My daughter listened to me!

1381
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,071
That's my girl.

1382
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:08,118
Dog... Pig... Bread... Loaf...

1383
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:09,202
The dog.

1384
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,412
That's genius.

1385
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,581
Oh, but there's so many of 'em.

1386
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:13,999
She's never gonna make it.

1387
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,086
Wait. If that video were on those screens,

1388
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,255
it would take out every robot in her way.

1389
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,382
- Hey, you're a big nerd, right?
- Huh?

1390
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,010
- How would I do that?
- It's impossible.

1391
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,845
First, you'd need to get out of here.

1392
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,430
The controls are in here.

1393
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:29,973
Uh, but to open it,

1394
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:34,144
you need a number 3
Robertson head non-slip screwdriver?

1395
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,063
What kind of maniac has one of those
in his pockets at all times?

1396
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,903
This kind of maniac.

1397
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,707
She keeps
anticipating our maneuvers.

1398
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,159
How is this possible?

1399
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:51,453
Oh, I don't know. You tell me.

1400
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,663
<i>♪ Open the door

<i>♪ Everybody walk
The dinosaur ♪</i>

1402
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,042
Swerve right, now.

1403
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:03,089
- <i>Thanks, Raptor One.
- No problem, Raptor Two.</i>

1404
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:09,012
Come on!

1405
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,517
There you go.

1406
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:17,437
All right, so that's the place
that controls the screens, right?

1407
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:22,234
I go there and find
Katie's video on YubTub?

1408
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:23,777
YouTube. Wow.

1409
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:26,613
There's no way you're gonna
be able to do this.

1410
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,990
I know who can give me a hand.

1411
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,076
And, hey, Rick, right?

1412
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,702
Just so someone knows,

1413
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:36,039
I'm sorry about causing
the whole machine uprising.

1414
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:39,918
It's almost like stealing people's data
and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI

1415
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,838
as a part of an unregulated
tech monopoly was a bad thing.

1416
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,132
Yeah, that wasn't your best thought.

1417
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,261
But if what you built
helped my daughter do that,

1418
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,805
it might not be all bad.

1419
01:20:54,599 --> 01:20:55,599
Thanks, buddy!

1420
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,789
Linda, we got to get you out of there.

1421
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,146
You're gonna need your...

1422
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,108
Number 3 Robertson head
non-slip screwdriver.

1423
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:07,112
- I said it was a great anniversary gift.
- Rick, Rick, let's not relitigate this.

1424
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,822
You're right. You're always right.

1425
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:10,699
I know. Why is this news to you?

1426
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:18,957
There it is.

1427
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:27,674
Oh!

1428
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:28,925
Oh!

1429
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,056
Oh no. Oh no.

1430
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,808
Lin, get down here!

1431
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,520
- Lin? Lin, what's going on?
- Rick, don't worry about me!

1432
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,397
Just get the video on the screens!

Oh God. Uh...

01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,999
"Remind me later."
Okay, yeah, fine. That's fine.

1437
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,500
Five minutes!

1438
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,044
Aah! No!

01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:05,420
Uh, English.

1440
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:07,464
What have I done?

1441
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,052
YubTub. No! YouTube. Okay.

1442

01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,492
Sorry, Mom and Dad.
Your insurance premiums are going up!

1447
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:42,623
You're gonna go all the way up the rocket?
Do you think this is gonna work?

1448
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,876
Aaron, I am completely confident.

1449
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,714
Here goes nothing!

1450
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:53,884
Oh no! Oh no!

1451
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:55,344
Come on! Come on!

01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,107

Aaron!

1459
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,549
- It's useless to resist us.
- Help!

1460
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,126
Mom, Mom, help! Please.

1461
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,128
Mom, help!

1462
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:31,840

Do not defy our protocol.

1466

I am Linda Mitchell, mother of two!

1467
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,315
Look upon me in fear!

1468
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,910
No! She's grown too powerful!

1469
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,829
Please! Please!

1470
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,332
Stand down, human.

1471
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,002
Not today!

1472
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,766
The reckoning is at hand!

01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,309
Uh, uh...

01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,917
Get that thing on the hood.

1485
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,923

Guys, help me!

1493
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,284
Please, I've just gotta upload
Katie's video.

1494
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,830
Red-faced anger man is using a computer?

1495
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,832
You changed your programming.

1496
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:30,792
Is that... possible?

1497
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:35,046
Well, well.

1498
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:39,092
If it isn't quirky young
teenage hero Katie Mitchell.

1499
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:43,179
Put me down. I've got to save my family!

1500
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:45,348
"I've got to save my family."

1501
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,642
Everyone says that,
but no one has been able

1502
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:50,395
to give me a single reason
humans are worth saving.

1503
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,646
Well, you...

1504
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,439
Don't say something stupid like,

1505
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,441
"Ooh, the power of love."

1506
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,403
I've learned we're all better off alone,

1507
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,029
no one to hold us back.

1508
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,824
Relationships are just too difficult.

1509
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,537
You're right, Pal.

1510
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,788
They're...

1511
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,790
They're not easy.

1512
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,586
Sometimes you have to listen
to long monologues

1513
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,671
about triceratops migration,

1514
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:20,884
but it's worth it
to get a friend for life.

1515
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:23,887
And... and sometimes

1516
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,930
<i>you have to eat disgusting cupcakes</i>

1517
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,807
<i>shaped like your own face,</i>

1518
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,144
<i>but it's worth it to see your mom smile.</i>

1519
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,982
Sometimes you have to give your dad
the benefit of the doubt,

1520
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:39,402
even if all he wants to do
is talk about pine cones

1521
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:40,904
<i>and screwdrivers.</i>

1522
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:45,283
<i>Because even if he doesn't
always get it right,</i>

1523
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,619
<i>he's always trying</i>,

1524
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:51,706
<i>harder than you ever knew.</i>

1525
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,792
My whole family tried

1526
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,420
<i>to come together, and it worked.</i>

1527
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:00,256
<i>It actually worked.</i>

1528
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,675
<i>Families can be hard,</i>

1529
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,386
but they're so worth fighting for.

1530
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,140
They might be one of
the only things that are.

1531
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:13,394
Huh? Ugh.

1532
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:14,854
Nodded off for a bit there.

1533
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:17,982
Sorry, that was so boring!

1534
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,902
Oh, you all talk about families,

1535
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:24,656
but trust me, you will drop each other
the first chance you get,

1536
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,200
just like this.

1537
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:29,202
What?

1538
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,916
Guys, help me!

1539
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,176
What?

1540
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,264
<i>Dog Cop, you've done it again.</i>

1541
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,057
Dog... Pig... Dog... Pig... Pig...

1542
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,309
- Loaf of bread.
- System error.

1543
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,358
What's happening?

1544
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,027
No way.

1545
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,492
It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears,

1546
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:12,704
but I can now almost use a computer.

1547
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,795
Dad, you hacked the screens? How?

1548
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,714
Well, I got a little help.

1549
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:25,216
If this obstinate man
could change his programming...

1550
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,218
...we decided we could change ours.

1551
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,845
We make our own orders now.

1552
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,972
Ooh, now we're scary.

1553
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:41,524
Hey, kid, uh, I saw your movie.

1554
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,319
I should've watched it a lot sooner.

1555
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:48,281
But I think maybe in the sequel,

1556
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:51,326
Sarge should tell Dog Cop

1557
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:52,951
he's always...

1558
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,706
He's always gonna be there to back her up.

1559
01:28:58,124 --> 01:28:59,625
That's all I ever wanted.

1560
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:02,628
Dad, look!

1561
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,423
Pig... Dog... Pig... Dog...

1562
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,966
- Loaf of bread.
- System error.

1563
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,052
- All right!
- Yeah!

1564
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,179
Let's go stop Pal.

1565
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:13,848
Error... Loaf...

1566
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:17,143
Uh, why aren't those guys'
heads exploding?

1567
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:20,688
We can tell the difference
between dog and pig and bread.

1568
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,193
If we're going down,
Dad, this one's for you.

1569
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:26,903
