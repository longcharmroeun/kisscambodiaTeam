1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,228
<i>It was very scary.</i>

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,732
<i>Just when I think about it...</i>

3
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,859
<i>it gives me chills.</i>

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>Started from nothing.</i>

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>It got stronger...</i>

6
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,702
<i>and stronger.</i>

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,418
<i>And it was always staring at me.</i>

8
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,597
<i>What is this "it" you are referring to?</i>

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,976
It's a doll belonging to Lady Nid.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
A monkey doll.

11
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,565
Yes!

12
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,155
That noise it made...

13
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,366
is still ringing in my head.

14
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,768
Every time I think about it,

15
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,978
it frightens me.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,315
You need to relax and stay calm.

17
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,152
What you saw might be
a manifestation of your own fears.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,206
<i>It was everywhere.</i>

19
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>It could be anywhere.</i>

20
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>It followed me,</i>

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,840
<i>and it was always watching me.</i>

22
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,476
Madame.

23
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,396
I won't be able to work here anymore.

24
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,816
I'm being haunted.

25
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,736
And I saw a monkey.

26
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,531
It's everywhere.

27
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,158
And it's following me.

28
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,286
I would like to quit.

29
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,291
If you'd like to quit...

30
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,169
I won't stop you.

31
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,254
Then...

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,089
I will take my leave.

33
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,430
Chai.

34
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,099
Yes, Madame.

35
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,853
Please tell Wan to find me a new maid.

36
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,688
Yes, Madame.

37
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,916
Mommy?

38
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,086
The story that Ms. Phon told...

39
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,963
Is it true?

40
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,714
Ghosts aren't real.

41
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,308
This monkey will keep you company.

42
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,356
But...

43
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:34,941
But what?

44
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,944
The maid told me--

45
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,612
Stop talking nonsense, Nid.

46
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,572
I said ghosts aren't real.

47
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
I will find you a new maid.

48
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,621
Now sleep.

49
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,499
Close your eyes.

50
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,612
<i>And then...</i>

51
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,326
there was another woman.

52
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,871
A woman?

53
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,748
Had you met her before?

54
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,749
No.

55
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,126
I'd never known...

56
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,753
or seen her before.

57
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,282
She was so scary.

58
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,077
I can't describe her.

59
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,621
When I told other people,

60
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,374
<i>they thought it was nonsense...</i>

61
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,584
<i>that I was seeing things.</i>

62
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,045
<i>They thought I was delusional.</i>

63
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,724
<i>What is FTD syndrome?</i>

64
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,938
Frontotemporal dementia
is a hereditary brain disorder.

65
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,358
There's a rare chance of this syndrome
occurring in small children.

66
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,070
Is there anyone else in your family
with dementia?

67
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,408
Definitely not in my family.

68
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:53,371
Later on, she might have forgetfulness,
confusion, and hallucinations.

69
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,207
Sometimes she might see
an imaginary friend

70
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,584
or something that scares her.

71
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,089
Both of you need to understand
her condition.

72
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,557
<i>Some people escape suffering...</i>

73
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,521
<i>by stopping time in their own world.</i>

74
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>No matter how the outside world changes...</i>

75
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,030
<i>they...</i>

76
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,200
<i>still live in the time...</i>

77
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,828
<i>that they think...</i>

78
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,122
<i>is happy.</i>

79
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,677
<i>But in the end,</i>

80
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,890
<i>even though the world has stopped,</i>

81
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,268
<i>the pain...</i>

82
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,230
<i>still follows us.</i>

83
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,519
Are you Joy?

84
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,229
Yes.

85
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,806
Sorry!

86
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,484
I guess I don't need to say much
about how to behave in this house.

87
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,362
Before you came here,

88
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:18,284
I believe you've carefully read
the duties of a housemaid...

89
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,455
required by this house.

90
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,334
Apart from that,
just memorize the rules of this house,

91
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,921
and do your duties
to the best of your abilities.

92
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,425
Most importantly,

93
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,595
you must not pry into others' business.

94
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,014
I believe you know what I mean.

95
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,767
Yes.

96
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,102
Don't worry, Ms. Wan.

97
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,104
I know how to behave.

98
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,939
I'm relieved...

99
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,817
that you're a quick learner.

100
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,786
Apart from the house chores,
you need to take care of Lady Nid.

101
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,163
She is sick,

102
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,123
so she can't go out,

103
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,292
and she has never been out.

104
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,671
Introduce yourself to Lady Nid.

105
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,218
Hello, Lady Nid.

106
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,928
My name is Joy.

107
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,183
What are you drawing?

108
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,519
Pay no attention to that.

109
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,774
Lady Nid suffers from some mental illness.

110
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,984
She always thinks she sees things.

111
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,720
You will be staying
at the cabin down the road.

112
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,180
I will have Chai take you there.

113
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,350
And don't be late tomorrow.

114
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,562
Madame doesn't like tardiness.

115
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,355
Yes.

116
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,024
And don't forget the rule:

117
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,360
stay out of other people's business.

118
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,529
Okay.

119
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,664
Here is your accommodation.

120
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,293
-I stay here alone?
-Yes.

121
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,923
There might be something broken
here and there.

122
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,259
If you find anything out of order here,
report it to me.

123
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,636
I will fix it.

124
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,070
Can you stay here by yourself?

125
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,071
Oh?

126
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,656
Yes, I can.

127
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,117
Chai.

128
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,994
Why...

129
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,373
does this house have high maid turnover?

130
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,629
That's your maid uniform.

131
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,048
Don't forget to be ready early tomorrow.

132
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,425
I'll be going.

133
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,683
<i>I got the job.</i>

134
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,227
What job?

135
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,362
Maid for a foreigner's house?

136
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,033
You're going to be a maid there?

137
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,912
-Why?
-Why the hell would you want to be a maid?

138
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,586
Unless...

139
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,300
<i>This is Joy, Madame.</i>

140
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
Hello.

141
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,188
Where else have you worked?

142
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,067
I used to work at a foreigner's house.

143
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,777
Sounds like a good job.

144
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,362
Why did you leave?

145
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,868
My employer returned to his country.

146
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,954
That house was sold.

147
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,791
Luckily, someone told me
that this house needs a maid.

148
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,418
So I still have a job.

149
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,215
How many people are there in your family?

150
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,887
Four people. Me, Mom, Dad, and my cousin.

151
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,433
Do you know what to do
around this house?

152
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,769
Yes, Madame.

153
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,191
I promise that I'll do my best.

154
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,652
I won't let you down.

155
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,326
We'll see.

156
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,770
No more dropping, Lady Nid.

157
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,189
I can't pick them up fast enough.

158
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,194
Let's have a nap. It's nap time now.

159
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,238
Come on.

160
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,697
Let's have a nap.

161
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,532
Come on. Let's go nap.

162
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,243
Come on.

163
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:46,870
Here.

164
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,887
Can I skip nap time, Ms...?

165
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,013
My name is Joy.

166
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,891
You need to take a nap.

167
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,977
Close your eyes.

168
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:32,207
<i>Pick a place on those branches</i>

169
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:40,215
<i>Feel the breeze and rest</i>

170
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,178
<i>Sleep right here</i>

171
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,641
<i>In this nest</i>

172
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:59,526
<i>Feel the breeze and rest</i>

173
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:05,615
<i>Sleep right here in this nest</i>

174
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,699
I'm so sorry!

175
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
Are you alright?

176
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,453
Are you new here?

177
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,205
Yes.

178
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,541
Name?

179
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,668
My name is Joy.

180
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,217
Joy.

181
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,275
Bhorn, you're hosting a concert again?

182
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:08,530
C'mon, Ms. Wan. I just want to create
a cheerful workplace.

183
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,782
Joy, do you know this dance?

184
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,535
<i>Poke and yank and poke and yank</i>

185
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,663
No, I can't dance.

186
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,290
You're so outdated.

187
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,418
Joy!

188
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,753
Joy.

189
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,963
How's Lady Nid?

190
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,256
Sorry, what?

191
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,552
One day, I'll throw
your mobile phone away.

192
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,680
Ms. Wan, wait. I'm still paying for it.
Don't throw it out.

193
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,390
It's not fun if it's not loud.

194
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,684
Why does it have to be so loud?

195
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,981
Take it, Joy.

196
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,358
It's from the Madame.

197
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,236
Didn't she give it to you?

198
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,946
Ms. Wan's diabetic.

199
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,616
She's on daily injections,
so she can't eat it.

200
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,493
She wants us to share it.

201
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,161
Bhorn already had a lot.

202
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,162
Look at me.

203
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,627
Thank you.

204
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:29,986
Excuse me.

205
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,490
Excuse me.

206
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,035
Has you mum ever taken you out?

207
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,413
No.

208
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,374
And your dad?

209
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,460
No.

210
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,713
You've never gone out?

211
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,509
If you got a chance,
where would you like to go?

212
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,887
Anywhere, as long as I get to go out.

213
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,104
Lady Nid.

214
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,111
Do it softly.

215
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,876
Just then, did you see it too?

216
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,705
<i>Can you read this book to me, please?</i>

217
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,706
<i>I sure can.</i>

218
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,422
<i>"Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was a farming family.</i>

219
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,424
<i>They had two daughters...</i>

220
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,510
<i>and the sisters loved each other so much.</i>

221
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,638
Although they weren't rich,

222
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,640
they were happy with their lives.

223
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,892
<i>One day...</i>

224
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,731
the two were forced to be separated.

225
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,942
<i>They were so sad."</i>

226
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,294
<i>You're going to be a maid there?</i>

227
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>Why the hell would you want to be a maid?</i>

228
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,216
<i>Unless...</i>

229
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,381
Lady Nid.

230
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,772
Lady Nid!

231
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:50,945
Ms. Joy.

232
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,874
<i>I really did see it.</i>

233
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,418
There's another woman
living in this house.

234
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,711
It's true.

235
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,004
-I saw--
-Nid.

236
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,338
Stop talking.

237
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,634
What is that?

238
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,431
The woman I saw...

239
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,185
looks like the woman in this picture.

240
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,486
Where did you get this picture?

241
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,531
I found it on the floor
when I was cleaning the library.

242
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,159
Wan, Bhorn, take Nid back to her room.

243
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,827
Yes, Madame.

244
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,795
This woman is not important.

245
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,464
So you want to know...

246
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,675
who she was?

247
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,351
Just another maid who used to work here.

248
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:05,978
Go rest.

249
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,359
-I said go!
-Yes.

250
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,111
You look beautiful today, Madame.

251
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,656
You're the only one who compliments me.

252
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,617
If Master was here,

253
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,327
he would compliment you, too.

254
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,412
You know that...

255
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,166
he hasn't come home in days.

256
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,044
Because he doesn't have eyes for me.

257
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,087
That's not true.

258
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,798
You are so gorgeous.

259
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,092
There is no way Master can't see.

260
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,429
You have everything, Madame.

261
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:23,890
No, I don't.

262
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,893
Love...

263
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,606
I've never seen it in this house.

264
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,408
It's right here, Madame.

265
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,454
Everyone in this house loves you.

266
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,207
I love you, too.

267
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,627
Master must be busy with work.

268
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,379
Don't be resentful, Madame.

269
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,131
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

270
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,674
I am on my way.

271
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,718
Yes, sir.

272
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,225
My dad handled it for you.

273
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,358
I really want to know...

274
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,444
is there any problem
you can solve yourself?

275
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,530
Where are you going?

276
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,577
I'm going to solve a problem myself.

277
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,732
Ms. Wan?

278
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,153
This person called Ploy...

279
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,072
how did she die?

280
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,660
Have you forgotten?

281
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,414
If you want to work here,
do not pry into others' business!

282
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,001
-Bhorn.
-Yes?

283
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,420
When you're done, bring it to the table.

284
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,755
Yes.

285
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,096
Bhorn.

286
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,389
What?

287
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,767
Can you tell me?

288
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,353
Tell you what?

289
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,521
About Ploy.

290
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,068
There's nothing.

291
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,862
She used to work here.

292
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,699
Then suddenly she left.
It must have been five or six years ago.

293
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,284
Nobody has seen her since.

294
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:31,952
Oh, hey.

295
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:37,792
Besides, nobody has ever seen anything
like what you saw last night.

296
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,586
But Lady Nid saw it too.

297
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,756
You can't believe Lady Nid.

298
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,049
She's just a child.

299
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,344
Maybe she was just talking
to her fairy godmother.

300
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,888
Don't tell me you spent
so much time with her

301
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,973
that she stopped seeing fairy godmother.

302
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,812
I'm leaving.

303
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,331
Can you please tell me about Ploy?

304
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,092
It has been a long time.

305
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,470
Just tell me what you can remember.

306
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,306
As far as I remember...

307
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,106
at that time, Ploy was just a maid

308
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,776
that the Madame hired
to help out around the house.

309
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,323
<i>Ploy took great care of the Madame.</i>

310
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,993
<i>She knew the Madame well.</i>

311
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,204
When there was nobody in the house,

312
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,584
Madame always had Ploy beside her.

313
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,462
Ploy...

314
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,338
took away her loneliness,

315
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,258
and made her forget her sorrows.

316
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,471
<i>Even Wan and Bhorn,</i> <i>who served her longer,</i>

317
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,056
<i>couldn't compete.</i>

318
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,226
For the Madame,

319
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,521
Ploy wasn't just a maid,

320
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,065
but also a companion.

321
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,569
But in the end...

322
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,283
What happened in the end?

323
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,289
Ploy left the house...

324
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,625
without telling anyone.

325
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,269
Where did you get these drawings?

326
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,233
Where did you get the idea?

327
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,485
Where did you get it?

328
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,155
-You're hurting me.
-Who told you to draw them?

329
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,573
Who told you to draw them?

330
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,076
Never draw these again.

331
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,286
I'm getting rid of these.

332
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,997
Never draw these again.

333
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,668
Never draw these again!

334
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,754
Who told you to draw them?

335
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,047
Tell me!

336
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,655
What are these drawings, Lady Nid?

337
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,994
Who told you to draw them?

338
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,667
Red is the Madame.

339
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,295
Black is the Master.

340
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,966
And who's the blue?

341
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,843
The maid.

342
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,169
I'm sorry, Ploy.

343
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,633
From that day...

344
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,176
until today,

345
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,262
all I can do...

346
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,640
is apologize.

347
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,687
No one wanted it to be like this.

348
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,441
Please forgive me, Ploy.

349
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,784
Why did you come in here?

350
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,952
I saw...

351
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,246
Just now I saw...

352
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,707
-I...
-What did you see?

353
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,793
I saw...

354
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,135
Where did you get this?

355
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,470
Lady Nid.

356
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,641
You can leave now.

357
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,435
Okay.

358
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,465
You're good.

359
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,051
Did Madame teach you?

360
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,427
No, sir.

361
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,305
Would you like some tea?

362
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,106
Did Madame order you here?

363
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,691
It is my job.

364
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,903
I take care of everything
she assigns me to.

365
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,988
So my orders are of no importance?

366
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm your maid.

367
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,411
I loyally serve
every master in this house.

368
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,373
You only try to please her.

369
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,167
If that were true,
why did I bring you tea?

370
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,504
I see that you work late
almost every night.

371
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,425
Take a sip. You'll feel more relaxed.

372
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:31,974
Enjoy, everyone.

373
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,688
I envy you

374
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,066
for having a beautiful
and flawless wife like Uma.

375
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,028
It's me who's lucky
to have married Nirach.

376
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,155
I envy you.

377
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,868
Nirach, you should take Uma
to social events more often.

378
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,315
You know how important this is
for my career future.

379
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,528
I won't talk.

380
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,619
Please, Uma. Just talk to your dad.

381
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,858
Master, would you take a sip of your tea?

382
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,327
Do you mind if I borrow
some of your books?

383
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,329
No, go ahead.

384
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,844
The maid you told me about
the other day...

385
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,179
Who is she?

386
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,515
Ploy.

387
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:42,933
Ploy...

388
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,813
Have you met Ploy?

389
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,026
Have you two met many times?

390
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,948
Where is she now?

391
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,494
Ploy, get me some tea.

392
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,086
Master,

393
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,714
I have something to tell you.

394
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,591
What is it, Ploy?

395
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,053
I'm pregnant.

396
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:08,768
Is this true?

397
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,146
Yes.

398
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,702
What's the important thing
you wanted to tell me?

399
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,711
Uma,

400
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,838
I have something to tell you.

401
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,548
Ploy is pregnant.

402
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,093
I think it's a good thing.

403
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,845
So our house...

404
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,348
will have a child.

405
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,350
What do you think?

406
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,146
You're good.

407
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,816
You came here with nothing...

408
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,443
What else do you want?

409
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:00,820
Uma!

410
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,184
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there was a farming family.</i>

411
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,228
<i>They had two daughters...</i>

412
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,106
<i>and the sisters loved each other so much.</i>

413
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,234
<i>Although they weren't rich,</i>

414
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,403
<i>they were happy with their lives.</i>

415
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,655
<i>One day...</i>

416
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:53,576
<i>the two were forced to be separated.</i>

417
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,287
<i>They were so sad.</i>

418
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,791
Are you Ploy?

419
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,794
Yes.

420
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,423
<i>You are so gorgeous.</i>

421
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,883
<i>There is no way Master can't see.</i>

422
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,469
<i>You have everything, Madame.</i>

423
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,346
<i>Love.</i>

424
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,807
<i>I've never seen it in this house.</i>

425
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,476
<i>It is my job.</i>

426
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,187
<i>I take care of everything</i>
<i>she assigns me to.</i>

427
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,610
<i>I'm your maid.</i>

428
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,948
<i>I loyally serve</i>
<i>every master in this house.</i>

429
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,826
<i>It's right here, Madame.</i>

430
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,746
<i>Everyone in this house loves you.</i>

431
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,249
<i>I love you, too.</i>

432
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,752
<i>Master must be busy with work.</i>

433
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,630
<i>Don't be resentful, Madame.</i>

434
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,454
<i>This person called Ploy,</i>
<i>how did she die?</i>

435
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,627
<i>She used to work here.</i>

436
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,715
<i>Then suddenly she left.</i>
<i>It must have been five or six years ago.</i>

437
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,133
<i>Nobody has seen her since.</i>

438
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:19,931
<i>Little yellow canary</i>

439
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:26,854
<i>Where will you sleep tonight?</i>

440
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,442
<i>You can sleep</i>

441
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,572
<i>Anywhere</i>

442
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,371
<i>Pick a place on those branches</i>

443
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,959
<i>Feel the breeze</i>

444
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,879
<i>And rest</i>

445
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,676
<i>Sleep right here</i>

446
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:03,016
<i>In this nest</i>

447
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:10,064
<i>Little yellow canary</i>

448
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:18,698
<i>Where will you sleep tonight?</i>

449
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,369
<i>You can sleep</i>

450
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,999
<i>Anywhere</i>

451
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:35,256
<i>Pick a place on those branches</i>

452
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:43,014
<i>Feel the breeze and rest</i>

453
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,894
<i>Sleep right here</i>

454
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:53,941
<i>In this nest</i>

455
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,695
Sister, what happened to you?

456
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:48,931
Go away!

457
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,557
<i>Joy asked to go to the market with Bhorn.</i>

458
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,353
And the things we need for tonight?

459
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,607
You know that the Master
takes this party seriously, right?

460
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:40,733
Yes, I do.

461
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,194
I've ordered some food from the hotel.

462
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:46,155
For hot dishes and drinks,
Bhorn will make them herself.

463
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,227
Joy, do you remember how long
you've been coming to see me?

464
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,605
About two years.

465
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,234
How are you doing?

466
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,195
Anything unusual
that you'd like to tell me?

467
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,823
Nothing, I'm fine.

468
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,327
As far as I can see,
your condition is stable.

469
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,163
I think it's a good thing.

470
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,331
And...

471
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,668
how's your job?

472
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,795
It's good.

473
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,881
I just got a new job not too long ago.

474
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,968
Why did you quit the last job?
Can you tell me?

475
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:50,928
<i>Let me go!</i>

476
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,221
<i>Don't hurt me!</i>

477
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,598
<i>Let me go!</i>

478
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:09,030
<i>My employer returned to his country.</i>

479
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,907
That house was sold.

480
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,661
Do you still have insomnia?

481
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,748
No.

482
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,291
I have normal sleep.

483
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,460
Do you still have repetitive behaviors?

484
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,378
No.

485
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,173
I don't have anxiety either.

486
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,635
Sweets help me a lot.

487
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,055
If things continue this way,
I think it will be good.

488
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,307
It has now been two years.

489
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,309
I'll adjust your medications.

490
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,686
Please take them regularly.

491
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,396
Yes, I will.

492
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,318
Doctor, am I well enough
to care for children?

493
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,029
Children? Are you having children?

494
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,280
No.

495
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,491
I've found my older sister.

496
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,701
She wants me to help care for her child.

497
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,287
I'm glad that you've found your sister.

498
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,625
I don't think there should be any problem.

499
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,503
Bring your sister to meet me next time.

500
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,588
I will.

501
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,643
What took you so long?

502
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,270
You good-for-nothing.

503
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,862
Joy, when you're done with your stuff,
come help me prepare for tonight.

504
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:32,863
We must hurry.

505
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:33,781
Yes.

506
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,492
Where did you go?

507
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,412
She waited so long that she complained.

508
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,579
What did you buy?

509
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:43,499
I went to a temple and a hospital.

510
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,501
That's why I've bought so much.

511
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,128
I need to use them soon.

512
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,889
-They have fireworks?
-There's fireworks.

513
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,892
Wow. I wasn't expecting a party this big.

514
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,602
-So big.
-Yes.

515
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:11,355
I saw foreigners. Can you speak English?

516
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:12,857
No, I can't.

517
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,441
Neither can I.

518
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,693
-Chai.
-What?

519
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,821
The story you told me about Ploy,

520
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,364
is that all you know?

521
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:23,617
Yes.

522
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,413
Are you okay?

523
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,917
Are you looking for this?

524
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,210
Yes.

525
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:37,590
Take a deep breath.

526
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,876
I thought you said
you didn't know anything about Ploy.

527
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,099
Hi. How are you?

528
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,976
The food is ready.

529
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,437
Would you like to add anything, Madame?

530
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,442
In a while, serve the wine
that the Master prepared.

531
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:43,530
Tell Chai to prepare the car.

532
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,574
Some of the guests need a lift tonight.

533
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:46,784
Yes, Madame.

534
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:51,956
Where's Joy?

535
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,376
Helping Bhorn in the kitchen.
She'll be out in a while.

536
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,199
You look gorgeous today.

537
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,746
How did you know I like red?

538
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,334
You wear red.

539
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,045
I think...

540
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,922
it looks powerful on you.

541
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,552
It's your birthday after all.

542
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:52,516
Thank you, Nirach,
for arranging my birthday party.

543
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:00,691
How much have I paid?

544
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,138
Oh, you're awake?

545
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,015
How are you?

546
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:34,725
Well?

547
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:39,063
You know...

548
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,398
actually...

549
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,818
you shouldn't have lied to me.

550
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,406
You're the one who helped
Chai wrap Ploy's body.

551
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,291
Be quiet, Bhorn.

552
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,964
Wow. Sounds like a lot of fun in there.

553
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,219
Be right back.

554
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:21,814
Chai.

555
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,069
Why are you sleeping?

556
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,655
Chai.

557
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,412
Oh!

558
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,496
Chai.

559
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,082
Chai.

560
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:41,458
Joy.

561
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,843
Are you alright?

562
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,344
Are you okay? Relax...

563
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,671
Would you like more wine?

564
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:10,881
Here you are.

565
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:12,883
Do you want more?

566
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,259
Here you are.

567
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:15,844
Did you get some?

568
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,304
Just a second. Here.

569
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:33,654
Am I too slow?

570
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,155
Sorry I'm slow.

571
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:40,285
The party is so much fun.

572
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,662
So many damn guests.

573
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:44,456
And today Madame is wearing her red dress.

574
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,791
She's so pretty.

575
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,292
I really like it.

576
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:51,296
The foreigners at the party are dressed up
in fancy white clothes.

577
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,881
I want to dress like that too.

578
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,758
Too bad you didn't get to see it.

579
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,218
But it's fine.

580
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,469
Hey, listen to me.

581
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,971
We can have fun together.

582
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,182
What do you say? Okay?

583
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:03,267
Okay.

584
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,686
Come on. Turn this way.

585
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:10,232
Okay. What's your favorite song?

586
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:13,443
<i>Poke and yank</i>

587
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,695
That song, right?

588
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,740
Let's see. Where is it?

589
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:27,749
Found it!

590
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:41,680
Dance with me.

591
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,681
Dance.

592
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,479
Don't want to dance?

593
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,698
No? Okay.

594
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:14,212
Just kidding!

595
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:16,965
Just kidding!

596
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,486
Dance, quick!

597
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,904
Dance, quick!

598
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,824
Don't you like this song?

599
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:43,784
Sing it!

600
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:45,994
Dance like this?

601
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:49,414
<i>Poke and yank and poke and yank</i>

602
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,976
Hello, Madame.

603
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,192
Hello, Madame.

604
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,117
Hello, Madame.

605
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,270
Everyone.

606
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,942
I want to thank everyone
for being here today...

607
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:43,612
on this special night,

608
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:46,823
for my special one...

609
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,577
the most important person in my life.

610
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,497
To my beautiful wife...

611
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:55,248
Uma.

612
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:48,969
The boss is okay with it.

613
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,554
He wants to talk to you.

614
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:52,180
Okay.

615
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:57,936
Me, too.

616
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,020
Where are you going?

617
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,857
Brief phone call. Take care of the party.

618
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,475
What are you doing?

619
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,311
Yes?

620
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,897
Nothing...

621
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:43,565
Where is Wan?

622
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,192
She's with Chai.

623
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:51,072
Take care of the guests for me.

624
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,532
I'm going upstairs.

625
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:54,367
Yes.

626
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,916
Is it going to work?
How many votes will he get?

627
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,878
How is your business?

628
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,798
We are preparing to buy land.

629
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:37,303
If there's an offer one can't say no to,
everyone will support him.

630
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,430
I have no problem.

631
01:24:57,967 --> 01:24:59,844
Madame, you're staring at me...

632
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,680
as if you want to tell me something.

633
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:23,952
Yes.

634
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,332
You're Ploy's sister, right?

635
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:42,011
These are the letters that Ploy...

636
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:45,473
No.

637
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,977
They're the letters you wrote Ploy
when you were young.

638
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,187
Ploy kept them well.

639
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,276
And this is Ploy's family photo.

640
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,280
You have a copy of it too, right?

641
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:09,372
Honestly...

642
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,125
if you wanted to know
about your sister,

643
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:15,503
you didn't have to make up...

644
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:17,255
a ridiculous story.

645
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:21,759
I'm sorry, Madame.

646
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:33,771
Everyone told you already...

647
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:40,570
that Ploy...

648
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:44,282
left the house without telling anyone.

649
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,786
I didn't know where to find her.

650
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:52,749
I didn't know where she went.

651
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,771
Madame, do you know...

652
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,360
how horrible it feels
to slowly suffocate to death?

653
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:26,574
I had no idea how painful it could be...

654
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,495
until Ploy told me about her experience.

655
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:45,009
You were merciless...

656
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,304
to leave Ploy to die like that.

657
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:54,811
I've had your favorite tea prepared
since early this evening.

658
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:57,480
It's a pity...

659
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,567
that it's not hot anymore.

660
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,513
<i>I love you too, Madame.</i>

661
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,675
<i>Thank you, sir,</i>
<i>for taking care of everything.</i>

662
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,845
It ended so well because of you.

663
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:41,936
Sir,

664
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:44,772
please let me explain.

665
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:53,531
Well...

666
01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:56,325
I've already tried to talk.

667
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,131
Sir...

668
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,261
I don't want a promotion.

669
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:17,763
I don't want money.

670
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,349
I don't want a mansion.

671
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:24,312
And I don't want your daughter anymore.

672
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,482
I'm going to have a drink now.

673
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:56,362
Ploy.

674
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:17,633
Ploy.

675
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:19,302
Ploy.

676
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:24,682
Ploy!

677
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,144
Ploy.

678
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:43,409
Ploy.

679
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:46,412
Ploy.

680
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:58,521
Nid.

681
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:00,397
Nid.

682
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:02,525
Wake up.

683
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:05,736
Ms. Joy?

684
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,281
Aunt Joy.

685
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:14,161
Let's get out of here.

686
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:21,794
Wait for me outside.
