INA REVIEW

5
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,833
Hi. I'm Ina,

6
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,583
reviewing everything
in and out of this world, episode one.

7
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,542
Today, I'm reviewing my own ghetto-ness.

8
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,292
This is my wall of debt
worth 500,000 baht.

9
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,417
Being in debt is like
being married to poverty.

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,250
Once you're married,
you must find a way to live together.

11
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:06,750
DECEMBER

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,208
I've been paying it off for a year.

13
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:09,917
I have four more years to go.

14
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,542
It's way too long.

15
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,830
The first year of torture is over.

16
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,333
My salary is a bit over 10,000
minus what I owe.

17
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,417
After I pay my rent, I have exactly 1,500.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,583
Can I get by?

19
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,375
Here are my secrets for saving.

20
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,667
I iron at work.

21
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,833
After work, I stop to pee at the mall
and take the toilet paper home.

22
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:33,542
I do make up like no makeup.

23
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,292
Natural beauty.

24
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:41,917
It's cheap but chic.

25
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:46,333
Are you wondering about how I eat?
What do I eat to stay alive?

26
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:49,417
It's bananas grouped by color.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,583
Dark yellow is for today.

28
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,500
Super green is for next week.

29
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,625

31

00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:08,583
SRISAWAD

36
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:13,375
Enter your info
and car photo into the app…

37
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,583
Ma'am, you've already missed
two installments.

38
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,292
You have an overdue balance
of 18,000 baht.

39
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,250
Ina.

40
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,708
I want to pay,

41
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:29,792
but I invested the 500,000 I got
in the snail mucus cream and…

42
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,125
It isn't selling at all.

43
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,625
Don't trick your student.

44
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,375
Pajayra--

45
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,583
Ma'am.

46
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,208
I remember the Pajayra teacher song,

47
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,333
but the Pajero you pledged as collateral

48
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,792
will get repossessed
at the end of this month.

49
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,958
One second, ma'am.

50
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,375
Go ahead, dear.

51
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,417
Hello?

52
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,583
Who's calling?

53
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,830
Ma'am!

54
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,958
Ma'am!

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,250
I gotta go!

56
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,208
Hey.

57
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:17,708
Ma'am, you forgot your loafer.

58
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:18,833
Keep it!

59
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,792
Or toss it!

60
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,125
Hello.

61
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,458
Hi. I need a moment of your time.

62
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,708
Ms. Ina Jitimaim,
you accept donations on YouTube, right?

63
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,750
Yes.

64
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,125
I'm Wichai Kuenkow.
I'm an official from the tax department.

65
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,000
Buri Ram, zone 14.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,625
The tax department?

67
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,792
That's correct.

68
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,333
You can look up this number

69
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,500
and verify it on the Internet.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,875
One second.

71
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,750
BURI RAM TAX DEPARTMENT, ZONE 14

72
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,250
Okay. Can I help you?

73
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,958
I'm calling to inform you

74
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,958
of a money transfer
to your savings account at JNBC

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,958
under account number 5-9648-117-48

76
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,583
in the total amount of 55,000 baht.

77
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,125
Did you say 55,000?

78
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,208
AMOUNT OF 500
TRANSFER

79
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,292
What?

80
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,167
YOU HAVE 500 BAHT DEPOSITED
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT

81
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:24,958
Wait.

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,333
But there is only 500 baht deposited.

83
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:31,917
That's correct. We can't release the money
into your account yet.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,208
Why?

85
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,125
When donations are made
to personal accounts

86
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,875
that aren't qualified as nonprofits,

87
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,167
they fall into tax classification eight

88
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,167
and are subject to withholding tax

89
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,292
at ten percent.

90
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,583
-So I need to transfer 5,500 first.
-That's correct.

91
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,917
Then our system will release
the money to you.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,830
Then I'll make the transfer now.

93
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,458
TRANSFER

94
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,417
YOUR INTERNET DATA HAS RUN OUT
PLEASE TOP UP

95
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,833
Why does it have to run out now?

96
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,750
Give me your account number.

97
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:12,792
Six-zero-two.

98
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,208
Six-seven-eight.

99
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,500
One-zero-one-zero.

100
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,125
It's 5,500, right?

101
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,208
It's 5,500 in total.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,917
Number 134, please come to window eight.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PLEASE ENTER TRANSFER AMOUNT

104
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,333
CONFIRM

105
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:51,458
ACCOUNT NAME
MR. WICHAI KUENKOW

106
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,417
Wait.

107
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,125
Why is it an individual account name,

108
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,830
not the tax department's account?

109
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,500
We use an official's name
for auditing purposes.

110
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,417
MR. WICHAI KUENKOW

111
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,833
CANCEL

112
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,542
One moment. The ATM rejected my card.

113
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,875
I'm switching to another one.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,125
Tangdong, check this account for me.

115
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,125
Who transferred me that last 500 baht?

116
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,917
Who is it?

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,375
A call center scammer.

118
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,542
Okay.

119
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,625
Have you completed the transaction?

120
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,625
There's no amount showing.

121
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,333
The ATM is slow.

122
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,542
Please be quick.
I have many more calls to make.

123
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,500
Sir,

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,167
the number five button is broken.

125
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,125
Will pressing one and four
at the same time work?

126
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,792
What's the matter with you?
I'm not your friend.

127
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,792
Let me tell you the joke is on you.
You're a fake officer.

128
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,375
The account is fake.

129
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,375
Did you steal Mr. Wichai's account?

130
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,167
You scumbag.

131
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,167
You dried piece of dog shit. You parasite.

132
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,417
Hey! Isn't that too harsh?

133
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,792
You haven't lost one baht. I've lost 500.

134
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,125
You deserve it.

135
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,417
You better eat what you crave for now.

136
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
You're going to jail.

137
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,667
What can a net weirdo
like you do to catch me?

138
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,125
I've conned a cop's wife before.

139
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,625
Ina.

140
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,208
ID CARD
MR. TEWA SUPPAPAISAN

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,958
Your eyebrows look like leeches.

142
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,000
Mr. Tewa Suppapaisan.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,583
Number 4111 Niwas Road,
Isan Sub-district, Muang District,

144
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,917
Buri Ram Province.

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,333
-How the hell?
-You're screwed.

146
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,208
You're trying to con an ex-banker.

147
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,750
I'm going to post your voice clip online.

148
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,750
You'll be famous.
Turn on the TV and watch.

149
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,583
Ellen and Amanpour
will be talking about you.

150
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,583
-Wait.
-Bye.

151
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,958
I'm so screwed.

152
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,250
Hello?

153
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,542
It's me, Leech Eyebrows.

154
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,917
Don't hang up.

155
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,500
I feel guilty.

156
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,667
Can I pay one month of your installments?

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,333
JANUARY

158
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,125
Money can't buy me.

159
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,625
How about I go see you?

160
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,708
It'll just take a minute.
You delete the recording,

161
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,750
and I'll knock two post-its off your wall.

162
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,420
JANUARY, FEBRUARY

163
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:03,458
It's your chance to get someone
to pay your debts.

164
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:07,750
Someone to pay your debts…

165
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,708
Are you there?

166
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,830
If you want the recording deleted,
meet me tomorrow.

167
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,208
Hello.

168
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,167
It's the white car.

169
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:41,792
To your right.

170
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,500
Where? I don't see any cars.

171
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,917
Do you know left from right?

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,333
To the right.

173
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,125
Yes, I’m right here.

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
You stole a car?

175
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,625
Get in the car and let's make a deal.

176
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,583
No. You come out.

177
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,833
You get over here.

178
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll only talk in a public space.

179
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,208
Stop!

180
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,420
Not you. Keep moving.

181
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,375
Thank you.

182
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,417
What's wrong with you? Scat.

183
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,583
Jesus. She even talks to a dog.

184
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,583
Stop.

185
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,417
Show me your hands. Lift up your shirt.

186
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you armed?

187
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,000
Are you joking?

188
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,750
I'm serious.

189
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:53,833
Higher.

190
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,750
Higher.

191
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,500
You're going to see my nipples.

192
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,458
Higher.

193
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,125
Are you a weirdo? Seriously.

194
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,583
You might have weapons up there.

195
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,333
You look like a newborn goat.

196
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,167
So what?

197
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,167
Nothing.

198
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,208
Are you any good at conning people?

199
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,708
I caught you.

200
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,417
I got unlucky. How was I supposed to know
you were an ex-banker?

201
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,292
Well?

202
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,208
If you don't talk, I'll leave.

203
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,542
-Bye.
-Hold on.

204
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,833
Someone is refusing
to pay back what they owe.

205
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,375
If you can get the money back,
I will delete the recording.

206
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,208
Who is it?

207
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,917
It's my friend.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,375
Her boy toy took her money.

209
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,583
Your boy toy took your money.

210
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,542
If you don't tell me the truth,
I'll just wing it.

211
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,625
-We met through a dating app.
-Right.

212
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,833
I was a banker. He was in his fourth year.
We dated for two months.

213
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,583
He had money problems,
so I wired him 2,000 baht.

214
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,208
You look bigger in person.

215
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,208
Nice teeth like a cob of corn.

216
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,917
Do you like my smile?

217
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,500
If you do, I will smile all the time.

218
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,875
You also look

219
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,958
a lot cuter in person.

220
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,875
Let's switch seats.

221
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,830
Your side has smoke. Your hair will smell.

222
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,333
Oh, right.

223
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,375
I thought of surprising you later.

224
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,208
But since you saw it already,
I'll give it to you now.

225
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,542
Here's the money I borrowed from you.

226
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,208
And this

227
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,625
is the interest.

228
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,417
After that meal, we became a couple.

229
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,125
Leaving for Khon Kaen Province.

230
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,167
Drive along.

231
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,167
-What?
-Follow me in your car.

232
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,167
Right before graduation,

233
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,208
Petch had money problems again.

234
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,583
I see.

235
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,542
He paid back the money
to borrow more later.

236
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,125
So you were his sugar mommy.

237
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,542
How do you know?

238
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,250
It's only a transcript.

239
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,875
Not having one won't matter.

240
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,333
I have the knowledge I need to get by.

241
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,208
But you need a transcript
to apply for jobs.

242
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,875
Otherwise, who will believe
you really graduated?

243
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,542
How about this? I'll get a bank loan.
You can borrow it to pay your tuition.

244
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,292
No, it's okay.

245
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,125
I don't want to bother you.

246
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,833
It's 500,000 baht.

247
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,417
But I want to do it for you.

248
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,420
Really?

249
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,500
The reason I love you more everyday

250
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,917
is because you have a big heart.

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,250
It's as big as the ocean.

252
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,000
POLICE STATION

253
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:32,917
Ina.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,875
Do you want me
to pay back what I don't owe?

255
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:41,830
I wanted to take care of you forever.

256
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,583
But now that I see this side of you,

257
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,542
I don't think we should be together.

258
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,417
Petch.

259
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,250
Petch, wait!

260
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,583
I won't ask you to pay anymore.
Don't pay me back.

261
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,375
But please don't leave me.

262
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,667
You can stay.

263
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,792
But I'm leaving.

264
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,875
The cop said I gave the money willingly.
There was no contract.

265
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,667
-This guy is something.
-Why are you giving him props?

266
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,542
No. I'm just analyzing him.

267
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,750
There you have it.

268
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,250
The end of my happiness.
The cause of my pain.

269
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,420
The deadbeat ex.

270
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,958
-Follow me.
-Hey.

271
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,583
KANOKPON TOUR

272
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,708
This is Ms. Kanokpon.

273
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,250
Petch is leeching off of her.

274
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,583
She owns a bunch of tour branches.
She lets Petch be the manager here.

275
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,208
That's him.

276
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,250
How much do you want?

277
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,625
I want 500,000.

278
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:02,792
I'll do it.

279
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,000
Delete the recording now.

280
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:07,667
Okay.

281
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,125
PARASITE CONS EX-BANKER.MP3

282
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,958
The name makes me want to toss your phone.

283
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,458
It's done. I deleted it.

284
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,708
Can I ask you something first?

285
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,458
Do you think Petch meant
to con me from the start?

286
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,208
"The reason I love you more every day

287
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,458
is because you are

288
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:41,750
kindhearted."

289
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,792
"Your heart is as big as the ocean."

290
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,420
-What?
-I read his lips just now.

291
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,667
He said it to Kanokpon.

292
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,542
Liar.

293
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,420
"Let's kill this love,
rum, pum, pum, pum."

294
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,125
"Cupcake cooks cook cupcakes."

295
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,958
You con artist with tiny nipple tits.

296
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,833
What is your problem with my nipples?

297
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,333
Hey!

298
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,708
Hey. Chill out.

299
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,958
I don't fancy weirdos.

300
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,208
What's your name?

301
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,333
Tower.

302
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,292
-Is that your real name?
-I just made it up.

303
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:23,833
All right?

304
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,750
Are there no more questions?

305
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,792
PARASITE

306
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,125
I've got an awesome plan.

307
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,917
URGENT BUSINESS CARDS

308
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,292
Our plan is to trick Petch
into booking a hotel.

309
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,375
We'll pretend to be the hotel staff

310
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,542
and wait for the money from Petch.

311
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,208
Will someone in the tour business
fall for a hotel scam?

312
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,583
He knows more than us.

313
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,667
Using what he knows well

314
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:15,625
makes the con work.

315
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:20,750
First of all,

316
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,667
we must disguise ourselves
and survey the hotel.

317
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,917
I already picked the hotel.

318
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
It's the Le Grand Khon Kaen.

319
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,583
"CBP"? What does it stand for?

320
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,417
Check Bill Petch.

321
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,250
I like it. It's a good name.

322
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,708
By the way,

323
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,208
use fake names.

324
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,750
Okay, boss. Let's do it.

325
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,125
Unless necessary, don't speak.

326
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,333
If you get in a jam,

327
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,167
just smile. Okay?

328
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,333
Hello.

329
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,167
Welcome to Le Grand Khon Kaen.

330
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,625
Sorry to keep you waiting.

331
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,167
I'm from Chok Boon Pa Travel, Buri Ram.

332
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,420
-I would like--
-I'm sorry

333
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,250
for not making an appointment.

334
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,420
Actually, we are here to sherbet.

335
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,125
"Sherbet"?

336
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,500
She meant we came to do a survey.

337
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,875
I see. A survey.

338
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,875
I'm Yingyod. This is my secretary.

339
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,500
Ina Jitimaim.

340
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,792
Your drink is so refreshing.

341
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,583
Oh, yes.

342
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,625
-It's amazing.
-Yes.

343
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,167
I'm Sam.

344
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,833
-Did you see that?
-Yes.

345
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,875
Samson.

346
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,833
My full name is Seksan Srangsuansua.

347
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,917
You can call me Sam or Samson.

348
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,420
Whatever suits you.

349
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,375
Whatever is easiest.

350
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,125
Our hotel has these kinds of rooms.

351
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,667
Standard superior, 300 rooms.

352
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,375
Deluxe special, 43 rooms.

353
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,917
And our best seller…

354
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,000
Executive suite, 30 rooms.

355
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:33,167
They come with a workstation, Jacuzzi,
and free minibar refills.

356
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,625
Our service is superb.

357
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,333
Is his splash guard broken?

358
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,292
Hey.

359
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,625
We can talk and drink. Please.

360
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,208
Your coffee is getting cold.

361
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,458
Drink some.

362
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,125
We aren't coffee people.

363
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,167
Right.

364
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,417
How about I get the help
to bring you some orange juice?

365
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,917
Orange juice.

366
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,917
-How about--
-Mr. Sam.

367
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,292
May I have the executive suite rate?

368
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,458
Sure.

369
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,917
The tour rate is lower
than the walk-in rate

370
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,333
by ten to forty percent

371
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:18,375
depending on the season. I'll check.

372
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,625
He should be quarantined.

373
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,542
Do you have tissue?

374
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,208
-No.
-What?

375
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,125
Use this so you don't get the virus.

376
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,792
Here. Mister--

377
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,000
Mister--

378
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,667
Mister--

379
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,833
-Yingyod.
-Yes, Yingyod.

380
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,333
Mr. Yingyod.

381
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,292
I'm so forgetful.

382
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,500
No.

383
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,833
-What?
-What?

384
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,750
I forgot to feed the dog this morning.

385
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,333
-I see.
-I'm forgetful.

386
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,208
Me too.

387
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,375
Hey.

388
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,333
It seems the air conditioner is leaking.

389
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,792
I'll call the repairman.

390
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:23,958
-Mr. Sam.
-Yes?

391
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,375
Do you know Petch from Kanokpon Tour?

392
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,750
Yes, I know him.

393
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,792
We meet often.
Petch always brings us customers.

394
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,833
Do you know him?

395
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:36,750
We meet sometimes
at tour operator seminars.

396
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,125
Petch is very nice.

397
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,167
During holidays, he always sends me gifts.

398
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,542
Sometimes, he lets me go abroad for free.

399
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,167
But never mind. I'm just saying.

400
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,417
Have you seen
the Northern lights in Russia?

401
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,667
It's very bright around this time.

402
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,958
No. I've only seen pictures.
I've always wanted to go.

403
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,208
You're in luck.
I have a quota for a round trip ticket.

404
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,333
No, we don't.

405
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,750
We do.

406
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,125
If you say so, Mr. Yingyod.

407
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,208
But I think it's just to Myanmar.

408
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,208
What?

409
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:17,750
I checked the email
and I'm sure it said Russia,

410
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,125
not Myanmar.

411
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,417
Go check again. Go.

412
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,458
My secretary hasn't been
thinking straight lately.

413
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,500
-Can I have a few pieces of A4 paper?
-Sure.

414
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,417
So,

415
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,833
I'll arrange your ticket
to Russia right away.

416
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,708
Suzie, my girlfriend, will complain

417
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,917
if I go see the Northern lights alone.

418
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'll make it two.

419
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,458
That's too much.

420
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,125
It's over our budget.

421
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:44,917
Don't worry. I'll get you two tickets.

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,667
-To Russia?
-Yes, sir.

423
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,542
-Please prepare to take time off.
-You're a true hustler, Mr. Yingyod.

424
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,167
I'll buy some Heattech.

425
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,750
How much will be left of my 500,000?

426
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,792
You need to invest a bit.

427
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,583
It will ruin our plan,
letting Sam run into Petch.

428
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,167
If we include the costs,

429
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,750
how much should we con out of him?
Is 550,000 enough?

430
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:08,958
Three million.

431
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,917
That's funny.

432
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,167
This plan will need more than just us.

433
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,000
What?

434
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,667
Our goal is three million baht.

435
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,458
You and the person
who will play the client,

436
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,542
you're amateurs. You get 500,000 each.

437
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,625
That's one million gone.

438
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,458
The person who will take Sam's place

439
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:39,420
and wait for the money is a pro.
His fee is one million.

440
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,420
And the last million?

441
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,417
For me, the mastermind.

442
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,000
-No way.
-Why?

443
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,708
We made a deal already.

444
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,333
You deleted the recording.

445
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,500
I work a con to get money.

446
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,667
I'm not a saint who helps people for free.

447
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,500
I knew that you would be like this.

448
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,000
About your recording,
I didn't really delete it.

449
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,333
Hey!

450
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:12,958
Delete the clip.

451
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,417
PARASITE CONS EX-BANKER.MP3

452
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,167
CANCEL

453
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,830
It's done. I deleted it.

454
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,708
I also knew you'd be like this.

455
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,420
So I deleted it myself.

456
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,625
It's gone!

457
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,292
We're going to con
three million out of him.

458
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,333
I am as bad as you.

459
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,750
Don't stress.

460
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,167
Conning a bad guy doesn't make us bad.

461
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,208
He must learn a hard lesson,

462
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,830
so he knows what it's like to be conned.

463
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,167
Make him remember.

464
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,000
Make sure he cons no one again.

465
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,458
There. That's my elementary school
Chinese teacher.

466
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,667
She's currently in debt to my company.

467
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,125
Her car is about to get repossessed.

468
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,583
She needs cash
more than anyone in Buri Ram.

469
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,420
Are you leaving already?

470
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:47,375
See? Nobody wants to go near her.
They're afraid she'll borrow their money.

471
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,125
She can speak Chinese.

472
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,750
She's the best choice
to play the Chinese client.

473
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,833
We'll give her a makeover to look rich.

474
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,792
Let's go. It's a deal.

475
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,208
Eat.

476
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,250
Jiat.

477
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:12,667
Eat rice.

478
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,458
Jiat beung.

479
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,250
Drink tea.

480
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,125
-Jiat de.
-Freeloader.

481
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,125
You bootlicker!

482
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,750
She's good. She's a quick thinker.

483
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,625
Okay.

484
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,667
You will be our bait.

485
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,875
You'll play a foxy rich cougar

486
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,875
to attract our wolf.

487
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,583
You might need to lead Petch on.

488
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,625
Petch likes to con women.

489
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,292
We're going to use this to our advantage.

490
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,833
A wolf thinks only
about attacking its prey.

491
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,292
He would never suspect

492
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,458
that a sheep would trick him.

493
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,708
Let's go wolf hunting.

494
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:06,167
Why do we have to meet Petch in Bangkok?

495
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,958
We can go to Kanokpon Tour in Khon Kaen.

496
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,792
-It's much closer.
-I don't know.

497
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,875
An office will make us look more legit.

498
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,292
We're conning
three million out of him, not 300.

499
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:15,208
Right.

500
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,667
How can we go up to the office?

501
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,875
We won't.

502
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:26,833
We will tell Petch to meet us
at the lobby.

503
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:30,250
I started the game
by contacting Petch already,

504
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:34,333
posing as someone from Lhingwu,
a Chinese beer company.

505
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,583
I emailed Kanokpon Tour.

506
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:39,167
I created a fake email account

507
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,333
and made it look like
Lhingwu's company email.

508
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,500
I said I wanted him to arrange a tour.

509
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,667
The email was signed by Ms. Kluay,
Secretary of Ms. Liu, the CEO.

510
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:51,208
It caught Petch's eye
and he replied right away.

511
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,875
Hey!

512
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:57,000
We agreed to meet
at Lhingwu's office at 10:00 a.m.

513
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,250
All done.

514
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,917
Lhingwu Beer on the 12th floor, please.

515
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,167
Okay.

516
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,125
Here.

517
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,500
SECRETARY KLUAY

518
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,958
KLUAY LHINGWU
SEE YOU AT THE COFFEE SHOP IN THE LOBBY

519
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,000
-I'm sorry.
-Yes?

520
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,583
I won't be going up. May I have my ID?

521
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,833
Of course.

522
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,375
Here.

523
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,500
CEO LIU

524
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,125
Bye-bye, Yingyod, my buddy.

525
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,458
Sam took off.

526
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,333
We have six days and five nights
before he comes back.

527
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:50,167
Hey.

528
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,500
Ni hao.

529
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,167
Hi. I'm Liu,

530
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,708
the CEO of Lhingwu Beer Thailand.

531
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,125
Hello. I'm Petch from Kanokpon Tour.

532
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,625
I never thought
the owner would come down herself.

533
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,917
I must apologize.

534
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,583
My office upstairs is a mess.

535
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,333
The repairman changed his schedule.

536
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:18,167
That's why I changed our meeting to here.

537
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,250
It's not a problem.

538
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,500
I told you.

539
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,333
She's the campfire star.
She's always the best performer.

540
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,292
Damn. Look at her go.

541
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,542
Please have a seat.

542
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,375
Ms. Liu.

543
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,830
Switch seats with me.
The sun is in your eyes.

544
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,000
Please.

545
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,333
Excuse me. I need to take this call.

546
00:34:58,417 --> 00:34:59,292
Please.

547
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,625
I have a meeting today.
I'll be in Shanghai in two days.

548
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,167
Have the contract drafted.

549
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:10,333
Ten million yuan is fine.

550
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,875
Your accent is very charming.

551
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,792
You sound like a Chinese movie star.

552
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:22,417
What did my assistant inform you about?

553
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,458
She had me book 30 rooms
at a five-star hotel

554
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,500
for the research and management team.

555
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:31,750
The Chinese team wants to survey
the rice in the Northeast

556
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,542
to develop a new beer formula.

557
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:37,625
I see. I brought you a list
of five-star hotels.

558
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:38,708
I think

559
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,420
you will like it for sure.

560
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,417
I'm sure I will.

561
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,458
I wish I was 20 years younger.

562
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,792
Oh, well.

563
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:58,250
-Jesus.
-My goodness.

564
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,125
This is a public space.
You can't stretch your legs here.

565
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,208
Mind your manners.

566
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,708
-Are you doing yoga?
-I'm sorry.

567
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:09,333
Why don't you just lie down?

568
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,542
Damn it.

569
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,000
Sir.

570
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,420
How can you talk to your boss like that?

571
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:19,958
What boss?

572
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,792
I'm my own boss! The coffee spilled
on my nipples. They're swelling.

573
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,667
"He's an employee at your company."

574
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,292
"He's being disrespectful to you."

575
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,417
"Aren't you going to scold him?"

576
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,292
"Don't expect me to apologize, lady!"

577
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,167
"I'm not wrong." Damn it.

578
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,167
Who said that?

579
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,420
Me!

580
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,292
She can't hear her phone.

581
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,420
He works at Lhingwu.

582
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,667
-How come he doesn't know you?
-How old are you?

583
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,417
You're lucky I don't call you auntie.

584
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,583
I'm not saying sorry.

585
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,500
Go be bossy at home.

586
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,917
I'm not apologizing.
I'd rather say sorry to a cat.

587
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,625
Hey!

588
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,375
I'll have to discipline my staff.

589
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,125
What department are you from?

590
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,333
Didn't they inform you that

591
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:38,750
the head office would send me here

592
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,917
to reorganize this company?

593
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,125
You don't care
about the company's affairs.

594
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,333
You're clueless about who comes and goes.

595
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,625
Cross your arms.

596
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,292
Do you know Lhingwu's Chinese motto?

597
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,167
No, I don't.

598
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,125
Study hard.

599
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,125
Have discipline.

600
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,667
Be in pursuit of virtue.

601
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:14,667
I'll send you to study Lhingwu's motto
in China for a year.

602
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,250
Go say goodbye to your wife.

603
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,333
I'm sorry. Don't send me away.

604
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:21,208
My kid is still small. My wife is young.

605
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,625
My cat at home is old.
Please don't send me away.

606
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,583
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,375
I won't hold it against you.

608
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:30,417
But please pay attention and care more

609
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,167
-about our company.
-Yes, ma'am.

610
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,833
Otherwise, I'll deduct your merit points.

611
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:34,917
What?

612
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,375
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:41,333
I--

614
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,125
Oh, right.

615
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:46,875
We have a system
of awarding merit points to our staff.

616
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,417
That was close.

617
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,458
You're up next.

618
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,125
Get ready. Keep him distracted.

619
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,125
Here you go.

620
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,917
I recommend these two hotels,

621
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,458
The Royal and Le Grand Khon Kaen.

622
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,208
The Royal is cheaper.

623
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:10,583
It must be Le Grand only, Petch.

624
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,875
And I need to have
the most expensive rooms

625
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,708
because the care
of my partners needs to be perfect.

626
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:17,917
They bring me
hundreds of millions each year.

627
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,292
As in yuan, not baht.

628
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:33,542
Oh, one moment.

629
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,750
-Hello.
-Get his phone.

630
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,375
Petch, may I borrow your phone
to calculate the yuan exchange rate?

631
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,750
Sure.

632
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,420
He's handing his phone to her.

633
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,667
Go!

634
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,167
-Ms. Liu.
-Yes?

635
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,917
Will you excuse me?

636
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,792
Take your time.

637
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,458
Ina, what are you doing in Bangkok?

638
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,125
-Hey.
-Petch.

639
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,583
What happened?

640
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:35,708
Nothing happened.

641
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:38,750
-I happen--
-What?

642
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,125
I happen to be in trouble.

643
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,250
My new boyfriend beats me.

644
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,458
He beats me every day.

645
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,208
I had to move to Bangkok

646
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,417
to find a job.

647
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,333
NO RESULTS

648
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:06,875
What did he save Sam's number as?

649
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,583
Who is your boyfriend?

650
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,333
He's a boxer.

651
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,917
Do you know him?
He's Vin Diesel The Rock Cena McGregor.

652
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,792
Let the police help you.
I'm with a client.

653
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Petch.

654
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,792
Le Grand.

655
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:30,000
NO RESULTS

656
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,583
Did you find it?

657
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,542
Not yet.

658
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,167
Do you have Tony Jaa's number?

659
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,167
-I need to learn how to fight.
-Stop it.

660
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,830
You know how to fight.
You can teach me. Come on.

661
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:52,958
Petch.

662
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,625
Petch, I lied.

663
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,667
I want you back. Let's get back together.

664
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,375
-Petch!
-Hey!

665
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,667
What are you doing? People are staring.

666
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,167
S--

667
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,667
S--

668
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,708
It's Zamzun!

669
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,167
Oh, shit.

670
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,830
PLEASE DRAW YOUR PATTERN

671
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:22,458
What's wrong with you?

672
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,125
Let me go. Let go.

673
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,417
Let me go.

674
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,750
Okay. Turn around.

675
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,208
I let my hair go. Are you happy?

676
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,958
Have you lost it?

677
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,917
Do you need to see a doctor?

678
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,542
Petch.

679
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,417
Can I go stay with you?

680
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,792
-Ina, let go!
-I can be your driver.

681
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,167
I love you so much.

682
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,250
I'll do anything! I mean it!

683
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,958
Shit. She's not holding back.

684
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,583
A diamond, huh?

685
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:16,917
If you need a kidney, you can have mine.

686
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,500
Mission accomplished. You're mine.

687
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,542
You can take my kidney.

688
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:23,958
Take one of my kidneys.

689
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,708
Take it! Take my kidney!

690
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,292
Petch!

691
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,458
EDIT

692
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,833
Excuse me.

693
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:39,833
This seat,

694
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,333
is it taken?

695
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,125
Go ahead.

696
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,417
SAVE

697
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,125
She's a senior
who stalked me back in school.

698
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,875
You're super charming.

699
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:01,208
Are you done with my phone?

700
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,250
What?

701
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,167
Well?

702
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,417
Petch!

703
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,420
Petch!

704
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,667
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,625
I'm sorry for--

706
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:35,958
Killing this love,
rum, pum, pum, pum, pum.

707
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,125
Ms. Liu.

708
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:47,625
I'm really sorry.

709
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:50,167
It's all right.

710
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:54,375
You're cute. I'm not surprised
that girls are crazy for you.

711
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:56,417
Here.

712
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,750
-Your phone.
-Thanks.

713
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:02,875
I'll call the hotel
to make your booking then.

714
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,830
Hey.

715
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,667
PETCH KANOKPON TOUR

716
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,750
DECLINE

717
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:46,542
FAKE SAMSON

718
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:54,458
I'M AT A SEMINAR IN RUSSIA.
MY SALES GUY, PONGSAKORN, WILL CALL.

719
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,000
The hotel just sent me a message.

720
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,833
Their head of sales went abroad,

721
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,875
but they will send someone in his place.

722
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:05,708
But after today,

723
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,125
can I contact you directly?

724
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:10,375
If you don't call,

725
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,792
I'll be mad at you.

726
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,875
Even if you get mad,
I'm good at making up.

727
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:45,875
Aren't you being too emotional?

728
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,625
Patch up your pants.
The edge of your panties are showing.

729
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,750
Not even close.

730
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,292
SECRETARY KLUAY

731
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,458
Is that a distraction technique?

732
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,833
What technique?

733
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,167
You're distracting me.

734
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:25,708
You wish.

735
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:43,500
RESIDENT PARKING ONLY

736
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:49,000
SECRETARY KLUAY

737
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:54,208
PARASITE

738
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,375
SAVE

739
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:04,125
WICHAI, TEWA, YINGYOD,
SECRETARY KLUAY, TOWER

740
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,250
Ina.

741
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:10,792
Look. Petch just sent me a flirty message.

742
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:13,750
Is it okay that I miss you?

743
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,125
He sent me a goodnight sticker.
What should I do?

744
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:19,125
Send him a heart spam.

745
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,417
Fire away.

746
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,750
MOM

747
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:34,833
Hello, Mom.

748
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,333
Is Petch still paying you back?

749
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:38,208
He pays me every month.

750
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,542
Are you together or did you break up
without telling me?

751
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:42,917
We are still smitten.

752
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,208
Good. Remind him
to send money on the nose.

753
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:50,167
If they take the land,
I'll have no place to sleep.

754
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:53,292
If he gets a bonus,

755
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,333
I'll use it to close our debt.

756
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:56,667
It's good if you can close it.

757
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,458
I won't let the bank take your land, Mom.

758
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:07,542
Hey.

759
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,292
I'm hungry.

760
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,417
Let's go find something to eat.

761
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,417
WILAI'S PORK BLOOD SOUP

762
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,333
Were you asleep or awake?

763
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,375
You weren't reading my lips, right?

764
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,625
You're so full of yourself.

765
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:24,917
You're not that interesting.

766
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,125
What would you like to drink?

767
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,958
Iced coffee, chrysanthemum,
or longan juice?

768
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,458
The tea is fine. It's free.

769
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:38,583
Took you long enough.

770
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,333
Where did you learn to read lips?

771
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:44,958
Well,

772
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:46,583
when I was in jail,

773
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:49,750
the TV was on, but the sound was off.

774
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:50,917
So, I learned to read lips.

775
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,875
I don't believe everything I hear.

776
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,792
You're lying. I can tell.

777
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,625
If you can see through people,

778
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,333
how did you get conned out of 500,000?

779
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,250
When you're in love, you believe anything.

780
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:07,583
Who would think
the person you love will con you?

781
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,750
You have no girlfriend.
You won't understand.

782
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:18,583
Here's your pork blood soup with no blood.

783
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:23,417
Won't you answer me?

784
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,830
Silence is my answer.

785
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,000
My answer is no.

786
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:29,917
It's boring.

787
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,125
Flirting is like conning.

788
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,542
Guys just fake being nice

789
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,542
to get in your pants.

790
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,583
It's just another con.

791
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,917
I won't argue with you.
A dummy like me won't win.

792
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,875
Hey.

793
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,500
It has nothing to do with being dumb.

794
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:51,667
You only have one problem.

795
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,000
You met a bad guy. That’s all.

796
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,875
You know what they say.

797
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:03,333
A player on the field can't read the game.

798
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,830
It's mushy.

799
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:09,958
This is so mushy.

800
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,292
Hey.

801
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,792
-Look and tell me what it is.
-I don't know.

802
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:16,917
It's yummy.

803
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,625
Excuse me. What is this?

804
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:21,625
I'm not sure. Open your mouth wider.

805
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,875
Wilai, come look at this.

806
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,708
What is this? It's yummy.

807
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,583
It's either spleen or kidney.

808
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,500
I'm not sure.

809
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:33,667
It's intestine.

810
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,750
Wow. Your car is fierce.

811
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,250
But you drive slow like my grandma.

812
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,583
I don't like to drive fast.

813
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I get car sick when the car goes fast.

814
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,792
-Film it but don't post it.
-Choo choo.

815
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:51,458
I'm Ina, reviewing everything
in and out of this world, episode two.

816
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:54,250
Today, I'm reviewing sleeping
in a convertible.

817
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,250
Why do you sleep in your car?
What's good about it?

818
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,125
It's easy to get away.

819
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:02,875
It's an answer that befits a con artist.

820
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:05,500
Con artists must sleep in their cars.

821
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,375
Hey!

822
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:37,292
A picture of St. Basil's Cathedral
for my buddy.

823
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:51,375
The booking details
for 30 executive suites.

824
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,208
For the duration of 30 days,
the total price is

825
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,375
three…

826
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:02,125
TOTAL OF 3,600,000 BAHT

827
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,500
You said we would do three million.

828
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:05,917
What is this?

829
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,500
You're conning 600,000 more out of him?

830
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,125
No. I left room to negotiate.

831
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,625
Come on.

832
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:14,583
Here.

833
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,875
A tour company normally transfers
money to the hotel.

834
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,500
We won't get that money. So what do we do?

835
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,167
We give him a discount as bait.

836
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,417
Pressure him to pay cash.

837
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,458
Pay cash to get a discount.

838
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:30,167
You took that from a food promotion.

839
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,500
The guy who plays the salesman is coming.

840
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:35,458
He's never late.

841
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,458
Is he a man or a ghost?

842
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,750
How amazing.

843
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,500
He's my brother.

844
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:54,458
His name is Jone.

845
00:53:54,542 --> 00:53:56,500
Jones as in an English name?

846
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,792
It's Jone as in a crook in Thai.

847
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,167
-How are you?
-Damn.

848
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,125
Is that how young people say hi?

849
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,125
I'm good.

850
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,167
Here.

851
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,875
Show me some love.

852
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,833
I carried you
since your willy was a tiny lizard.

853
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,708
Now, it is a gecko.

854
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:34,792
He's embarrassed.

855
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,792
He likes to be carried
since he was little.

856
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,292
When I rock him, he falls asleep.

857
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,830
It's a flawless plan with lots of details.

858
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,708
I trained him myself.

859
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,167
Can we trust this guy?

860
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,417
Of course. We crawled out together.

861
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,750
Are you siblings? You don't look alike.

862
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:06,458
We crawled out of prison together.

863
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:11,830
Three million, bro.

864
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:12,917
Later.

865
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,542
He came like a crook.

866
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,875
And took off like a thief.

867
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:28,625
Mr. Petch.

868
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,792
I'm Pongsakorn from Le Grand Hotel.

869
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,875
Mr. Sam told me to call you.

870
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,125
Please tell me all the requirements.

871
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:43,833
Thank you.

872
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,750
We arrived at the airport.

873
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,542
Aren't you getting out, sir?

874
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,333
I changed my plans.

875
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:53,167
Please drop me off in town.

876
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:58,292
Mr. Petch, I'm in front of Kanokpon Tour.

877
00:55:58,375 --> 00:55:59,417
Please come in.

878
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:28,875
The weather is very hot.

879
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:34,667
GRAND TOTAL OF 3,600,000 BAHT

880
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:40,458
It says 3.6 million.

881
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:42,250
That's correct.

882
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,458
Is 2.7 million okay?

883
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:48,708
Is 2.7 million okay?

884
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:50,830
May I?

885
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:54,958
One moment.

886
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,667
I can accommodate you at 3.5 million.

887
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:13,500
If this price is still too high,

888
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,833
I must apologize on the hotel's behalf.

889
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:18,167
I'll have to keep the rooms.

890
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,333
How about 2.8 million?

891
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,375
If I sell you the rooms at this price,
it's like I'm signing my resignation.

892
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,250
That's okay.

893
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,625
I'll try to talk to the client
about changing hotels.

894
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:40,417
For our next deal,

895
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
I'll try to be of more help.

896
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,708
I must apologize for today.

897
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,875
I'll see myself out. Goodbye.

898
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,917
It must be Le Grand only.

899
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,375
The care of my partners must be perfect.

900
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:18,917
You see,

901
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,167
I want to give you the price you ask for.

902
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,208
But with this much discount,

903
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,542
I'll need to consult with the GM.

904
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:29,708
Thank you.

905
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,958
Just a little rain on the window sometimes

906
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,830
Just a little rain on holiday

907
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:05,250
It might be

908
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:12,333
It might be

909
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,667
Even myself I don't know
What day I'm with you

910
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,125
Always sleepwalking and daydreaming
Every time I look up

911
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:26,167
In the sky a drop of dew falls in my eyes

912
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:28,167
And within today,
How tomorrow will I walk and eat

913
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,125
Will I allow the day and time
To walk how far

914
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,667
But alas the morning sun was not
Glowing bright

915
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,542
Okay, boss. Thank you.

916
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,500
That looked intense.

917
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,292
I had a lot to discuss with the GM.

918
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:48,420
This is the best price we can offer you.

919
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,333
We can give you 3.3 million.

920
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:53,917
-I think--
-But--

921
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,750
My GM proposed that

922
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,167
if you can pay in cash,

923
00:59:58,167 --> 01:00:01,000
we can go as low as three million.

924
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:05,208
If this price is okay,
we can settle the payment terms.

925
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:11,875
Is everything okay?

926
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,875
Our plan is on

927
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:21,250
target!

928
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:23,917
Jone.

929
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,792
Get in before Petch sees you.

930
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:32,958
Petch is calling.

931
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:37,667
We need to play hard to get.

932
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,833
Ms. Liu is having dinner with a client.

933
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:42,830
She can't answer her phone.

934
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,500
Do you have black clothes?

935
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:51,667
My condolences. He was so young.

936
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:54,667
-No blood, please.
-No blood?

937
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,583
No.

938
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:58,250
-Here.
-Spoon, please.

939
01:00:58,333 --> 01:00:59,292
-Here.
-Thank you.

940
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,333
Chinese noodles, Pavilion 2.

941
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:07,833
You call this dinner?

942
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,250
I imagined a fancy dinner.

943
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,830
If you want to eat fancy, eat that.

944
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:12,792
It's food for nobles.

945
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:16,750
More like funereal disposals.

946
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:24,167
Would you like some crooked goods?

947
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,500
Steamed banana sticky rice, Pavilion 4.

948
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:32,667
Jone told me

949
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,208
he taught you the art of conning
when you were five.

950
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,333
Really?

951
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:39,167
I was his distraction technique.

952
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,420
How?

953
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,750
I was such a cute kid then.

954
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:46,420
Jone took me to a gold shop.

955
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,792
He used me as a decoy.

956
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:51,250
I see. So he picked you up this morning

957
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,958
to reminisce about the past.

958
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,417
Every time we meet, he picks me up.

959
01:01:57,417 --> 01:02:00,708
So what you said
about crawling out of prison together,

960
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:01,625
is that for real?

961
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:04,958
Yes.

962
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,333
We got arrested once.

963
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:13,125
I'll play one hand.

964
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,292
-Hurry.
-Here's two.

965
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,417
-I'll win again.
-Here.

966
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,420
Freeze, everyone!

967
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:21,708
-This is the police.
-Hold it. Stop.

968
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,292
-You used to be a cop?
-Yes.

969
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,917
You're all under arrest.

970
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,375
Damn it! A cop is here!

971
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:32,542
Something's wrong.

972
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,792
Are you going to listen?

973
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,792
-Continue.
-Okay.

974
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,792
Save yourselves! Leave everything!

975
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:44,792
Scat.

976
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,875
Deputy Inspector,
I'm off to another gambling ring.

977
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:48,792
Copy that.

978
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:53,625
I know what happened next.

979
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:54,958
You ran into the real deal.

980
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:58,208
Yes. I almost shit my pants.

981
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,292
Hey.

982
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,542
Let me go.

983
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,125
I told you not to gamble, right?

984
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,167
What station are you from?

985
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,875
The city station.

986
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,167
I'm from the city station too.
You don't look familiar.

987
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,458
Hey. Don't stop.

988
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,917
Keep the headlock on.

989
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:25,458
Let me go.

990
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:29,583
Hey. I actually know a lieutenant colonel.

991
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:30,750
A police lieutenant colonel?

992
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,625
Colonel KFC Sanders!

993
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,250
It was game over.

994
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,958
Now we will call Petch.

995
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:44,583
Ask him to pay the hotel in advance.

996
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,500
It's up to Ms. Liu
whether we'll get the money.

997
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,625
Lead him on so this wolf howls in heat.

998
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,458
-Baa.
-Baa.

999
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:55,833
Baa.

1000
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:57,958
-Baa.
-Baa.

1001
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:03,583
-Baa.
-Baa.

1002
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,417
-Call Petch right now.
-Damn.

1003
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,292
Hello, Ms. Liu.

1004
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:16,750
I was going to call
and update you about the hotel.

1005
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,167
I'm so sorry, Petch.

1006
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,583
I was having dinner with a client.

1007
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,417
I couldn't answer your call.

1008
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:27,417
Goodness. You must be tired
from working so late.

1009
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:31,208
I'm not tired at all.

1010
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:32,250
-Hey.
-What?

1011
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,167
You're very dedicated.

1012
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,500
You work all day without any complaints.

1013
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,333
I can't do half as much as you.

1014
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:44,458
You are truly a working woman.

1015
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,833
"Oh, but it would be nice
to have someone take care of me."

1016
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:55,917
Oh, my. Keep talking like that
and I might fall for you.

1017
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,125
I closed the deal on the hotel

1018
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,917
and made an appointment
to make the payment.

1019
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,250
Please arrange the payment accordingly.

1020
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,167
Can you pay in advance first?

1021
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,000
My company is closed for the holidays.

1022
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,250
I'll pay you back after New Year's.

1023
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,830
Pay in advance?

1024
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,875
I'm sorry, Ms. Liu.

1025
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,833
My company can't make an advance payment.

1026
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:39,292
Then I'll postpone paying the hotel
until after New Year's.

1027
01:05:39,917 --> 01:05:41,625
Sam will be back by then.

1028
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,917
There's no need to hurry.
We still have time.

1029
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:50,917
"I'm afraid we will lose our booking."

1030
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,833
"Cremate…"

1031
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:58,625
I can't hear you clearly. Cremate…

1032
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:00,583
Cremate what?

1033
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:03,917
Can't wait to pay after New Year's.

1034
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,500
Can't wait!

1035
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:09,830
I see. If it's about that, it's okay.

1036
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:13,250
Don't worry. It's not a problem
if we lose the booking.

1037
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,420
The Royal is just as good.

1038
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:16,625
No.

1039
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:19,917
I told you that I only want Le Grand.

1040
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,875
Didn't I make myself clear?

1041
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,830
Hey.

1042
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,250
Why did you hang up?

1043
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,917
Well, I'm pissed.
Why did he try to sell me the Royal?

1044
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:59,125
Petch, how about this?

1045
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:03,375
I will use my personal money
to pay you a million baht deposit.

1046
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,417
Actually, I want to pay for it all,

1047
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,542
but I just bought a sports car

1048
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,375
and I don't have enough cash.

1049
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:14,420
But after New Year's,
I will pay you in full.

1050
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,830
Then--

1051
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,875
Okay.

1052
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,750
But can I ride in your sports car?

1053
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,917
My car is four years old.

1054
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,875
Will your company loan me
a million for it?

1055
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:42,250
I think so.

1056
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:43,375
-Cool.
-Hey.

1057
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:47,208
Are you loaning money
to pay Ms. Liu's deposit?

1058
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:51,625
Even if Petch pays us,
we will only get two million.

1059
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,333
I've got a plan
on how to not use that million.

1060
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,333
What?

1061
01:07:56,917 --> 01:07:58,830
Do you know cashier's checks?

1062
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:03,000
This is a cashier's check scam.

1063
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,875
It will get us our three million.

1064
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,292
I'll pledge my car for cash.

1065
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,667
After I get the money,
I'll fly to Bangkok.

1066
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,125
I'll buy a cashier's check
at Lhingwu Building.

1067
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,917
Make the check out to Petch Prateepnon.

1068
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,917
I'll send a picture to Ms. Nongnuch.

1069
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:25,167
She will forward the picture to Petch.

1070
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:28,417
Petch, this is Liu.

1071
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,333
I issued a cashier's check to you
and sent you the picture.

1072
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:33,708
Please check if your name is correct.

1073
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:35,458
My name is correct.

1074
01:08:35,542 --> 01:08:38,333
I'm going to Kalasin tomorrow
to visit a rice farm.

1075
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,167
The plane lands in Khon Kaen.

1076
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,500
Please come pick up your check.

1077
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:43,625
What flight will you be on?

1078
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,417
Do you want me to drive you to Kalasin?

1079
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,792
No need.

1080
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,542
A driver will pick me up.

1081
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:02,875
Tomorrow when you meet Petch,

1082
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:05,542
pretend you forgot the cashier's check.

1083
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:07,708
Will Petch believe me?

1084
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,625
-He won't.
-What?

1085
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,333
He will call the bank.
The bank will verify for us

1086
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:14,875
that the check has been issued.

1087
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,292
Then we will cancel the check later.

1088
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:19,542
This will save us from losing any money.

1089
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,417
This world is such a scary place.

1090
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,583
Are these dogs or polar bears?

1091
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:31,792
Tomorrow I will go hunting
for the Northern lights.

1092
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,167
I'm so excited!

1093
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,830
Ms. Liu.

1094
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:52,500
It's for the most beautiful woman I know.

1095
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:56,917
This is so cute. It will make me miss you.

1096
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,292
My goodness. Why am I so forgetful?

1097
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,500
I forgot to bring you the check.

1098
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,250
What a bummer.

1099
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,542
I really wanted
to give it to you in person.

1100
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:18,667
What?

1101
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,750
But I made an appointment
to make the payment this afternoon.

1102
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,375
What should we do?

1103
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,458
I'm really sorry.

1104
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:31,458
I will call my secretary
to send you the check.

1105
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:33,708
It will arrive at your office tomorrow.

1106
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:41,917
Petch, can you pay the hotel first?

1107
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,833
Can you?

1108
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,500
No problem, Ms. Liu.

1109
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,750
I will advance the money and pay first.

1110
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,875
You're so sweet.

1111
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,625
Goodness. It's time for my car
to pick me up.

1112
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:10,375
I have to go now. I'll see you later.

1113
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:14,292
Okay. I will see you off
with a smile here.

1114
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,708
Okay. Bye.

1115
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:16,708
See you.

1116
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,125
I'd like to verify a check.

1117
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,500
Who is the check made out to?

1118
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,583
It's made out to Petch Prateepnon.

1119
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:30,292
What is the amount?

1120
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:32,167
One million baht.

1121
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,667
What's the check number?

1122
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,750
It's 10475727.

1123
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:38,167
The information matches.

1124
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,750
A cashier's check of one million baht

1125
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:43,417
has been issued at JNBC,
Bangkok Space branch.

1126
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,875
Which room do you want?

1127
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:58,917
Any room is fine.

1128
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:22,917
Welcome to the executive suite

1129
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:27,125
where we will celebrate
our success tonight.

1130
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:42,958
Let's have a fancy dinner.

1131
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,167
After Jone gets the money, let's meet up.

1132
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:46,458
My treat.

1133
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,875
I haven't slept in a bed in so long.

1134
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,583
After this job, you won't have to sleep
in the car anymore.

1135
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:10,667
You're avoiding me.

1136
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,125
The lights are sound controlled.

1137
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,125
You're drunk.

1138
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,420
Shit!

1139
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:37,792
Damn it.

1140
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,125
Yingyod, my lovely buddy.

1141
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,875
I didn't get to see the Northern Lights.

1142
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,792
A husky bit my girl in the face.

1143
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:45,542
We're going back to Thailand.

1144
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,167
Damn. This will be close.

1145
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,625
I'm sober now.

1146
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:57,125
Jesus.

1147
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,125
Goodness.

1148
01:13:58,125 --> 01:13:59,833
Find something to cover up the smell.

1149
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:02,208
You reek of alcohol. Go.

1150
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,500
I bet Bangkok can smell him.

1151
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:22,542
His whole body reeks.

1152
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,625
You forgot to zip up.

1153
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:31,708
My gun is smoking!

1154
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:40,000
Tower.

1155
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:42,917
Today,

1156
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,750
let's CBP, Check Bill Petch.

1157
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:07,875
Have you been waiting long?

1158
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:09,125
Not really.

1159
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:14,830
I drafted the contract.

1160
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,625
TOTAL OF 3,000,000 BAHT

1161
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,420
Today, I'll pay one million as deposit.

1162
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,375
We need to revise the contract.

1163
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:40,917
When I get the money from the client,
I will pay you the rest.

1164
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,875
One million should guarantee that

1165
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:44,542
I want the rooms for sure.

1166
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,417
May I?

1167
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:57,708
Have a look.

1168
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:01,292
TOTAL OF 3,300,000 BAHT

1169
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,375
If you pay in installments,
it must be 3.3 million.

1170
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,792
If you want the three million rate,

1171
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:13,958
you have to pay the full amount
within today.

1172
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,250
A million?

1173
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,708
He's so tricky.

1174
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:35,667
Then I'll wait for Sam to return.

1175
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:38,292
He's easier to talk to

1176
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:40,292
since we are real close.

1177
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,000
Mr. Petch, hold on.

1178
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:54,792
He will only pay
as much as he got for the deposit.

1179
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,833
Is it game on or game over?

1180
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:01,833
It's game over.

1181
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,792
This plan is dead.

1182
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:05,875
A million in 4 to 5 days is quite okay.

1183
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:08,458
What about the two sheep at the hotel?

1184
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,375
What do you want to do?

1185
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,830
Cut them loose.

1186
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:19,667
Take 500,000 each and split up.

1187
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:24,292
Take care, bro.

1188
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,292
CONTRACT

1189
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,833
ARTICLE 1
I, TEWA SUPPAPAISAN,

1190
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:51,830
PROMISE THAT
WHEN CBP-CHECK BILL PETCH IS DONE,

1191
01:17:54,792 --> 01:18:01,000
I WILL STOP CONNING PEOPLE
AND USE MY ABILITIES

1192
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,542
TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING

1193
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,500
BANGKOK

1194
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:14,542
Mr. Tower's reservation?

1195
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:15,958
This way, please.

1196
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,750
You go in first.

1197
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:19,917
Okay.

1198
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,833
Please follow me.

1199
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:40,917
NICE EX-BANKER

1200
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:43,125
DECLINE

1201
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,583
You want me to change the ice
for the oysters?

1202
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:10,750
They aren't coming.

1203
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:18,292
Let's eat. It's all good food.

1204
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,250
It's delicious.

1205
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:38,625
I, TEWA SUPPAPAISAN, PROMISE THAT
WHEN CBP-CHECK BILL PETCH IS DONE

1206
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:48,667
Ina Review. Choo choo.

1207
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,375
Hello.

1208
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:55,417
I review everything
in and out of this world, episode three.

1209
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,167
Today, I will review

1210
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:00,167
my misfortune at 25.

1211
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,667
It just happened.

1212
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:05,000
What happened?

1213
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:07,125
A con artist scammed me.

1214
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,333
I drove slowly, so I just arrived.

1215
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:38,292
You planned it from the start,

1216
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,417
to stab us in the back.

1217
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,667
If you know the answer, why ask?

1218
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,333
Do you enjoy seeing me look dumb?

1219
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,792
Hey.

1220
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:07,458
Do you enjoy seeing me look dumb?

1221
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,125
Do you think I'll be mad?

1222
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,625
Do you think I'm hurt?

1223
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,458
I'm not.

1224
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:27,542
If you don't know how to lie,
stop talking.

1225
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:34,792
There he is,

1226
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,375
the call center scammer.

1227
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:41,208
He's a Southeast Asian man.

1228
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:44,375
He's a 30-year-old criminal.

1229
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:47,292
He can't be trusted.
He's a tricky swindler.

1230
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,292
I was naive enough to trust him.

1231
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:52,000
I was fooled over and over again.

1232
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,833
Do you know what Ina stands for?

1233
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,375
It stands for "ignorant."

1234
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:02,167
I am stupid.

1235
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,292
-Enough already.
-I'm stupid.

1236
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:06,417
-I'm stupid!
-I said enough!

1237
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,625
Stop crying.

1238
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:15,458
Do you see?

1239
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,125
No one dies from being conned
out of money.

1240
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,667
It just breaks your heart.

1241
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:23,708
It makes you want to run
into an electric pole and die.

1242
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:29,333
You know…

1243
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,167
I trusted you.

1244
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:35,958
I really trusted you.

1245
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,625
I'm a con man.

1246
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,917
You know I can't be trusted.

1247
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:07,125
Why did you come back?

1248
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:24,833
Stop thinking about me
and focus on keeping your mom's land.

1249
01:23:27,292 --> 01:23:28,583
You read my lips.

1250
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:31,333
Have you ever told me the truth?

1251
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,830
Petch only paid one million.

1252
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,708
I've got a plan to con
another two million out of him.

1253
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,292
We can split the money as planned.

1254
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,625
Or do you want to keep lying to your mom?

1255
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:56,583
I'll continue with the plan.

1256
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:00,833
Under one condition.

1257
01:24:04,417 --> 01:24:06,417
I'll be the last person
who holds the money.

1258
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:09,125
Deal.

1259
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:30,667
Can we still trust him?

1260
01:24:31,917 --> 01:24:32,917
No.

1261
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,420
I don't trust him anymore.

1262
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:39,833
I'm back from Russia.

1263
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,708
All my peeps who are passing by Le Grand,

1264
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:45,250
don't forget to stop by
and pick up your gifts.

1265
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,542
It's chocolate vodka.

1266
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:50,375
Don't eat too much
or you'll get drunk off your butt.

1267
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,833
Hello. What's up, bro?

1268
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:58,167
Jone.

1269
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,625
I changed my mind. Let's see this through.

1270
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:02,333
Here they come.

1271
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,542
The photographers you met last night,

1272
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,625
the deceased's family hired them
every night.

1273
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,708
Okay. I see.

1274
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,167
Hello. I called you this morning.

1275
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,708
I want to rent this place
to do a photo shoot.

1276
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:25,750
-Okay.
-Yes.

1277
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:28,500
Have you ever taken pictures of cars?

1278
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:34,125
We volunteer for nonprofit organizations.

1279
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:36,917
We take photos of car accidents.
Is that okay?

1280
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,750
His legs are completely twisted.

1281
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,500
I like it. It's high fashion.

1282
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:46,667
When do you need us?

1283
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:48,417
This afternoon. Are you free?

1284
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,167
Before we begin this new plan,

1285
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,625
we need Petch to trust us again.

1286
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:55,792
We must con him
using what we talked to him about before.

1287
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:57,958
Hello, Ms. Liu.

1288
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,000
Petch.

1289
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:03,333
What I said about sending you the check--

1290
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:05,583
There's been a change of plans.

1291
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:09,292
From Kalasin, I'll stop by Buri Ram.

1292
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:12,375
I will have a messenger
send the check to me instead.

1293
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:15,000
Are you free to pick up the check?

1294
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,583
I have something to show you.

1295
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:18,792
Sounds good.

1296
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:20,167
Where are you staying?

1297
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:26,375
Ms. Liu, I've missed you.

1298
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:29,000
Your check is in my room.

1299
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:31,375
You can come and get it tonight.

1300
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:36,917
Will Petch fall for it?

1301
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,375
I got Jone to find something big
to grab his attention.

1302
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:42,458
He will forget about the check.

1303
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,833
When I bought a sports car,
I bought it from this guy.

1304
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:08,667
How are you?

1305
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:09,792
Ms. Liu.

1306
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,292
Here.

1307
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:17,750
This is Auto.

1308
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,875
He imports super-cars to sell.

1309
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:22,958
He is the owner
of a big rice mill in Buri Ram.

1310
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,708
He gives us advice
about the rice for Lhingwu beer.

1311
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:29,750
Petch is the owner
of a tour company in Khon Kaen.

1312
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,167
I see.

1313
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:33,542
Have you ridden in a Ferrari?

1314
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:35,500
Would you like to try?

1315
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:37,667
Yes.

1316
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,708
Then let's go to my rice mill.

1317
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:40,667
It's wide open.

1318
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,375
RENTAL MANUAL

1319
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:59,420
-Do you normally drive fast?
-I'm not fast.

1320
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:03,167
I'm furiously fast!

1321
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:05,875
I usually go over 100.

1322
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:07,125
When I want to have fun,

1323
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:08,708
I do 200.

1324
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:10,375
So what are you waiting for?

1325
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:14,625
Let's step on it.

1326
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:20,875
Wow. We're flying.

1327
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:22,583
Yes.

1328
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:30,917
Let's go.

1329
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,708
I looked it up on the Internet.

1330
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:38,667
It says a Ferrari can go from zero to 200
in 11 seconds.

1331
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,917
Yes.

1332
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,458
Let's test this car's limit.

1333
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:46,292
Right now, my body craves speed.

1334
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:48,833
Ms. Liu might mind.

1335
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:49,917
This is a new car.

1336
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,417
Come on. This is a Ferrari.

1337
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,458
Let's do it!

1338
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:58,417
Come on!

1339
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:01,833
Let's go!

1340
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:29,917
-Go faster.
-Faster?

1341
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,875
Yes!

1342
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,458
Press the pedal to the metal.

1343
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:37,792
Faster!

1344
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,958
Top speed all the way!

1345
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:48,250
Wow! There it is!

1346
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,542
A turtle!

1347
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:58,667
There's a turtle!

1348
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:03,542
Look out!

1349
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,417
Damn!

1350
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,833
That drift was beautiful
just like in Furious 7.

1351
01:30:32,417 --> 01:30:33,750
You should buy one.

1352
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:34,917
Vin Diesel.

1353
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:53,167
The plan is for Ms. Liu
to get Petch to invest

1354
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,420
in a sports car at a special price.

1355
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,375
But there is one condition.

1356
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:59,542
Both of you need to invest two million

1357
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,750
and agree to pay cash in person.

1358
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:03,708
Our side will invest two million.

1359
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,917
The first million is
from the money Petch gave us.

1360
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,208
The second million is

1361
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:08,583
from this check.

1362
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:11,292
But it needs to be cashed in
only in Bangkok.

1363
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,708
I will sign a power of attorney.

1364
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:16,542
You must cash it in
at the Lhingwu Building

1365
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:17,583
where it was issued.

1366
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:29,125
Hey, Auto.

1367
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,458
Is this the car for my partner?

1368
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:32,542
You got it.

1369
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:34,333
I'm sure your partner will love it.

1370
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:36,000
This color is limited edition.

1371
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,375
I borrowed it to promote my page.

1372
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:39,792
Go ahead.

1373
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:40,875
Okay.

1374
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:44,292
Let's see.

1375
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,875
Can you capture the power of the engine?

1376
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:52,000
Summon the wild horse's spirit
from the grille of the car.

1377
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:56,000
Can I take a photo for my partner to see?

1378
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:57,167
Snap away.

1379
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:04,917
I will sell you the car for four million.

1380
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,792
The market price is six million.

1381
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:11,625
You're giving me a two-million margin.

1382
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,583
I don't want to make a profit.

1383
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:15,667
I want to make an impression
on my partner.

1384
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:18,625
Take it. I made enough
from selling you the Ferrari.

1385
01:32:19,417 --> 01:32:20,292
We're friends.

1386
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:22,583
You're so good to me, Auto.

1387
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,542
I have one condition though.

1388
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,750
I want four million in cash today.

1389
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,125
I just bought a Ferrari.

1390
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:33,375
I'm afraid I won't have enough cash.

1391
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:36,417
Then this car will have to go
to your frenemy, Mr. Chok.

1392
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:38,208
Is Chok interested?

1393
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:39,875
-Very.
-I won't let that happen.

1394
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:44,208
I'll sell some stocks at a loss
so I can buy this car.

1395
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:47,420
That's good.
Why would you keep losing stocks

1396
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:49,420
when you can profit from this?

1397
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:57,500
Petch.

1398
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:02,000
Do you want to invest with me
for two million each?

1399
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,375
I won't have to sell lots of stocks.

1400
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:07,458
I'm afraid it won't be worth it
when the prices go up.

1401
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:08,708
Ms. Liu.

1402
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,667
I don't want an outsider involved.

1403
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:12,458
Sorry, dude.

1404
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:15,542
I understand.

1405
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:24,917
Auto, can you let Petch in
on the investment?

1406
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,417
He isn't an outsider.

1407
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,375
He is with me.

1408
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:36,833
Don't give me a hard time.

1409
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,333
I want him to have a piece of the cake.

1410
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:44,000
If you vouch for him, I'm okay with it.

1411
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:48,333
If you want to give him some cake,
I won't stand in your way.

1412
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:50,583
But you have to buy it
under your name only.

1413
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,500
You can't tell anybody.

1414
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,420
Dude.

1415
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:57,292
You're a lucky guy.

1416
01:34:00,792 --> 01:34:03,625
Petch, actually,

1417
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:06,708
I really just want to impress my partner.

1418
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:07,625
As for the profit,

1419
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:09,208
I will give it all to you.

1420
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:10,875
Ms. Liu, don't pressure him.

1421
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:12,542
He isn't rich like you.

1422
01:34:14,917 --> 01:34:15,750
When is the deadline?

1423
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:18,292
I'll see Chok this evening.

1424
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:21,375
If you won't take it,
he's ready to drive off with it.

1425
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:25,167
Then you should prepare
to apologize to Mr. Chok.

1426
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:35,583
Can you get two million by this afternoon?

1427
01:34:36,542 --> 01:34:37,542
I think so.

1428
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,250
I want to cancel this cashier's check.

1429
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,830
Here's one million baht.

1430
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,875
Ms. Kanokpon.

1431
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:55,583
What is it, Petch?

1432
01:34:55,667 --> 01:34:57,625
My friend invited me to buy land.

1433
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:59,167
He told me to buy it now.

1434
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,458
When the high-speed train is finished,

1435
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:03,208
the price will triple.

1436
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:05,708
Really? That's interesting.

1437
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:10,000
Can I borrow two million from you?

1438
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:11,792
I have to pay him this evening.

1439
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,833
Could you let me borrow the money?

1440
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:15,958
I'm a bit short this month.

1441
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:19,167
I just bought you a BMW.

1442
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:22,500
You don't need to do any side hustles.

1443
01:35:23,667 --> 01:35:26,420
I have to go. A client is calling.

1444
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,125
I'll have a truck
transport the Ferrari for you.

1445
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:32,583
If you want the Mustang for real,

1446
01:35:32,667 --> 01:35:33,875
I can send both cars to you.

1447
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:36,792
So can you get the money?

1448
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,375
Well, I--

1449
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:42,625
If I take out two million now,

1450
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:45,420
it will affect my company's cash flow.

1451
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:46,917
Petch.

1452
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,750
I already asked for a favor from Auto.

1453
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,500
Petch doesn't have enough money.
I will buy the car myself.

1454
01:36:02,375 --> 01:36:06,125
Auto, can I ride with you
to finalize the payment?

1455
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,417
Sure.

1456
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,420
I will take Auto out for dinner.

1457
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:13,250
I will let you know
when you can pick up the check.

1458
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:14,458
I'll leave it at the lobby.

1459
01:36:14,542 --> 01:36:15,500
Let's go.

1460
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:19,625
Shit.

1461
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,417
He's on the fence.
Let's pick Ina up at the airport.

1462
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:41,792
Hello. Who's calling?

1463
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:44,125
Hello, Petch.

1464
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:45,625
This is Samson.

1465
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:46,833
Didn't you save my number?

1466
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:48,750
I saved it.

1467
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,333
I have your number saved.

1468
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:54,750
I was on holiday in Russia,
so you couldn't contact me.

1469
01:36:55,333 --> 01:36:56,333
Holiday?

1470
01:36:56,417 --> 01:36:57,542
Yes.

1471
01:36:57,625 --> 01:37:00,333
It was so cold.

1472
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:03,167
I had to wear four layers of sweaters,

1473
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:04,833
like playing Russian roulette with snow.

1474
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:07,250
Sam.

1475
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,917
But you texted me
that you went to a seminar.

1476
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,292
You had Mr. Pongsakorn
deal with me instead.

1477
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:14,833
No.

1478
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:16,750
Our hotel has nobody named Pongsakorn.

1479
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:19,917
Who is Pongsakorn?

1480
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,625
I didn't have anyone deal with you.

1481
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:26,208
Sam, I have to go. Something came up.

1482
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:58,833
A cashier's check
payable to Petch Prateepnon

1483
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:00,542
has been canceled.

1484
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,417
Do you have any other inquires…

1485
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,458
Shit.

1486
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,420
How many people?

1487
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,917
Two million in total.

1488
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:09,420
Hey!

1489
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:13,458
An ant bit my foot.

1490
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:18,417
-How many people?
-Two people.

1491
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:34,917
I know everything.

1492
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,542
I saw them pick you up at the airport.

1493
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:41,500
You're working with those con artists

1494
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:43,000
to con me out of money.

1495
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:45,958
I've lost a million of my savings.

1496
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,542
Do I deserve this?

1497
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:51,542
If you never tricked me,
do you think I would do this?

1498
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:54,500
You deserve to lose that one million.

1499
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:59,125
I could report them to the police,
but I didn't.

1500
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:01,125
It's because you're involved.

1501
01:40:04,292 --> 01:40:05,375
I never thought

1502
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,208
that what I did to you

1503
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:11,458
would make you go this far.

1504
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:15,420
I admit

1505
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,208
I intended to fool you

1506
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:19,542
and Kanokpon.

1507
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:21,375
But the things I did,

1508
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:23,875
I did it to survive.

1509
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:24,917
It's what you're doing.

1510
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,208
It's not the same. Not at all.

1511
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:31,583
I'm really sorry.

1512
01:40:32,917 --> 01:40:34,958
It's too late to be sorry.

1513
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:36,958
I know.

1514
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:40,625
Right now, I can only think about

1515
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:43,500
how I can make it up to you.

1516
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:46,667
Because good people like you

1517
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:49,875
shouldn't get involved
with those con artists.

1518
01:40:55,167 --> 01:40:57,500
I'll play along and give them two million.

1519
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:01,458
If you can get all the money back,

1520
01:41:03,208 --> 01:41:05,167
we'll get two million from those guys.

1521
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:09,417
Do you want me to betray them?

1522
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:13,625
I just want my one million back.

1523
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:16,792
You can have the other million.

1524
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:19,667
I just want to help you.

1525
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,125
Ina.

1526
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,292
Do you really think

1527
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:31,500
those con artists next door

1528
01:41:32,667 --> 01:41:33,833
will share the money with you?

1529
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:40,250
After I give them the money,

1530
01:41:41,792 --> 01:41:43,542
can you find a way to get it back?

1531
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,830
Can you do that for me?

1532
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,167
PETCH (KANOKPON TOUR)

1533
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:58,420
Petch is calling.

1534
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:00,333
Answer it.

1535
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:07,875
I want in too.

1536
01:42:09,417 --> 01:42:11,420
Where are you now?

1537
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,250
PETCH PRATEEPNON

1538
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,167
I'll withdraw two million.

1539
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:22,333
Here's two million baht.

1540
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:38,625
I want to thank you for this opportunity.

1541
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,375
Where's the contract?

1542
01:43:19,792 --> 01:43:21,625
It's here. I have it ready.

1543
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:37,750
Do you any problems with it?

1544
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:38,667
Well,

1545
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:40,917
not at all.

1546
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:43,375
Okay.

1547
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,420
Right.

1548
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,458
No need to count it.
The two million is all there.

1549
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,292
You can trust me.

1550
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:16,375
I'm not afraid it's short.

1551
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:18,417
I'm afraid it's over.

1552
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,375
He won't carry the money himself.

1553
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:32,167
He will leave the money with me

1554
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:33,208
in this room,

1555
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:36,958
so I can go to the bank
to deposit everybody's share.

1556
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,458
Let's help each other out.

1557
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:45,708
Ina.

1558
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:48,333
I care about you.

1559
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:01,167
You guys are quite daring.

1560
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,875
You saw a picture in a chat

1561
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:04,792
and agreed to buy a six-million-baht car.

1562
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:06,420
It's normal.

1563
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:08,417
We all trust each other.

1564
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,375
We don't cheat.

1565
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:14,333
The lamb stew here is good.

1566
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:16,250
You should order some.

1567
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:20,000
I don't like stew.

1568
01:45:20,542 --> 01:45:21,375
It stinks.

1569
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,292
Thank you, Ms. Liu.

1570
01:46:09,167 --> 01:46:10,333
It's on you now.

1571
01:46:25,667 --> 01:46:26,917
Ina, good job.

1572
01:46:43,792 --> 01:46:44,792
Petch!

1573
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:49,000
Did you trick me again?

1574
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:55,625
Hey. You should know me better by now.

1575
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:58,417
-I watch your reviews.
-Petch.

1576
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:02,208
Next episode, review how stupid you are.

1577
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:05,542
Lots of people will watch for real.

1578
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:07,208
Petch.

1579
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:09,250
Stop smiling.

1580
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:12,167
The one who should be smiling

1581
01:47:12,667 --> 01:47:13,875
is me!

1582
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:16,875
Did you really think

1583
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:19,583
I would be that stupid
to trust a jerk like you again?

1584
01:47:25,667 --> 01:47:27,167
The plan is

1585
01:47:27,167 --> 01:47:31,830
for Ms. Liu to get Petch to invest
in a sports car at a special price.

1586
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,125
This plan won't work.

1587
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:36,167
Petch gets easy money from women.
Why would he invest?

1588
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:37,500
We don't have any sheep left.

1589
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:38,708
You have me.

1590
01:47:38,792 --> 01:47:40,000
I’m still Petch's sheep.

1591
01:47:44,667 --> 01:47:46,750
Can you find a way to put me in the plan?

1592
01:47:49,417 --> 01:47:51,420
Then you'll have to pretend to betray us.

1593
01:47:53,875 --> 01:47:56,417
You should prepare
to apologize to Mr. Chok.

1594
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:00,625
Hello, Sam?

1595
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,583
Can you call Petch from Kanokpon Tour?

1596
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:05,292
I ran into him
and he said he couldn't reach you.

1597
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:06,625
Hello.

1598
01:48:07,292 --> 01:48:08,500
Sam.

1599
01:48:08,583 --> 01:48:10,292
-But you texted me--
-"But you texted me

1600
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:11,750
that you went to a seminar."

1601
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:14,830
"You had Mr. Pongsakorn
deal with me instead."

1602
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:21,667
-He's coming.
-Awesome.

1603
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,708
Don't block the way. Petch is behind us.

1604
01:48:28,792 --> 01:48:31,125
Show your face a bit,
so he sees you clearly.

1605
01:48:32,708 --> 01:48:33,792
Shit.

1606
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:34,833
Ina.

1607
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:37,708
I care about you.

1608
01:48:40,792 --> 01:48:42,583
Care my ass!

1609
01:48:46,625 --> 01:48:47,542
It's on you now.

1610
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,250
Hey.

1611
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:52,375
Take his picture
when he realizes the truth.

1612
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:55,292
Don't be paranoid. He has no clue.

1613
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,500
I'm reviewing stupidity now,

1614
01:48:59,583 --> 01:49:01,420
and it's your stupidity.

1615
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:05,417
Check Bill Petch.

1616
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:14,375
Hey!

1617
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,830
Damn it!

1618
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:23,125
FYI.

1619
01:49:23,125 --> 01:49:26,458
There are criminals
posing as our hotel staff.

1620
01:49:26,542 --> 01:49:29,583
Any customers who suffered any damage,
please call me.

1621
01:49:29,667 --> 01:49:32,125
This con job will not end nicely!

1622
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:34,125
It won't end nicely!

1623
01:49:34,208 --> 01:49:36,750
MS. KANOKPON

1624
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,333
Hello, Ms. Kanokpon.

1625
01:49:41,417 --> 01:49:42,625
Don't sweet-talk me.

1626
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:44,750
Your ex sent me your voice clip.

1627
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:50,125
I admit I intended to fool you
and Kanokpon.

1628
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,667
Come on.

1629
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:53,583
It's easy to edit a clip these days.

1630
01:49:53,667 --> 01:49:56,000
You need to listen to what I'm saying now.

1631
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:58,250
I'm not listening. Get out of my company.

1632
01:49:58,333 --> 01:49:59,875
Don't try to take my BMW with you

1633
01:49:59,958 --> 01:50:01,667
or I will sue you, you jackass!

1634
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,542
Okay, you hag!
If you want to sue me, go ahead.

1635
01:50:04,625 --> 01:50:07,917
This voice clip can't be used as evidence.

1636
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,167
I won't sue you in court.

1637
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:10,875
I will report this to Ellen, my bestie.

1638
01:50:11,458 --> 01:50:13,000
You'll have no standing in society.

1639
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:15,833
You can wait by the TV.
The world will know who you are.

1640
01:50:15,917 --> 01:50:16,875
Whatever.

1641
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:18,917
Are you done talking, you hag?

1642
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,167
No!

1643
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:22,792
If you report those people
who sent me the clip to the police,

1644
01:50:22,875 --> 01:50:24,333
you better buy life insurance.

1645
01:50:24,417 --> 01:50:25,875
You'll be dead.

1646
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:28,292
Damn it!

1647
01:50:39,792 --> 01:50:40,750
Mommy!

1648
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:04,000
Good job. Ina Jitimaim.

1649
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:09,167
Hold on.

1650
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:12,292
Baa.

1651
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,420
Baa.

1652
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:21,875
Baa.

1653
01:51:22,625 --> 01:51:26,750
-Baa.
-Baa.

1654
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:31,292
Give me a special discount next time.

1655
01:51:31,375 --> 01:51:32,250
Okay.

1656
01:51:33,708 --> 01:51:35,208
Here's three million.

1657
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:40,420
This is Tower's and yours as we agreed.

1658
01:51:41,333 --> 01:51:42,625
Thank you, Jone.

1659
01:51:45,917 --> 01:51:46,833
Thank you.

1660
01:51:46,917 --> 01:51:48,333
You’re a quick learner.

1661
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,875
I'm sorry for getting you
involved in this.

1662
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,708
What are you talking about?

1663
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:04,792
We won't talk about this
for the rest of our lives.

1664
01:52:04,875 --> 01:52:05,750
Do you understand?

1665
01:52:06,417 --> 01:52:07,417
Okay.

1666
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:11,542
Thanks.

1667
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:22,833
Here. This is your cut.

1668
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,375
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1669
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,125
What's next?

1670
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:36,875
Songkran is coming up.

1671
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,625
Let's do an air ticket scam.

1672
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:40,917
I'll be the decoy.

1673
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,417
You can be an airline agent, okay?

1674
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,667
Sure.

1675
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:48,250
But I want no pregnant women,
no old people,

1676
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:50,667
nobody in debt, and no you.

1677
01:52:51,667 --> 01:52:53,792
You don't want me!

1678
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:13,917
You are a con artist.

1679
01:53:14,417 --> 01:53:15,708
She is a good girl.

1680
01:53:16,667 --> 01:53:17,917
It won't work.

1681
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:19,875
Trust this crook.

1682
01:53:20,792 --> 01:53:21,708
I know.

1683
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:00,000
I'm so relieved.

1684
01:54:01,667 --> 01:54:03,167
Thank you, Tower.

1685
01:54:10,458 --> 01:54:12,667
Was it worth it?

1686
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:24,250
NICE EX-BANKER

1687
01:54:55,417 --> 01:54:56,667
I'm a con man.

1688
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,125
You know I can't be trusted.

1689
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:00,708
Why did you come back?

1690
01:55:09,875 --> 01:55:11,542
Seeing your smile makes it worth it.

1691
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:15,125
ARTICLE 1
I, TEWA SUPPAPAISAN,

1692
01:56:15,125 --> 01:56:17,292
PROMISE THAT
WHEN CBP-CHECK BILL PETCH IS DONE,

1693
01:56:17,375 --> 01:56:20,375
I'LL STOP CONNING PEOPLE AND USE
MY ABILITIES TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING

1694
01:56:20,458 --> 01:56:24,420
TEWA SUPPAPAISAN

1695
01:56:37,792 --> 01:56:38,917
Thank you.

1696
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:43,420
And

1697
01:56:43,667 --> 01:56:44,750
don't get conned again.

1698
01:56:45,917 --> 01:56:47,420
Okay.

1699
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,000
Tower.

1700
01:58:20,667 --> 01:58:23,167
I'm taking your money to do a tour scam.

1701
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:26,000
I will return it someday.
You can trust this crook.

1702
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:27,792
Damn you, Jone!

1703
01:58:41,792 --> 01:58:42,708
What?

1704
01:58:44,792 --> 01:58:48,167
Article two, if Mr. Tewa complies
with requirement number one,

1705
01:58:48,167 --> 01:58:50,250
I, Ms. Ina Jitimaim,

1706
01:58:50,333 --> 01:58:54,500
will be happy to get to know
Mr. Tewa Suppapaisan.

1707
01:58:54,583 --> 01:58:55,708
Ina Jitimaim.

1708
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:45,458
OVERDUE BALANCE OF 50,000 BAHT

1709
01:59:48,458 --> 01:59:51,667
MR. TEWA SUPPAPAISAN
LOAN TOTAL 1,000,000 BAHT

1710
02:00:06,958 --> 02:00:09,333
Hello, Mr. Tewa.

1711
02:00:10,333 --> 02:00:11,417
Who's speaking?

1712
02:00:12,417 --> 02:00:16,420
I'm Ina Jitimaim.
I'm a debt collector at Srisawad.

1713
02:00:20,583 --> 02:00:21,667
Hello?

1714
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:23,792
Are you still there?

1715
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:25,625
I'm listening.

1716
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:28,125
I'm calling to inform you

1717
02:00:28,125 --> 02:00:31,875
that your loan payment
is overdue by one week.

1718
02:00:32,833 --> 02:00:33,875
I know.

1719
02:00:34,458 --> 02:00:36,125
I have no money right now.

1720
02:00:36,667 --> 02:00:38,167
Can I postpone the payment?

1721
02:00:38,833 --> 02:00:40,667
Are you having financial problems?

1722
02:00:42,208 --> 02:00:45,830
I invested the money in a tour agency.

1723
02:00:46,125 --> 02:00:47,917
We were on lockdown for two months.

1724
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,458
We just started to have customers.

1725
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,792
CHOK BOON PA TRAVEL

1726
02:00:55,875 --> 02:00:59,833
Please bring your business documents
to the company.

1727
02:00:59,917 --> 02:01:02,125
We can come up with a compromise.

1728
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:04,917
When?

1729
02:01:06,375 --> 02:01:07,583
How about tomorrow?

1730
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:09,167
Okay.

1731
02:01:11,583 --> 02:01:12,625
Do you have

1732
02:01:12,708 --> 02:01:14,875
any other inquiries?

1733
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,833
I do.

1734
02:01:21,792 --> 02:01:23,420
Do you have a boyfriend yet?

1735
02:01:26,375 --> 02:01:28,792
Is it too late
to tell you that I like you?

1736
02:01:33,958 --> 02:01:35,917
VISITING ROOM

1737
02:01:43,958 --> 02:01:45,667
How are you, youngsters?

1738
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:48,417
What's up? Jone Crook.

1739
02:01:50,125 --> 02:01:51,333
I'm a crook in jail.

1740
02:01:51,417 --> 02:01:53,250
Since COVID hit us,

1741
02:01:54,917 --> 02:01:58,167
people got scared
and returned all their tickets.

1742
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,000
I couldn't move the money in time.

1743
02:02:01,583 --> 02:02:02,458
It was game over.

1744
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:04,375
Will you quit being a con artist?

1745
02:02:09,542 --> 02:02:10,417
Are you dating?

1746
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:12,750
I'm conning her now.

1747
02:02:14,833 --> 02:02:15,750
And you?

1748
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:18,208
You know he's conning you.

1749
02:02:19,375 --> 02:02:20,417
You willing to be conned?

1750
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:22,292
I am.

1751
02:02:25,333 --> 02:02:27,333
Then if nobody has any objections,

1752
02:02:28,125 --> 02:02:30,917
the groom may kiss the bride.

1753
02:02:57,583 --> 02:02:58,708
Thanks, bro.
