00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,740
How about you give it a try?

152
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,460
How is it?

153
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,710
This is manual?

154
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,350
Manual...

155
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,450
Don't you have a broken leg that prevents you from getting exercise?

156
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,990
You can just treat it as exercise, it's good for your health.

157
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,060
Look. Now I only owe you 108,800 yuan.
(~$17,000)

158
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,660
Agree?

159
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,540
You didn't spend your money on this wheelchair imported from Germany, right?

160
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,520
Smart.

161
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,930
Ever since you arrived, the water bills, electricity bills, and living expenses,

162
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,900
multiple fees are increasing nonstop.

163
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,160
I have difficulties. Try to understand them.

164
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,240
Try it.

165
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,850
I forgot.

166
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,970
I'll push you around.

167
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,510
How is it? Don't you think it's pretty nice?

168
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,490
Look outside the window.

169
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,640
You have to get used to using this.

170
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,260
Try it for yourself. I'll take out the trash.

171
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,560
Throw the flowers away too.

172
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,410
Quite wasteful.

173
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,090
[Novotel]

174
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,180
The project from last time...we really aren't including Nan Xi?

175
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,220
I heard the rate of return is very high.

176
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,680
Many people want to get a share.

177
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,190
Then do they know...that project

178
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,660
hasn't even received approval?

179
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,920
Wow, you!

180
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,940
No wonder you aren't eating meat right by your lips.*(Not taking advantage of something right in front of you)

181
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,000
So you already knew there was a problem. As expected of Gu Xin'er.

182
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,750
A toast!

183
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,470
Sha Sha?

184
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,160
Sorry, I mistook you for my first love.

185
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,560
As an apology, can I treat you to a drink?

186
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,690
This guy's pickup lines are so old-school.

187
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,290
Why are you being a stranger?

188
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,200
What are you doing?

189
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,080
Why did you hit me? Security!

190
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,850
He hit me! Hurry and catch him!

191
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,830
Hey, you've caught the wrong person!

192
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,450
Xiao Shen?

193
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,500
You were that little wild kid who always said they'd marry Xin'er?

194
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,140
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

195
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,940
A tiger has five mountain holes in front of him.

196
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,720
Then every hole has a lamb.

197
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,870
However he only went into the second hole.

198
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,880
Do you know why?

199
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,300
Because the lamb in the second hole is fatter.

200
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,860
No.

201
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,130
Because he can go into whatever hole he wants to.

202
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,440
That's a joke?

203
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,600
No.

204
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
I attended a prize event while walking in the market today.

205
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,920
They gave me two movie tickets.

206
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,440
You're lucky enough to receive movie tickets?

207
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,640
Then go by yourself.

208
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,880
I...don't need two tickets.

209
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,040
That's right...

210
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,500
Then give me one.

211
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,050
I'll put it up for you for sale.

212
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,910
No need. It can't be sold for much.

213
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,570
Even though a mosquito's small, it still eats meat.*(A small thing is still valuable)

214
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,520
How about I gift it to you?

215
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,150
The movie's on Friday at 8 pm.

216
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,560
You...should be off work then...

217
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't have time...

218
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,240
Anyways, the movie's on Friday at 8 pm. Come if you want.

219
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,600
Anxin, we might have to get off late again today.

220
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,140
-Why?
-There was a notification just now saying there was a batch of products organized incorrectly.

221
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,550
But you see...Fei Fei and Xiao Yan have already left.

222
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,390
-But today I-
-Sister, please don't let me work overtime by myself.

223
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,830
-I can only stay with you for awhile.
-Ok, ok, ok. That's fine. We can finish it quickly.

224
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,700
-Ok.
-Thank you.

225
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,660
Hi Sir, here is the popcorn you wanted.

226
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,140
Hello, how can I help you?

227
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,830
Here. Anxin. Anxin!

228
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,940
There's these too.

229
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,450
Hello, welcome to Movie City.

230
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,980
The 8'ock screening of Zootopia

231
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,270
Is now allowing the watchers to come in and get their tickets checked.

232
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,440
Viewers who bought tickets for the current screening

233
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,660
please come to the gate to have your ticket checked.

234
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,920
Thank you for your cooperation and enjoy the movie.

235
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,240
We are finally done.

236
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,890
-Oh no!
-What happened?

237
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,220
I had an appointment with a friend to watch a movie at 8'ock.

238
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,620
8 pm! If you go now, it might already be over!

239
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,530
Xiao Ba?

240
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,580
No way.

241
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,730
You didn't watch it?

242
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,810
There's no point in watching it alone.

243
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,630
-A coworker...
-Don't worry about it.

244
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,670
Let's go.

245
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,990
Wait!

246
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,040
Wait a second.

247
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,040
How can we miss the movie you wanted to watch?

248
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,610
I'll treat you to this movie, so it's on me.

249
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,080
Then let's go.

250
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,820
I'll hold it for you.

251
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,550
Let me hold you.

252
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,710
Walk slowly.

253
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,840
Oh my god!

254
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,610
Anxin.

255
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,890
Nothing, go to sleep.

256
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,510
Good night.

257
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,640
Good night.

258
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,680
Anxin.

259
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,760
Nothing, go to sleep. Good night.

260
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,440
Good night.

261
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,600
Did he really leave?

262
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,560
The words he didn't say last night,

263
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,750
Was that a farewell?

264
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,160
The movie tickets were a farewell gift?

265
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,910
This is a bit big.

266
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,530
Can you hold it later?

267
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,060
Anxin?

268
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,330
Anxin! Why are you dozing off? The package.

269
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,210
Oh, Phoenix Neighborhood?

270
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,870
What's wrong? You're not in the right mind today.

271
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,510
Nothing, I probably didn't sleep well.

272
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,380
Kind person, have some pity on me.

273
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,720
Give me some food.

274
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,650
Have some pity on me.

275
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,650
Give me some food.

276
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,080
Kind person, please give me some food.

277
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,740
Please have pity on me.

278
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,510
Please give me some food.

279
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,060
Kind person.

280
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,090
Please have some pity on me.

281
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,390
Xiao Yan, something came up at home!

282
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,200
Can I switch shifts with you?

283
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,860
What happened?

284
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,860
My house... my house's cat is missing.

285
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,750
-You raised a cat?
-Just a cat that grew up with me.

286
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,660
There's a problem with its legs, and we suddenly lost it.

287
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,380
Can we switch shifts?

288
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,880
Okay.

289
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,760
Boss!

290
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,420
Did you see the guy that smashed all your beer?

291
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,850
No.

292
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,120
Thank you.

293
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,040
Okay, go play with them.

294
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,630
Doctor Xiao!

295
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,470
That's really you?

296
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,900
Is your leg

297
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,430
okay?

298
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,810
It's fine.

299
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,950
You are pretty smart to guess it was me right away.

300
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,360
Of course.

301
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,080
Besides you, who else knows I would be here every weekend?

302
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,810
Besides you, who else would be so psychotic to send me a message using binary.

303
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,410
Did you get what I sent you?

304
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,590
It's here. Your report.

305
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Thank you.

306
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,910
Give me your wallet.

307
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,420
Give it to me.

308
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,970
My-

309
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,940
I-

310
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,050
Ask Ai Li to reimburse you.

311
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,320
That's fine with me.

312
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,780
Do you really not want me to take a look at your leg?

313
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,610
Lawyer Chen,

314
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,850
what you mean is that my father wants to give 50% of the shares to this women?

315
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,570
That's right. Jin Guan is no longer in this world.

316
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,350
Based on the policy,

317
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,250
the shares will be transferred to that girl.

318
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,940
Daughter?

319
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,960
Could it be his secret daughter?

320
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,010
I don't know if it's his secret daughter,

321
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,050
but he has always been looking for her.

322
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,420
Then that means, as long as we have her 50% of the share

323
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,570
the inheritor position wouldn't depend on the old man's choice. Right?

324
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,110
My brother always knows about this?

325
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,140
Right, Lawyer Chen?

326
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,440
Then who am I?

327
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,210
You don't know who you are?

328
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,040
First pay the fee, then take the bill to get medicine.

329
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,920
Hello, can I borrow your phone?

330
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,250
Thank you.

331
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,160
-Hello, who is this?
-It's me.

332
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,690
President Ling?

333
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,950
As long as you are fine, I can rest assured.

334
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,600
Is there any movement on Ling Fang's side?

335
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,820
Ling Fang's people have followed me the whole day.

336
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,430
If nothing unexpected comes up, this matter definitely has to do with them.

337
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,620
-Is there evidence?
-As of right now, no.

338
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,140
Then I won't make an appearance yet and observe for changes.

339
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,270
I'll wait for them to fall for the bait.

340
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,040
President Ling, where are you right now? Let me prepare somewhere for you to stay.

341
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,040
No need.

342
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,870
I found the girl, the CEO want's to find.

343
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,570
300,000 yuan? Are you blackmailing me?

344
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,430
Then let's call the police, a collision is not a minor charge.

345
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,900
So, how about...

346
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,710
You can stay at my house.  00:32:33,950
Xiao Ba! Where is my toothbrush?

347
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,020
When I used the restroom, I by accident knocked it over and it fell into the toilet.

348
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,490
-What is this?
-A toothbrush.

349
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,430
You seem to relate to this a lot.

350
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,670
Because I was also adopted.

351
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,730
[DNA result for Gu Anxin. Paternal index for 0.09. Less than 0.0001]

352
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,370
Good thing she wasn't the CEO's secret daughter.

353
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,850
It's me, how has it been?

354
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,220
For the matter concerning when the company's firewall was attacked by a secret group,

355
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,050
we have already found their location with the IP address you provided.

356
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,300
It's President Ling Fang and them.

357
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,260
Don't worry. I have already fixed the firewall.

Do everything according to plan.

359
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,100
That's right. There's a new e-commerce business called Fei Te.

360
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,870
Recently, they've continually hooked away our people.

361
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,060
They claim that those who leave Niu Wei

362
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,050
can receive double the salary.

363
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,580
The fish are about to bite the hook.

364
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,070
Also recently President Ling Fang has been hiring people to find out more about Miss Anxin.

365
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,320
What did he find out?

366
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,160
He didn't find out anything so far.

367
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,270
Watch him closely, don't let him find out about Anxin.

368
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,480
Okay, don't worry.

369
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,390
Tell me honestly.

370
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,130
Don't tell me you're some kind of wanted criminal, gangster,

371
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,620
or someone who committed misconduct, so you're hiding in my house because you're scared that you'll be found.

372
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,800
If I were a wanted criminal,

373
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,680
I would have made a move on you first.

374
