In the past, there was an old king.

He wanted to find an inheritor. Therefore,

140
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,200
he called his three sons to him

141
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,470
and said...said I'm old.

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,220

143
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,340
You three must battle and decide the inheritor.

144
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,030
After it began, the third prince threw away his sword first.

145
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,350
He said...between his two brothers,

146
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,770

147
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,890

Throughout their fight, the second prince's sword

151
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,110
already brushed against the first prince's neck. However, he hesitated.

152
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,320
At that moment...the first prince took advantage of the second prince.

153
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,180
And then?

154
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,360

This king just watched his sons kill each other?

156
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,340
The king believed in a cruel and savage education.

157
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,070
He didn't even care for the life of his second son.

158
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,880
I think maybe he just didn't like this second son.

159
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,600

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,780
Chairman, how could you say that?

177
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,070
The doctor says you need to rest.

178
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,180
How could we dare to disturb you with normal little problems?

179
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,790
That's right, Old Ling.

180
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,180
Right now, it's crazy outside.

181
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,420
They all say Xiao Yue has met misfortune.

182
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,040
The company's workers are all uneasy as well.

183
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,980
That secretary that he has

184
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,370
isn't of the Ling family. He can't replace Xiao Yue.

185
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,250
That's right. We should quickly choose a new President

186
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,880
to replace Xiao Yue's position.

187
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,230
My son's life and death is still uncertain,

188
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,820
yet you all have started to form alliances already?

189
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,800
Old Ling, we don't mean it that way.

190
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,350
-Then what do you mean?
-Everyone's worked so hard all these years,

191
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,110
so we can only be well if the Ling family is doing well. We don't have any selfish ideas.

192
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,860
Let me think about this matter.

193
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,900
I am tired. Please leave.

194
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,660
Then...we will head over now.

195
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,160
Hey! Did you see my Transformer?

196
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,200
No.

197
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,240
What are you hiding?

198
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
-Nothing!
-Let me see!

199
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,440
Isn't it just a stupid spinning top? Why are you hiding it?

200
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,240
Acting all weird.

201
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm warning you. Don't you dare tell mom and dad.

202
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,770
Or else just you wait!

203
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,560
Here, eat some more.

204
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,790
Xiao Yue! Xiao Yue!

205
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,590
What's wrong?

206
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,190
Morning.

207
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,050
Morning.

208
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,860
Xiao Ba!

209
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,740
Where's my toothbrush?

210
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,380
I accidentally knocked it into the toilet when I was using the restroom.

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,000
C-Can I beg you

212
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,950
to not touch my things?

213
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,430
Then...I'll help you take it out?

214
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,860
How could I put something you picked back up into my mouth?

215
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,580
Makes sense.

216
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,000
[You You]

217
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,700
Xiao Ba, don't talk.

218
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,020
Hello, You You?

219
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,100
Anxin! I have good news! I saw Mike!

220
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,850
He's so much more handsome than in TV!

221
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,460
Then did you take a photo with him?

222
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,650
Of course! I'll be back in a few days.

223
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,750
Can you let me live at your place for a few days?

224
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,590
I don't want to go home, or else my parent's will remind me about marriage again.

225
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,460
No. These few days don't work out.

226
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,240
Why not? Could you have

227
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,250
hidden a man in your home?

228
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,570
Its-No, no, the company held a training session and chose me.

229
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,920
They want me to go train outside of the city for a few days.

230
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,080
So you can't live here.

231
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,210
I'm scaring you! Alright.

232
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,530
Then I'll play a few more days before coming back! Bye!

233
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,120
Bye...

234
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,270
I noticed you're pretty good at coming up with stories.

235
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,950
I can also not make them up.

236
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,890
You move out and make some space.

237
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,110
It's alright.

238
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,970
I think the way you speak nonsense is pretty cute.

239
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,370
Oh, right. Remember to help me buy a wheelchair.

240
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,030
Imported from Germany.

241
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,780
Imported from Germany?

242
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,150
Then isn't that several thousand...

243
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,480
Aren't you about to receive money?

244
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,180
H-How do you know?

245
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,320
You talk about it everyday. "I'm getting paid on Wednesday."

246
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,660
You scared me...

247
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,040
Huh? Why does my right eyelid keep twitching?

248
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,420
Grandpa Liu.

249
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,090
-Grandpa Liu, your grandson sent you some good food! 
-Hey Anxin.

250
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,450
Here.

251
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,100
There's a new one today?

252
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,080
The joy of getting a package is no longer what's in it,

253
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,800
But it's to see what your new manga is about.

254
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,560
-I'm glad you like it. I'm going to leave first. 
-Okay. Walk safely!

255
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm leaving.

256
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,080
What is the new perfume you're using? It smells really good.

257
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,670
Layered Fragrance. This perfume is not bad.

258
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,000
You can try it too.

259
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,250
Isn't it Gu Anxin?

260
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,750
Anxin? Is it really you?

261
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,370
What a coincidence. 
-Gu Anxin, it's been so long since we have last seen each other.

262
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,440
You are still the same.

263
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,810
Nancy, you know her?

264
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,460
Of course. We went to the same school.

265
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,560
Did you guys know, this delivery girl

266
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,000
was the adopted daughter that was abandoned by the Gu family.

267
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,670
Adopted daughter? The one who was kicked out of school?

268
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,670
-Ya! 
-Nancy.

269
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,280
Stop talking.

270
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,170
Give me President Wei's namecard.

271
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,490
Anxin, this is the business my friend opened.

272
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,070
You can go look for him,

273
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,570
he will give you a good job.

274
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,250
No need. The job I have now is pretty good. 
-Just take it.

275
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,360
I really don't need it. Thank you.

276
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,300
You are already in dire straits and you are still so arrogant.

277
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,200
She's helping you because she finds you pitiful.

278
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,250
You are really uneducated.

279
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,400
There's really no upbringing at all.

280
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,490
What are you doing?

281
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,760
People like me without any upbringing won't know what actions I would take.

282
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,250
Please watch what you say.

283
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,700
I'm leaving.

284
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,880
Take this.

285
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,770
Oh yeah, Nancy. About your boyfriend's project

286
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,400
our company won't be investing in it.

287
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,290
This decision is from top management. Please relay this message to him.

288
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,080
Wait, Xin'er.

289
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
Gu Xin'er!

290
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,400
How can they do that?

291
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,440
You bastard, get out of this family.

292
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,780
Why did you tattletale to Dad? 

293
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,200
 I- I didn't. 

294
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,660
 It was you. After you came everything has changed. 

295
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,650
 It's because of you! 

296
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,510
 It's because of you, you bastard. 

297
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,220
It signifies wealth when the left eyelid twitches.

298
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,910
What are you trying to do?

299
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm asking you. What are you trying to do?

300
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,550
I'm talking to you.

301
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,410
I am the victim, why are you acting like that?

302
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,580
What's wrong with you?

303
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,990
What's wrong with you?

304
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,650
Why are you shaking?

305
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,000
Are you scared of water?

306
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,210
Wait here.

307
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,320
♫ Look at me, don't avoid me.  ♫

308
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,380

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Why are you looking at me?

324
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,860
Nothing.

325
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,160
Your holding the magazine backwards.

326
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,560
Let me calculate this with you.

327
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,280
Based on today, you are responsible for everything.

328
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,790
Maintenance: $490.

329
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,900
Spanner, ¥$30.

330
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,940
Thread seal tape, ¥$10.

331
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,060
Tee pipe, ¥$20.

332
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,610
Faucet: $35

333
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,040
Water pipe: $53.23

334
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,880
Pliers: $15

335
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,450
In total it is...

336
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,670
$653.23

337
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,630
I understand.

338
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,500
Oh ya, we can clean these things tomorrow.

339
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,880
But you need to help too.

340
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,950
Even if your hurt, you need to help.

341
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,800
What's wrong.

342
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,590
Aren't you cold?

343
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,580
The weather forecast says today is 30 degrees.

344
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,880
There's a big difference between indoor and outdoor room temperature.

345
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,640
So weird...

346
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,360
You have something here.

347
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,360
Just-let me help.

348
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,060
Do you know how many germs are on a bottlecap?

349
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,000
How many?

350
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,530
1.59 million.

351
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,630
Wow.

352
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,760
And it's easy to hurt your teeth resulting in gum infection and enamel buildup.

353
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,440
It does sound pretty scary.

354
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,850
Hurry and eat. We still need to go to the hospital afterwards.

355
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Doctor, are you really sure everything's normal?

356
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,970
Of course it's normal. It's not like he's hurt anywhere else.

357
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,060
Was I too rough?

358
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,610
No. Is the doctor married?

359
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,380
Doctor Liu? He doesn't even have a girlfriend, so who could he be married to.

360
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,490
Everyone's too busy working in the hospital. No one has time to date.

361
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,710
Sometimes, I'll walk around at home.

362
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,660
What about you?

363
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,310
No.

364
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,330
Then do you have a girlfriend?

365
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,340
Right there.

366
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,590
Aren't you brother and sister?

367
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,290
Isn't it the trend right now to call each other brother and sister?

368
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,640
I still have something to ask you.

369
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,120
His leg is healing well,

370
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,100
but right now I think his head has some problems.

371
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,980
Just...he often

372
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,260
says and does some very odd things.

373
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,670
I don't know what's wrong with him.

374
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,990
The CT scan of his head is perfectly fine.

375
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,990
What you're saying must be after the patient is injured, his mental health is impacted as well.

376
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,090
The patient's family must slowly make sure he recovers.

377
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,970
Can you keep walking?

378
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,910
I'm alright.

379
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,920
Watch out!

380
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,200
So accurate?

381
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,140
Oh my...

382
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,700
You aren't hurt?

383
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,280
How could I be hurt? I've trained before.

384
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,030
Trained?

385
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,270
I catch quick delivery.

386
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,560
Wait.

387
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,860
The skin's broken.

388
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,630
What's wrong with that? It's a small problem.

389
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,030
What are you doing?

390
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,450
It doesn't hurt?

391
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,950
It doesn't hurt...it's just a small injury.

392
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,920
I-It's a small injury. I'll do it myself.

393
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,610
Alright.

394
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,460

W-Why are you taking off your clothes?

409
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,750
What? You don't need to shower after getting rained on?

410
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,430
Y-You shower but you don't need to take your clothes off in front of me. Go inside and take them off.

411
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,090
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

412
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,090
The showerhead is broken, so you can only use the bath tub.

413
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,210
Go and shower first. I'll shower after you shower.

414
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,650
I need you to help me.

415
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,540
Help you do what?

416
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,480
Help me shower.

417
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,660
What are you thinking about?

418
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,230
What am I thinking of?

419
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,800
Or are you expecting something?

420
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,120
W-What's there to expect?

421
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,050
Y-Your foot's hurt, not your hand.

422
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,050
You can shower normally before, but you can't today?

423
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,700
But I need to bathe today.

424
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,120
What's the difference?

425
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,240
The difference is that I, an injured person, cannot sit into that bathtub.

426
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,940
Figure it out yourself.

427
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,060
100 a time.

428
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,410
200.

429
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,960
Your good?

430
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,110
Then I'll leave.

431
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,560
Wait.

432
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,250
I can't reach the shampoo.

433
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,180
