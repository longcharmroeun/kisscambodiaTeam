Why do you keep wearing something so ugly?

There won't be electricity for awhile anyways. I'll tell you a story.

120
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,610
In the past, there was an old king.

121
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,660
He wanted to find an inheritor. Therefore,

122
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,950
he called his three sons to him

123
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,220
and said...said I'm old.

124
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,970
I am going to pass down the throne to you.

125
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,090
You three must battle and decide the inheritor.

126
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,780
After it began, the third prince threw away his sword first.

127
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,100
He said...between his two brothers,

128
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,520
I am the weakest.

129
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,640
And I don't have any ability to inherit this country.

130
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,880
I choose to give up.

131
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,190
Now...only the first and second prince are left.

132
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,740
Throughout their fight, the second prince's sword

133
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,860
already brushed against the first prince's neck. However, he hesitated.

134
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,070
At that moment...the first prince took advantage of the second prince.

135
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,930
And then?

136
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,110
And then the first prince won.

137
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,090
This king just watched his sons kill each other?

138
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,090
The king believed in a cruel and savage education.

139
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,820
He didn't even care for the life of his second son.

140
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,630
I think maybe he just didn't like this second son.

141
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,350
Maybe...

142
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,260
his birth was a mistake.

143
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,090
What do you mean?

144
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,490
He's an adopted son.

145
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,510
Adopted son?

146
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,160
What's wrong?

147
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,280

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,170
They all say Xiao Yue has met misfortune.

164
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,790
The company's workers are all uneasy as well.

165
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,730
That secretary that he has

166
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,120
isn't of the Ling family. He can't replace Xiao Yue.

167
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,000
That's right. We should quickly choose a new President

168
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,630
to replace Xiao Yue's position.

169
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,980
My son's life and death is still uncertain,

170
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,570
yet you all have started to form alliances already?

171
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,550
Old Ling, we don't mean it that way.

172
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,100
-Then what do you mean?
-Everyone's worked so hard all these years,

173
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,860
so we can only be well if the Ling family is doing well. We don't have any selfish ideas.

174
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,610
Let me think about this matter.

175
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,650
I am tired. Please leave.

176
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,410
Then...we will head over now.

177
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,910
Hey! Did you see my Transformer?

178
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,950
No.

179
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,990
What are you hiding?

180
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,510
-Nothing!
-Let me see!

181
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,190
Isn't it just a stupid spinning top? Why are you hiding it?

182
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,990
Acting all weird.

183
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,470
I'm warning you. Don't you dare tell mom and dad.

184
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,520
Or else just you wait!

185
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,310
Here, eat some more.

186
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,540
Xiao Yue! Xiao Yue!

187
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,340
What's wrong?

188
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,940
Morning.

189
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,800
Morning.

190
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,610
Xiao Ba!

191
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,490
Where's my toothbrush?

192
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,130
I accidentally knocked it into the toilet when I was using the restroom.

193
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,750
C-Can I beg you

194
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,700
to not touch my things?

195
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,180
Then...I'll help you take it out?

196
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,610
How could I put something you picked back up into my mouth?

197
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,330
Makes sense.

198
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,750
[You You]

199
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,450
Xiao Ba, don't talk.

200
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,770
Hello, You You?

201
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,850
Anxin! I have good news! I saw Mike!

202
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,600
He's so much more handsome than in TV!

203
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,210
Then did you take a photo with him?

204
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,400
Of course! I'll be back in a few days.

205
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Can you let me live at your place for a few days?

206
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,340
I don't want to go home, or else my parent's will remind me about marriage again.

207
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,210
No. These few days don't work out.

208
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,990
Why not? Could you have

209
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,000
hidden a man in your home?

210
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,320
Its-No, no, the company held a training session and chose me.

211
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,670
They want me to go train outside of the city for a few days.

212
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,830
So you can't live here.

213
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,960
I'm scaring you! Alright.

214
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
Then I'll play a few more days before coming back! Bye!

215
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,870
Bye...

216
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,020
I noticed you're pretty good at coming up with stories.

217
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,700
I can also not make them up.

218
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,640
You move out and make some space.

219
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,860
It's alright.

220
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,720
I think the way you speak nonsense is pretty cute.

221
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
Oh, right. Remember to help me buy a wheelchair.

222
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,780
Imported from Germany.

223
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,530
Imported from Germany?

224
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,900
Then isn't that several thousand...

225
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,230
Aren't you about to receive money?

226
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,930
H-How do you know?

227
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,070
You talk about it everyday. "I'm getting paid on Wednesday."

228
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,410
You scared me...

229
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,790
Huh? Why does my right eyelid keep twitching?

230
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,170
Grandpa Liu.

231
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,840
-Grandpa Liu, your grandson sent you some good food!
-Hey Anxin.

232
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,200
Here.

233
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,850
There's a new one today?

234
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,830
The joy of getting a package is no longer what's in it,

235
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,550
But it's to see what your new manga is about.

236
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,310
-I'm glad you like it. I'm going to leave first.
-Okay. Walk safely!

237
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,950
I'm leaving.

238
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,830
What is the new perfume you're using? It smells really good.

239
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,420
Layered Fragrance. This perfume is not bad.

240
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,750
You can try it too.

241
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,000
Isn't it Gu Anxin?

242
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,500
Anxin? Is it really you?

243
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,120
What a coincidence.
-Gu Anxin, it's been so long since we have last seen each other.

244
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,190
You are still the same.

245
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,560
Nancy, you know her?

246
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,210
Of course. We went to the same school.

247
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,310
Did you guys know, this delivery girl

248
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,750
was the adopted daughter that was abandoned by the Gu family.

249
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,420
Adopted daughter? The one who was kicked out of school?

250
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
-Ya!
-Nancy.

251
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,030
Stop talking.

252
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,920
Give me President Wei's namecard.

253
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
Anxin, this is the business my friend opened.

254
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,820
You can go look for him,

255
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,320
he will give you a good job.

256
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,000
No need. The job I have now is pretty good.
-Just take it.

257
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,110
I really don't need it. Thank you.

258
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,050
You are already in dire straits and you are still so arrogant.

259
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,950
She's helping you because she finds you pitiful.

260
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,000
You are really uneducated.

261
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,150
There's really no upbringing at all.

262
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,240
What are you doing?

263
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,510
People like me without any upbringing won't know what actions I would take.

264
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,000
Please watch what you say.

265
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,450
I'm leaving.

266
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,630
Take this.

267
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,520
Oh yeah, Nancy. About your boyfriend's project

268
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,150
our company won't be investing in it.

269
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,040
This decision is from top management. Please relay this message to him.

270
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,830
Wait, Xin'er.

271
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,190
Gu Xin'er!

272
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,150
How can they do that?

273
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,190
You bastard, get out of this family.

274
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,530
Why did you tattletale to Dad?

275
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,950
I- I didn't.

276
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,410
It was you. After you came everything has changed.

277
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,400
It's because of you!

278
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,260
It's because of you, you bastard.

279
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,970
It signifies wealth when the left eyelid twitches.

280
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,660
What are you trying to do?

281
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,550
I'm asking you. What are you trying to do?

282
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,300
I'm talking to you.

283
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,160
I am the victim, why are you acting like that?

284
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,330
What's wrong with you?

285
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,740
What's wrong with you?

286
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,400
Why are you shaking?

287
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,750
Are you scared of water?

288
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,960
Wait here.

289
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,070
♫ Look at me, don't avoid me.  ♫

290

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,610
Nothing.

307
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,910
Your holding the magazine backwards.

308
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,310
Let me calculate this with you.

309
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,030
Based on today, you are responsible for everything.

310
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,540
Maintenance: $490.

311
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,650
Spanner, ¥$30.

312
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,690
Thread seal tape, ¥$10.

313
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,810

314
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,360

Pliers: $15

317
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,200
In total it is...

318
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,420
$653.23

319
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,380
I understand.

320
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,250
Oh ya, we can clean these things tomorrow.

321
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,630
But you need to help too.

322
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,700
Even if your hurt, you need to help.

323
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,550
What's wrong.

324
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,340
Aren't you cold?

325
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,330
The weather forecast says today is 30 degrees.

326
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,630
There's a big difference between indoor and outdoor room temperature.

327
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,390
So weird...

328
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,110
You have something here.

329
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,110
Just-let me help.

330
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,810
Do you know how many germs are on a bottlecap?

331
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,750
How many?

332
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,280
1.59 million.

333
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,380
Wow.

334
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,510
And it's easy to hurt your teeth resulting in gum infection and enamel buildup.

335
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,190
It does sound pretty scary.

336
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,600
Hurry and eat. We still need to go to the hospital afterwards.

337
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:49,190
Doctor, are you really sure everything's normal?

338
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,720
Of course it's normal. It's not like he's hurt anywhere else.

339
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,810
Was I too rough?

340
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,360
No. Is the doctor married?

341
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,130
Doctor Liu? He doesn't even have a girlfriend, so who could he be married to.

342
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,240
Everyone's too busy working in the hospital. No one has time to date.

343
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,460
Sometimes, I'll walk around at home.

344
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,410
What about you?

345
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,060
No.

346
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,080
Then do you have a girlfriend?

347
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,090
Right there.

348
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,340
Aren't you brother and sister?

349
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,040
Isn't it the trend right now to call each other brother and sister?

350
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,390
I still have something to ask you.

351
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,870
His leg is healing well,

352
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,850
but right now I think his head has some problems.

353
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,730
Just...he often

354
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,010
says and does some very odd things.

355
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,420
I don't know what's wrong with him.

356
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,740
The CT scan of his head is perfectly fine.

357
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,740
What you're saying must be after the patient is injured, his mental health is impacted as well.

358
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,840
The patient's family must slowly make sure he recovers.

359
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,720
Can you keep walking?

360
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,660
I'm alright.

361
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,670
Watch out!

362
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,950
So accurate?

363
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,890
Oh my...

364
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,450
You aren't hurt?

365
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,030
How could I be hurt? I've trained before.

366
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,780
Trained?

367
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,020
I catch quick delivery.

368
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,310
Wait.

369
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,610
The skin's broken.

370
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,380
What's wrong with that? It's a small problem.

371
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,780
What are you doing?

372
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,200
It doesn't hurt?

373
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,700
It doesn't hurt...it's just a small injury.

374
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,670
I-It's a small injury. I'll do it myself.

375
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,360
Alright.

376
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,210
Thank you.

Call a car! I'll pay.

W-Why are you taking off your clothes?

391
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,500
What? You don't need to shower after getting rained on?

392
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,180
Y-You shower but you don't need to take your clothes off in front of me. Go inside and take them off.

393
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,840
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

394
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,840
The showerhead is broken, so you can only use the bath tub.

395
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,960
Go and shower first. I'll shower after you shower.

396
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,400
I need you to help me.

397
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,290
Help you do what?

398
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,230
Help me shower.

399
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,410
What are you thinking about?

400
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,980
What am I thinking of?

401
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,550
Or are you expecting something?

402
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,870
W-What's there to expect?

403
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,800
Y-Your foot's hurt, not your hand.

404
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
You can shower normally before, but you can't today?

405
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,450
But I need to bathe today.

406
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,870
What's the difference?

407
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,990
The difference is that I, an injured person, cannot sit into that bathtub.

408
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,690
Figure it out yourself.

409
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,810
100 a time.

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,860
Then I'll leave.

413
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,310
Wait.

414
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,000
I can't reach the shampoo.
