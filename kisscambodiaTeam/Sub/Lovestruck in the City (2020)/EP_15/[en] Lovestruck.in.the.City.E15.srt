#VOLUNTARILY SINGLE

#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,087
What is this place?

9
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,758
You didn't have to rent a nice place
like this just for an interview.

10
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,970
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TEN MINUTES AGO

11
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:56,890
You know me.

12
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,603
-I like kissing.
-I must have been out of my mind.

13
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,607
What do you mean, "out of my mind"?

14
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,778
-Why did I do that?
-What do you mean?

15
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,571
-I regret it.
-Hey! What?

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,032
Did you just say you regret it?

17
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,576
Did she say she regrets… This is insane.

18
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,828
Seriously? Did you just say you regret it?

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,747
Do you mean it?

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,706
Wait!

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,756
You know what?
Think carefully before you answer.

22
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,758
If you say that you regret it now,

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,761
I'm going to go insane. I'm serious.

24
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,183
-I regret it.
-Damn it.

25
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,897
Hey, you kissed me first.

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,942
You always kissed me first.
You even kissed me first in Yangyang.

27
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,361
-Right. I must have been crazy.
-What do you mean, "crazy"?

28
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,613
You're not crazy. You're in love with me.

29
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,365
You… Hold on.

30
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,411
Look. Look at this.

31
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,748
I threw this ring away in Cheonggyecheon.

32
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,084
The fact that she has it here means

33
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,045
she went into the water on a cold day
and picked it up.

34
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,965
You know what?
I could never do something like that.

35
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,175
You loved me.

36
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,927
I did back then.

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,222
It broke my heart
when you threw it away in Cheonggyecheon,

38
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,641
so I picked it up in the water
on that cold day.

39
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,352
Yes. You did that. But what?

40
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,147
-What about now?
-But I regret it now.

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,566
I regret fishing it out and kissing you.

42
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,113
Look at her, everyone.

43
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,198
Look at her!

44
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,284
Look at her, everyone!

45
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,537
And guys, remember that face!

46
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,165
She kissed me first,
but she says she regrets it.

47
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,791
She's tearing my heart out.

48
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,918
Should I just report her
for sexual assault?

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,045
Report me? You kissed me back.

50
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,298
Fine. I kissed you back. So what?

51
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,091
I like you, so I don't regret it.

52
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,510
I like you, too. So I kissed you.

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,929
But I still regret it.

54
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,476
I like you.

55
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,645
It's true that I like you,

56
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,523
but you're not my top priority right now.

57
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,775
Okay. You do like me.

58
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,321
Fine. Let's hear it, then.
What's so important to you right now?

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm sure Kyeong-jun already told you

60
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,118
how stupid and frustrating I used to be.

61
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,831
That you were engaged to another guy?

62
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,001
So what? What about that?

63
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,170
I don't care about it at all.

64
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,922
What's the big deal about it?

65
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,966
What does it have to do
with you liking me back?

66
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,594
It might not matter to you,
but it does to me.

67
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,723
It was a secret I wanted to take
to the grave without anyone finding out.

68
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,975
You found out about it,
and I feel humiliated.

69
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,727
"Humiliated"? What about me?

70
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,437
Look at me.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,856
I'm begging you to take me back
like a crazy idiot.

72
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,442
Right now, I just look insane.

73
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,278
-Stop it. People are watching.
-I don't care!

74
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,240
They can watch us. Go ahead and watch!
I'm crazy!

75
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,784
I don't mind. They can watch.
I'm fine with it.

76
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,203
They already think I'm crazy.
Let them watch.

77
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,917
You know what?

78
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,128
You're really selfish.

79
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,007
Fine. I am selfish.

80
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,344
I pity, value,
and cherish myself the most.

81
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,346
I decided to live only for myself.

82
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,683
I'd rather be a horrible woman
than a stupid slowpoke.

83
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,185
You said Lee Eun-o was frustrating, too.

84
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,397
We're not that couple
who fell for each other in Yangyang.

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,524
We've seen each other's worst moments.

86
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,776
Do you think we can be happy together now?

87
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,074
My head hurts.

88
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
I'm going crazy.

89
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,372
What should I do? Can anyone tell me?

90
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,165
What do I do? I'll do as you say.

91
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,001
No. You know what, Seon-a…

92
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,127
No.

93
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,296
Lee Eun-o. I will get

94
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,880
revenge.

95
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,257
I mean it. I'll get revenge.

96
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,342
Is there a way

97
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,219
to make her cry?

98
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,306
Is there a way to make her
shed tears of blood?

99
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,223
Please tell me.

100
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,811
What? Meet someone else?

101
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,398
That doesn't solve anything.

102
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,941
I still like Eun-o.

103
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,193
It'd make that woman feel bad,
don't you think?

104
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,279
I can't date someone else
in this condition.

105
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,990
Right now, I'm the crazy one!

106
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,158
Never mind.

107
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,410
Never mind. No.

108
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,997
You know what? I cannot let this slide.

109
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,167
Here. Look. I'll show you.

110
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,294
You're dead meat.

111
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,464
Fine.

112
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,884
CRAZY IDIOT

113
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,066
-Hello?
<i>-How can you sleep right now?</i>

114
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,115
What?

115
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,368
Did she hang up?

116
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,581
Truly unbelievable.

117
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
-What?
-How can you sleep right now?

118
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,345
I'm sleepy. So what?

119
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,432
"Sleepy"? Gosh, you are

120
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,893
truly awful, indeed!

121
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,269
-<i>Damn it.</i>
-I know.

122
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,772
You…

123
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,899
You are terrible.

124
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,734
I am.

125
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,071
Hello?

126
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,284
She must be out of her mind.
She hung up again.

127
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,592
Don't hang up on me.

128
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,178
Don't hang up. Please don't hang up on me.

129
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,972
Also,

130
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,181
don't go to sleep.

131
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,307
If you do,

132
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,310
it will drive me crazy
and torture me to death.

133
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,403
Okay. I won't.

134
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,406
<i>Yes. Good.</i>

135
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,408
Just

136
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,118
stay like that.

137
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,038
Fine. I will.

138
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,630
By the way, if I'm the bad one here,

139
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,424
what are you?

140
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,508
I'm…

141
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,094
I'm the crazy guy.

142
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,309
-Do you know you're crazy?
-Yes.

143
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,644
It's all because of you.

144
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,152
But you know what?

145
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,239
Do you really regret meeting me?

146
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,415
I don't regret it.

147
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,210
Me neither.

148
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,921
I've done all sorts of crazy things
after I met you.

149
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,381
But I never regretted meeting you.

150
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,844
When I was with you,

151
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,848
I loved every moment.

152
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,311
<i>I tried out things
I'd wanted to do but never tried.</i>

153
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,773
And…

154
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,153
the fact that you liked me

155
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,324
made me very grateful.

156
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,162
<i>That's what I needed back then.</i>

157
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,791
<i>I wanted to become someone else.</i>

158
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,170
And I wanted to be loved.

159
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Do you

160
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,063
honestly believe
that you weren't yourself in Yangyang?

161
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,029
I still don't know.

162
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,119
I don't know if I've changed

163
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,664
or if I'm just Lee Eun-o
pretending to be Yoon Seon-a.

164
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,168
<i>I've tried and reminded myself
not to go back</i>

165
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,921
<i>to the stupid old me.</i>

166
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,135
But there are times
when even that effort feels fake.

167
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,309
That's it.

168
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,520
Your top priority.

169
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,981
<i>You're right.</i>

170
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,816
I

171
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,445
want to find my true self.

172
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,531
<i>I want to know what I'm made of.</i>

173
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,285
<i>I still don't know who I really am.</i>

174
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,040
But I don't want to go back to the old me.

175
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,509
I'm sorry that this is the real me.

176
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,678
But…

177
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,432
finding myself is more important to me.

178
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,895
<i>Taking care of myself is,</i>

179
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,855
for now,

180
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,608
more important than loving you.

181
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,685
Your keys.

182
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,157
Hello. How can I help you?

183
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,410
Hi. The side-view mirror here fell off.

184
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,285
Take them.

185
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,287
It's for my conscience.

186
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,331
Okay.

187
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,626
I don't want you to feel guilty.

188
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,761
Here.

189
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,514
You left it at my place
when you slept over.

190
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,977
You said you're finding yourself.

191
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,856
So good luck.

192
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,400
Okay.

193
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,739
Aren't you going to tell me to take care?

194
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,911
We'll see each other at work.

195
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,665
Yes. You're right. See you.

196
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,929
<i>Did you glue the fork?</i>

197
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,227
<i>I knew it.</i>

198
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,020
<i>Do you want a new bike?</i>

199
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,523
No, thanks. I want something else.

200
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,525
<i>One hundred kisses.</i>

201
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,485
<i>One hundred "I love you's."</i>

202
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,487
<i>And one hundred hugs.</i>

203
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,491
<i>Then, how about tonight?</i>

204
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,786
<i>Tonight?</i>

205
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,247
No.

206
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,586
<i>I'm washing my bedding now.</i>

207
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>I'm sleeping over at Eun-o's tonight.</i>

208
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,467
Just buy an extra set of bedding! Please!

209
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,344
I beg you!

210
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,987
SEON-YEONG

211
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,532
<i>I finally found your place. Come out.
I'm in front of your house.</i>

212
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,599
Where is she?

213
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,604
Whose house is she waiting at?

214
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,703
It's cold outside. Come on.

215
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,969
-What do you want?
-Sorry.

216
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,064
Attention. At ease.

217
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,691
Attention.

218
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,736
Look at these punks. I said, "attention."

219
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,411
Are you leaning on one foot?

220
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,955
Stand properly.

221
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,665
You just kicked me.

222
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,209
Yes. I did kick you.
So what are you going to do?

223
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:46,338
Should we go to the police
or the Office of Education? You choose.

224
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,843
Smoking itself is bad enough,

225
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,597
but throwing away cigarette butts
on the streets is even worse.

226
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,977
Now, start picking up the cigarette butts
you threw away yourself.

227
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,894
Right now.

228
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,605
Now!

229
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,236
Pick them up. Hurry up.

230
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,114
Why is that tissue here?
Did you blow your nose?

231
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,490
Gosh. Move faster.

232
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,284
Hey, right here. Pick it up.

233
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,411
-Here. Pick that up.
-You blew your nose?

234
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,206
Mister, just mind your business.

235
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,042
You're quite tall.

236
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,086
What a rude punk.

237
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,757
-Do you know how old I am?
-Why should I care?

238
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,342
You're irritating me.

239
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,179
"Irritating"?

240
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,391
How dare you pick a fight
when you're being disciplined?

241
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,559
Get a grip.

242
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,940
By the way, he's my boyfriend.

243
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,235
Don't bother him.
He'll hurt his handsome face.

244
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,322
Right.

245
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,158
I'm her boyfriend.

246
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,202
Do you hear me?

247
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,377
I told you just to turn a blind eye
to such students.

248
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,671
Do you know how scary kids are?

249
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,715
It's okay. I'm scarier.

250
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,593
Yes, that's true.

251
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,722
Why did you say you're at my house?

252
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,353
I couldn't find your house,
so I did a little experiment.

253
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,148
I wanted to see if you could find me
if I texted you.

254
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,655
Do you still miss your mom?

255
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,785
Yes. I miss her when I drink,

256
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,955
when I'm rolling on the floor
with a hangover,

257
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,374
when I'm walking on the streets
late at night,

258
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,461
and when my principal lectures me
for being late.

259
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,213
How could you miss your mom

260
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,424
only in situations
where your mom would be furious?

261
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,761
I feel like she'll come to my rescue.

262
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,850
I'm hot-tempered
because I take after my mom.

263
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,020
"Hey! You shouldn't live like that!

264
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,230
Get a grip!"

265
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,443
I feel like

266
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,405
she'll show up in my dreams to scold me.

267
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,869
What do you want to say if you meet her?

268
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,585
I would tell her there's this guy
I keep thinking about.

269
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,423
He's really slow and really ugly.

270
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,093
He's a total idiot.

271
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,055
Why did you dump him then?

272
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,516
Why didn't you stop me?

273
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,769
You're not the kind of woman I could stop.

274
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,771
I waited for you.

275
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,859
I thought you would stop me

276
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,570
and tell me to reconsider.

277
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,032
I wanted you to beg me to stay.

278
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,245
So I waited, but you didn't come back.

279
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,960
If it was someone else,
I would have just moved on

280
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,754
and wouldn't even have cared.

281
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:19,593
But because it was you,
I was so angry, annoyed…

282
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,683
and sad.

283
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,984
Do you know how special you are to me?

284
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,907
Whenever I told guys I missed my mom,
they all said,

285
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,825
"Cheer up.

286
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,869
I understand how you feel.

287
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,996
I would feel the same way."

288
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,501
But you were different.

289
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,673
"Whenever you miss your mom, come to me."

290
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,095
You were the only guy who said that.

291
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,390
Look at you.

292
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,809
You're not trying to comfort me.

293
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,145
Instead, you're letting me
talk about my mom all I want.

294
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,940
I guess…

295
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,403
I wanted to be like that to you.

296
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,079
You like Eun-o, right?

297
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,961
No.

298
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,307
That's the first time you said no.

299
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,560
Lee Eun-o. Suh Rin-i.

300
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,354
I don't see them as women.

301
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,983
Even if I see them as women,

302
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,444
I think you're the prettiest

303
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,156
and the sexiest.

304
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,619
What?

305
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,165
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

306
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,543
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

307
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,548
I thought you were looking
for an excuse to break up with me.

308
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,551
I thought you fell out of love,

309
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,054
so you wanted to break up.

310
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,353
Why can't I

311
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,732
be in a long-term relationship
with one guy?

312
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,651
Your romance may be short,

313
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,613
but it's passionate.

314
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,865
Every moment counts.

315
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,296
From now on, I won't visit you
even when I miss my mom.

316
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,174
I'll pull through on my own.

317
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,100
I will end our relationship for good.

318
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,978
I came to say that.

319
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,118
Whenever we meet, it snows.

320
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,580
It won't snow for long.

321
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,005
Let's part our ways here.

322
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,553
Hey.

323
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,888
You know…

324
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,769
If you see those punks again
in that alley,

325
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,354
tell them you're my boyfriend.

326
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,482
I get the feeling
they'll punch you someday.

327
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,370
What do you take me for?

328
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,106
When will you get a real job
instead of a part-time job?

329
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,068
Just take your wallet out, Mr. Unemployed.

330
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,904
I'm not unemployed. I'm a novelist.

331
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,323
It's been three years
since you published anything.

332
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,575
A few days ago,
I had a meeting with the editor.

333
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,577
You've been having meetings
for three years

334
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,371
and haven't published anything.

335
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,957
You always rub salt in my wound.

336
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,254
Here's my card.

337
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,383
Hey, are we drinking beer tonight?

338
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,344
No. I'm lighting the candle today.

339
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,097
Why? What's the matter?

340
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,182
I'll tell you later.

341
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,018
-What time does your shift end?
-At ten.

342
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,728
But I'm crashing at your place.

343
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,064
I washed my bedding today.

344
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,274
You seem excited.

345
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,150
Isn't it annoying to come over?

346
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,069
Just get an extra set.

347
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,988
It's a waste. One set is enough.

348
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,323
Go now.

349
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,409
Pack them yourself.

350
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,334
<i>I'm lighting the candle today.</i>

351
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,337
<i>I have something to tell you.
My place, at ten.</i>

352
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,132
No way.

353
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,301
It's my turn to light the candle.

354
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,886
<i>The candle day?</i>

355
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,140
<i>The three of them have been friends
since kindergarten.</i>

356
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,601
When one of them lights a candle,
the other two just listen.

357
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,686
That's what I heard.

358
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,898
Me? I transferred to another school
when I was in second grade,

359
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,775
so I'm not their childhood friend.

360
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,652
I met them again through Rin-i.

361
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,909
Do you remember?

362
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,745
A year ago,

363
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,873
I went off the radar

364
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,792
and came back to Seoul.

365
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,784
<i>My house must be cold inside.</i>

366
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,552
What? Why are all the lights on?

367
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,890
Why is it so warm in here?

368
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,355
You startled me.

369
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,607
Why are you here?

370
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,734
Why are you at my house?

371
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,532
I thought

372
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,618
it would be cold when you came.

373
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,083
I washed your bedding.

374
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,421
And I took out the bedding for winter.

375
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:43,722
I thought the electricity and water
would have been cut off.

376
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,265
I took care of the bills.

377
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,270
Isn't it cold outside?

378
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,276
Yes.

379
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,361
It's freezing.

380
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,657
Did you know Rin-i came back?

381
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,745
-When?
-When she heard you disappeared.

382
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,038
She even went to Busan to find you.

383
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,751
Unpack your things. Let's eat.

384
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,756
Call Rin-i first.

385
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,648
I think Rin-i came here often to check.

386
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,818
They were on the door.
I put them there for you to see.

387
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,323
<i>Eun-o, it's Rin-i.</i>

388
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,202
<i>I found rice weevils while cleaning,
so I bought a new bag of rice.</i>

389
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,538
<i>It's not for free.
Pay me back when you come back.</i>

390
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,292
<i>I put curry inside the fridge.</i>

391
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,836
<i>I hope you'll come and eat it soon.</i>

392
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,591
<i>Where on earth are you?</i>

393
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,010
<i>Prepare for a huge fight
when you come back.</i>

394
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,890
<i>Come back soon, Eun-o. I miss you.</i>

395
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,060
EUN-O, ARE YOU EATING WELL?

396
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,520
EUN-O, I CLEANED THE HOUSE!

397
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,188
I EVEN WASHED THE BLANKETS!

398
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,399
<i>Back then,</i>

399
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,487
<i>you kept my house warm.</i>

400
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,657
And both of you waited for me.

401
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,492
Thank you.

402
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,497
It's all in the past.
Why bring that up now?

403
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,921
I'm sure you had so many questions
and wanted some answers

404
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,549
from me.

405
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,719
I know you didn't ask
out of consideration.

406
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,723
I knew it all along
but pretended I didn't.

407
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,354
Instead, I hid behind your kindness.

408
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,524
I'm sorry.

409
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,901
Sorry

410
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,195
and thank you.

411
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,170
So…

412
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,518
So…

413
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,778
You can tell us next time if it's hard.

414
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,407
Right, Eun-o.
You don't have to tell us today.

415
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,117
We see each other all the time.

416
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:54,954
No.

417
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,624
I can't run away again.

418
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,920
I kept secrets from you.

419
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,380
I'm sorry.

420
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,550
I don't want to do that again.

421
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,973
I…

422
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,896
I…

423
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,691
I am…

424
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,529
Yoon Seon-a.

425
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,370
I stole Jae-won's cameras.

426
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,883
Telling the truth is so hard.

427
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,644
Honestly,

428
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,649
I haven't changed at all.

429
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,568
I'm still the same stupid Lee Eun-o.

430
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,655
Why do you think you're stupid?

431
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,284
Back then, I thought it happened
because I was stupid.

432
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,997
Why is that your fault?
It was Kang Min-su's fault.

433
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,251
Your job offer, too.
It was the company's fault, not yours.

434
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,717
I just

435
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,847
didn't want Jae-won
to find out how stupid I was.

436
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,807
I really didn't.

437
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,521
I hated that the girl Jae-won met
in Yangyang was all fake.

438
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,567
And I didn't want Jae-won to find out

439
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,403
why I ended up going
all the way to Yangyang.

440
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,116
I didn't want you to find out
because it's embarrassing and humiliating.

441
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,498
I'm so mad at you.

442
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,208
Same here.

443
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,297
How could you keep that a secret?
What are friends for?

444
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,215
I'm sorry.

445
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,263
But it wasn't because
I didn't think you weren't my friends.

446
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,348
I wanted to keep it to myself.

447
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,269
I just didn't want anyone
to find out about this.

448
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,234
Eun-o.

449
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,405
I have something to tell you.

450
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,451
The old Eun-o

451
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,036
wasn't stupid.

452
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,830
She's right.

453
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,460
You were kind and warmhearted.

454
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,798
I liked the old you so much.

455
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,758
Me too.

456
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,763
And I like the new you, too.

457
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,267
Now you cry when you want to, smile a lot,

458
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,728
get angry easily,

459
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,564
move on quickly, and goof around.

460
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,526
That's why I like you.

461
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,325
The old you. The new you.
Both of them are Eun-o.

462
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,577
They're all Eun-o.

463
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,624
So I don't want you to say that again.

464
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,425
Why are you crying?

465
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,261
Because you're crying.

466
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,305
Don't cry, Rin-i.

467
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,349
You too.

468
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,483
Sorry.

469
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,944
What are you sorry about?

470
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,197
My dear Eun-o.

471
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,255
I'm lonely.

472
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,302
Why am I so lonely?

473
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,545
<i>You left it at my place
when you slept over.</i>

474
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,299
You said you're finding yourself.

475
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,509
So good luck.

476
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,764
What is this?

477
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,808
Right. You wanted to light a candle too.

478
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,893
Oh, me?

479
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,688
Why? What's the matter?

480
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,606
I

481
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,484
broke up with Seon-yeong

482
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,530
before I went to the supermarket.

483
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,700
But you broke up three years ago.

484
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,160
We broke up again.

485
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,915
When she was telling me something,
my heart just…

486
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,588
That's all for the candle day.
I'm going to wash up.

487
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,052
Even so,

488
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,181
it must have been hard on you.

489
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,559
You have to go and work, right?

490
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,645
Yes. I have some work left.

491
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,276
Fine, go. Leave.

492
