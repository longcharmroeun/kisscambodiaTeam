#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,546
Get home safe.

9
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,221
Eun-o.

10
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,685
Rin-i's here.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,860
What's going on?
Why are you two here together?

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,320
What?

13
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,043
Were you having a meeting
with his company?

14
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,170
Yes.

15
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,049
But all the documents
you brought yesterday are still at home.

16
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,929
We had to speed things up. That's why.

17
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,642
You didn't have to drop me home,
but you insisted.

18
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,227
Thank you. Get home safe.

19
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,354
I'll go in first.

20
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,940
Jae-won, do you want <i>ramyeon</i>?

21
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>-Ramyeon?</i>
-Yes.

22
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,195
Don't bother him. He's a busy man.

23
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,655
You're not hungry, are you?

24
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,907
I am.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,076
Still, you don't want <i>ramyeon</i>, do you?

26
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,455
I do.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,875
-Let's eat. I have time.
-Okay.

28
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,379
Go in first. Let me park my car.

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,597
-Eun-o's special cockle <i>ramyeon</i>!
-Eun-o's special cockle <i>ramyeon</i>!

30
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,191
-It looks good.
-It does.

31
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486
Ms. Lee, thank you.

32
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,031
It's so delicious.

33
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,700
-Jae-won, she invented this.
-What?

34
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,787
I love cockles. Why didn't I
think of adding this to <i>ramyeon</i>?

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,705
Eun-o.

36
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,041
Mine has so many cockles.

37
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,753
Mine…

38
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,594
-When will you start working?
-I won't.

39
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,096
We had a talk.
I didn't like the conditions.

40
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,433
You're not the one that could decide.
We may not hire you.

41
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,059
We don't hire just anyone.

42
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,644
You must be on a power trip.

43
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,480
You must not have read
the request thoroughly.

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,109
It says that many companies
will be competing against each other,

45
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,446
and our employees will evaluate
their proposals and take a vote.

46
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,364
We made it clear.

47
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,784
-Could she be disqualified?
-Yes.

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,620
Don't be ridiculous. I won't be.

49
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,621
Just so you know,

50
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
O3 is the smallest among them.

51
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,587
The size of a company
has nothing to do with its capacity.

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,256
Anyway, I have no time,
and it doesn't suit my company.

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,091
-So I won't do it.
-Eun-o.

54
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,302
I don't think
you're in a position to be picky.

55
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,388
Why not? O3 is flourishing these days.

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,017
I'm about to reap what I sowed
and receive hundreds of offers.

57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,479
Kyeong-jun probably told him
that you were about to starve to death.

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,983
Starve how? I was not.

59
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,737
You need to get this gig.
You'd better win that bidding.

60
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,241
The landlord called us
about raising our rent.

61
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,246
What? Why are you telling me that now?

62
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,914
I got the call this morning.

63
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,624
So I'm telling you pretty soon.

64
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,793
So? By how much?

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,545
-Twenty percent.
-Twenty?

66
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,007
Damn it! How could they do that?

67
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,386
Do they want us to freeze to death
this winter? Are they serious?

68
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,221
There's a rent fee price cap.

69
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,516
They can only raise it
by five percent at most.

70
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,519
Are you stupid?
Why didn't you say anything?

71
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,146
Even five percent is absurd. It's not like
I can make money grow from trees.

72
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,523
I can't pay more than that.

73
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>Kyeong-jun said
the old Eun-o used to be kind and calm.</i>

74
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,863
-I'm speechless.
<i>-Who in the world is she?</i>

75
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,410
She's neither my beloved Yoon Seon-a
nor the kindhearted Lee Eun-o.

76
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,954
I just can't understand her.

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,415
Tell the landlord I'm on my way.

78
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,417
-You do it.
-You signed the contract.

79
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,628
Sorry to say this right now,

80
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,590
but the bidding is just around the corner,
Eun-o.

81
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,387
Yes, this isn't the time for that.

82
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,180
Han-gyeol.

83
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,351
If you look at the maintenance
and equipment fees for the building…

84
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,605
Mr. Choi, may I have a word with you?

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,453
What is it?

86
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,748
I asked the owner
of the house in Buam-dong

87
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,624
to wait until the end of this month.

88
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,837
Why won't you give up on your design?

89
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,177
They won't be able to move in
by the set date.

90
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,595
Where will they live then?

91
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,096
What did you tell me last time?

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,974
You said you'd give up
because you can't modify it.

93
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,603
-I think I'll figure it out.
-Sure, you'll find a way.

94
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,813
After you redesign the entire building.

95
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,192
You know you'll have to move and rebuild
the water supply and drainage.

96
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,652
You're an expert. What's wrong with you?

97
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,323
Why won't you talk? Answer me.

98
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,784
Because you're right.

99
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,246
Kyeong-jun, everything you said is right.

100
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,583
Have you ever wondered

101
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,087
how many houses
in Seoul are over a century old?

102
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,757
They all get demolished
in less than 20 to 30 years.

103
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,470
If we're going to build a house
with every material we want to use,

104
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,472
I want to have no regrets,

105
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,017
and I want the family to live there
for generations on end.

106
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,230
You and your bluffing. Hold on.

107
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,195
I'll give you ten more days.

108
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,114
I can't give you more than that.

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
Did the meeting for the materials go well?

110
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't know. Why were you late?

111
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,498
I had a meeting with Ms. Lee
early in the morning.

112
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,041
Didn't you hand over everything?

113
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,254
I thought I did, but I had forgotten
to give her something. That's why.

114
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,537
What's this?

115
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,422
<i>Where was Eun-o planning to go</i>

116
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,799
<i>with this empty suitcase?</i>

117
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,827
-Right, your necklace.
-Right.

118
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,039
Right, your necklace.

119
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,582
What are the rings for? A new boyfriend?

120
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,170
Hello?

121
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,631
Hello. Are you busy?

122
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,593
Do you remember the open house party
you did last time?

123
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,054
Yes, could you send me the reference?

124
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,099
I saw the video your company made

125
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,475
and wanted to refer to it.

126
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,102
Right.

127
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,522
I'm thinking of going with acoustic music
for the performance.

128
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,899
Could you send me
the list of artists as well?

129
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,696
Of course, you're investing in me.

130
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,699
You just wait.
O3 will grow big and help you out.

131
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,285
Okay, thank you.

132
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,830
I guess that will do.

133
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,999
Let's see.

134
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,143
Are you here to see Rin-i?

135
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,102
Yes.

136
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,563
I guess she didn't tell you.

137
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,275
She got fired today.
Our manager's sister-in-law will take…

138
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,237
What? That's just ridiculous.

139
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,659
So where is Rin-i?

140
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,663
She didn't come here.

141
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,125
Then where is she? She wasn't home either.

142
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,794
She's not a kid.
Are you worried that she lost her way?

143
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,382
Did you really agree to buy that
for 350,000 won?

144
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,425
Yes.

145
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,428
I only gave in
because she was pestering me.

146
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,805
I searched it up.
It really costs 1,2 million won.

147
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,266
And it's a famous brand.

148
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,520
That's right. And you know what?
That's brand new.

149
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,357
It has never been used
or displayed before.

150
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,941
It's really brand new, idiot.

151
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,902
Why did you say you got it for free?

152
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,407
Did you lie to her again?
Because she'd get mad about the price?

153
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,950
Why didn't you catch on sooner?

154
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,078
I gave you all sorts of signals.

155
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,537
Did you?

156
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,290
You're really unhelpful.

157
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,043
You're the problem here, not me.

158
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,045
Why are you complicating your romance?

159
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,340
I don't want someone who's been single
for two years to lecture me.

160
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,468
Where in the world is she?

161
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,554
Isn't her boss crazy?

162
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,848
Should I report him
for wrongful dismissal?

163
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,350
-Yes.
-Should I?

164
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,312
What if she's crying somewhere right now?

165
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,856
She must be furious and upset.

166
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,859
She said she needed to get an extra job.

167
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,986
-How could she get fired?
-Kyeong-jun.

168
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,115
You don't know what Rin-i's like.

169
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,993
Don't worry. I'm sure she's doing fine.

170
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,622
Are you sure? How do you know that?

171
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,750
-Are you her dad?
-I am indeed, Mr. Choi.

172
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,086
You should go back home.

173
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,343
Good job.

174
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,887
You're good on the leash.

175
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,898
What's going on?

176
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,818
I missed you, you know?

177
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,528
And here you are!

178
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,071
I read your mind.

179
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,199
Then you must have also known
I was craving spaghetti.

180
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,200
You bet.

181
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,286
I know everything about you, Rin-i.

182
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,580
Of course, you do.

183
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,499
-It looks so delicious.
-It's done. Wash your hands.

184
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,675
What?

185
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,637
We should throw this away.

186
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,890
No, I can glue it back.

187
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,349
Put it there. I'll be back.

188
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,647
Why would she glue it back?

189
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,202
Rin-i, this portable gas stove
looks dangerous.

190
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,245
The induction cooktop will be fixed soon.

191
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,457
-Should I buy a cheap one?
-Thank you for the meal.

192
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,339
This is so good.
I thought I was starving to death.

193
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,342
-Eat up. I made a lot.
-You too.

194
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,224
Rin-i.

195
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,686
I heard you got fired
from the cosmetics store.

196
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,897
How did you know?

197
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,360
Did you come to see me?
You should have called me.

198
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,071
I got a new job.

199
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,782
-What is it?
-Dog walking.

200
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,036
There's a house near that playground,
and they have a big dog.

201
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,540
I'll be walking their dog
two hours every day.

202
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,458
Guess how much the rate is.

203
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,628
It's 15,000 won per hour.
That's 30,000 won for 2 hours.

204
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,296
Won't you be cold?

205
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,841
How can you walk around for that long
in this weather?

206
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,718
No, dog walking is fun.

207
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,804
I'll be exercising
and making money as well.

208
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,430
This is good.

209
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,267
Rin-i.

210
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,522
Is there anything
you'd like to learn or study?

211
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,524
I do study.

212
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,943
I also attend
those environmental seminars.

213
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,028
No, not that kind of studying.

214
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,156
Didn't you say
you want to become a teacher?

215
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,159
We all have grand dreams
when we're little.

216
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,414
No, I think that occupation
will suit you well.

217
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,541
After all, you like kids.

218
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,003
I think you'll make
a great elementary school teacher.

219
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,132
How about going
to Seoul National University of Education?

220
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,886
Give it some serious thought.

221
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,724
I heard many people study
to become a teacher at a later age.

222
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,854
Kyeong-jun.

223
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,983
It's not for me. I told you last time.

224
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,402
I'm truly happy with my life right now.

225
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,655
Besides, the tuition is too expensive.

226
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,367
You have me.
If you want, I can pay for your tuition.

227
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,287
Think about it.

228
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,793
Right.

229
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,712
I have something to show you.

230
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,342
Ta-da. It's 350,000 won.

231
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,053
Geon paid me for that bedside table.

232
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,430
I'll buy you a muffler.

233
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,937
All right. Let's finish our meal.

234
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:42,983
It's so good.

235
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,321
This is a neighboring house. Number 56-9.

236
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,699
They want us to rebuild the wall
between them and our house.

237
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,700
Let me see.

238
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,621
Like this.

239
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,623
Like this?

240
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,667
I see.

241
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,088
We have the bidding result
for the complex cultural center.

242
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,507
O3.

243
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,302
See? I told you she'd get it.

244
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,055
-You may proceed.
-Yes, sir.

245
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,892
Will they stop complaining
if we fix this wall?

246
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,187
Hold on. Let me tell Eun-o
about the bidding result.

247
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,563
Sure.

248
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,830
COMPLEX CULTURAL CENTER DESIGNER
TEAM LEADER: PARK JAE-WON

249
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,376
You knew I tried to find you for a year.

250
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,505
You heard it from Rin-i and Kyeong-jun,
but you did nothing.

251
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,591
LEE EUN-O

252
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,699
O THREE

253
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,332
I found nothing
when I searched for "Yoon Seon-a."

254
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,175
<i>I found a book at a bookstore
someone I know used to read.</i>

255
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,978
<i>Bratislava, Poznań,</i>

256
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>Trieste, and Riga.</i>

257
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,944
<i>Due to their unfamiliar names,
these cities sound more romantic.</i>

258
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,073
<i>He wanted to walk
the alleyways in Europe together.</i>

259
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,450
<i>How are you doing?</i>

260
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,286
<i>I'm doing great.</i>

261
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,455
What?

262
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,625
You said you got over it.

263
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,839
<i>Tonight, I'm reminded
of the memories that radiated</i>

264
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,633
<i>and dissipated
like a midsummer night's dream.</i>

265
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>My proposals have been rejected,
and I haven't received any job offers.</i>

266
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,897
<i>Despite the endless worries</i>

267
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,733
<i>that have made me gloomy,
I can still hold on</i>

268
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,320
<i> thanks to the memories
of dancing in the rain like a kid.</i>

269
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,159
<i>Those memories make me smile once again.</i>

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,327
<i>Lee Eun-o, you can do it.</i>

271
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,895
<i>I'm always cranky.</i>

272
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,564
But I turn gentle when I fall in love.

273
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,358
What are you like when you're in love?

274
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,212
But when they come back,
they forget about it and just move on.

275
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,796
So did you get over me?

276
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,590
Was it just a piece of memory?

277
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>You know nothing about me.</i>

278
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,267
<i>About my feelings, personality,
thoughts, or preferences.</i>

279
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,853
<i>You know nothing.</i>

280
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,579
What's with the jump ropes?
Nighttime workout?

281
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,665
Look who's talking. Go in.

282
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,708
There's a package downstairs.

283
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,001
Why didn't you pick it up?

284
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,128
Because

285
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,714
it was yours.

286
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,636
That little…

287
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,075
-What was that?
-What was that?

288
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,080
What is it?

289
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,001
What? O3?

290
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,502
This is Seon-a's…

291
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,129
I mean, Eun-o's car.

292
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,840
This is unbelievable.

293
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,594
Why did it have to be hers?

294
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,721
No way.

295
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,723
Jae-won, you lunatic.

296
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,808
How could you…

297
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,188
What should I tell her?

298
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,566
I should call her.

299
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,403
What should I say?
This is driving me crazy.

300
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,207
Hello?

301
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,959
Hello?

302
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,338
I'm really sorry, but I…

303
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,341
No. This is Park Jae-won.

304
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,093
I was parking, and I think

305
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,473
I bumped into your car.
You should come and check.

306
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,850
It's nothing serious.

307
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,976
It's just a scratch.

308
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,188
It's a small scratch. A teeny one.

309
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,148
How is that a teeny scratch?

310
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,816
What?

311
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,944
Move aside.

312
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,574
-How is that teeny?
-You can barely see it from afar.

313
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,242
Hang up first.

314
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,621
Hey. Your car is fine,
but mine is smashed up.

315
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,373
Come on. How is this "smashed up"?

316
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,543
And you should have parked
a bit more to the--

317
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,171
-This is in front of my house.
-Yes, you're right.

318
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,589
As the owner of this house,

319
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,300
you should've parked a bit closer.

320
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:09,346
What did I do so wrong?
I parked flawlessly.

321
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,556
Right, it's all my fault.

322
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,266
You did nothing wrong.

323
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,186
It's my fault for coming here
and hitting your car.

324
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,355
It's my fault for being Park Jae-won

325
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,525
and having you as my ex-wife.

326
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,527
"Ex-wife"? Hey.

327
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,988
-Don't say that.
-Why not? You are my ex-wife.

328
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,532
When I asked you to marry me,

329
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,910
you happily demanded a proposal.
Why? Is it irritating?

330
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,829
-I'm sick of it.
-"Sick"?

331
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,872
You're sick of it?

332
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,126
Why did you seduce me?

333
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,002
You had an ulterior motive, didn't you?

334
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,672
Talking about the field and the rain
as you convinced me

335
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,132
to get a driver's license.

336
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,344
You could've not fallen for me
when I was talking about those things.

337
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,638
Did you not seduce me then? You did.

338
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,641
-You were more passionate about it.
-Was I? When?

339
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,185
Why did you grab my hand
when we first met?

340
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,354
I was standing still, but you grabbed me.

341
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,607
We were playing a game.
I wanted the prize.

342
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,860
Coincidentally, you were in front of me.

343
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,154
You were within arm's reach.

344
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,241
If it was another woman,
you would've grabbed her instead, right?

345
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,161
What is this? You're jealous, aren't you?

346
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,787
Forget it. Pay for the damages.

347
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,789
I will. Call the insurance…

348
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,834
No, forget it. How much is it?

349
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,212
-Are you showing off your money?
-How is this…

350
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,383
They said you used to be kindhearted.

351
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,885
But you're so weird now.

352
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,929
Look who's talking.
You acted so nonchalant,

353
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
but you're so obsessive now.

354
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,100
This is all because of you!

355
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,019
Where is the kindhearted Eun-o?

356
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,229
Forget about Seon-a. Where is she?

357
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,523
She's right here.
What will you do about it?

358
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,443
No, you're not kind at all.

359
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,653
I bet you were always mean.

360
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,822
-I bet Kyeong-jun didn't know.
-Move your car!

361
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,074
Fine. I'll move it!

362
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,243
You horrible woman.

363
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,745
Move your car, you lunatic.

364
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,788
Why did you kick…

365
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,566
This is…

366
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,236
This is our wedding ring.

367
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,490
I threw mine away in Cheonggyecheon.

368
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,035
Where is it?

369
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,431
What is this?

370
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,309
Is this our ring?

371
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,104
No.

372
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,234
The rings on your necklace I heard…

373
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,152
-They're our rings, aren't they?
-No.

374
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,529
What do you mean? They are.

375
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,948
-Move aside. Let me check.
-I said no.

376
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,908
-Move.
-It's not ours.

377
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,957
I was right. They're ours.

378
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,003
I'm right.

379
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,381
Give them back. They're mine.

380
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,800
I threw this away in Cheonggyecheon.
Why do you have it?

381
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,385
-Give them back.
-Hey.

382
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,096
What's your deal?

383
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,683
Why are you tormenting me?

384
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,810
Why?

385
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,854
These are our wedding rings.

386
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,398
You didn't throw yours away.

387
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,192
You lied that you moved on, didn't you?

388
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,820
I found out everything.

389
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,573
What do you mean?

390
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,743
You had my cameras
and printed all of our photos.

391
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,578
And these rings.

392
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,624
They are our wedding rings.
You had yours all along.

393
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,170
Eun-o, what is going on?

394
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,050
Tell me what your true feelings are!

395
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,599
Can't you just pretend not to know me?

396
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,354
I…

397
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,816
I really don't want my friends
to find out.

398
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,448
Are you that embarrassed
about your alias in Yangyang?

399
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,829
Coincidentally,
you're Kyeong-jun's cousin.

400
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,166
You're right. I'm his cousin. So what?

401
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,003
Why do we have to break up
because of that?

402
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,717
Can't you just break up with me?

403
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,346
Do you really mean it?

404
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,058
You don't.

405
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,727
I can tell.

406
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,483
Tell me.

407
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,236
Look at me.

408
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,114
Eun-o.

409
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,324
Hey, Eun-o.

410
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,164
When you looked for my ring
when you were in Cheonggyecheon,

411
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,290
what were you thinking?

412
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,046
You thought of me.

413
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,550
You

414
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,094
still love…

415
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,611
