00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,290
Oh, the product name has to show?

9
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,833
Like this?

10
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,799
It's nice. Very sweet.

11
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>Have you ever blacked out after drinking?</i>

12
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,308
Not even once.

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,145
I really don't get
why people drink to the point

14
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,064
of blacking out.

15
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,232
We don't cross the line.

16
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,735
Exactly. We just have
a few drinks to get buzzed.

17
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,612
That would annoy other people a lot.

18
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,489
Sorry, Jae-won.

19
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,824
Some end up at a police box
after getting drunk.

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,873
I'm a mess. I have blackouts a lot.

21
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,709
I've been to the police station
and cried on the streets.

22
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,920
I've done everything.

23
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,089
I won't give you lame excuses.
I'll be honest.

24
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,384
By the way, Geon's friends are such liars.

25
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,385
Do you mean us?

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,554
I've heard stories from Geon.

27
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,892
I plead the Fifth.

28
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,978
They're a bunch of messed-up idiots.

29
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,523
Rin-i.

30
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,861
-Let's go home now.
-You're being a huge nuisance to us.

31
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,948
Don't say that.

32
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,910
-Look at her sleeping soundly.
-<i>Sleep tight</i>

33
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>-Baby
-Baby</i>

34
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,956
<i>-The birds are asleep</i>
<i>-The birds are asleep</i>

35
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,916
-What?
<i>-And so is the lamb</i>

36
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,961
-Stop. What are you doing?
-Thank you for your service. Salute.

37
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,964
Hello. You must be Rin-i's friend.

38
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,466
I'm her boyfriend.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,261
-Kyeong-jun, I smell a dog.
-<i>When Rin-i's drunk…</i>

40
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,512
<i>she sleeps in a doghouse.</i>

41
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,472
-Coming. Here he is.
-Coming. Here he is.

42
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,392
-Kyeong-jun is here.
-Here he is.

43
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,185
Kyeong-jun.

44
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,479
-Hello.
-Hello.

45
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,692
<i>Rin-i's boyfriend sleeps in the elevator
whenever he's drunk.</i>

46
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,236
-Bye, Kyeong-jun.
-Bye, Kyeong-jun.

47
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,281
And Geon. He doesn't remember a thing.

48
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,784
By the way,
do you know how he and I first met?

49
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,720
Geon is such a great singer.

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,024
He's such an awesome dancer. He's so cool.

51
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,027
Geon, you're so cool.

52
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,281
-Do you guys know him?
-I think he teaches second grade.

53
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,200
I've never seen him before.
Doesn't he teach first graders?

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,953
Do you know him, Ms. Oh?

55
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,248
It doesn't matter who he is.

56
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,042
We came here to sing.

57
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,974
And Eun-o. She gets on a bus
whenever she gets drunk.

58
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,144
She always goes to the last stop.
All four of them are messed up.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,147
Birds of a feather flock together.

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,024
It's been proven by science.

61
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,803
Hello? Hey, Eun-o.

62
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,762
Hey. Hello?

63
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,973
What's going on?

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,021
She sleeps when she's drunk.
Did I just interrupt that?

65
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,733
She's the most dangerous
when she wakes up after getting drunk.

66
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,831
This is killing me.
I can't sleep sober now.

67
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,343
Darn it. I forgot to charge my phone.

68
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,726
JERL
HOW CQULD YPU BE SO HARSN?

69
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,316
What is she saying?

70
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,072
Tonight,

71
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,075
someone will be in danger.

72
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,036
If you

73
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,373
got a call from Eun-o
or saw her on the street,

74
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,004
I advise you to get
as far away from her as possible.

75
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,049
CALLING

76
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,357
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello?

77
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,945
Who is this?

78
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,239
I got a bunch of weird texts from you.

79
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,493
This isn't my phone.
It belongs to some young woman.

80
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,662
But she's hammered.

81
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,206
She's at the last stop of my route.

82
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,001
I'm the last driver,
so there are no more buses for the night.

83
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,339
What? Yes.

84
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,884
Wake up, miss.

85
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,928
What's your name, miss?

86
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,596
It's Lee Eun-o.

87
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,390
Lee… What?

88
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,392
-Lee Eun-o.
-Eun-i?

89
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,269
Who? Lee Eun?

90
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,231
Hold on, sir.

91
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,359
One moment.

92
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,869
O3 MARKETING AGENCY
CEO: LEE EUN-O

93
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,830
Sir, where are you exactly?

94
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,832
Yes.

95
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,782
-Is that our account book?
-Yes. Good morning.

96
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,703
What's with the serious face?

97
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,080
I'll switch to a cheaper phone plan.

98
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,541
My phone plan is too expensive.

99
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,418
Hang on.

100
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,338
Let me check if there are cheaper plans.

101
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,883
There's one.

102
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,095
And I spent a lot more on food this month.

103
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,765
No wonder I felt so heavy!

104
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,185
Rin-i, what are you talking about?
You're not heavy at all.

105
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,895
I can lift you with my fingers.

106
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,899
Why are you so sweet this morning?

107
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,193
Was I? Then…

108
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,331
Or should I get another part-time job?

109
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,124
-Rin-i.
-Yes.

110
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,921
Why don't you get a proper job instead?

111
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,549
-But I'm working.
-It's a part-time job.

112
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,928
I think it would be better
if you got a permanent job.

113
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,139
No.

114
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,976
I don't want to be chained
to commuting every day.

115
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,937
And I don't want to get mixed up
with people at work.

116
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,647
I just like my life now.

117
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,610
Only having you, Eun-o, and Geon nearby

118
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,320
is enough for me.

119
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,905
Oh, right.

120
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,077
Geon will buy that nightstand
for 350,000 won.

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,954
No. I'm going to keep it here.

122
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,497
No. What about that one?

123
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,624
Sell it on the second-hand market.

124
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,335
No. I like the one you fixed for me
way more.

125
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,880
That's an old nightstand.
I just painted on it.

126
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,257
Why would you want it?

127
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,802
The imported nightstand is
more expensive, sturdier,

128
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,679
suits you better, and better-quality,

129
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,850
Hey. It's not about the price.
You painted that for me for hours.

130
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,851
No.

131
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,812
You win. I give up.

132
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,149
I won!

133
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,068
-You lost.
-Goodness.

134
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>Eun-o, are you up? I'm opening the door.</i>

135
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,751
Where is she?

136
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,598
<i>Where am I?</i>

137
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,060
Miss! Please wake up! Please!

138
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,689
I'm coming.

139
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,444
Thank you.

140
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,345
"Pushover"? Who is that?

141
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,349
-Hey, don't answer that.
-Hello?

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,438
Hello?

143
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,982
<i>Yes. Go ahead.
This is Lee Eun-o's cell phone.</i>

144
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,901
I see. Eun-o…

145
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,819
Wait. Who is this?

146
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,114
Eun-o is in a meeting now.

147
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,866
Okay.

148
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,118
Here.

149
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,333
-That was rude.
-I learned it from you.

150
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,090
She left after drinking last night.

151
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,927
She must have returned after I fell asleep

152
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,970
and left this morning.

153
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,973
So, she's in a meeting right now.

154
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,767
Right. Yes.

155
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,311
That's a relief.

156
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,030
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

157
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,766
-How did I end up here?
-How much do you remember?

158
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,646
-I was at the last stop--
-You were sitting on the bench.

159
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,649
I thought about leaving you there,
but it was too freezing.

160
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,776
I carried you to my car.

161
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,404
Then I carried you to my bed in my room.

162
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,199
You've gotten heavier than before.
Life must have been good to you.

163
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,743
My back almost broke.
Meanwhile, I lost 3kg.

164
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,831
Were you always this sarcastic?

165
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,832
What about you?

166
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,126
I don't know.

167
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,212
It's you who seems like
a total stranger to me.

168
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,470
Let's eat first.
I know you feel awkward, but…

169
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,140
Forget breakfast. We should talk.

170
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,017
We couldn't talk yesterday
because of my friends.

171
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,435
But I'm hungry.

172
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,187
What is it?

173
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,440
Seon-a loved this kind of breakfast.

174
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,066
Do you not?

175
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,611
-What do you like?
-You're still being sarcastic.

176
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,488
You have no right to say that.
Wouldn't you be sarcastic?

177
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,531
And…

178
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,870
what's this? Explain it to me first.

179
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,731
<i>Jerk.</i>

180
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,192
<i>How could you be so harsh?</i>

181
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,320
<i>Did you track me down
to tell me I'm a horrible woman?</i>

182
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,656
<i>I'll remove the heart in your name.</i>

183
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,407
<i>I changed your name on my phone.</i>

184
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,202
<i>No. I'll delete your number.</i>

185
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,622
I LPVRD YIU

186
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,873
<i>I loved you.</i>

187
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,335
<i>I miss you.</i>

188
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,712
I MOSS YIU

189
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,303
I guess you still remember
my phone number.

190
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,180
Or it's still saved on your phone.

191
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,807
What did you save me as?

192
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,268
If I had your number,

193
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,854
I would've saved you as Camera Thief.

194
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,524
Go ahead. It's not too late.

195
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,693
I won't. I doubt I'll contact you again.

196
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,237
I'll return the cameras. I said I would.

197
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,031
No, just keep them.
What's the point of having them back?

198
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,950
Why would I want to keep them?

199
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,995
Why did you print my photos?

200
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,082
You printed all of our photos. Why?

201
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,668
Did you miss me?

202
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,463
Yes, I did.

203
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,299
They're my souvenirs. So what?

204
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,677
You can do the same.

205
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,639
Fine. I'm sorry I couldn't let it go
and tried to find you.

206
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,310
You knew I tried to find you for a year.

207
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,148
You heard it from Rin-i and Kyeong-jun,
but you did nothing.

208
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,774
Why?

209
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,776
Was it fun to watch me suffer in pain?

210
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,194
I was

211
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,322
worried if you were in an accident
and hospitalized,

212
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,409
and if that was the reason
you couldn't call me.

213
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,746
I even e-mailed Ra-ra and Bin,
who had moved to South Africa.

214
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,956
I was in despair
when I didn't get a reply.

215
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,333
When I saw someone
who resembled you on the street,

216
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,710
I ran after them to check.

217
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,671
-Every day, like a mad--
-Why did you live like that?

218
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,591
I said I stole your cameras.

219
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,676
How could you not take the hint?

220
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,264
People have flings on trips.

221
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,894
But when they come back,
they forget about it and just move on.

222
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,028
So did you get over me?

223
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,741
Was it just a piece of memory?

224
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,542
Then why did you marry me?

225
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,755
Why did you marry me?

226
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,469
I said it was for fun.

227
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,805
-You agreed.
-No, not for me. I was serious.

228
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,847
And you were, too.

229
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,600
You were fully aware
that I was serious about you, right?

230
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,811
So what?

231
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,355
Did we register our marriage or what?

232
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,817
-We didn't.
-How could you be so brazen? How?

233
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,653
You weren't like this in Yangyang.

234
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,863
-Seon-a, you--
-Yes.

235
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,282
Yoon Seon-a.

236
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,703
Seon-a wasn't clumsy or brazen.
I bet she was great because…

237
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,499
Because she's not me.

238
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm Lee Eun-o.

239
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,131
The person you loved is Seon-a.

240
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,845
She's an identity I made up,
so she's not me.

241
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,683
You loved the fake version of me.

242
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,104
You probably loved her from head to toe.

243
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,358
But I'm not her.

244
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,737
You know nothing about me.

245
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,658
About my feelings, personality,
thoughts, or preferences.

246
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,953
You know nothing.

247
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,293
I'm so sorry I'm not…

248
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,962
Yoon Seon-a.

249
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,133
Damn it.

250
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,518
Get in. I'll drop you off.

251
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,063
Just lend me your umbrella.

252
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,693
Would you do that for someone you hate?

253
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,863
Get in. The bus stop is far away.

254
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,823
Here. Come on.

255
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,123
I don't drive when it rains.

256
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,667
It's dangerous.

257
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,923
Hey.

258
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,051
Gosh. Eun-o has quite a temper.

259
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,971
Seon-a had a temper too,
but she was so cute.

260
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,809
I said I'm sorry I'm not Seon-a.

261
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,977
If you're sorry, don't get mad at me.

262
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,605
You don't have the right
to get angry with me.

263
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,497
Do you want some music?

264
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,183
Don't touch it. It's my car.

265
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,770
Are you always this cranky?

266
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,313
Yes.

267
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,399
I'm always cranky.

268
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,944
But I turn gentle when I fall in love.

269
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,156
What are you like when you're in love?

270
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,089
<i>Jae-won is silly.</i>

271
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,593
<i>That's why I liked him.</i>

272
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,388
Aren't you hungry?

273
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
Are you hungover?

274
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,729
<i>This is weird.</i>

275
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,106
<i>I just can't hate her.</i>

276
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>I want to hate her, but I can't.</i>

277
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,607
Sir, there's a meeting
with the Materials Management Team

278
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,317
for the bathroom in Sinsa-dong.

279
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,362
But our team leader hasn't come in yet.

280
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,030
Okay, shall I delay the meeting?

281
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,412
Give me the list of the materials.
I'll take a look first.

282
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,372
Okay.

283
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,589
<i>Guys, it's raining.</i>

284
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,591
Ramyeon <i>is the best on rainy days.</i>

285
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,220
<i>-Is your meeting over, Eun-o?
-Yes. It's over.</i>

286
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,239
Get home safe.

287
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,873
Eun-o, where were you…

288
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,169
Hello.

289
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,016
Rin-i's here.

290
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,941
What's going on?
Why are you two here together?

291
