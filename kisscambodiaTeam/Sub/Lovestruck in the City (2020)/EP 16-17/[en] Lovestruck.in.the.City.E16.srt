#GIRLCRUSH

#VOLUNTARILY SINGLE

00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,725
#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,830
WHAT'S YOUR IDEAL TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP?

9
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,791
-Hey, you can go first.
-No, you first.

10
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,713
First, I should meet someone who likes me.

11
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,133
What do you mean?
You should meet someone you like.

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,259
-What?
-What?

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,679
-You should like each other!
-You should like each other!

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,810
When you're still young,
you don't know how miraculous it is

15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,148
to start a relationship
with someone who likes you back.

16
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,569
I bet it's only possible
when the whole universe helps you out.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,073
After some time, you keep forgetting.

18
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,366
That we were able to meet
because the universe helped us.

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,243
I have no expectations now

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,121
since I always see couples
coming to the police after a fight.

21
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,089
They're asking you
about your ideal type of relationship.

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,301
-To be honest, I've never dated before.
-What?

23
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,220
Really?

24
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,347
With that handsome face of yours?

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,059
Anyway, I should find a date soon.

26
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,769
Someone will come to me one day

27
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,021
like a gift without me having to try
to find her.

28
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,231
Spontaneously.

29
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,316
He's only saying that
because he's handsome.

30
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,444
Do you really think you'll meet someone
without even trying?

31
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,867
-Are you talking to me?
-No, it's for the interview.

32
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,204
-We can speak casually in the interview.
-Excuse us.

33
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,917
What's up? We'll be late. Hurry.

34
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,712
Being considerate and trying your best
also counts, in my opinion.

35
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,673
Romance isn't just about excitement.

36
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,008
Did you see that?

37
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,344
My Kyeong-jun is an expert.

38
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,471
I always gave my all when I dated.

39
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,099
But now, it's too boring.

40
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,816
I still think
it's the most important thing in life.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,985
You feel lonely on your own.

42
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,113
How reassuring would it be

43
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,157
to have someone on your side
in this big world?

44
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,621
When I broke up with Seon-yeong,
I told her this.

45
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,374
"Come to me whenever you miss your mom."

46
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,712
But now, I want to tell her this.

47
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,422
"Wander around

48
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,632
and do everything you want to do.

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,384
When you're done,

50
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,470
let's date one more time."

51
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,266
<i>She doesn't know what that means.</i>

52
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,851
She won't.

53
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,979
Just like how she didn't know back then.

54
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,241
The construction got delayed
because I had to move the stairs.

55
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,119
Honestly, we were worried about the delay.

56
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,622
But this looks much better than before.

57
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,335
I thought they would make a big fuss.

58
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,753
But you pulled it off.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,213
I'm proud. Good job, Jae-won.

60
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,215
They even gave us a box of tangerines.

61
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,928
Hey, what did you take me for? Goodness.

62
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,305
It's over, right?

63
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,434
-Don't act out of your mind again.
-Okay. I won't.

64
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,645
Hey, give me the car keys.
I'll open the trunk.

65
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,355
We don't need keys in this era.

66
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,440
Aim for the middle and use your foot.

67
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,943
What's this? How's this possible?

68
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,236
Haven't you tried this?

69
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,946
Does my car also have this function?

70
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,489
Of course, you idiot.

71
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,201
SInce we're here,
let's check the townhouses in Gapyeong.

72
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,245
We can't. We have a meeting with Eun-o.

73
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,579
What time?

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,167
Hey, you should've told me in advance
if we had a meeting at 2 p.m.

75
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,962
You're the one who wasted our time
by coming here

76
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,339
when they had offered to visit us instead.

77
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,299
And she can wait.

78
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,968
-She's my friend, anyway.
-Hey, Kyeong-jun.

79
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,763
I'll give you advice as someone
with more experience in life and work.

80
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,932
What you're doing is an abuse of power.

81
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,558
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,227
You're making her wait!

83
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,187
-That's a power trip!
-Okay, be quiet!

84
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
I'm speeding up. Hold tight.

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,991
I came too early.
They will think I'm desperate.

86
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,285
I'm the one getting paid
so I should be on time.

87
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,203
Be bold. Be confident.

88
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,625
-I'm no longer the stupid old…
<i>-Eun-o.</i>

89
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,462
The old Eun-o wasn't stupid.

90
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,341
I was never stupid.

91
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:05,138
The old you. The new you.
Both of them are Eun-o.

92
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,098
They're all Eun-o.

93
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,517
She's right.

94
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,437
Old or new, I'm still Lee Eun-o.

95
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,149
I may make a mistake today
or botch the party tomorrow.

96
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,900
But it's okay.

97
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,861
I can do it.

98
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:34,584
In conclusion, the entire event
will end around 7 p.m.

99
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,545
Here are the details. Have a look.

100
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,675
Our workers gave

101
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,304
a generous score for your idea
of "a walk around the neighborhood."

102
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,640
I know. We said something similar
when we built this.

103
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,351
-"A place to age beautifully."
-You're right.

104
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,063
The thing that came to my mind
when I built it

105
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,272
was a zelkova tree.

106
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,274
You know how in rural areas,

107
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,486
there's always this one area
where neighbors gather to relax.

108
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,742
Right. It's like a zelkova tree

109
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,661
that's always there
no matter when you visit.

110
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,830
"It would be nice if there's a building

111
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,208
I can go to when I go for a walk."

112
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,126
That's how I came up with this project.

113
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,882
I heard that's why the main event
will be like a casual talk show.

114
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,593
But will he and I do a good job?

115
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,222
You'll give an honest talk
about how you built that place.

116
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,101
The catering service and the performance
will be casual rather than fancy.

117
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,271
Is that why we'll have a campfire
and bake sweet potatoes?

118
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,357
This is unique.

119
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,442
It's interesting. I like it.

120
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,737
Mr. Park, one minute.

121
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,739
Coming. Keep discussing.

122
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,658
-Okay.
-Oh, right, Kyeong-jun.

123
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,160
Check if we're allowed
to make a campfire there.

124
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,078
They might say no.

125
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,496
-Okay.
-Thanks.

126
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,625
Carry it out as planned.
Just send us the detailed budget.

127
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,751
Eun-o.

128
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,463
-What do you think?
-About what?

129
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,633
You kept staring at him.

130
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,263
-Is he good-looking?
-What are you talking about?

131
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,057
Okay, what should we do?

132
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,102
Let's see. Call the city hall.

133
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,187
Ask if they can lower the water pressure.

134
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,357
If they can't, we'll have to install
a reducing valve.

135
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,317
Mr. Park. One minute.

136
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,361
-What is it?
-We're going to step out.

137
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,530
-Where to?
-To have pizza at Rin-i's.

138
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,448
Sure.

139
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,783
-See you.
-Let's go.

140
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,045
Look at the balcony.
We should do something about it.

141
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,471
Ta-da!

142
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,391
-No way.
-No way.

143
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,185
You really made this yourself?

144
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,479
Its taste is even more phenomenal. Dig in.

145
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,612
How is it?

146
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,240
How much is the prize
for this recipe contest?

147
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,700
-Five million won.
-It's yours.

148
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll bet double the amount.

149
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,748
You guys planned this, right?
Why are you being so nice?

150
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,501
No. Objectively speaking,
it's really delicious.

151
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,294
The decoration is perfect.

152
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,338
You have a great sense of aesthetics.

153
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,590
So what's the name of this pizza?

154
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,842
I need to think about that.

155
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,345
Oh, don't be worried.
You have a marketer here.

156
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,555
And a writer.
Should I do some brainstorming?

157
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,517
Hey, hold on.
Something's coming to mind right now.

158
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,477
Wait.

159
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,522
Wait. Will we get something
in return for naming this?

160
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,106
You bet.

161
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,567
I'll treat you to a really nice meal
if I win.

162
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,696
You should invite Jae-won too.

163
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,866
Hey, Eun-o. While you're working with him,

164
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,077
why don't you make a move on him?

165
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,455
You guys were eyeing each other
back there.

166
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,124
What was that for?

167
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,757
Is this product placement? Do I have to?

168
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,425
I'll try my best.

169
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,593
Product placement.

170
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,972
Here. "Squeeze it and mix it with water"?

171
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,765
How convenient.

172
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,811
All right. Just squeeze it like this.

173
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,648
Why do you think he gave me this necklace?

174
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,526
I mean… What does this mean?

175
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,986
I'm not sure.

176
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,780
What could it mean?

177
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,160
Wow, it tastes so fresh.

178
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,870
There wasn't even a letter.

179
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,456
<i>Why in the world</i>

180
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,251
<i>was this in my suitcase?</i>

181
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,379
Maybe he left it there by accident.

182
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,755
If that's the case,

183
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,717
she should have given it
back to me earlier. Don't you agree?

184
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,554
-Is this even for me?
<i>-Yes, it's hers.</i>

185
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,889
I bought it
as soon as I came back to Seoul

186
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,309
to give it to Seon-a at Cheonggyecheon.

187
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,893
I never got to meet her,

188
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,397
but I still kept it.

189
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,107
I just couldn't throw it away.

190
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,276
I'm usually very nonchalant, but…

191
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,694
Gosh.

192
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,321
It bothers me so much.

193
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,158
What's bothering her?
Isn't she too busy finding herself?

194
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,410
To be honest,

195
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,624
that thing about her finding herself…

196
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,626
Gosh.

197
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,670
I should give it back
when I see him next time.

198
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,090
How can I possibly persuade her?

199
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,216
I just…

200
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,677
I did everything I could.

201
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,597
<i>There wasn't even a single note,</i>

202
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,641
so I have no clue what it means.

203
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,975
Does it matter what I mean?

204
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,062
If I didn't leave a note,
isn't it up to her to interpret it?

205
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,438
Should I call him?

206
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,192
No. I won't pick up her calls. Never.

207
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,829
Look at this. Gosh.

208
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,872
PRETTY IDIOT

209
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,334
No. I'm not answering.

210
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,337
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.</i>

211
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,838
<i>-Please call…</i>
-What's this?

212
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,389
What should I do?

213
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,100
Isn't it obvious?
She should follow her heart.

214
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,518
Why is she even asking?

215
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,153
What is this?

216
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,159
Kyeong-jun is incredible.

217
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,997
That building is his work.
Isn't he amazing?

218
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,750
It is indeed amazing.

219
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:55,005
My friend built this building
and is hosting the housewarming party.

220
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,549
They'll even have a book cafe.

221
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,469
Won't it be perfect
if you sell your new novel there?

222
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,723
What about you? You should join too.

223
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,641
Me?

224
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,810
I'll be a regular customer.

225
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,979
That's wonderful. Let's go.

226
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,982
Wait. Will they hire part-timers?

227
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,609
It'd be awesome if I could work here.

228
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,446
How will you manage four part-time jobs?

229
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,989
Why not?

230
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,034
-Eun-o, your walkie-takie.
-Oh, thank you.

231
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,370
Could you relocate the photo zone outside?

232
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,998
The harmony between the building
and nature is important,

233
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,875
so you need to capture it in one frame.

234
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,792
-Okay.
-Thanks.

235
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,336
-Can you first check the videos upstairs?
-Sure.

236
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,379
Eun-o.

237
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,139
I'm going to check
the experience zone upstairs.

238
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,642
-Pick up your walkie-talkie later.
-Okay.

239
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,192
She looks like a professional.

240
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,410
<i>You had such a radiant smile</i>

241
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>Like in that photo that I stared at
Countless times</i>

242
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,504
<i>What should I do with my heart?</i>

243
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,300
<i>What should I do with my love?</i>

244
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,386
<i>Your night</i>

245
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,764
<i>Your star</i>

246
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:32,436
<i>Every moment I spent
Loving you was beautiful</i>

247
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,271
Hey, you look great today.

248
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,650
I'm a bit busy right now,
so I'll see you later.

249
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,609
Okay.

250
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,907
What are you looking at?

251
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,706
Oh, and check the food and beverage stock
on the ground floor later.

252
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,832
Sure.

253
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,668
-Anything to report?
-No.

254
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,296
The acoustic band is performing
on time as planned.

255
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,383
The separate events are going well
as planned.

256
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,345
However, I think this room
has too many people.

257
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,140
In that case,
let's split them into two groups.

258
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,141
Okay.

259
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,478
This is the monitoring room.

260
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:19,817
Please split the people
in Gallery Two into two groups.

261
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,694
Thank you.

262
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,293
Thank you for making time
despite your busy schedule.

263
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,544
My pleasure.

264
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,755
-Jae-won.
-Hello.

265
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,635
Sir, this is my son.

266
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,805
-Hello, I'm Park Jae-won.
-Goodness.

267
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,516
No wonder you brag about your son.

268
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,270
This is a wonderful place.
Congratulations.

269
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,313
Thank you.

270
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
-All right, then.
-Sure.

271
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,816
-All right.
-Goodbye.

272
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,360
-Goodbye.
-Dad.

273
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,070
I'm busy, so I should go.

274
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,363
-All right. See you.
-Okay.

275
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,532
Uncle.

276
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,368
This is my girlfriend.

277
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,455
-Hello, I'm Suh Rin-i.
-Nice to meet you.

278
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,418
Didn't we say hi a few times
in front of my company?

279
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,295
Yes, we've met a couple of times.

280
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,172
I wanted to formally introduce her.

281
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,883
I've heard a lot about you.
Maybe a bit too much.

282
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,970
Every time he talks about you,
his eyes glisten like crazy.

283
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,805
Oh, really?

284
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,600
I always look at you like this.

285
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,646
You two are still a loving couple
after all those years.

286
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,148
-It's nice to see.
-Thank you.

287
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,777
By the way, what do you do?

288
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
-Oh, I--
-Right.

289
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,114
You're preparing for graduate school.

290
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,661
Kyeong-jun has told me before,
but I keep forgetting.

291
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:55,955
Professor Park.

292
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,959
It was nice meeting you.
See you next time.

293
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,585
Sure.

294
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,761
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes, sir?

295
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,056
Let's talk later.

296
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,103
TALK ABOUT SPACE

297
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,604
Okay.

298
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,399
We faced countless crises.

299
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,985
But we were able to overcome them

300
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,820
thanks to

301
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,074
the tenacity of this man
who pestered everyone he worked with.

302
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,202
The tenacity of Team Leader Park Jae-won.

303
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,038
I refuse to acknowledge
anything else about him,

304
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,000
but his tenacity is
the one thing I acknowledge.

305
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,838
Hello, I'm Park Jae-won,
the man who pesters his co-workers.

306
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,964
Nice to meet you all.

307
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,591
Compared to the person I love the most

308
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,386
and respect the second most,
our president,

309
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,016
and my countless seniors,
I lack experience and wisdom.

310
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,642
That's why I have no choice

311
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,352
but to be tenacious.

312
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,689
I believe in the phrase, "Sincerity wins."

313
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,984
This could be applied to both construction

314
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,654
and building relationships with people.

315
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,572
Therefore,

316
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,950
I don't want to disappoint those
who have put their trust in me.

317
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,286
I'll hold you whenever you fall.

318
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,872
So don't worry, and focus on the waves.

319
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,290
I'll focus on you.

320
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,130
<i>Eun-o, please come to the monitoring room.</i>

321
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,715
Okay. I'm on my way.

322
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,343
Thank you!

323
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,483
-Good work.
-Thanks, Dad. Good night.

324
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,318
-Wrap up well.
-Yes, Uncle.

325
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,279
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

326
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,955
Good work. Go home now.

327
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,792
-What about you?
-I'll stay here and watch them wrap up.

328
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,211
The field team will take care of that.

329
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,214
Right. Can you drop Eun-o off?

330
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,674
I drove her here,
so she needs a ride home.

331
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,134
Sure. Don't worry.

332
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,511
-Bye.
-Bye.

333
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,181
-Good work, Kyeong-jun.
-You too.

334
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,565
Excuse me. Do you know where Ms. Lee is?

335
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,401
-I saw her going outside.
-Okay. Thanks.

336
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,871
Who is it?

337
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,751
I think I drank too much wine.

338
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,422
Why is it so cold in here?
Hey, turn on the heater.

339
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,341
Oh, it's already on.

340
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,385
Why am I so cold?

341
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,347
Are you guys listening to me?

342
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,811
So it's because of the mood
between you two.

343
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,814
The mood is as cold as Siberia here.

344
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,649
Did you two fight?

345
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,413
Damn it.

346
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,424
<i>Can we talk?</i>

347
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,511
Thanks for dropping me off. Bye.

348
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,888
-Bye.
-Bye.

349
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,023
It seems serious.

350
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,958
What did he mean back there?

351
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,924
Did you tell Jae-won's father
that I was preparing for graduate school?

352
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,553
That's what I told him

353
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,639
when he asked me about you.

354
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,060
Why did you say that?

355
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,269
It's not true.

356
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,813
Rin-i.

357
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:37,653
To be honest, when people ask me
what my girlfriend does for a living,

358
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,324
I don't know how I should answer.

359
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,203
Just tell them I work part-time.

360
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,412
What's wrong with that?

361
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,541
I don't want to tell them that.

362
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,337
They'll keep asking about you.

363
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,507
"Why does she still work part-time?

364
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,550
What was her major?

365
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,469
Did she even go to college?"

366
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,346
You hear that all the time.

367
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,515
Aren't you fed up as well?

368
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,226
It's annoying to explain.

369
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,020
But so what? That's how I live.

370
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,648
But I hate doing that.

371
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,150
That's why I lied.

372
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,697
I don't want to explain to those
who don't even know you.

373
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,574
And…

374
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,079
I don't like
your current lifestyle, either.

375
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,874
What do you mean?

376
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,335
I think you should go to graduate school

377
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,045
or look for a permanent job.

378
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,590
I'd like you to have a decent job.

379
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,138
Why?

380
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,848
Why should I do that?

381
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,392
-Rin-i.
-Kyeong-jun.

382
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,186
It seems like you know nothing about me.

383
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,273
Forget about other people.

384
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,483
You're the one
who knows the least about me.

385
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,946
I want to live on what I really need
instead of having many things.

386
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,159
I don't need to have something
just because everyone has one.

387
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,828
And that kind of lifestyle
doesn't suit me.

388
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,498
So I don't want to stay at one job
for many years.

389
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,543
I'm making less money,
but I prefer having more free time.

390
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,670
And I may not have a proper job,

391
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,839
but I enjoy living a minimal lifestyle.

392
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,466
Don't you know what I mean?

393
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,301
I know. I'm just worried.

394
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,596
Why would you be? I'm okay, Kyeong-jun.

395
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,432
I'm as hardworking as anyone else,

396
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,309
and I love my current self.

397
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,937
I don't understand
why you're so worried about me.

398
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,064
So you're fine?

399
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,316
-Yes, I'm--
-You got fired out of the blue.

400
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,776
How are you okay with that?

401
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,612
Then you hastily find
another part-time job to make ends meet.

402
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,822
You never know
when you'll get fired again.

403
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,908
Yet you're fine? How so?

404
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,202
I don't feel fine at all
watching you like this.

405
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:55,123
It still makes my blood boil
to know that you were treated that way.

406
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,252
Rin-i. I'm not asking you
to get a well-paying job.

407
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,962
I can make the money.

408
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,799
I just hate that people look down on you

409
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,425
and treat you badly.

410
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,262
Besides, you can't work part-time forever.

411
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,599
Do you think you can manage
multiple part-time jobs

412
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,351
when you're over 40?

413
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,268
Rin-i.

414
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,105
You can't keep living like this.

415
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,318
Okay, Kyeong-jun.

416
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,321
I understand how you feel.

417
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,157
But one thing.

418
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:35,455
You might think
my lifestyle has no vision,

419
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,958
but I'm devoted to this.

420
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,044
This is how I live. This is my life.

421
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,508
I'm working hard
and doing my utmost to be happy.

422
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:50,137
I'm not saying you're not hardworking.
But the world--

423
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,974
What the world thinks of me
doesn't matter!

424
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,946
What breaks my heart is

425
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,200
that's what you've been thinking
about me all this time.

426
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,581
You took me for a reckless child
who couldn't take care of herself.

427
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,292
That's what you've been thinking about me.

428
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,543
That's not true.

429
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,380
I thought you'd understand me.

430
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,009
I thought you respected and supported me

431
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,095
because you're Kyeong-jun,
not just anybody.

432
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,182
But if that's not the case…

433
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,144
If that's not true,

434
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,023
why should we keep seeing each other?

435
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,065
Hey.

436
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,984
Stop there.

437
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,278
-That's enough.
-Let's break up.

438
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,654
Rin-i.

439
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,783
Let's break up.

440
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,953
You deny me.

441
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,164
You deny my entire life.

442
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,417
-I told you that's not it!
-You lied to your uncle!

443
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,968
You don't know why I left my mom
in the UK and came here, do you?

444
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,766
It's true I came because I was worried
about Eun-o after she disappeared.

445
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,561
But also because

446
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,025
I wasn't happy at all there
because of my mom.

447
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,905
She lied to everyone about me as well.

448
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,699
She told them…

449
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,080
that I was her niece, not her daughter.

450
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,999
She kept denying me.

451
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,881
I want to break up.

452
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,925
Don't you ever contact me again.

453
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,548
I…

454
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,302
still don't know

455
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,138
what kind of person I am.

456
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,933
I'm not the Yoon Seon-a you know of.

457
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,149
Once you find out who I really am,
you may regret it.

458
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,404
I'm still a coward. I'm clumsy.

459
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,033
I'm a mess.

460
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,829
Yes. You're right.

461
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,708
You still don't know who you are.

462
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,002
And you're timid.

463
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,382
I am.

464
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,259
But

465
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,554
I'm not going to pretend
I'm tough anymore.

466
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,309
I'm scared and nervous right now.

467
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,729
But

468
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,026
I'll try to tell you how I truly feel.

469
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,367
I'm still a mess.

470
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,662
I'm not the Yoon Seon-a you knew of.

471
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,915
And I'm still not
the best version of Lee Eun-o.

472
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,003
There are countless things
that I still need to fix.

473
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,469
Are you still

474
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,889
okay with that?

475
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,770
To be honest,

476
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,650
I thought about sending her
a letter with the necklace.

477
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,530
But I thought it'd be better for her
to interpret the gift herself.

478
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,700
What I'm trying to say is…

479
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,791
Eun-o, there's something
I didn't tell you.

480
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,004
The old Eun-o who was kind and calm,

481
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,298
Seon-a whom I fell in love with,

482
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,759
and the current Eun-o
who showed up in front of me…

483
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,972
They're all you. They're all Lee Eun-o.

484
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,558
The woman I loved

485
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,269
is still inside you.

486
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,979
Are you still

487
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,065
okay with that?

488
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,905
<i>"As you slowly discover yourself,</i>

489
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,700
<i>I'll slowly learn
about the current you as well.</i>

490
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,579
I'll try my best to love you properly."

491
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,915
<i>That's what it meant.</i>

492
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,168
<i>I hope she figures that out.</i>

493
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,673
As for those things you want to fix…

494
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,052
Instead of removing them,

495
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,555
how about we get to know them together?

496
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,144
First…

497
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,898
First…

498
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,067
Dating.

499
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,446
Let's find out what that means first.

500
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,365
Okay?

501
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,503
Why am I nervous?
This isn't even our first kiss.

502
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,755
Me too.

503
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,926
My heart's about to burst
as if it was our first kiss.

504
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,880
<i>What do you think romance is?</i>

505
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,760
A journey to finding my true self.

506
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,179
I've finally learned how it feels

507
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,056
to truly love someone.

508
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,350
It was very miserable and painful.

509
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,353
That's why it's more precious
and more cherishable.

510
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,938
It's too difficult for me.

511
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,981
Two people meeting,

512
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,233
and showing each other
their deepest feelings

513
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,985
and their worst moments,

514
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,112
then striving to become one.

515
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,156
-Isn't that it?
-It's fascinating.

516
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,744
I hated my stupid self,
so I kept running and hiding.

517
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,163
But I'm no longer scared.

518
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:41,292
I'm still a complete mess,
but if he's by my side,

519
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,837
I want to be braver
and take the bull by the horns.

520
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,089
It's unfair.

521
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,633
I admit I was wrong,

522
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,927
but I don't want to end it like this.

523
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,222
I think
there are no special relationships.

524
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,767
They can come to an end at any moment.

525
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:02,230
My grandpa's final letter
is like a bridge between Rin-i and me.

526
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,234
It's this one.

527
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,611
I'll tell you about it next time.

528
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,699
Anyway, because of this letter,

529
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,701
our breakup is

530
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,497
a little difficult to accept.

531
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,374
If there's a reason to break up,

532
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,585
then I think I should.

533
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,963
A relationship is like a war.

534
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,967
It's easy to start,
but it's never easy to end.

535
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,095
For now, my relationship is
like a ceasefire.

536
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,930
It's not over yet.

537
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,433
Seon-yeong, don't you give up.

538
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,102
End the ceasefire and keep searching.

539
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,645
Once you're exhausted,

540
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,523
come and ask me again,

541
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,816
"You like Eun-o, right?"

542
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,486
With that excuse,

543
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,740
we can see each other again.

544
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,118
We're officially a couple starting today.

545
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,245
What should we do?

546
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,415
-First…
-Yes.

547
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,168
Call me by my name.

548
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,086
Your name? Ms. Lee Eun-o.

549
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,088
Eun-o.

550
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,591
Eun-o.

551
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,051
Lee Eun-o!

552
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,135
-Quiet!
-Eun-o!

553
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,095
Okay, I'll stop.

554
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,311
-Eun-o.
-What?

555
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,104
Let's go.

556
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,691
It's snowing.

557
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,027
Wow, it's snowing.

558
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,906
-Does Eun-o like snow?
-Yes, just as much as rain.

559
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,034
What else does she like?

560
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,579
-Sunny days.
-Okay.

561
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,539
-Hot lattes.
-Okay.

562
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,708
-Cats' paws.
-I see.

563
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,669
-Taking a walk with someone.
-Okay.

564
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,214
The aroma of lilacs.

565
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,674
-And…
-And?

566
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,471
And

567
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,014
Park Jae-won.

568
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,533
What?

569
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,243
How can Yoon Seon-a be Eun-o?

570
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,455
So Yoon Seon-a is
actually my friend, Eun-o?

571
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,834
Hey. Damn it. That's nonsense.
How's that possible?

572
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,879
Are you kidding me?
I would have known if that was true.

573
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,340
Everyone else knows but me?
Who else knows?

574
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,383
Wait.

575
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,053
Hold on. Let me make a call.

576
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,937
Geon isn't picking up.

577
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,356
Hold on, let me call Rin-i.

578
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,858
Wait.

579
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,863
Right, I shouldn't call her.

580
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,952
She picked up. Be quiet.

581
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,917
Hello?

582
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,960
<i>Hello?</i>

583
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,594
I hear a man's voice.

584
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,061
-Is this Rin-i's number?
<i>-Yes, it is.</i>

585
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,065
Who are you?

586
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,859
Where's Rin-i?

587
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,789
