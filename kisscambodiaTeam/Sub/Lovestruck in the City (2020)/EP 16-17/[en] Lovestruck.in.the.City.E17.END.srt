00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,627
This coffee is…

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,755
Smooth.

10
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,758
-The best coffee is…
-Cold-brewed?

11
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,802
You're good.

12
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,932
It's about this big.
What should we call it?

13
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,936
<i>What comes to your mind
when you hear the word, "first"?</i>

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,815
-"First"?
-"First"?

15
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,531
Why are you looking at me?
What are you thinking?

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,492
Nothing. It's nothing.

17
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,910
WOMEN-ONLY DRY SAUNA

18
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,036
"First"?

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,082
The word reminds me of…

20
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,460
My first love.

21
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,922
When I was in high school,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,884
I ran into my elementary school partner

23
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,220
who transferred to another school.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,306
He was my first love.

25
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,936
Now, I broke up with him.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,313
She broke up with me so easily.

27
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,940
We dated for five years,

28
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,859
but it only took a moment to break up.

29
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,821
Fine. It was my fault.

30
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,281
But if we broke up
for every mistake we made…

31
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,617
You think you never messed up?

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,579
I had no idea what happened
with your mom in the UK.

33
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,623
You never told me. How could I have known?

34
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,750
<i>How was I supposed to know?</i>

35
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,752
<i>Do you think I can read your mind?</i>

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,797
If you told me,
I wouldn't have said what I said.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,798
Damn it.

38
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,219
Fine, get out.

39
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,804
You too. Everyone, get out.

40
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,597
I've dated a lot of men.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,935
But my first love was…

42
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,023
I don't think I had my first love yet.

43
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,400
How is this possible?

44
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,529
Do you think this is normal?

45
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,657
When I hear the word, "first," I think of…

46
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,995
my first kiss.

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,081
I heard it all.

48
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,708
You did?

49
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,962
The word reminds you of your first kiss.

50
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,339
Yes, my first kiss. What about you?

51
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,301
Who was the lucky girl?

52
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,386
No idea. I don't remember.

53
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,848
Seriously. I don't even remember her name.

54
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,310
Then, you must remember her face.

55
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,812
I don't remember her face either.
Wait, I do now.

56
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,105
You were my first kiss.

57
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,860
I first met her in kindergarten.

58
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,363
And when we were in third grade, boom!

59
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,991
She suddenly looked so pretty.

60
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,911
I lost my umbrella that day.

61
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,871
She walked me all the way home.

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,374
I still remember the path we walked
under her umbrella.

63
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,962
The rain, the smell, and the atmosphere.

64
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,760
What did she say?

65
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,305
My first love was…

66
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,349
She's talking about it now.

67
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,100
-Kang Geon.
-Hey!

68
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,435
In middle school.

69
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,812
He was wearing his school uniform.

70
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,440
All of a sudden,
he looked a little handsome.

71
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,859
Hey. What did you say?

72
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,862
-Nothing.
-What did you say?

73
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,364
-Nothing.
-You said, "a little" something.

74
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,449
She talked about her first love, right?
Who was it?

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,245
It could be Rin-i

76
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,288
or Eun-o.

77
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,791
Or was it someone else?

78
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,294
Seon-yeong, are you watching this?

79
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,505
I bet you're livid now.

80
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,632
I bet you want to punch me now.

81
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,718
Geon, meet a nice woman.

82
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,220
Not someone like me,

83
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,014
but someone gentle and kindhearted.

84
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,645
I think of Hae-na.

85
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,647
She could be anyone's first love.

86
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:33,982
Right?

87
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,318
By the way, Dong-sik,

88
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,612
do you really have no dating experience?

89
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,822
No first love?

90
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,491
You may not have dated,
but you must have had a crush.

91
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,994
I don't think so. Not yet.

92
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,121
Why are you just wasting your good looks?

93
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,706
I don't get you.

94
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,500
Yes. I'm almost there.

95
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,378
I'll call you again
once I'm in the parking lot.

96
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>The second floor? Okay. Thank you.</i>

97
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,400
Next scene!

98
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,277
Set up the next scene.

99
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,112
Excuse me. How can I get…

100
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,574
Excuse me.
How can I go to the second floor?

101
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,745
-Why are you so nervous?
-Sorry?

102
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,455
Is this your first kissing scene?

103
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,832
Even if this is your first kissing scene,

104
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,667
I'm sure you've kissed before.

105
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,009
What? You've never kissed anyone?

106
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,680
Really?

107
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,560
I see.

108
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,856
Then, I'll be your first kiss today.

109
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,025
What an honor.

110
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,028
Excuse me.

111
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,824
-Don't you like me?
-No.

112
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,494
What?

113
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,290
-What did I say?
-That you don't like me.

114
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,088
It's just that…

115
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,634
I have a lot on my mind lately.

116
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,722
I feel weird.

117
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,642
I think I'm kind of burnt out.

118
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,477
I'm sure you went through this, too.

119
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,108
Right. I did. "Burnt out."

120
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,195
But you're too young to be burnt out.

121
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,196
Pardon?

122
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,157
When I was your age,
I didn't have time to process my feelings.

123
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,951
I was just crazy about my work.

124
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,285
You have to be.

125
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,331
I think you're amazing.

126
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,250
No.

127
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,003
Thank you for your advice.
I'll get going now.

128
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,506
Wait.

129
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,384
If you haven't had your first kiss,

130
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,886
you probably
haven't slept with anyone yet.

131
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,017
I guess you're new to everything,
not just acting.

132
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,980
I'll just tell you the basic things.
Have a seat.

133
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:23,025
My goodness, Hae-na. Hello.

134
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,404
I'm here to meet Director Yoon
about the cultural heritage project,

135
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,073
but I don't know
how to get to the second floor.

136
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
-It's that way.
-That way?

137
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,871
How come I didn't see that?

138
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,706
Thank you. See you later, then.

139
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,418
Bye.

140
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,180
-Anyway--
-Get ready for the next scene.

141
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,724
Okay. I was giving her acting advice.

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,561
Next scene.

143
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,232
Anyway, I'm saying this for your good.

144
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,110
I need to know the degree
for me to adjust the level.

145
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,279
You understand that, right?

146
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,740
Don't worry. I'm good at this.

147
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,619
I'll give you a great first kiss.

148
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,787
Just trust me.

149
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,457
Take it easy, okay?

150
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,374
Relax.

151
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,213
It's a video campaign to promote
the Korean cultural heritage.

152
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,006
I marked Hae-na's parts separately.

153
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
I see.

154
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,802
She'll be working with these stars?

155
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,889
Yes. It will feature
practically every Korean world star.

156
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,308
Hae-na will be filming at Deoksugung.

157
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,686
Please check the theme photos
and the script one more time.

158
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,729
Okay.

159
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,566
-Hello?
-Everyone is on it.

160
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,110
What? Hae-na disappeared?

161
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,404
One moment, please.

162
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,365
Hey.

163
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,535
I'll call you after I review it.
She has to film her next scene now.

164
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,453
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

165
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,916
What's happening right now?

166
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,417
You don't know where she went?

167
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,462
-Is she out of her mind?
-We're looking for her now.

168
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,713
Call her now.

169
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,757
-Outside.
-Is she out of her mind?

170
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,008
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,052
Where did she go?

172
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,513
-Mr. Cha.
-I don't believe this.

173
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,847
Mr. Cha?

174
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,433
What will you do?

175
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,227
-What will you do now?
-I'm so sorry.

176
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,189
-Call her now.
-Okay.

177
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,484
-I'll call her outside.
-Hurry.

178
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,622
-Hae-na.
-Just drive now.

179
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,040
What? But…

180
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,334
I don't think I can do that--

181
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,504
Help me out this once.
I'll do my best for the campaign.

182
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,885
Please.

183
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,265
Okay, then.

184
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,321
This is insane.

185
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,031
I told you not to leave her alone.

186
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,532
Okay. I'll go look for her.

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,909
Why isn't she answering?

188
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,662
THE BAD

189
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,497
THE GOOD

190
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,707
THE HANDSOME

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,666
Hey!

192
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,835
Don't follow me!

193
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,882
-Go that way.
-Okay.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,085
Damn it.

195
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,422
Let go of me.

196
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,226
Drop me off at the streetlamp there.

197
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,602
-Over there?
-Yes.

198
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,978
Hold on.

199
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,735
Thank you

200
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,613
for driving me here
without asking any questions.

201
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,532
No problem. You must have your reasons.

202
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,950
We'll meet again anyway.

203
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,704
You won't call Mr. Yoon, will you?

204
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,707
I won't tell anyone.

205
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,127
Thank you, Eun-o.

206
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,389
She must be cold.

207
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,702
Hey, Mom.

208
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,371
I've been busy.

209
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,290
I forgot to call you earlier.

210
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,334
Why seaweed soup?

211
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,714
Right. It's my birthday today.

212
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,426
Birthdays aren't a big deal.

213
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,595
Right. Mom.

214
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,348
Thank you for giving birth to me.

215
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,559
Thank you.

216
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,980
You're here again?

217
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,652
I said I wouldn't let you in
if you come again.

218
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,278
I'm cold. Open the door now.

219
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,116
What? What happened to your face?
Did you get hurt?

220
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,746
Where did you get that cut?

221
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,874
How did you get hurt?

222
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,502
Cover yourself with that.

223
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,963
It's not summer.
What's up with the outfit?

224
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,006
Are you okay? Any other injuries?

225
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,302
Dong-sik. Let me see.

226
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,721
-Let me see.
-Have a seat.

227
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,518
-Let me see your face.
-Why do you keep…

228
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,983
Why did you get that cut?
It must have hurt.

229
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,485
I was doing my job.

230
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,280
That's why I told you
not to work too hard.

231
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,323
They pay you chicken feed for your…

232
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,909
salary.

233
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,662
Just do the bare minimum.

234
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,291
Why do you work so hard
and hurt your face like that?

235
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,792
Sit down. Don't make a fuss.

236
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,460
Sit down.

237
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,594
Did you have dinner?

238
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,390
Do you want some <i>tteokbokki</i>?

239
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,394
Put lots of cheese on it.

240
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,316
Don't you know any <i>tteokbokki</i> places?

241
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,234
Why do you always eat it here?

242
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,154
You just offered to make it.

243
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,324
-I've been starving for a month.
-What? A month?

244
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,368
An apple for breakfast,
a tiny piece of chicken breast for lunch,

245
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,122
and a protein shake for dinner.
I haven't had any carbs for a month.

246
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,751
Don't you feel bad?

247
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,254
So just make me some <i>tteokbokki</i>.

248
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,173
Unbelievable.

249
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,888
Lots of cheese, please.

250
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,729
-Do you know Cha Chi-hun, the actor?
-Yes.

251
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,814
He's such a jerk.

252
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,857
Really?

253
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,900
-Cha Chi-hun?
-Yes.

254
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,901
How do you know?

255
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,820
-I was at Hae-na's movie shoot for work.
-Okay.

256
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,238
And I saw him there.

257
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,198
He has

258
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,699
no manners.

259
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,495
But Hae-na has to act like
she likes him in the movie.

260
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,331
-I felt so bad for her.
-That must be so hard.

261
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,332
Right?

262
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,544
-Eun-o.
-Yes?

263
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,296
When did you get so pretty?

264
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,173
Me?

265
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,301
You look gorgeous right now.

266
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,679
-Why?
-You look…

267
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,555
So beautiful.

268
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,809
I almost dropped my pizza.

269
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,352
-Really?
-Yes.

270
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,522
Then, when did you get so handsome?

271
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,815
After I met you.

272
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,943
It feels like I'm living a new life.

273
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,986
Same here.

274
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,918
You look so pretty.

275
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,879
I love you.

276
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,427
-I should stop.
-Yes, you should.

277
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,896
<i>-Where are you?
-Where are you?</i>

278
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,275
-It's Rin-i.
-It's Kyeong-jun.

279
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>Do you want to go to the movies with me?</i>

280
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,446
<i>Do you want to get a drink?</i>

281
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,574
<i>Sorry.</i>

282
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,743
<i>I'm having a meeting
with a team leader I know,</i>

283
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,911
<i>and I think he's going through
a tough time.</i>

284
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>I'm having a meeting with my client.</i>

285
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,332
<i>She's the pickiest client ever.</i>

286
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,418
<i>I don't know when it will end.</i>

287
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,344
<i>Guys, you know
today is our Halli Galli day, right?</i>

288
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,973
<i>Hurry up. I set up everything.</i>

289
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,395
<i>I'll crush all of you today.</i>

290
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,669
Dong-sik, doesn't this look better on me?

291
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,091
Right? It could pass for mine.

292
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,093
Fine. You can keep it.

293
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,594
It's ready. Have a seat.

294
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,722
-It looks delicious.
-Let's eat.

295
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,728
I'm so scared.

296
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,774
Scared of what? <i>Tteokbokki</i>?

297
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,195
Guess how many calories
five pieces of these have.

298
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,863
It's 250 calories.

299
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,157
But I need to eat
less than 1,000 calories a day.

300
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,035
What's more, this contains cheese.
So how many calories?

301
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,703
Isn't that scary?

302
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,123
Don't eat then. I'll eat all of it.

303
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,627
But I can't let you overeat.
Overeating isn't good for your health.

304
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,920
I'll help you out.

305
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:57,136
You are way too skinny,
so don't think about that. Just enjoy.

306
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,264
Thanks. That sounds nice.

307
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,269
But what if I get fat and no one hires me?
Will you take care of me?

308
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,437
-Why would I do that?
-You fed me <i>tteokbokki</i>.

309
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,858
Don't eat, then.

310
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,317
No. I'll eat it all up.

311
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,697
It's so good.

312
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,880
I hate you. I mean it.

313
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,674
I caught a phone scammer today.

314
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,259
So he's the one who punched you.

315
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,262
But you're the police officer.
Is getting beat up your job?

316
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,264
Is hurting people my job then?

317
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,934
Whatever.
You always get hurt like an idiot.

318
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,603
Do you come here to scold me?

319
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,647
I won't come again.
I get nothing but <i>tteokbokki</i>, anyway.

320
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,526
Then, do you want to play a game?

321
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,321
I'm so sick that too.
You always want to play games.

322
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,574
Is that the only thing
you want to do with me?

323
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,367
Then, stop coming here.

324
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,828
Fine. I won't come back.

325
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,456
I'm never coming back here.

326
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,541
Nice. Faster.

327
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,335
Yes! I'm faster than you.

328
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,669
-I'm winning.
-Wait.

329
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,506
Yes! I won!

330
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,759
I won again.

331
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,929
Why are you so good
when you hate playing games?

332
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,264
That's all I ever do when I come here.

333
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,433
It's boring.

334
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,604
I cooked <i>tteokbokki</i> for you
and played games with you.

335
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,980
But you still complain.

336
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,486
Is there anything else
you want to do with me

337
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,529
other than games?

338
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,162
Shall we watch a movie?

339
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,622
THE HANDSOME GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

340
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,792
Forget it, you idiot.

341
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,836
I'm older than you.
Have some respect. Don't call me "idiot."

342
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,339
I have a delivery for you.

343
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,760
Go get it. I ordered it.

344
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,432
What is it?

345
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,434
It looks like a cake.

346
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,023
<i>First, I told them
that your mother collapsed,</i>

347
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,150
<i>so you had to leave urgently.</i>

348
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,695
<i>Cha Chi-hun's commercial shoot
won't take long,</i>

349
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,905
<i>so they're going to film
your scene tonight.</i>

350
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,782
<i>You have to be here before midnight.</i>

351
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,536
<i>Hae-na, do this for my sake.
You have to come, please.</i>

352
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,376
Is it the one I ordered?

353
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,841
How old are you now?

354
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,634
Aren't you turning 28?

355
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,139
You'll turn 30 soon.

356
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,641
I'm not 30 yet.

357
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,311
You'll be 30 soon,
but you don't have a girlfriend.

358
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,271
-What do you mean?
-You don't.

359
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,565
I asked your mom.
She said you didn't have one.

360
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,150
Stop calling my mom.

361
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,486
If you don't want me to call her,
answer my calls.

362
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,613
And stop calling me, too.

363
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,699
Why do you keep calling me
when you're busy?

364
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,994
If you want to know, use your brain.

365
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,871
Why would I call you?

366
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,788
THE HAND

367
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,040
THE USELESS

368
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,885
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

369
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,555
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

370
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,893
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dong-sik</i>

371
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,313
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

372
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,491
What? I didn't even pop the firecracker.

373
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,703
You don't know how to celebrate.

374
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,955
On top of that, you're ugly.

375
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,832
That's why you're single.

376
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,335
Everyone tells me I'm handsome.

377
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,837
No way.

378
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,464
You're

379
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,633
just ordinary for a non-celebrity.

380
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,468
How is this "handsome"?

381
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,762
Who told you that you were handsome?

382
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,806
Was it a girl?

383
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,516
Just eat the cake.

384
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,353
Who is she?

385
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,730
Do you see her every day?
Is she a cop, too?

386
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,190
Is she pretty?

387
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,900
Prettier than me?

388
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,611
Prettier than me?

389
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,453
Hae-na.

390
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,415
Fine. I won't come here again.

391
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,593
Thanks for coming today.

392
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,390
I forgot that it was my birthday today.

393
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,144
I had my birthday cake
and blew out the candles thanks to you.

394
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,856
So I wanted to thank you.

395
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,239
But don't come here again.

396
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,116
It's a hassle for me.

397
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,326
Okay. Fine.

398
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,175
-Dong-sik.
-Yes?

399
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,385
Do you have a toothbrush?

400
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,120
Dong-sik.

401
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,997
I have to go now.

402
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,124
On your own?

403
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,627
Mr. Yoon's going to pick me up.

404
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,544
Really?

405
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,630
Hold on.

406
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,595
Put this on.

407
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,277
Wait, Hae-na.

408
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,704
It's not that cold.

409
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,292
You're an actress.
What if someone recognizes you?

410
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,544
You knew.

411
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,714
I thought you didn't
because you don't treat me like one.

412
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,801
Where is he picking you up?

413
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,844
In front of the supermarket.

414
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,681
You should've told him
to come to my house.

415
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,775
Why? Did you leave something behind?

416
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,780
Your manager is waiting. Hurry up.

417
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,536
Dong-sik.

418
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:24,332
Can you give me
just one minute of your life?

419
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,250
One minute?

420
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,669
Think about it.

421
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,504
Our average life span is 80 years.

422
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,925
If you calculate that into minutes,
one day has 24 hours.

423
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,221
And multiply that by 80.
It's 700,800 hours.

424
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:43,059
If I multiply that by 60,
it's 42,048,000 minutes.

425
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,561
What are you doing?

426
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,902
I'm just asking for one minute
out of the countless minutes you have.

427
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,989
Can you just spare me

428
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,283
one minute?

429
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,079
Fine. That I can do.

430
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,167
What will you do with that one minute?

431
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,180
Not yet.

432
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,892
My one minute isn't over.

433
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,354
Did you just…

434
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,050
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

435
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,010
-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Let's get ready.

436
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,971
-I'm so sorry, sir.
-Hurry up and go.

437
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,478
I saved your career
because I waited for you.

438
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,772
I'm sorry, Chi-hun. I'll do my best.

439
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,775
You ought to. Let's see how good you are.

440
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,611
I'll do my best.

441
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,321
Thank you.

442
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,491
Hae-na, let me fix your makeup.

443
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,910
I'll do the lips myself.

444
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,397
Cha Chi-hun said something awful
to you, didn't he?

445
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,277
Everybody knows that he's nasty and rude
to rookie actors and actresses.

446
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,570
No, he didn't.

447
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,489
Then, why did you leave like that?

448
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,450
Just because.

449
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,496
<i>I wanted to have my first kiss
with someone I liked.</i>

450
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,617
The city is a lonely place.

451
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,786
But there are some heartwarming days.

452
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,746
Thank you for listening to our stories.

453
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,539
Thanks to you, I felt less lonely.

454
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,958
Thanks for pretending
to not know about my story.

455
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,586
I plucked up my courage
thanks to your support.

456
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,464
Will we be able to meet again?

457
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,050
It was really fun
listening to your stories.

458
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,552
-It sounded like my own story.
-And my friend's story.

459
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,720
I knew some of them.

460
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,430
Some of them might have passed me by.

461
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,098
And we might never meet again.

462
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,684
Just like you listened to my story
and supported me,

463
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,061
I'll root for you, too.

464
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,731
If you see me at my part-time job,
come in and say hello.

465
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,733
It'd be fun to run into each other.

466
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,152
-Let's meet again.
-Until then, take care.

467
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,487
-Bye.
-Bye.

468
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,656
-Bye.
-Bye.

469
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,282
Bye.

470
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,077
Bye.

471
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,662
Bye.

472
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,914
What are you doing?

473
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,835
Leave me alone.

474
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,629
-Hurry up and say goodbye.
-Why are we saying goodbye?

475
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,881
It's over, anyway.

476
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,174
Bye.

477
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,343
-Bye.
-Thank you.

478
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,847
Bye. Take care.

479
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,139

Loosen up.

Okay. Let's look cool.

00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,861
Focus. Pretend we're professional models.

00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,322
Stretch your leg like this.

503
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,907
Jae-won, I'm slipping.

504
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,909
You're doing a great job.

505
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,663
Don't do that. Come here.

506
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,331
-Let's take it standing up.
-Sure.

507
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,290
Like this.
