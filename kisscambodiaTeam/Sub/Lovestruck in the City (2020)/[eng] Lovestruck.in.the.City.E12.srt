6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,619
LOVESTRUCK IN THE CITY

8
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,414
We're drinking hard liquor today,
so we'll keep this wine.

9
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,752
Hey.

10
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,796
That bottle looks familiar.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,757
How does it feel not to be an alcoholic?

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,760
When was I an alcoholic, you rascal?

13
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,845
What would they think of me?

14
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,388
-Let's enjoy the barbecue.
-Okay.

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,975
You must be upset
because of that camera thief.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,268
I'll pour you a glass.

17
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,271
Hey, don't you dare drink.

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,397
You can't.

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,066
Not until you forget about her.

20
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,734
Not even one sip.

21
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,235
Put that down.

22
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,864
All right, then. Exclude the alcoholic.

23
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,908
-Bottoms up!
-Give him some water at least.

24
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,868
Here.

25
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,706
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,249
All right.

27
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,418
FF!

28
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,212
{\an8}-Friends forever!
-Friends forever!

29
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,129
{\an8}IPG!

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,714
{\an8}-Interact! Prosper! Good luck!
-Interact! Prosper! Good luck!

31
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,632
{\an8}HER!

32
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,383
{\an8}-Hopeful, energetic, rich!
-Hopeful, energetic, rich!

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,429
Do it.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,515
YHUD!

35
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,433
{\an8}-Youth has ups and downs!
-Youth has ups and downs!

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,351
-Hey!
-Cheers.

37
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,019
"Hey"?

38
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,022
By the way, what did you mean?
When did you take off your ring?

39
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,565
Why bother asking?

40
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,568
He threw it out after taking
that thief to the police.

41
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,364
"You're as good as dead to me.
I'll throw you out with this ring."

42
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,283
Good job.

43
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,124
Jae-won.

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,169
To be honest,
I can't even imagine how you feel.

45
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,839
-So let's give him a drink.
-No, don't.

46
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,841
Will you pick him up from the police?

47
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,925
I said no.

48
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,803
Don't you do that again.

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,228
What do you think, Ms. Lee?

50
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,321
You seem to enjoy
sharing stories about your love life.

51
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,074
You seem to enjoy keeping yours secret.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,870
Yes, I tend to be careful.
I don't tell anyone about it.

53
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,247
I see. I was wrong.

54
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,875
I should've bled to death
without anyone knowing.

55
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,044
Instead, I caused a huge scene
and bawled in front of everyone.

56
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,130
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,673
I'm…

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,762
I was wrong.

59
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,266
What's wrong?

60
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,061
I think he has anger issues.

61
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,688
-I--
-That's not it.

62
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,565
He's just sick. Be considerate.

63
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,068
Eun-o, he's very shook up
because of the camera thief.

64
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,695
Please understand.

65
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,573
Jae-won, you'll find a better woman soon.

66
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,366
Right, your necklace.

67
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,368
-Right.
-What?

68
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,706
-Right, your necklace.
-What are the rings for?

69
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,292
-A new boyfriend?
-Why didn't you tell us?

70
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,628
Let me see.

71
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,171
Mind your own business.

72
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,798
Even if I get a boyfriend,
I'll never tell you guys.

73
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,758
You see,

74
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,679
unlike someone,
I will keep my private life private.

75
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,225
-Where are you going?
-The bathroom.

76
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,645
Come on, we're friends.
Why can't you tell us about it?

77
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,980
-She's so secretive.
-Even strangers will tell us.

78
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,315
-I bet.
-What's wrong with her?

79
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,535
How did he know I lived here?

80
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,749
He didn't look shocked to see me.
He must know everything.

81
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,629
But how much does he know?

82
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,257
Right.

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,260
I brought Eun-o's proposal
and the bidding request.

84
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,636
I should give them to her.

85
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,097
I'll do it.
I need to use the bathroom anyway.

86
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,348
-Will you?
-Yes.

87
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,225
What is that?

88
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,394
-Password, please.
-It's 0660 and an asterisk.

89
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,105
Remember the proposals you gave me?

90
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,231
Everyone liked it.

91
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,927
Kyeong-jun thinks I'm here
because of this.

92
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,930
You seem to be close to my cousin.

93
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,516
I had no idea.

94
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,856
How fascinating.

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,067
I can't believe I've come to O3

96
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,154
with these request papers.

97
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
Ms. Lee Eun-o must be a marketer.

98
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,700
I can't work with you.

99
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,079
Of course. Me neither.

100
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,084
Then why are you here?

101
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:41,549
I wanted to see if this Lee Eun-o was
the one I met at the police station.

102
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,597
If you're done, leave.

103
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,611
By the way,

104
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,739
is that all you got to say?

105
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,866
What do you want to hear?

106
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,410
What should I hear to soothe my anger?

107
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,622
I don't think anything can soothe me,

108
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,665
but say something.

109
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,754
Explain to me at least

110
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,757
why you can't tell your friends about us,

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,258
why we broke up like that,

112
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,720
and why you hid from me
even when you heard from Kyeong-jun

113
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,473
I'd been looking for you. Explain.

114
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,243
This is driving me crazy.

115
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,167
So this is what Lee Eun-o's like.

116
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,961
Seon-a wasn't like that.

117
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,548
You…

118
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
Everything was fake.

119
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,679
If you were Seon-a,

120
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,848
you would have forced yourself to speak.

121
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,812
Seon-a would've been honest with me.

122
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,689
And that's what I liked about her.

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,152
That's why I didn't understand
the way you chose to break up with me.

124
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,070
Seon-a wouldn't have just disappeared.

125
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,158
She wouldn't have left an absurd message
about stealing my cameras.

126
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,202
If Seon-a wanted to break up with me,

127
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,288
she would've at least

128
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,082
said it to my face.

129
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,667
She's not a coward like you.

130
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,295
Everything about you was fake
from the start.

131
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,589
You were a liar.

132
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,324
-How did it go?
-I gave her all the materials.

133
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,827
You can explain the details. I'm leaving.

134
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,329
-Bye.
-Already?

135
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,622
-See you next time.
-Okay.

136
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,207
Bye.

137
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,833
-I'll call you.
-Go home safely.

138
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,544
He's so cool.

139
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,005
He's totally my style.

140
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,257
Rin-i, let's go.

141
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,218
-We can see Eun-o tomorrow.
-Okay.

142
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,845
Hold on.
Do I have to clean this up on my own?

143
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,431
Fine. Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

144
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,767
Let's go! Let's hurry!

145
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,644
Have fun cleaning and good night.

146
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,772
Good night, Pushover.

147
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,783
Who the hell are you?

148
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,246
-You little…
-He always plays rock.

149
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,248
I know. That fool always does.

150
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,589
Hey. They all left.

151
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,809
You gave Kyeong-jun my proposals,
didn't you?

152
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,646
He has many connections
and is the most successful one here.

153
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,315
I asked him to introduce some companies.

154
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,986
It's all because you're good.

155
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,655
If you were incompetent,
he wouldn't have done so.

156
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,449
See? Mr. Park came here right away.

157
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,205
I can only bid for it
when I'm competent enough.

158
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,334
Whatever. I feel so miserable.

159
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,047
Why do you feel miserable?
It's not what you think.

160
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,402
You just downed a million won.

161
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,912
If you're done, leave.
What do you want to hear?

162
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,587
-Take that!
-Stop it.

163
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,729
When will we finish cleaning up?

164
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,315
Eun-o, let's do the dishes.

165
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,317
You can't leave everything here…

166
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,071
Eun-o!

167
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,907
Don't you know how expensive this is?

168
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,867
How could you finish this precious…

169
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,994
Where did she go?

170
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,891
Don't.

171
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,434
Come on.

172
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,492
Long time no see, Eun-o.

173
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,703
Hello.

174
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,543
-Where are you going?
-To see Geon.

175
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,338
-Why?
-Because I was kicked out.

176
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,881
Why?

177
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,968
Imagine if you're my dad.

178
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,970
Would you like me

179
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,681
when I drink every day?

180
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,769
But why would you go to Geon
after getting kicked out?

181
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,021
Because there's nowhere else to go.

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,651
He lives at my house.

183
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,696
I know. That's why I'm going there.

184
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,493
Goodbye, then.

185
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,580
Hey.

186
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,041
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

187
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,001
What?

188
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,462
No, not at all.

189
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:40,968
I always thought you were cool.

190
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,766
I'm obviously a crazy woman.

191
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,269
Do you think I'm cool?

192
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,107
All right.

193
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,988
But

194
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:07,411
this cool woman didn't get over Geon yet.

195
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,871
Why?

196
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,208
Because he told me a long time ago

197
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,542
that even if we break up,

198
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,004
if I ever miss my mom terribly,

199
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,923
I could visit him anytime.

200
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,052
Isn't he amazing?

201
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,598
He's a decent guy.

202
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,101
You like him, don't you?

203
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,229
What?

204
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,816
Let me tell you right now.

205
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,946
If you ever marry Geon,

206
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,949
you're dead meat.

207
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,868
Why would I marry him?

208
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,038
Don't say such disgusting things.

209
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,292
Do you think Geon is disgusting?

210
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,837
He's not disgusting.

211
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,381
Geon is

212
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,841
very sexy.

213
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,179
You must be crazy. Why did you hit me?

214
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,641
To be honest, I've always hated your guts.

215
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,352
What in the world are you saying?

216
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,148
Why do you hate me?

217
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,109
Because Geon likes you.

218
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,238
I like him too.
We're close friends. It's obvious.

219
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,075
Hey.

220
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,494
Just go.

221
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,039
I'm going to do a palm blast,

222
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,583
so leave.

223
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,168
Here I go.

224
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,756
Palm…

225
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,176
Blast!

226
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,100
Are my hands frozen from the cold?

227
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,852
Then…

228
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,271
Hold on. One more time.

229
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:04,320
Palm

230
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
blast!

231
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,449
You're hammered.
You won't be able to find my house.

232
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,868
What? Why isn't it working?

233
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,871
What? Hey.

234
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,249
Hey, where do you live?

235
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,045
Why isn't she answering me?

236
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,882
Why am I still here?

237
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,510
Is that the right way?

238
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,605
Did Eun-o go to take a bus again?

239
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,691
Why does she ride the bus
whenever she's drunk?

240
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,708
<i>Everything was fake.</i>

241
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,794
If you were Seon-a,

242
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,463
you would have forced yourself to speak.

243
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,801
Seon-a would've been honest with me.

244
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,803
And that's what I liked about her.

245
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,388
She's not a coward like you.

246
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,516
<i>Everything about you was fake
from the start.</i>

247
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,226
<i>You were a liar.</i>

248
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,026
-Isn't this too small for me?
-It looks fine.

249
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,366
-Who could that be?
<i>-Door opening.</i>

250
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,453
Baby, I'm home. Are you surprised to see…

251
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,598
It's not like you didn't know
that I fell out of love.

252
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,936
No, you never told me that.

253
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,398
I kept sending signals
that you were annoying.

254
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,525
You're too boring and ordinary.

255
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,485
I feel suffocated when I'm with you.

256
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,531
Did you really not know,
or did you just want to deny it?

257
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,369
I'm starting work in a week.

258
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,539
What am I supposed to do?

259
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,799
DAESEONG MOTEL

260
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
What should we do?

261
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,971
Ms. Lee,

262
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,517
did you not get the notice
that we canceled your employment?

263
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,559
Sorry?

264
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,478
What do you mean?

265
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,439
The HR Team couldn't reach you.

266
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,484
They texted you
and even sent you an e-mail.

267
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,569
Hello, everyone.

268
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,784
I'll be working with you from today.
My name is Yoon Seon-a.

269
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,621
Did you hear about my interview?

270
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,540
I'll keep that energy up

271
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,751
and always try to help
relieve your stress.

272
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,547
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

273
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,091
What? Fellow newcomer?

274
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,387
We were interviewed together, right?

275
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,223
I hope we get along.

276
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,528
One of the employees'
job transfer to Dubai got canceled,

277
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,113
so she'll be remaining here.

278
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,033
That's why we decided to hire
just one more marketer.

279
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,079
Why…

280
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,126
Why didn't you hire me?
You picked both of us.

281
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,340
Ms. Yoon was in
the same interview group, right?

282
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,178
Both of your applications were excellent.

283
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:44,641
But her interview score
was higher than yours.

284
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:49,313
We wanted a new employee
who was full of vigor, determination,

285
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,440
and new energy.

286
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,859
Your answers

287
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,196
were too ordinary.

288
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,742
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,204
Okay, thank you.

290
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,814
Hello?

291
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,108
Mom, it's me.

292
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,946
Sorry, my phone broke.

293
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,618
Min-su?

294
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,373
Yes, he's doing well. He is.

295
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,587
I know he can't pick up.

296
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,216
Yes.

297
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,304
Mom, Min-su had to go abroad for training.

298
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,811
No.

299
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,440
I'll be fine without him. I'm doing well.

300
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,568
The new job is nice.

301
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,114
Everything is nice.

302
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,783
I'm having so much fun. I love Busan.

303
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
Mom.

304
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,208
I have so much to tell you,

305
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,836
but not over the phone.

306
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,171
Yes.

307
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,925
I'll explain everything in person later.

308
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,344
Okay.

309
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,766
What do you mean? I'm not crying.

310
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,772
It's just that hearing your voice
makes me miss you so much.

311
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>That day, I rode the bus just like today.</i>

312
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,517
<i>And that bus led me to Jae-won.</i>

313
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,565
<i>I sometimes wonder</i>

314
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:45,280
<i>what would've happened to me
if I didn't go to that beach.</i>

00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,882
<i>That's when</i>

364
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,552
<i>I thought of Yoon Seon-a.</i>

365
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,889
You're looking very casual today.

366
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,936
Yes. The Marketing Team
doesn't need to meet customers.

367
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,648
If I get the job,
I'll be receiving a uniform.

368
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,483
And I can dye and straighten my hair.

369
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:18,446
I thought it was most important
to represent myself in this interview.

370
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,575
-Doesn't this look suit me?
-Yes, it does.

371
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,121
-What do you do for fun?
-I dance.

372
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,334
But how can we verify that?

373
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,545
Should I show you, then?

374
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,839
I can show you.

375
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,386
It will be boring without any music.

376
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,223
Mr. Red Tie,

377
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,142
could you turn on some music?

378
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,769
I'll liven up this room.

379
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,312
Let's see.

380
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,941
My playlist is a bit old-fashioned.

381
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,151
It's okay. Any will do.

382
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,779
All right.

383
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,115
This is good.

384
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,285
Could you clap for me, please?

385
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,739
You can call me Yoon Seon-a.

386
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,908
Yoon-seon?

387
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,536
No. Yoon Seon-a.

388
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,253
<i>That's how I became Yoon Seon-a.</i>

389
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,468
<i>And then, I met Jae-won.</i>

390
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,558
<i>A healthy breakup?</i>

391
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,519
Sure.

392
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,146
If it's possible,
I'd like to break up that way.

393
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,195
I didn't mean to leave him like that.

394
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,448
Do you think I enjoyed that breakup?
He was someone I loved.

395
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,991
But I stripped and hit him

396
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,994
and yelled at him to return
everything I gave him.

397
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,622
I didn't want to do that.

398
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,043
The day Jae-won and I agreed to meet here,

399
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,880
I came here with his camera bag.

400
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,844
He left for Seoul in a hurry,

401
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,596
and I wanted to give him back
the cameras he'd left behind.

402
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,182
I was going to come clean.

403
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,687
I just wanted him to say,
"Seon-yeong, don't do this.

404
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,146
I love you."

405
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,108
That's what I wanted to hear.

406
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,485
However,

407
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,406
when I saw him waiting,

408
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,826
I couldn't walk over to him.

409
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,078
I was too scared.

410
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,998
That's why I left that message

411
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,042
that I stole his cameras.

412
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,336
I wanted him to hate me.

413
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,089
I wanted him to curse me.

414
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,633
I wanted him

415
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,553
to forget me.

416
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,682
But I've never heard those words before.

417
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,893
Every time I requested a breakup,

418
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,229
they didn't hesitate
as if they were waiting for that moment.

419
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,441
I didn't want to break up like that.

420
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,943
I didn't want to end it like that.

421
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,154
I just

422
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,657
wanted confirmation
that I was being loved.

423
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,369
I've been betrayed before,

424
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,331
so I know how Jae-won must feel.

425
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't know how to confirm their love

426
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,502
or how to break up.

427
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,796
I have no idea.

428
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,635
I still don't know
how I should've broken up with him.

429
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,762
I think I'll never know.

430
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,264
I just

431
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,808
regret it.

432
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,772
I just keep thinking
I shouldn't have done that.

433
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,029
I'm lonely.

434
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,446
<i>Where am I?</i>

435
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,232
Where is the house? I'm exhausted.

436
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,280
I found it!

437
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:56,534
Kang Geon, let's play!

438
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,246
Isn't it the right place?

439
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,875
Am I wrong?

440
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,045
Then I should keep searching.

441
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,464
It's freezing.

442
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,841
Geon.

443
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,764
Why are you still here?

444
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,183
Palm blast!

445
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,518
That rascal's strong.

446
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,395
Palm blast!

447
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,483
You have my respect.

448
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,863
You're incredible. Thank you.
