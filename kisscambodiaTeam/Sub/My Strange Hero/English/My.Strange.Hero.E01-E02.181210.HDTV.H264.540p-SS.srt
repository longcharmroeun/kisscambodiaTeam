(Episode 1)

4
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,009
I want to give more.

5
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,979
I hear their steak is over 150 dollars.

6
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,578
I should give at least 100 dollars.

7
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,388
But I can't.

8
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:27,804
Because that's against the anti-graft law.

9
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,739
Steak. Steak. Beef steak.

10
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,539
- Thank you for coming. - Hello.

11
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,085
- Thank you. - Hello.

12
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,488
Hello, Mr. Kim.

13
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,062
Congratulations!

14
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:53,920
Hi, Ms. Son.

15
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,619
I'm not sure if I gave you a wedding invitation or not.

16
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,918
Oh, don't worry about it. I must come to celebrate.

17
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,349
Because I'll be a permanent teacher soon,

18
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,643
and I'll be working under you for a long time.

19
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,229
Well, it's going to be difficult.

20
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,159
We'll be hiring someone from outside.

21
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,012
What do you mean?

22
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,069
I even took the permanent teacher exam.

23
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,433
I have no power.

24
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,995
Ms. Son, I'll see you at school, okay?

25
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,554
Goodness, Mr. Park.

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,496
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

"life is wonderful."

Will you, Kim Jae Woong, take Lee Chae Young...

31
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:44,130
as your lawfully wedded wife?

32
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,339
- Yes! - Yes!

33
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,380
Yes, I will.

34
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:18,939
I'm sorry...

35
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,410
for being late.

36
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,089
Chae Young.

37
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,790
Lee Chae Young!

38
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,634
Tolstoy was wrong.

Gosh, you have to work now.

45
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,150
Let's go with Plan B.

46
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,344
Are you really going to give up on me?

47
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,343
Let's be confident.

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,699
I can't give up on our love. I won't break up with you.

49
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,790
Please let's be proud before the world.

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,215
Who are you?

51
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,480
Don't come near me.

52
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,138
Chae Young, I don't know him. I don't know him.

53
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,251
Who the heck are you?

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,545
Gosh! What the...

55
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,441
Hurry.

56
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,778
He said he'd give me the permanent position,

57
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,133
and made me work overtime so many times.

58
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,793
If that's how he'll treat me,

59
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,808
I'll go eat all the steaks.

60
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,879
What are you doing? We'll get caught.

61
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,500
Hurry!

62
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,267
I guess it's tasty because it's so expensive.

63
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,419
He said as if there'd be a position.

64
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,848
He said as if he'd give me a permanent position.

65
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,143
I offered him so many gifts, that jerk!

66
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,270
What?

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,902
What's wrong with her?

How will you settle the balance?

72
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,468
I'll pay cash.

73
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:14,528
Excuse me.

74
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,439
Our CEO is still stuck at the wedding hall.

75
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,268
You need to take that into consideration.

76
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,158
I did already.

77
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,478
By the way, it was a sudden request,

78
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,802
but you took care of it so well.

79
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,640
I'll get off here.

Hope you have a granddaughter that looks just like you.

Amen.

86

Guys. If you don't get married within 6 months...

of catching a bouquet,

88
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,884
you can't get married for 3 years, Bok Su.

89
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,958
Don't tell me you're considering Bok Su as your husband.

90
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,717
Hey, hey, hey.

91
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,958
You never know.

92
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,929
By the way, are you okay after getting beat up?

93
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,292
Thanks for asking so fast.

94
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,701
The groom's hobby is jiu-jitsu.

95
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,069
All of those guys were from his jiu-jitsu club.

Our car is so big. How did you not see it?

101

- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

102
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,988
Are they blind?

103
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,172
They're from Seolsong High School.

104
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,813
The uniform is still the same.

105
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,769
It's normal for kids to go around without looking.

106
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,211
Let's go, Bok Su.

107
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,090

Do you think this will be okay?

115
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,199
I think so. No, wait.

116
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,281
Isn't it our homeroom teacher today?

117
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,450
I think so.

118
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,781

123
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,711
F-i-t.

124
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,699
I pulled in about 1cm,

125
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,850
and it makes a huge difference. Look.

126
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,919
I don't care. Let's go.

127
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,212

Are you guys crazy?

136
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,981
Hey! Close the window!

137
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,309

(Seolsong High School)

142
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,256
- It was a tough morning, right? - Yes.

143
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,368
I got annoyed because of you, ma'am.

144
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,968
We're only a year apart. Don't be so formal with me.

(English Vocabulary)

148
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,779
Our class queen is pretty today too.

149
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:34,689
No way. I prefer someone with black hair.

150
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,159
Our class president Soo Jeong is super nice and pretty.

151
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,889
Our homeroom teacher didn't believe I had naturally brown hair.

152
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,789
Then she said,

153
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,598
"You shouldn't demand students with naturally brown hair..."

154
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,418
"should dye their hair. That's infringing a student's right."

155
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,728
That's what she said.

156
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,328
She's not your type, right?

157
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,622
No. Neither are you.

158
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,559
Your eyelash fell off.

159
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,208
There are two.

00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,229
I did it on purpose.

Hey, hey.

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,406
- Hello. - Hello.

165
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,154
The scores from the mock test are out.

166
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,053
The one with the top mark from the school...

167
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,187
is our class president, Son Soo Jeong.

168
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,409
What a great news.

169
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,139
The one with the worst score is in our class too.

170
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,378
This is a matter of privacy,

171
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,057
so I won't announce it. Okay, Bok Su?

172
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,949
You should study a little. What will you become?

Gyeong Hyeon. You're 299th.

174
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,419
Your score was the worst in Korean,

175
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,651
and your homeroom teacher teaches Korean.

176
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:49,540
Gosh.

177
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,499
I came up with an amazing idea.

178
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,498
I don't want to.

179
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,098
I'll group the smart students with the not-so-smart students,

180
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,238
and the smart ones will be in charge of teaching the other.

181
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,039
When the smart students teach, they'll excel even more,

182
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,478
while the not-so-smart students can learn from them.

183
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,398
The group that brings up their scores the most...

184
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,576
will be given a perfect score in practical technique assessment.

185
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,978
I've put you into teams, so check.

186
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:20,732
Gosh. The class president is grouped with Bok Su.

187
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,777
Bok Su, you might end up getting into university.

188
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,879
My gosh, you're with Bok Su.

189
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,341
I'm so jealous.

190
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,869
Sir, I want to be in Bok Su's team.

191
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,294
Min Ji, your score was 298th.

192
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,008
If you and Bok Su are put in the same team,

193
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,738
it'd be like committing suicide together.

194
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,607
This is not love.

195
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,698
Okay, get ready for class.

196
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,667
Let's eat.

197
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,213
Let's do our best, Bok Su.

198
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,468
Tell me your schedule, and I'll...

199
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:02,823
No. No, no. I'm too busy.

200
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,128
I have so many other things to do other than study. No, I can't.

201
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,139
It's still part of our performance assessment. We have to do it.

202
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,220
No, thank you.

203
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,190
What?

204
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,809
Let's try to find some time here and there.

205
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,436
I need to get a perfect score in performance assessment.

206
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,089
I appreciate your help.

207
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,081
Hey, do you want some ramyeon?

208
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,140
Bok Su.

209
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,616
Bok Su. Bok Su.

210
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:37,098
Bok Su.

211
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,260
Wait. A little later. A little later.

212
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:42,838
Bok Su.

213
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,153
I'm late.

214
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,008
Bok Su. Bok Su.

215
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,898
Bok Su. Bok Su.

217
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,753
Let's talk outside.

218
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,221
Soo Jeong.

219
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,965
Hey, hold on.

220
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,292
Soo Jeong.

221
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,718
How do you walk so fast?

222
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,105
What do you want to talk about?

223
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,019
You darn little punk...

224
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,898
that's of no use in this world.

225
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,289
You probably don't even know the Pythagorean theorem.

226
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,689
You have no clue, do you?

227
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,189
I'm the top student at the school.

228
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,088
It's a waste of my time to talk to someone in 300th place.

229
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,181
I could be solving five sample questions at this time.

230
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,882
Why are you doing this?

231
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,881
Go and do these problems.

232
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,298
If you don't,

233
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,824
I'll rip your pants before Mr. Park does.

Uncle Bok Su! Grandma told you to come and eat.

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,813
I said, come and eat.

237
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:01,384
Grandma! Mom! Uncle's acting strange!

238
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,894
- He's studying. - That little...

239
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,389
You darn little punk...

240
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,005
that's of no use in this world.

241
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,751
My gosh, what is this?

242
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,728
It's an arrhythmia.

243
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:25,768
Yes, that's right. We have a family history of arrhythmia.

244
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,526
What's going on?

245
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,088
- Bok Su. - What?

246
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,229
- Are you sick? - What?

247
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,298
Why are you suddenly acting unusual?

248
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,934
Hey, Bok Su's here.

249
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,244
Here. Are you happy now?

250
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,240
What happened?

251
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,751
What did Soo Jeong say that made you sigh like that?

252
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,789
What do you mean? She didn't say anything.

253
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,138
She suppressed you with nothing but her eyes?

254
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,582
She's incredible.

255
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,162
She even looks pretty from behind.

256
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,849
I should've been the last student.

257
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,546
- Why did I have to be so smart? - Hey.

258
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:46,999
She...

259
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,409
Never mind. Hey, listen.

260
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,701
She...

261
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,129
She's so two-faced.

262
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,745
She's even really good at swearing.

263
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,130
Bok Su, are you trying to keep me in check?

264
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,028
The skies are fair.

265
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:29,554
They gave Bok Su his good looks,

266
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,498
but they didn't give him a good brain.

(Quotes that help with studying)

268
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,068
I mean, why did he even memorize...

269
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,120
these positive quotes when he doesn't even study?

270
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,497
(Isn't it a joyful experience to learn something and master it?)

271
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,579
Did I or did I not tell you to bring this to me...

272
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,600
before the meal so that I could have it as an appetizer?

273
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,592
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:50,868
You're huge, but you get scared easily.

275
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,778
Hey, he's so cushiony.

276
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:53,931
That hurts.

277
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:55,631
Stop it.

278
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,900
Hey.

279
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,549
You didn't even buy me the bread I asked for.

280
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,656
Your head must be up in the clouds.

281
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,106
My gosh, that's enough! Stop it!

282
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,975
Gosh, what kind of jerk threw away plastic in a general waste bag?

283
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,201
That hurts. Stop it.

284
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,040
Don't you know how to recycle waste?

285
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,695
Well, let me be honest here.

286
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:27,022
I'm actually an advocate of non-violence.

287
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,008
Abraham Lincoln once said this.

288
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,746
You know who he is, right? He's the Indian guy.

289
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,657
"Weak people are not capable of forgiving others."

290
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,617
I'll forgive you guys, so you may go.

291
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Go. Go.

292
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,010
You punk.

293
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,268
You little punk. I told you not to get into a fight!

294
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,369
Bok Su, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

295
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,609
Yes, I'm okay. Gosh, I didn't fight anyone.

296
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,679
And why do you always show up after the fight's over?

297
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,760
You should've come earlier.

298
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:03,829
Did you get hurt?

299
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,230
Who?

300
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:06,759
Me?

301
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,000
Mr. Park.

302
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,810
I'm Kang Bok Su.

303
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,129
You little punk. You're always nothing but words.

304
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,958
- That really hurts. - Your mouth is your problem.

305
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,647
Get going, you punk. Go.

306
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,598
He's so bad at convincing people. He only knows how to take action.

307
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,056
Today, you'll be doing...

308
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,023
a three-legged race.

309
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,281
The results will be reflected

310
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,401
in your mid-term grades and performance assessment.

311
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,305
You know the study groups you were all assigned to?

312
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:37,096
You'll be teaming up with the same member.

313
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,089
It's really important for you and your partner to be in tune for this.

314
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,493
So grab your partners and get ready for the race.

315
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,178
Gosh, where did she go?

316
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:51,371
Are you okay?

317
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,025
What? What do you mean?

318
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,290
Never mind. Which leg should I tie?

319
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,590
Any leg is fine. Here. Tie this leg.

320
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:08,623
We need to tie it up real nice.

321
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,631
Hey.

322
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,288
You better do this properly.

323
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,804
I'm going to kill you if you make me lose points.

324
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,689
Gosh, you're so two-faced.

325
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,780
- It's such a waste that others... - Shut it.

326
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,171
Get ready.

327
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,117
My gosh, my leg.

328
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,619
Bok Su, you should just faint.

329
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,659
I can't watch this.

330
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,892
How... How dare she carry Bok Su?

331
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,240
My gosh.

332
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,320
Gosh.

333
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:55,146
Soo Jeong, are you okay?

334
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,001
Did we come in first place?

335
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,286
Well, yes. Yes, you did.

336
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,419
Bok Su, are you okay?

337
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,029
Hey, are you crazy?

338
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,665
What... What did you do to me?

339
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,791
What do you mean?

340
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,478
Bok Su, you just came in first place.

341
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,808
Has that ever happened to you?

342
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:26,173
Gosh, that's not what's important right now!

343
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,849
My gosh, this is so embarrassing.

344
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,788
Hey, you just...

345
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,359
You just made me look like a complete fool.

346
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,541
You are a fool.

347
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,228
Hey. Hey, Two-face. I...

348
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:43,289
I won't go easy on you just because you're a girl. Stop...

349
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,051
And listen to me, you fool.

350
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,308
The Indian guy you were talking about isn't Abraham Lincoln.

351
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,451
It's Gandhi.

352
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,508
Abraham Lincoln once said this.

353
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,368
You know who he is, right? He's the Indian guy.

354
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,729
Well...

355
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,318
Whatever. They're both foreigners.

356
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,844
I don't know if you're really an advocate for non-violence.

357
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,103
But you were pretty impressive earlier.

358
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,143
But you were pretty impressive earlier.

359
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:42,709
Where is he? Bok Su.

360
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,078
Hey, Bok Su.

361
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,028
My gosh, he must've hurt his head.

362
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,191
- Carry him on your back. - Let's get you to a hospital.

363
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,249
Why?

364
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,631
Have you broken a bone?

365
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,391
My heart...

366
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,663
broke.

367
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:04,591
What?

368
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:42,059
Wait.

369
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,779
Soo Jeong, wait a minute.

370
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,872
Your leg is all better now.

371
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,613
Yes, it's because of love...

372
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,211
Class president.

373
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,079
I mean...

374
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,279
Soo Jeong.

375
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,219
Let's...

376
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,829
go on a date.

377
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,666
I don't date idiots.

378
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,232
I can study hard.

379
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:15,171
I don't want to disappoint you.

380
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,831
I don't know...

381
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,500
how though.

382
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,150
I can't be disappointed because I have no expectations.

383
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,711
Then...

384
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,388
try getting better grades in Korean.

385
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,094
I'll look forward to it.

386
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,394
Kang Bok Su.

387
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,414
- Hey, Kang Bok Su. - Bok Su.

388
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:35,142
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)

389
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,928
(Episode 2)

390
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,728
Look. Phonological variation is...

391
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:46,124
What is "phonological"? Why does it vary?

392
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,738
Phonological variation is concerned with sounds and pronunciation.

393
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:52,538
We learned this in middle school.

394
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:55,438
Slender raindrops. Yellow socks. Don't you remember?

395
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,889
Hey.

396
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,678
That's a terrible fashion sense.

397
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,279
Who wears socks like that these days?

398
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,349
Don't try to understand it. Just memorize it.

399
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,649
It's simple if you just memorize it.

400
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,149
In syllables, there is the last consonant law.

401
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,422
K, N, D, L, M, B, NG sound applies to that.

402
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,558
S is missing.

403
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,299
That's why we say slender raindrops.

404
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,658
So you don't get confused even without the S.

405
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:18,740
Look.

406
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,528
That law is so abstract.

407
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:24,039
Red light means stop. Green light means go.

408
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,469
Protect children, pregnant women, and elderlies

409
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,109
It can be simple like this.

410
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,059
Why did they have to make it so hard?

411
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,731
Hey, you fool. In lesson...

412
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,203
Do you want to have fried rice too?

413
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:57,409
Can I?

414
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:01,434
- You know that's extra large. - Of course.

415
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,750
Okay.

416
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:10,656
My uncle is all grown up. He brought a girl over.

417
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:40,420
Soo Jeong.

418
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,566
Soo Jeong.

419
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,751
What do you think, Soo Jeong?

420
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,769
Don't you feel better after running?

421
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,851
Better?

422
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,824
I was scared to death.

423
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,900
You skipped the self-study session again.

424
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:02,178
You never study and always cause trouble.

425
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:03,779
Why do you come to school?

426
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,900
What do you mean why? It's fun.

427
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,049
I have friends here. I get food.

428
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,110
I get a good sleep in class.

429
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:11,300
It's paradise.

430
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,345
Give me your Korean test paper.

431
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,113
Well...

432
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,339
I'm sorry, but I guess I'm really stupid.

433
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,598
Did you get everything wrong?

434
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,118
"Well, at least you tried. It's okay."

435
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,349
I can't say that to you.

436
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,388
(Korean)

437
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:43,618
Ta-da.

438
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,488
Look! I scored 50 points higher.

439
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,509
Then...

440
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,948
- you had 15 before... - Yes.

441
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,012
What did you get?

442
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:57,709
80?

443
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:00,450
90?

444
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,079
No way.

445
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,190
Did you get perfect?

446
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,670
Soo Jeong, you lack humane feelings.

447
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:10,479
What?

448
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,590
Hey, Soo Jeong.

449
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,561
What's your dream?

450
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:16,573
- My dream? - Yes.

451
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,759
What do you want to be? Why do you study so hard?

452
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,175
I don't have a dream yet.

453
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,181
Then...

454
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,192
how about a teacher?

455
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:37,095
- A teacher? - Yes.

456
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,649
Teacher Son Soo Jeong. That sounds great.

457
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,078
What's important is that you made me get 65 points.

458
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,575
This is an amazing achievement.

459
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,301
A teacher?

460
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,683
Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

461
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:58,258
See? Now you've found your dream.

462
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,224
I know what I want to be too.

463
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,183
Son Soo Jeong's...

464
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,422
boyfriend.

465
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:12,452
What are you saying?

466
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,800
Ms. Son.

467
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,403
Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

468
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,721
Ms. Son.

469
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,760
Ms. Son.

470
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,665
Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

471
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,243
Gosh. Hey, Young Min.

472
00:38:57,489 --> 00:38:59,459
The school counselor isn't here yet.

473
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,499
Today,

474
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,816
I came to see you.

475
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:05,949
Me? Why?

476
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,915
Do you need counseling?

477
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,361
What is it? Are you being bullied?

478
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:13,788
Not really...

479
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,619
I'm...

480
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,779
so scared I'll get kicked out of the Ivy class.

481
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,863
I see.

482
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,119
I'm scared I'll get kicked out of this school.

483
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,433
We have tests every week,

484
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,659
and the other kids seem to be doing well.

485
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,760
Everyone else is doing well. Why only me?

486
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,881
What should I do?

487
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,707
That's what I want to ask. What should I do?

488
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:51,208
Young Min. You're at an age when everything seems to change.

489
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,448
It's normal to feel anxious.

490
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:54,722
Ms. Son!

491
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,337
Did you not pay for the meal service?

492
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,218
The administration office just called in.

493
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:04,458
How can a teacher eat for free for three months?

494
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,289
I'm counseling someone,

495
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,674
so I'll be right down.

496
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:09,306
Okay.

497
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,833
Young Min, can we do this another time?

498
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,068
Another time? When?

499
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:23,279
Later.

500
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,532
This office is always open.

501
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:35,441
- Hello. - Hello.

502
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,064
They keep on constructing more buildings.

503
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:50,225
Write "Flag" by Yoo Chi Hwan 100 times each.

504
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,068
- No. - Come on, sir.

505
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:56,171
All right. Forget about everything else.

506
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,739
Just remember that this is Yoo Chi Hwan's pen name.

507
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,208
I wish I was a full-time Korean teacher.

508
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,348
That would be wrong.

509
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:06,207
Will I secure a spot if Mr. Park leaves?

510
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:08,037
I'm telling you.

511
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,711
Have you gone crazy?

512
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:11,869
Wake up.

513
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,423
(Administration Office)

514
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,784
Ms. Son Soo Jeong?

515
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,708
Your contract ends this term, right?

516
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:30,961
What? 50,000 dollars?

517
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:35,624
Lower your voice.

518
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,880
If you pay 50,000 dollars, you can become a full-time teacher.

519
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:45,037
I wasn't going to say this,

520
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:47,514
but do you know Ms. Hong who's in charge of freshmen Korean?

521
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,803
Of course.

522
00:41:50,729 --> 00:41:53,092
- No way. - Second year civics teacher.

523
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,928
No way, Ms. Jang too?

524
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,979
Yes.

525
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:00,312
By the way, why are you giving me this offer?

526
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,838
Also, where will administration office...

527
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:04,178
use that money?

528
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:06,261
You failed to get promoted to a full-time teacher.

529
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,134
If you don't do something like this, you'll never get in.

530
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,340
I really wasn't going to say this, but...

531
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,401
I'm...

532
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,259
the second cousin of the cousin...

533
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,612
of the chairman of the board.

534
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,955
I see.

535
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,913
That's amazing.

536
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:37,208
You're a son of a gun.

537
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:38,724
What are you trying to pull?

538
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,409
If you're the second cousin of his cousin, you're strangers.

539
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,119
How can someone pay to buy a job to teach kids?

540
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,249
I'm going to report you to the broadcasters...

541
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,107
and the police.

542
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,433
I won't let you get away with this.

543
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,077
Fine, just live that way forever.

544
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,029
You won't ever secure a position,

545
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,289
and you'll always be nervous around the kids.

546
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:57,029
You'll have to flatter the other teachers too.

547
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,656
Keep on living with that attitude.

548
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:03,752
I was trying to be nice.

549
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,254
You're behind on your meal payment.

550
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,227
Please pay up soon.

551
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:23,109
(Hana Nursing Home)

552
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:39,203
Grandma, have you been well?

553
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:42,433
You got even more beautiful.

554
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,733
I'm the only one getting old.

555
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:53,383
Grandma, should I quit working at the school?

556
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,541
The food at the cafeteria tastes bad.

557
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,978
It used to taste good in the past.

558
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,154
You know very well how much I liked the food there.

559
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,664
They almost persuaded me.

560
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,120
In my head,

561
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,967
I was thinking about how I should make the money.

562
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:25,719
Is it okay for someone like me to become a teacher?

563
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,780
Ms. Son Soo Jeong.

564
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,675
Do I have the right?

565
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:38,302
Ms. Son. Teacher Son Soo Jeong.

566
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,820
I must be crazy. Why do I remember that?

567
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,608
Well, it's going to be difficult.

568
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:50,438
We'll be hiring someone from outside.

569
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:59,273
Grandma, I'll visit you again soon.

570
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,972
I better earn some money as soon as possible.

571
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:07,302
Grandma.

572
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,846
Can you go easy on me this time?

573
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,609
Will you?

575
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,533
What do I do?

576
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,528
Grandma, I'll become a full-time teacher with this,

577
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:48,113
then treat you well.

578
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,533
Hello. Hello.

579
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,120
I'm sorry.

580
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:06,394
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

581
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,043
Are you in a good mood today, Ms. Son?

582
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,558
Not really.

583
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,488
Teaching kids is the most exciting thing on earth.

584
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,502
Have you gone crazy?

585
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,527
You were frowning just a few days ago.

586
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:19,739
Are you dating?

587
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,587
(60,000 dollars)

588
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:28,350
I'm not dating.

589
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,307
I've been a little sick these last few days.

590
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,779
You find teaching kids the most exciting?

591
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,354
You still need a bit more rest, I think.

592
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,511
(65,000 dollars)

593
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,600
No.

594
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,508
Thank you for your concern.

595
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:53,769
Young Min, Oh Young Min.

596
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,639
How can you bring down the average so much?

597
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,769
Just go to the SKY class, and study comfortably.

598
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,334
You're a nuisance to the other students.

599
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,089
You can leave.

600
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,039
Young Min, do you want to get counseling today?

601
00:47:15,189 --> 00:47:16,704
My doors are always open...

602
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:20,869
Young Min.

603
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,040
Oh Young Min.

604
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,428
Over here. Listen!

605
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:30,469
Everyone, focus.

606
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,669
Kim Myung Ho from the Administration Office...

607
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,239
took all the lunch meal plan money from the students...

608
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,927
and hasn't come to work since yesterday.

609
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,979
I just got the call.

610
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,202
What a terrible person.

611
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:47,449
I heard he took 10 cents from each person's lunch money.

612
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,289
I guess the rumor was true.

613
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,459
Gosh, I'm pretty sure he took more than 10 cents.

614
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,729
I can't even imagine how much he pocketed to himself.

615
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,588
If he took the school's money, doesn't that count...

616
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:58,158
as embezzlement and tax evasion?

617
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:00,999
I reported him to the police.

618
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,929
It won't be any good for the parents to find out.

619
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,368
So please all keep it a secret.

620
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:07,469
The students pay so much for tuition because this is a private school.

621
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,308
So it's absurd to keep this from the parents.

622
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:10,709
Gosh, I know that.

623
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,608
Mr. Park, you really need to bring it down a notch.

624
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:15,609
I want all of you to keep quiet. Now, go ahead and teach.

625
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,749
The kids will sense something if things seem unusual.

626
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,163
- Okay. - Okay.

627
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:20,588
My gosh.

628
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:23,246
Who in the world is the owner of this school?

629
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,039
The number you've dialed is not available now.

630
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,509
You will be directed to voicemail.

631
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,125
You will be directed to voicemail.

632
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:02,599
Ms. Son.

633
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,946
I really want to die.

634
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,729
I'm a GSG.

635
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,890
(I'm a GSG.)

636
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,767
It's an abbreviation for "A Guy who studies inside a glass booth".

637
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,090
That's why it's GSG.

638
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:18,378
In Seolsong High School, students who are in the top 30...

639
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:19,924
are called GSGs

640
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:22,773
because we're the only ones that are given glass booth study rooms.

641
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,148
At first, I enjoyed all the special benefits that we were getting.

642
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:28,388
But as my grades started to go down,

643
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:30,459
the thought of having to leave this class and getting discriminated...

644
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,288
like all the other peers has started to drive me crazy.

645
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,759
At Seolsong High School, we take tests every week,

646
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,173
and we get divided into different classes based on the results.

647
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:38,812
But with this week's test results,

648
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,685
I'll get kicked out of the IVY class.

649
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:42,969
But I'd rather die instead.

650
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,818
You think I'm crazy? Well, you're wrong.

651
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,566
The students at Seolsong High School would know how I feel.

652
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:49,509
I wouldn't have even thought like this...

653
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,155
if all the classes were divided fairly from the start.

654
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,498
It's the school that's crazy, not me.

655
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,123
I wish to report Seolsong High School.

656
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:59,106
Find Young Min. Find my son!

657
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:00,388
Who's the person in charge?

658
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:01,833
We have shocking news.

659
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:04,789
Oh Young Min, a sophomore...

660
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,459
at S High School, a prestigious private school,

661
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,929
suddenly disappeared after leaving a post on his social media page...

662
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,223
about the overly competitive system that exists in his school.

663
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,969
It turns out that S High School

664
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,128
divides students into different classes...

665
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:19,098
by making them take tests every single week.

666
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,509
Young Min expressed that as time went by,

667
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:25,578
the anxiety of being kicked out of the top one percent class...

668
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:28,236
started to eat him up and make him go crazy.

669
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:32,932
(Oh Young Min: Ms. Son, I want to die)

670
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:37,011
Ms. Son, I want to die.

671
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:40,888
I'm the one that wants to die.

672
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:42,358
My gosh, Ms. Son.

673
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:44,358
I'm really going to die. I'm being serious.

674
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:45,858
I'm being serious too.

675
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:47,429
Let's meet up. Let's die together.

676
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,480
Where are you now?

677
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,977
Did you really come here alone?

678
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,041
Yes.

679
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,815
What am I going to do now?

680
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,525
The answer is simple. You just need to die.

681
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,697
What? Die?

682
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,926
Why? You said you wanted to die.

683
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:31,378
Are you suddenly scared to die?

684
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,378
Yes.

685
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:34,703
Thank you for everything you've done for me until now.

686
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,194
I'll never forget...

687
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:39,744
how you supported me for the rest of my life.

688
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,682
We spent three years together.

689
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:45,670
And...

690
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:50,936
I feel like it's time for us to take the next step in life.

691
00:51:57,399 --> 00:51:59,239
Your boyfriend wishes to break up with you.

692
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,825
What a surprise!

693
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,520
What is this?

694
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,694
You startled me.

695
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,630
What kind of proposal is this?

696
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:11,392
Where's my boyfriend?

697
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,964
This is all because of you.

698
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,189
Things wouldn't have come this far...

699
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,776
if only you had listened to me back then.

700
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,818
Hey, I know I'm the school counselor.

701
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:21,647
But I honestly don't even know what's going through my own head.

702
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,947
Contract teacher don't get paid that much.

703
00:52:25,129 --> 00:52:26,211
I was told I'd get 100 dollars more...

704
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,115
if I worked as the counselor. That's why I took the job.

705
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,450
Where's...

706
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,281
my boyfriend?

707
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,247
Your boyfriend called our firm...

708
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,772
and asked us to break up with you on his behalf.

709
00:53:01,629 --> 00:53:05,134
Are... Are you breaking up with me on his behalf?

710
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,625
What are you doing?

711
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:14,119
Are you done eating?

712
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,608
Our ancestors were always right about everything.

713
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,578
They say, "Ghosts who die with a full stomach look better."

714
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:25,039
You look really great right now.

715
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,425
I guess we won't feel lonely since we're dying together, right?

716
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:31,417
Gosh, stop it.

717
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:32,970
It's not funny.

718
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:34,581
What do you mean?

719
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:36,339
You said you're going to die.

720
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,515
It won't take too long.

721
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:43,157
Once we jump,

722
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,327
our brains will react first.

723
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,348
Our bodies will get extremely anxious.

724
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:53,818
Then we'll suddenly be short of breath.

725
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:57,489
Our cell respiration will increase because we'll start struggling.

726
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,019
Then we'll suddenly be in urgent need of oxygen,

727
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,558
so we'll start breathing with our nose.

728
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,328
That's when the water enters our nose,

729
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:04,481
flows down our airway, and fills up our lungs.

730
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,257
Our organs will start to fail,

731
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,039
our heart rate will start to decrease,

732
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,199
and we'll become brain dead.

733
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,663
Then our hands will slowly start to fall down.

734
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,456
Stop it! Stop it, Ms. Son.

735
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:24,946
Don't worry. It'll end in three minutes.

736
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,449
You're even capable of sitting inside that glass booth...

737
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,148
for five hours straight.

738
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:31,634
So there's no need to be scared.

739
00:54:45,169 --> 00:54:46,179
Ms. Son.

740
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,760
I'm... I'm sorry.

741
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:50,624
Ms. Son, please don't die.

742
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,808
I'm sorry. I won't die.

743
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:57,677
No. I don't want to die. So please...

744
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,104
What does your dad do?

745
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:09,339
Pardon?

746
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,472
He's a businessman.

747
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,087
Listen to me carefully.

748
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,992
Use your parents. Go study abroad.

749
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:21,166
You won't be able to last in the IVY class for too long.

750
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:24,134
Where do you think will be best? The States? Australia?

751
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,608
Actually, Canada sounds nice.

752
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:27,871
I heard the school meals there are very eco-friendly.

753
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:30,930
I'll go study abroad.

754
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:35,219
I sacrificed myself and came all the way here just for you.

755
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,523
So live diligently thinking that you got a second chance in life.

756
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,168
And do you know what's more important than studying and money?

757
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,383
I'm sure there's something out there.

758
00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:54,756
And it's your job to look for it.

759
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,890
Is it coming from a pay phone?

760
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,521
Kim Myung Ho?

761
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,499
Ms. Son, I got you.

762
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,620
I got you, so get back up here.

763
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,039
Hey! Don't let go of my hand!

764
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,568
I can't swim!

765
00:56:27,569 --> 00:56:30,609
Just drop your phone and climb back up!

766
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,019
My gosh, what did you eat? You're so heavy.

767
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,918
Hey! Don't let go! Don't let go!

768
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:45,318
Hey! Young Min!

769
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,719
I can't believe I dated a jerk...

770
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,173
that can't even break up with me himself...

771
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:51,047
for three whole years.

772
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,759
Do you have anything you wish to say?

773
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,517
Hey! Don't let go!

774
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:57,041
Don't let go!

775
00:56:57,169 --> 00:56:58,816
Hurry up and climb back up.

776
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,635
You jerk. How can you do this to me?

777
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,277
Hey! Hey! Don't let go!

778
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,489
Don't let go! Hey! Oh Young Min!

779
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,918
Then I'll make a request too.

780
00:57:51,919 --> 00:57:53,131
You jerk.

781
00:57:55,089 --> 00:57:57,429
Gosh, someone is drowning!

782
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,116
- Goodness. - You're right.

783
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,717
What are you doing? Go save her!

784
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,124
You go save her. I don't do anything for free.

785
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,944
Gosh, they're all worried, but nobody is jumping in.

786
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:12,826
I'll pay you. How much do you...

787
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:14,062
500 dollars including dry cleaning.

788
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,260
What?

789
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Is the Han River Grade 2 or Grade 3 water?

790
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,100
Help me. Save me.

791
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,618
I can't die like this because of this stupid cellphone.

792
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,575
I don't want to die.

793
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,553
At a moment like this,

794
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:16,861
why am I seeing Kang Bok Su?

795
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:20,591
No way.

796
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,072
I can't believe Kang Bok Su came to mind...

797
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,592
at the final moment of my life.

798
01:00:03,089 --> 01:00:07,200
