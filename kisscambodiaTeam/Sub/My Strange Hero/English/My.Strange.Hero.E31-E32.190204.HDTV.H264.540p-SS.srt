1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,180
You've got something wrong.

2
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,899
- What is it? - I didn't manage...

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,313
Lim Se Gyeong's slush fund.

4
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,084
I did everything...

5
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,454
from the beginning.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,350
What?

7
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,438
All the corruption in Seolsong High School...

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,792
wasn't done by Lim Se Gyeong,

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,490
but it was done...

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,998
by me.

11
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:39,359
Let me go!

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,049
I have something to say.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,232
Let go of me!

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,470
Hey, Se Ho!

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,780
Let go. Let me go!

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,269
I said, let go!

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,269
Bok Su, why are you doing this?

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,168
Were you lying that you're responsible for the corruption?

19
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,289
Please.

20
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,079
It has nothing to do with you.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,635
So you're taking all the responsibility?

22
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,018
This is the best I can do.

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,433
You selfish idiot!

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,648
The only thing you care about is yourself.

25
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,328
That's not taking responsibility.

26
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,459
You're just worsening the situation.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,158
Is it your priority to make illegal deals with your mom...

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,948
and prevent the school from closing down?

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,383
What about the school?

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,960
It'll go into your mom's hands again.

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,539
You tried to protect Seolsong High.

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,296
Wasn't that why you gave me the documents?

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,938
That's not how you take responsibility.

34
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,818
You can't protect yourself nor the school with lies.

35
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,940
Wake up, Se Ho.

36
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:53,159
Kang Bok Su, he already confessed...

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,724
that he's the main culprit of Seolsong High's corruptions.

38
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,913
It wasn't Se Ho.

39
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,999
Your testimony has no power at this moment.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,068
It was Se Ho who forwarded me the documents...

41
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,120
to show where the embezzled funds went.

42
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,062
If you need me to, I can prove it.

43
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,350
Se Ho...

44
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,099
isn't the main culprit of this corruption.

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,190
He's the whistleblower.

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,112
Did you make a false testimony?

47
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,045
What Bok Su said is true.

48
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,294
Can you tell me about what Bok Su said earlier?

49
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,832

Is it true that Board Chairman Oh Se Ho led this corruption?

for my son's wrongdoings.

to the Prosecution so that he'll be punished severely.

In addition,

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,468
I believe I'm to blame.

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,066
It pains me so much,

74
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,732
but I'll give up on Seolsong High School...

How can they pass the closure of Seolsong High?

80

81
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,748
How can an organization that manages education...

82
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,849
cause such a damage to the students?

83

84

must be penalized severely.

85
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,248

- Yes, sir. - Hold on.

89

I'm telling you, closing it is not the answer.

90

Why must innocent kids be kicked out of the school...

91
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,598

110

isn't a company you buy and sell with money.

138

this is how you ruined the name of the school.

139

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,868

No, there's nothing different.

154
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,785
They both look good on the outside,

155
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,018
but they're broken inside.

156
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,169
Ms. Lim Se Gyeong. Both Seolsong High School...

157

Please don't kick us out!

171

The Education Office already gave us their authorization.

00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,079
and request a screening on the validity of your arrest.

183
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,628
I'm pretty sure I made it clear that my son was the one...

184
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,169
who committed all those crimes, not me.

185
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,528
Your son changed his testimony...

186
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,169
and testified that you're the one who committed the irregularities.

187
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,280
What did you just say?

188
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,138
Bok Su, you did this, didn't you? You're the one...

189
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,250
Ms. Lim.

190
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,169
No one's on your side now.

191
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,119
Chairwoman Lim.

192
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,842
What needs to be gone isn't this school.

193
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,532
It's you.

194
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:29,899
Arrest her.

195
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,858
No, it wasn't me.

196
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,758
Let me go. Let me go!

197
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,998
Let go of me. This is my school. It's my school!

198
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,429
I dedicated my entire life on this school!

199
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,599
It's my school!

200
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,069
Who says you can do this to me?

201
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,069
Who do you think you guys are?

202
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,669
You useless little punks.

203
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,295
I won't forgive you for this. I will never forgive you!

204
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,490
Ms. Lim.

205
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,232
I'm not the one who'll be judging you.

206
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,837
You'll be judged by the viewers.

207
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,330
Goodbye.

208
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,560
You...

209
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:05,499
No.

210
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,658
- No, this can't be happening. - Let's go.

211
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,398
No! Let me go!

212
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,099
I said, let me go! Let go of me!

213
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,110
Let me go!

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,057
I said, let me go!

215
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,593
Who do you think you guys are?

216
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,349
You useless little punks.

217
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,278
I won't forgive you for this. I will never forgive you!

218
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,349
Not bad.

219
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,360
Ms. Lim.

220
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,988
(Shocking: Lim Se Gyeong reveals her true self.)

221
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:38,319
My gosh. The Blue House? A national petition?

222
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,189
Gosh, this is incredible.

223
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,876
It really is.

224
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,949
(Video of Chairwoman Lim abusing her power)

225
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,878
Did you guys see the inspectors hesitate...

226
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,978
after hearing my passionate speech?

227
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,679
It's because they couldn't dare to do anything...

228
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,349
after seeing my beautiful eyes.

229
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,693
Cut the nonsense.

230
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,179
This is what got them intimidated.

231
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,988
We were really impressive. You guys know that, right?

232
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,618
If I could do things my way, I would've thrown trash on her.

233
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:12,158
No, using flowers was a good idea. It looks nicer.

234
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,459
But do you think things will change...

235
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,758
just because the chairwoman got arrested?

236
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,199
You guys! Look at this!

237
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,512
(National Petition: Please stop Seolsong High from closing down.)

238
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,398
- "National petition"? - Really?

239
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,409
200,000 people?

240
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:22,749
My gosh.

241
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,858
Chairwoman Lim of Seolsong High became arrested this morning...

242
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,898
for having violated the Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes...

243
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,429
by committing...

244
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,228
embezzlement and bribery.

245
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,039
During the process of the investigation,

246
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,868
she perjured herself by blaming everything...

247
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,809
on former Chairman Oh Se Ho, her son,

248
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,920
which is causing an uproar among the public.

249
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,938
- Give me that. I'll do it. - Okay.

250
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,233
My gosh.

251
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,000
Mom.

252
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,353
Ms. Son. Come over here!

253
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,850
- What is it? - What?

254
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,699
More than a million people...

255
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,831
have signed the national petition uploaded on the Blue House website.

256
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,738
The Education Office accepted the petition...

257
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:36,314
and decided to cancel the abolishment of Seolsong High School.

258
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,108
Seolsong High will begin by firing all the teachers...

259
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,579
that got a full-time job through bribery,

260
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,148
and it will be temporarily managed by the Education Office.

261
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:46,589
After the irregularities that happened in Seolsong High,

262
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,559
a lot of people are saying the government should revise the law...

263
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,689
to reduce the authority that private school foundations have...

264
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,789
over the schools they own.

265
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,900
Let's move onto the next news.

266
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:23,109
(Seolsong High School)

267
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,853
I heard you'll be going abroad to study again.

268
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:08,879
Yes.

269
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,710
That is, if you agree to do me a favor.

270
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,050
What is it?

271
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,320
Mr. Park.

272
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,874
Can you become the principal of Seolsong High School?

273
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,008
Se Ho.

274
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,089
I just started a new career.

275
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,729
The school went into receivership,

276
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,880
so it will be temporarily managed by the directors.

277
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,723
Being a teacher suits you.

278
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,790
A teacher that stands by his students.

279
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,339
I want you to take care of and lead Seolsong High School...

280
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,107
so that it can become a better school.

281
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,698
You said you wanted to help me.

282
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,687
Hey! Hey!

283
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,439
Se Ho.

284
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,655
Are you running away again?

285
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,223
You coward.

286
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,632
I wanted to...

287
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,888
get on my knees if I meet you again.

288
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,365
They why don't you?

289
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,035
You're always just talk.

290
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,531
But doing that...

291
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:41,056
won't be able to give back all the years you've lost.

292
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:42,139
At least you know that.

293
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,754
I did things I can't ever take back,

294
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,016
and I don't want...

295
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,990
to make myself feel better just by apologizing.

296
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,004
You can just hate and resent me, Bok Su.

297
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,409
Hey, is that really all you have to say?

298
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,118
Aren't you going to explain why you did all that stuff to me?

299
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,249
I thought about it millions of times,

300
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,319
but I still don't get why you did all that stuff to me.

301
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,905
I wanted to become like you.

302
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,052
- What? - I envied you.

303
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,710
And because I envied you,

304
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,110
I hated you.

305
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,397
Every time I looked at you, I felt so pathetic.

306
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,779
You did nothing wrong.

307
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,698
I was just a huge jerk.

308
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:33,894
I did so many...

309
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,537
bad things to you until now.

310
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,801
I'm...

311
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:42,899
so sorry.

312
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,130
Se Ho.

313
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,559
I'd beat you to a pulp...

314
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,968
considering how angry I am at you.

315
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,698
But like you said,

316
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:58,002
that won't compensate for all the years I've lost.

317
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:02,474
I really can't forgive you.

318
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,649
But...

319
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,523
you should forgive yourself.

320
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,043
You're the only one who knows how painful and miserable...

321
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:17,533
you were.

322
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:24,179
This is a quote by Rosenberg.

323
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,317
"No one is evil in this world."

324
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,817
"There are just those who are lonely."

325
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,898
Let me say this one more time.

326
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,969
I can never forgive you.

327
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,350
Go.

328
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,090
Get lost.

329
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:41,977
I'm not going to care if you live a happy life or not.

330
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,260
Go.

331
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,408
- Mr. Ma, my orders yesterday... - Yes.

332
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,581
I'm Park Dong Jun, Seolsong's new principal.

333
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,108
You preserved your school on your own initiative.

334
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,705
Well done and thank you.

335
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,019
Because of the erroneous behavior of adults,

336
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,555
you must've been hurt and had a hard time.

337
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,001
I'd like to apologize on behalf of everyone.

338
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,097
Seolsong will change from now on.

339
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,099
All equipment, including the glass booths...

340
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,372
will be used fairly by drawing lots.

341
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:44,436
School meals will be the same for everyone.

342
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,678
I will listen to the voice of the students...

343
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,276
to create a school for the students...

344
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:57,752
that cares for what they want, even in the smallest details.

345
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,075
I will do my best to create a school that is gradually...

346
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,752
transformed by the students themselves.

347
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:07,980
Everyone,

348
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:10,449
I love you.

349
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,463
I was waiting for you.

350
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,012
- Are you okay? - How can I be okay?

351
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,409
It's so uncomfortable I can't bear it.

352
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,310
So,

353
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,613
tell me your plan.

354
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,110
My plan?

355
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,660
You can't just keep me here.

356
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,320
No plans?

357
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,807
That's okay. I have an idea.

358
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,678
There's a congressman you should meet. Go to him and...

359
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,498
I have no intentions to help you.

360
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,229
Oh Se Ho.

361
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,529
My plan is to make Seolsong a public school.

362
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,601
So it won't...

363
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:11,024
be controlled any longer by the wrong person.

364
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,813
Are you in your right mind?

365
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,650
Yes.

366
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,517
I'm finally in my right mind.

367
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,629
I hope your time in there cures you.

368
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,309
I'll be back when you're done with the sentence.

369
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,249
I'm going to leave home as you told me to.

370
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,502
Se Ho, that's...

371
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,911
The situation is different from then, isn't it?

372
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,352
- Goodbye. - Se Ho. Se Ho!

373
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,429
Se Ho, come back! Come back!

374
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,216
- Let go. - Calm down.

375
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,729
Do you know who I am?

376
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,053
Let me go!

377
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,314
Congratulations, Kang Bok Su.

378
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,543
You made it.

379
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,860
I didn't know I'd come this far.

380
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,350
But I feel relieved.

381
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,538
You know what? I think I'm too good for you.

382
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,878
What?

383
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:33,678
You're so nosy.

384
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,279
You're the oldest delivery boy in Korea.

385
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,019
You're amazingly dumb, with a scary sister.

386
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,678
How about you? You eat five yogurts in a row.

387
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,049
You finish four portions of meat.

388
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,402
You're strong and you swear all the time.

389
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,559
Hey, I eat well so I don't get sick easily.

390
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,259
I'm strong so I don't act all weak.

391
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,128
I'm good at swearing so I don't get intimidated.

392
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,200
Isn't that nice?

393
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,698
That's really persuasive. And attractive.

394
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,059
Whatever. I don't know.

395
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,090
Right? Am I not too good for you?

396
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,999
No one else would date you.

397
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,269
Do you know how hard it is to date someone like you?

398
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,509
Your leadership attracts everyone.

399
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,239
You have such a passionate heart...

400
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,739
that makes people around you feel warm.

401
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,708
You're so upright that people love you...

402
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:07,861
and I get worried.

403
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,640
You're no good, you know that?

404
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,363
Why are you confusing me?

405
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,008
Complimenting you makes me shy.

406
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,152
What do you want to compliment in particular?

407
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,255
For coming back to me.

408
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:31,798
Thanks, Bok Su, for coming back to me.

409
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:03,208
(Final Episode will air shortly.)

410
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:08,048
(Final episode)

411
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:09,513
(Seolsong High School 32nd Graduation Ceremony)

412
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:12,383
(One year later)

413
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:26,784
Okay.

414
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:29,023
I'm Kang Bok Su,

415
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:30,356
speaking on behalf of the graduates.

416
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:34,333
- Bok Su! - You're so cool.

417
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:36,684
Everyone,

418
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:41,686
I'm graduating...

419
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:43,595
in 10 years.

420
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,883
As you may know,

421
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:47,824
I was kicked out of school...

422
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:49,845
and came back after meeting my first love.

423
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,135
Also,

424
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,507
with all of you...

425
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:56,587
we protected this school.

426
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:01,915
You've been with me during those times.

427
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:06,780
Seolsong also stays in my memory.

428
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:12,313
I'm so very happy that I could...

429
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:16,052
share those memories with you.

430
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:21,294
You're going out into the harsh world now.

431
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,992
To tell you as someone who went ahead of you,

432
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:26,517
making a living is hard.

433
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:29,618
If you live carelessly, you'll be ruined.

434
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,349
Life is the real thing.

435
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,473
Put your guards down and you're finished.

436
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:36,733
That's how life is.

437
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:40,078
Life is like walking on thin ice. But still,

438
00:28:40,515 --> 00:28:43,949
I want to tell you it's worth living.

439
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:46,056
Because...

440
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:49,082
there's always someone next to you...

441
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:51,100
watching and trusting you.

442
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:57,452
Even if just one person, that one person is there for you.

443
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:02,069
That's why you shouldn't give up...

444
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:04,615
on life.

445
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:17,019
I'll finish with a famous saying.

446
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,807
K Revenge once said this.

447
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:23,380
Whatever you do, wherever you are,

448
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:27,186
you deserve to be loved.

449
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:33,063
That was from the oldest returning student...

450
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:34,449
and the oldest graduate...

451
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,105
Kang Bok Su.

452
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:40,647
Well done.

453
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:50,468
(Seolsong High School 32nd Graduation Ceremony)

454
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:04,006
K Revenge?

455
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:05,734
That's Kang Bok Su.

456
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,584
Mom!

457
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,171
Hey!

458
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:29,824
Goodness.

459
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,873
Good job, my son.

460
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,480
Mom, here's a present for you.

461
00:30:36,824 --> 00:30:38,007
Ta-da.

462
00:30:44,504 --> 00:30:47,504
(Certification of Graduation)

463
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:49,704
Mom, I'm a good son, right?

464
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:52,098
Yes, you're a good son.

465
00:30:52,705 --> 00:30:54,813
You showed me that you didn't give up.

466
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:56,128
You're the best son there is.

467
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:58,244
How embarrassing!

468
00:30:58,245 --> 00:30:59,744
You're graduating after 10 years.

469
00:30:59,745 --> 00:31:01,984
It's hardly something to be proud of.

470
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,500
Why did they make you give a speech?

471
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:15,205
What is it?

472
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:18,176
My son.

473
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:19,717
What is it?

474
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:23,205
Mom, my son is the best son.

475
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:27,143
You got in. My In Ho got accepted...

476
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:28,943
to a college!

477
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:29,985
Really?

478
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:31,844
Really? I got in?

479
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:33,875
- Gosh, gosh. - Congratulations!

480
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:40,300
- In Ho! - By the way,

481
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:43,224
it wouldn't have been possible without Soo Jeong's help.

482
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:44,224
I agree.

483
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:46,393
That's why I'll go to your wedding.

484
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:47,546
That's a given.

485
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:51,253
- In Ho. - I'm so proud.

486
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:56,408
- Hey. Congratulations. Good work. - Mr. Park.

487
00:31:56,904 --> 00:31:58,864
Ma'am, you went through a lot.

488
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:01,174
This is all thanks to you.

489
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:02,427
Thank you.

490
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:03,984
Not at all.

491
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,561
Bok Su worked hard.

492
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,269
Give me your camera. I'll take a picture for you.

493
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:11,049
- What about you? - It's okay.

494
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:13,023
Let's take it together.

495
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,893
- It's a family occasion. - Let's take it together.

496
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:16,924
- It's okay. - Come on, take it with us.

497
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,994
- Take it with us. - Gather.

498
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:20,164
I'm okay.

499
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,594
- Mr. Park! - Gosh.

500
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:22,934
Hello, Mr. Park.

501
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:25,263
I'll take the picture.

502

- Will you? - Yes.

503
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:27,315
Okay, then.

504
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:30,763
All right, here we go.

505
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:33,839
You two look good together.

506
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,474
Okay, here we go.

507
00:32:36,475 --> 00:32:37,656
Please pose.

508
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:40,064

510
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,133
Hey, Soo Jeong.

511
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:04,023
How do I look? Does the uniform still suit me?

512
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:08,762
It totally suits you.

513
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:10,594
Let's go.

514
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:14,281
- Where? - We should have our own graduation.

515
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:28,035
What's wrong?

516
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,316
Those brats...

517
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:56,867
It used to be a piece of cake.

518
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:06,047
My knees... Gosh.

519
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:09,376
My back hurts.

520
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:11,824
My whole body hurts.

521
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,375
Gosh.

522
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm still okay though.

523
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,429
My pants are too tight.

524
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:23,726
- You punk. - What is this?

525
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:25,083
- You! - What?

526
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,184
How can you be late as a student teacher?

527
00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:29,583
You're a principal. Aren't you busy?

528
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,924
A principal has a lot of free time.

529
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:35,294
Why would a principal follow around someone like me?

530
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:37,314
You're still talking big.

531
00:35:37,495 --> 00:35:40,194
If you're late, then what about your students?

532
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:41,864
- What will they learn from you? - They're going to see us.

534
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,277
Mr. Park!

Mr. Park!

536
00:35:47,504 --> 00:35:49,696
Mr. Park. There you are.

537
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,593
There you are.

538
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:55,903
Mr. Kang, were you late again today?

539
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,806
What is it?

540
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:02,524
Ta-da.

541
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:05,276
I brought you some herbal tonics.

542
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:08,554
This is effective if you have it before a meal.

543
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:12,218
You can have it. I'm all right.

544
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:13,476
Hurry up and go to class.

545
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:16,605
I'll get going too.

546
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,991
This is really expensive.

547
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:25,859
Only if you weren't around...

548
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:30,370
Until then, I'll take care of my own health.

549
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:35,695
It's so bitter!

Hey, what are you doing outside?

552
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,224
Hey, are you here?

553
00:36:47,225 --> 00:36:48,594
This isn't a good time.

554
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:49,706
Let's go in later.

555
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:50,814
Why?

556
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:53,064
Why do you think? Didn't you hear the news?

557
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,528
Mr. Kim went on a blind date, but he was dumped.

558
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:57,543
He's yelling at every teacher.

559
00:36:57,544 --> 00:36:58,604
It's a mess.

560
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:01,574
I'm not scolding you for wearing jeans.

561
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:03,844
It's just that these...

562
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:06,714
I told him he should pay more attention to his clothes.

563
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:09,753
Of course no woman likes him when he wears hanbok.

564
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:12,512
I told him to wear jeans, but he's wearing hanbok again.

565
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:16,454
Was it you? Were you the one who advised him to wear jeans?

566
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:17,505
Yes.

567
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:20,793
He got dumped because she thought jeans were too casual.

568
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:22,178
Really?

569
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,216
Got it?

570
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:27,773
- Come here. - He's coming!

571
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:28,886

572
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:30,334
Come here!

573
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,890
Run! Run!

574
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:36,374
Come here. Come here, Bok Su!

575
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:43,086
The view you have in your seat will all be different.

576
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:48,088
Draw what you see as it is.

577
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:50,748
This isn't a test, so don't peek at other people's work.

578
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:54,763
Mr. Kang, do we have to draw him?

579
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:56,444
Hey, watch it.

580
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:00,974
I made an official request, and already paid you too.

581
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:03,273
Mr. Kang, can you be our model?

582
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:05,467
Then we'll be able to focus a lot better.

583
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:06,744
No.

584
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,344
I know that my face makes you burn with passion...

585
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:11,172
for the arts and is valuable as a drawing, but no.

586
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:13,061
Mr. Kang, do you have a girlfriend?

587
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:16,880
It wouldn't make sense not to have one with this face.

588
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:20,403
Mr. Kang, is your girlfriend pretty?

589
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:21,665
Yes.

590
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:23,508
Very much.

591
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:24,836
No way.

00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:43,628
Next.

595
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,206
That's right.

596
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:56,513
This is my third try.

597
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:00,444
Who on earth said...

598
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:02,494
"failure is a mother of success"?

599
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:05,704
After failing three times in the final screening,

600
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,903
I want to tell people to stop comforting me...

601
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:09,520
with such quotes.

602
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:13,104
To be honest, I'm really upset.

603
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:14,474
If I don't make it again,

604
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:16,574
I'm too embarrassed to see my boyfriend,

605
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:19,043
and I don't dare to see his nephew.

606
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:21,854
I used to make fun of them and call them stupid.

607
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:24,350
This time, I'm the one that's stupid.

608
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:26,523
So please,

609
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:28,443
won't you let me pass?

610
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,516
This is my third time seeing you this year.

611
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:35,391
You must know very well why you keep on failing.

612
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:37,663
You stepped down from a private school...

613
00:39:37,664 --> 00:39:39,433
for being a corrupt teacher.

614
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:40,919
Then you must all already know...

615
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:43,424
how I ended up quitting.

616
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:44,889
You're like Joan of Arc...

617
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,974
who blew the whistle on the school.

618
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:49,814
Yes. It's true I was a corrupt teacher.

619
00:39:49,815 --> 00:39:51,804
I really wanted to become a teacher,

620
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:54,354
so I chose to do something I shouldn't have.

621
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:55,354
Exactly.

622
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:59,091
What is the reason why you want to become a teacher so badly?

623
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:04,385
The school I used to work at...

624
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:08,797
boasted about the discriminatory system they had.

625
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:11,133
They classified and discriminated students...

626
00:40:11,134 --> 00:40:12,983
according to their grades.

627
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:16,432
The class I was in charge of...

628
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:19,876
was Wildflower Class, a class of students with the lowest grades.

629
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:29,865
Hey, intern.

630
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:30,995
Yes?

631
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,670
- I want these photocopied. - Yes, sir.

632
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:34,365
No, wait.

633
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:35,534
Here.

634
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:37,335
Use reusable paper.

In Ho.

637
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:46,033
Once you launch the app you're developing,

638
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:48,533
you're going to have to start paying the monthly rent.

639
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:51,503
That's the limit to how merciful I can be as the CEO.

640
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:53,596
Gyeong Hyeon, if this becomes a huge hit,

641
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:55,588
I'll give you some shares.

642
00:40:58,684 --> 00:41:00,058
Write up a contract and sign it.

643
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:04,662
The school labeled them as hopeless students,

644
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,383
but the more they got stomped on,

645
00:41:06,384 --> 00:41:09,182
the more they tried to prove that the school was wrong.

646
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:12,415
That was their strength.

647
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:15,516
Although, they didn't seem to know that very well.

648
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:19,763
The faith they had in themselves and other people's support...

649
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:22,229
were enough to keep those kids going without giving up.

650
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:25,676
At times, it seemed like they had given up on their future.

651
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:30,214
But they were actually very passionate about lives.

652
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:31,527
Your Honor.

653
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:35,013
The defendant has committed an unforgivable crime,

654
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:37,084
but she keeps making excuses and blames it on others...

655
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:38,383
instead of showing any signs of self-reflection.

656
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:41,923
I request the atrocious defendant to get sentenced to life imprisonment.

657
00:41:41,924 --> 00:41:45,293
The defendant suffered from domestic violence for a long time.

658
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,834
I'm sure no one would've been able to hold their anger...

659
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:51,360
if they saw a little child getting abused just like she did.

660
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:56,074
The school was about to force...

661
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:59,503
those kids to transfer schools just because they got bad grades.

662
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:01,513
But I witnessed how they eventually managed...

663
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:04,069
to protect their friends and school at the same time.

664
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:07,072
Seeing those kids grow...

665
00:42:07,715 --> 00:42:10,381
enabled me to grow as well.

666
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:14,124
Yes, okay. That is a nice story.

667
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,824
But this is a very serious issue.

668
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:21,094
I really feel like I can be a good teacher this time.

669
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:23,834
I think I know what I need to teach the kids...

670
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:27,604
aside from all the things that are written in textbooks.

671
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:28,644
So can you please...

672
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,104
let me become a teacher...

673
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:34,306
and give me a chance to make up for the mistake I made?

674
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,530
Please.

675
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:40,055

676
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:42,883
If you fail to pass this year,

677
00:42:42,884 --> 00:42:45,248
are you going to take the test again next year?

678
00:42:45,684 --> 00:42:49,793
Yes. As long as I have money to pay for the application,

679
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:51,324
I'm going to keep trying.

680
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:54,163
I told my students never to give up.

681
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:56,558
So I'm not going to be a coward...

682
00:42:56,835 --> 00:42:59,187

00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:21,733
You must've been through a lot.

725
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,274
You did great. Good job.

726
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:26,673
Ms. Son truly deserves to be a teacher.

727
00:46:26,674 --> 00:46:28,344
Thanks to her, In Ho got accepted to a college.

728
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:30,314
Isn't that enough to prove that she's a good teacher?

729
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:32,544
It's a miracle. She made a miracle happen...

730
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:34,514
because she's dating a guy who also makes miracles.

731
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:35,983
Aunt, congratulations.

732
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:38,354
I know how hard you studied to get accepted.

733
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:40,284
- Thanks. - Great job.

734
00:46:40,285 --> 00:46:42,678
You did great. I'm so proud of you.

735
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:44,914
- Ms. Son. - Ms. Son.

736
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:46,723
Ms. Son.

737
00:46:46,724 --> 00:46:47,946
(Soo Jeong is the best!)

738
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:50,457
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

739
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:52,983
Where's my cake? Did you not get any cake?

740
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:57,144
You forgot?

741
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,304
What kind of a lame celebration party is this?

742
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,454
What about a gift?

743
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:02,956
You didn't even get me a gift?

744
00:47:05,585 --> 00:47:09,453
Is this seriously how you're going to congratulate your teacher?

745
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:12,423
Is this how I taught you? What a bunch of rude punks.

746
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:16,193
Our baby should only hear and see good things.

747
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:17,393
- Okay? - Okay.

748
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:19,587
Then I should always be looking at you.

749
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,776
You're so cute.

750
00:47:23,765 --> 00:47:25,334
Ms. Jang, how long has it been?

751
00:47:25,335 --> 00:47:27,034
I'm eight months pregnant.

752
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:28,874
I got an ultrasound, and our baby's really handsome...

753
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,419
because he takes after Young Jun.

754
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:33,287
(Congratulations on passing the test!)

755
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:37,314
So Ra, I noticed that your online novel is really popular.

756
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,983
"My Boyfriend Came Back to School".

757
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:40,913
Yes, that's the one. You know...

758
00:47:40,914 --> 00:47:43,114
that it's about you and Bok Su, right?

759
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:44,584
Are you serious?

760
00:47:44,585 --> 00:47:46,723
Yes, I'm currently shooting a web drama with the storyline.

761
00:47:46,724 --> 00:47:48,993
I'm the director, and So Ra will be writing and acting at the same time.

762
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,324
Is there a kissing scene?

763
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,923
Yes, there's a scene where the two of them secretly kiss each other...

764
00:47:51,924 --> 00:47:53,524
behind the classroom door.

765
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:55,211
Hey, get rid of that scene.

766
00:47:55,335 --> 00:47:58,032
What are you talking about? That's the most important scene.

767
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:00,534
What kind of situation is this?

768
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:02,004
Jae Yoon asked So Ra out, but he got rejected.

769
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,601
- Hey! What's your problem? - Really?

770
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:07,344
You should ask her out again.

771
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:09,443
- Did you hear that? - No, I don't even like your hair.

772
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:10,454
I got rejected again.

773
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:20,913
(Soo Jeong did it again!)

774
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:37,815
Bok Su.

775
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:45,708
(We're getting married. 11am on Tuesday, September 12, 2023.)

776
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:50,764
Hey, are you really sure about this?

777
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:53,502
Life is a marathon.

778
00:48:57,045 --> 00:49:00,105
(Gyeong Hyeon and Min Ji are getting married.)

779
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:07,593
Hey, this is a quote by Socrates.

780
00:49:07,785 --> 00:49:09,923
"If you get a good wife, you'll become happy."

781
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:12,722
"If you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher."

782
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:16,024
Are you sure you won't regret this?

783
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:17,782
Are you really going to marry her?

784
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:21,133
No way. I'm not going to marry him.

785
00:49:21,134 --> 00:49:23,964
You even printed the wedding invitations. You can't take it back.

786
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:25,574
He didn't even propose to me.

787
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:27,757
If you were in my shoes, would you get married like this?

788
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:30,521
He didn't even propose?

789
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:33,443
Hey, don't get married. You should just cancel everything.

790
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:35,214
Just live by yourself.

791
00:49:35,215 --> 00:49:36,801
Why bother to get married?

792
00:49:36,985 --> 00:49:40,145
That doesn't mean you have to tell me to live by myself.

793
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:44,882
Anyway, I won't marry.

794
00:49:46,894 --> 00:49:48,863
Hey, Gyeong Hyeon. I won't marry you, okay?

795
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:49,874
I'm just letting you know.

796
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:56,234
Do you see that? You should also say no to this marriage.

797
00:49:56,235 --> 00:49:59,608
Min Ji can be both cold and warm.

798
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:01,504
She's cold for three days...

799
00:50:01,505 --> 00:50:02,918
but warm for the remaining four.

800
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,329
Today's the third day,

801
00:50:08,785 --> 00:50:10,330
so she'll be warm to me tomorrow.

802
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:11,865
This is what you call love.

803
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,429
That's true love.

804
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:39,394
You never called me once.

805
00:50:40,315 --> 00:50:42,234
Why are you here all of a sudden?

806
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:44,658
I needed some time.

807
00:50:46,154 --> 00:50:47,194
Time for what?

808
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:52,252
To accept the fact that you're my mother...

809
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:55,078
and forgive you.

810
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,337
I needed time.

811
00:50:57,825 --> 00:50:58,874
Forgive?

812
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,048
You forgive me?

813
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:04,588
You should beg me for forgiveness.

814
00:51:05,505 --> 00:51:06,545
Mother.

815
00:51:09,545 --> 00:51:10,989
Someday,

816
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:13,527
you'll be able to change.

817
00:51:16,914 --> 00:51:18,353
Just as I've changed.

818
00:51:18,354 --> 00:51:19,496
Did you change?

819
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:23,346
I heard your business is doing well in America.

820
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,610
Do you think you're all that?

821
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:28,550
It doesn't hurt anymore when I see you.

822
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:31,807
That means I've changed.

823
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:37,475
Mother.

824
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:40,086
I'll hope...

825
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:43,398
that even you can change someday.

826
00:51:46,174 --> 00:51:47,559
Just like a friend of mine...

827
00:51:48,785 --> 00:51:50,229
trusted me in the past.

828
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:55,336
I'll wait.

829
00:52:20,844 --> 00:52:21,854
Where are you?

830
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:23,394
I'm at school.

831
00:52:24,285 --> 00:52:26,678
Me too. To pick you up.

832
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:49,865
Soo Jeong.

833
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:53,247
You look good when you're at school.

834
00:55:54,154 --> 00:55:56,993
Of course. You're the one who helped make my dream come true.

835
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,823
I'm an amazing boyfriend, right?

836
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:03,831
Yes. So I thought about it.

837
00:56:03,934 --> 00:56:06,459
And I've already decided on what I want to be next.

838
00:56:06,735 --> 00:56:08,461
What is it?

839
00:56:09,944 --> 00:56:12,701
The wife of Kang Bok Su.

840
00:56:34,495 --> 00:56:41,978
(Traditional black and white photography studio)

841
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,856
Anyway, what are you celebrating?

842
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:11,645
- Graduation. - Graduation.

843
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:23,611
Okay, here we go. Look at the camera.

844
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:25,503
1, 2, 3.

845
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,776
Good, once more. Show me a big smile.

846
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:32,944
1, 2, 3.

847
00:57:48,305 --> 00:57:54,375
