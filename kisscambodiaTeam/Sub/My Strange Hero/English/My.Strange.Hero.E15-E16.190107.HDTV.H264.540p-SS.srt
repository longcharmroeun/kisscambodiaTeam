00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,819
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,890
Where did Bok Su go? Where is he?

3
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:13,759
You guys planned this to ditch me, didn't you?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,068
No, we didn't.

5
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:18,429
You saw them running away.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,538
Let's just go back to Seoul.

7
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,538
We checked pretty much everywhere.

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,549
Hey.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,940
How can we leave Bok Su and Soo Jeong here together?

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,725
They couldn't have gone far.

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,766
A place to date...

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,221
Gosh, that's the last place we'll go, okay?

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,619
Or else I'll go back to Seoul alone.

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,440
Bok Su...

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,658
What? Are they not here?

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,789
Come here.

17
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,328
Well, what was...

18
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:25,768
Bok Su doing in a public place?

19
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,688
Soo Jeong's a teacher. She should know better.

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,150
Are you crying?

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,209
Yes, go ahead and cry.

22
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,521
Cry all you want.

23
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:39,345
I'll go get some tissue from the car.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,561
That's...

25
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,403
100 percent wool.

26
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,208
Don't blow your nose on it.

27
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,480
Gosh.

28
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:32,011
This is crazy.

29
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,052
Min Ji.

30
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,775
He's CEO, not Bok Su.

31
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,096
Was I too shocked?

32
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,872
Do you... Do you feel uncomfortable?

33
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,915
It feels stuffy here.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,939
I think so too. Maybe the air is scarce in here.

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,526
- Should I open the window? - Yes.

36
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,890
It's cold.

37
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:21,387
Well... We... Should we get going?

38
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:22,500
Okay.

39
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,418
Then you should wear the seat belt. I'll...

40
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,804
No, it's okay.

41
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,302
I'll do it.

42
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,243
Hey, what are you doing?

43
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,939
Driving with one hand is dangerous.

44
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,262
Don't worry. I'm the best dresser.

45
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,626
You mean "best driver".

46
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,851
Whatever.

47
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,350
We're here.

48
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:56,860
You should go.

49
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,593
I should paint the gate again.

50
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,441
So...

51
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,594
Are we a couple starting today?

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,999
What?

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,038
Then how about starting tomorrow?

54
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,686
Hey, I'm your teacher.

55
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,195
Good night, Ms. Son.

56
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,392
Dream of me.

57
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,993
Bok Su.

58
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,961
Bye.

59
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:53,480
Hey, Se Ho.

60
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:56,169
I'll ask you something since you're the second smartest here.

61
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,968
- Who's the smartest then? - Soo Jeong, you idiot.

62
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:00,928
Hey, do you have any good idea for a surprise?

63
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,679
I can barely see her smile.

64
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,569
She's pretty but she doesn't smile.

65
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,431
Study.

66
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,944
So I prepared something.

67
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,280
Will this do?

68
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,025
I think she will smile if you give her something that she needs.

69
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,768
Something she needs?

70
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,163
Wait, then should I give her snacks?

71
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,809
- Let me see. - Hey! Don't touch it.

72
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,769
- Let me see. - Study you idiot!

73
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,780
(Concept summary)

74
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,208
- What is this? - I had difficulty with that part.

75
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,038
So my private tutor summarized it for me.

76
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,433
Study with that, I have my own.

77
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,059
Why would you give this to me?

78
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,646
You paid for your tutor.

79
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,514
I can't just take the credit.

80
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,369
Don't you know competition in good faith?

81
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,299
It feels like I'm cheating.

82
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,037
You can have that, because I'm going to defeat you this time.

83
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,431
I don't know about that. That's not going to happen.

84
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,504
Thank you anyway.

85
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:49,431
Thank you, I really am.

86
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,212
You should go now.

87
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,409
By wearing that school uniform, does he think that he's an 18-year-old?

88
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,712
What's with that kiss on the cheek at the age of 27?

89
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,248
It's not good enough. Not impressive.

90
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,858
This is insane, Son Soo Jeong. Get it together!

91
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,243
You are Kang Bok Su's teacher.

92
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,470
Son.

93
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,851
Are you studying again?

94
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,707
Good boy. You should study tenaciously to take the first place.

95
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,498
As I always say,

96
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,738
it doesn't mean anything, if you are not the winner.

97
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,968
That's how the world is so...

98
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:25,393
I will study! I'll take the first place!

99
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,354
I will study.

100
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:33,779
I'm counting on you, In Ho.

101
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,214
You know that you are the hope and light of this family, right?

102
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,499
Yes...

103
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:46,068
Oh my, this is the Goryeo literature.

104
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,598
This is just for you to know.

105
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,899
So keep it to yourselves.

106
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,269
Frankly, information provided by mothers...

107
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,508
make their kids the top. Don't you agree?

108
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,974
Mothers should lead and pull their kids in the race.

109
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:05,759
They are wrong.

110
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,467
My son doesn't need that.

111
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,608
He's been doing well until now.

112
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,441
Or am I wrong?

113
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,349
- Wait up! - My goodness!

114
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,226
- Mr. Park! - Who is that?

115
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,679
You scared me.

116
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,949
It's early in the morning.

117
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,192
The world is too beautiful.

118
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:45,519
Mr. Park, the greatest thing...

119
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,159
that you did in your life is...

120
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,675
when you got sick for going Chungju.

121
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,515
Now I know where that sweet smell was coming from.

122
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,098
I think I'm going to like you for the first time in 10 years.

123
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,696
Hey, don't you think I'm tactful?

124
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,169
Thank you, Mr. Park.

125
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,522
Mr. Park, Mr. Park.

126
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,296
Good gracious! Go away.

127

128
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,839
Ms. Son.

129
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,010
Chairman Oh.

130
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,522
You don't look so well. Take care of yourself.

131
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,982
The students are going to notice.

132
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,237
What is that? What are they talking about?

133
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,789
Hey, did you see?

134
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,988
Chairman Oh and Ms. Son came together.

135
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:53,689
We should've taken their picture.

136
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,389
According to what I heard, Chairman Oh and Ms. Son...

137
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,088
were lovers since high school.

138
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,171
What?

139
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,569
I heard they were really famous since they were at school.

140
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,085
The two top students couple.

141
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:06,885
Chairman Oh was the top student?

142
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,222
No, Ms. Son was the top student.

143
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,692
Chairman Oh yielded to Ms. Son for love.

144
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,822
You are the first woman...

145
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:20,890
to defeat me.

146
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,569
I know you gave up for me on purpose.

147
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,761
I also like you.

148
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,140
Cut it out!

149
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,669
Who are you kidding?

150
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,998
Son Soo Jeong has a boyfriend.

151
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,414
- Who is that? - Who is that?

152
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,564
Do I really have to say this?

153
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,133
Piscal once said,

154
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,612
"The truth is always near us".

155
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,111
"However, we do not listen to it".

156
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:02,108
Look no further for the answer, my friends.

157
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,903
It's Pascal.

158
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,683
That's okay. You don't need to know that.

159
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,930
Your welfare comes from your good looks.

160
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,301
Hey!

161
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,610
What are you doing here? It's physical education class, get out!

162
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,112
Ms. Son, you recently got a new boyfriend, right?

163
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,199
Gye So Ra! What are you talking about? What boyfriend?

164
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,998
Ms. Son, you are overreacting.

165
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,261
Ms. Son, I know everything.

166
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:51,561
Since you were in high school...

167
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,425
you went out with Chairman Oh, am I right?

168
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,803
You guys are dating after breaking up when he went to abroad, right?

169
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,000
Gye So Ra.

170
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,189
Chairman Oh and I are not in a relationship.

171
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,529
Don't spread any rumors and stop writing your own novel.

172
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,159
Can't you guys just go out?

173
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,149
I knew it.

174
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,215
I had a feeling about this.

175
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,749
Hey.

176
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:34,660
This is great.

177
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,060
Pardon?

178
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,348
What are you talking about?

179
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,689
The ledger is a mess.

180
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,811
The corruption is greater than I thought.

181
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,076
My mom must be very rich.

182
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,811
Mr. Yoon.

183
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:53,511
Do you think this is funny?

184
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,187
You should do a better job.

185
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,570
My mom is good at ditching people.

186
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,992
Then how about you?

187
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,094
If I stand on your side,

188
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,361
will anything be different?

189
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,534
My gosh, I'm impressed.

190
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,337
You really are quick-witted.

191
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,700
(Infirmary)

192
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:31,693
- Bok Su, what are you doing? - Hey.

193
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,520
Soo Jeong.

194
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,023
- Yes? - I really...

195
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,229
didn't want to say this.

196
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,946
But what did you talk about with Se Ho this morning?

197
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,269
Gosh, I know this is embarrassing.

198
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,602
But it's been bothering me so much.

199
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,281
Hey, do I even need to report stuff like that to you?

200
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,368
Hey, yesterday...

201
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,530
What?

202
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,969
We...

203
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,603
We did it.

204
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,004
- Remember? - Bok Su.

205
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,057
Are you acting like my boyfriend just because of that kiss?

206
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,191
Hey, we kissed each other, and that means...

207
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,984
we're dating now.

208
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:40,339
We need to stick to the procedure.

209
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,778
When did we ever agree to date?

210
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,308
I never recall you asking me out.

211
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:44,623
Are you serious?

212
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,117
I told you guys not to have dates in the infirmary!

213
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,419
Hello.

214
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,107
I was treating him because he was sick.

215
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,589
Ms. Son, that's... That's a liquid pain reliever.

216
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,286
Please take care of him for me.

217
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,882
Where are you going?

218
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,139
Can you please help?

219
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,130
What happened?

220
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,602
- Can you please wipe it off? - My gosh.

221
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,284
- Ms. Park. Ms. Park. - Yes?

222
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,028
Your mom must be so proud of you.

223
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,675
I can't believe she said she doesn't recall me asking her out.

224
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,708
She's unbelievable.

225
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,932
Does she practice in giving presentations or what?

226
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,225
Gosh, what the...

227
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,048
Goodness, you startled me.

228
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,181
You were so happy this morning. What's wrong with you now?

229
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,499
Here.

230
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,619
You're acting like we're dating.

231
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,468
Why are you so concerned about how I feel? It's so corny.

232
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,431
Meanwhile, my actual girlfriend says we're not dating.

233
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,429
Is this a one-sided relationship?

234
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,984
No, that's not what it is.

235
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,068
Soo Jeong probably feels very uneasy about dating you.

236
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:17,768
I personally think you should wait...

237
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:19,789
- until you graduate... - Mr. Park.

238
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,748
I'm legally an adult and so is Soo Jeong.

239
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:26,537
I don't care if she's a student or a teacher.

240
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,594
To me, she's still the same Son Soo Jeong.

241
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,208
I wasted too much time.

242
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,638
I'm not going to hesitate anymore.

243
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,910
I hope you'll give me your full support.

244
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,470
Well...

245
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,183
Gosh, that punk.

246
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,092
But then again, I'm not even surprised.

247
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:50,779
Good luck.

248
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,607
Gosh, I hate learning Chinese characters.

249
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:57,272
Why do Koreans need to learn how to read Chinese characters?

250
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,278
You guys, this is a really easy poem.

251
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,048
The wife of the king who wrote this poem ran away from him.

252
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,625
He went after her to find her, but he got rejected.

253
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,711
Let's read the poem.

254
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,369
"The nightingales in the sky are loving couples."

255
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,833
"Meanwhile, who am I going to spend the rest of my life with?"

256
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,957
Let's try interpreting the poem.

257
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,119
On his way home, he sat down on a tree and took some rest.

258
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,859
But the nightingales up in the tree looked so affectionate.

259
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,283
And he felt jealous of their love because he was feeling so lonely.

260
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,271
I just wrote her a note wishing her good luck.

261
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,754
That's what the poem is about.

262
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,400
Let's go on a date.

263
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,058
My gosh, did he forget already?

264
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,899
Doesn't he know that I don't date dumb guys?

265
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,099
My gosh.

266
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,321
Does he think I'll actually show up?

267
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:57,954
Hello, I'm In Ho's mother.

268
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,351
My goodness, you startled me.

269
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,265
Mom, do I look rich?

270
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,894
I'm scared you might show up in my dreams.

271
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,690
Really?

272
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:15,931
Is this too much?

273
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,160
I think I look pretty.

274
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:23,728
My goodness gracious. What a bold little kid.

275
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:26,028
How could she mistakenly think that her son's in Ivy Class?

276
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,528
Shouldn't we tell her?

277
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,528
- Do you want to tell her? - Goodness, no way.

278
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,488
I don't want to meddle with another family's issue.

279
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,502
How is it possible for a mother to be so ignorant about her own son?

280
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:53,449
Goodness, hello. We've met before, haven't we?

281
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,258
I'm In Ho's mom. He's in Ivy Class.

282
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,159
I'm sorry for not attending any of the moms' gatherings.

283
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,927
From now on, please call me out more often.

284
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:02,840
Often?

285
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,028
Of course.

286
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,089
It's so nice to meet you all.

287
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:13,095
Excuse me. I'd like one Americano.

288
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:14,820
A tall size, please.

289
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:20,799
No, I'd like a grande.

290
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,143
By the way, Ms. Kang.

291
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,103
What's your major?

292
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:32,802
Oh, me?

293
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,544
I majored in sepak takraw.

294
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,814
Sepak... What?

295
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:40,599
Is it an instrument?

296
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,169
Don't you know?

297
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,768
It got chosen as an official sport in 2000...

298
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:46,861
by the National Sports Festival.

299
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,609
The net's in the middle.

300
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,650
And you only use your feet to kick the ball over the net.

301
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:00,830
Let me show you.

302
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,000
My goodness.

303
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,960
- What's she doing? - What's wrong with her?

304
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,879
Okay, we get it. You can sit back down.

305
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,303
I'm usually better, but I'm in heels today.

306
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,271
I used to be a killer.

307
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,889
A killer?

308
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,273
That was my position.

309
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,488
The one in charge of attacking is called the killer.

310
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:38,929
I see.

311
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,969
By the way,

312
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,633
did you apply to be a proctor for tomorrow's test?

313
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:44,899
Of course.

314
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,030
We need to do that in order to get a chance to talk to the teacher.

315
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,834
A proctor? Moms do that kind of stuff?

316
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,602
(Episode 16 will air shortly.)

317
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,666
(Episode 16)

318
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,546
Bok Su.

319
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,416
This could cause fire.

320
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,038
Hey, wait.

321
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,565
Hey, Soo Jeong.

322
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,411
Hey. I prepared all this to set the mood.

323
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,170
Why are you blowing the candles?

324
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:34,939
Gosh, you're really something.

325
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,729
I mean...

326
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,489
Don't you know you have to be careful with fire?

327
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,722
How many candles did you light up? This is dangerous.

328
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,840
I don't know.

329
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,981
I thought about buying a new one, a better one.

330
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,389
But I think it'd be better to start by giving you this.

331
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:16,128
Bok Su, don't you think you're too traditional?

332
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:18,251
Are you going to kneel down and propose next?

333
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:23,979
That's...

334
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,852
the ring...

335
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,308
I couldn't give you nine years ago.

336
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,318
My heart is like that ring.

337
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,218
There's nothing special...

338
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,532
and it looks ordinary.

339
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,030
But just like that ring,

340
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,944
for a long time...

341
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,941
I've always kept you...

342
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:54,711
in my heart.

343
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,690
Soo Jeong.

344
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:06,691
Will you...

345
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,262
make my dream come true?

346
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:13,401
Let me...

347
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,085
be your boyfriend.

348
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,280
Give me that.

349
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,929
Hey.

350
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,503
It doesn't fit.

351
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,703
That's weird. The size...

352
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,432
Hey, did you gain weight?

353
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,959
- Yes, I did. - No, I'm sorry.

354
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,359
I'll buy you 100 rings.

355
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,370
No.

356
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,122
I like this the best.

357
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,265
Bok Su, thank you.

358
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:21,330
I'll never...

359
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,278
lose your heart...

360
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,471
ever.

361
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,680
Aren't these pretty?

362
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,830
- Now there are 100. - Yes, 100.

363
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:03,598
Right. I planned out...

364
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,598
our date.

365
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,668
What is it?

366
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,429
Here. We'll check out...

367
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,769
all these restaurants.

368
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,468
- What do you think? - I like that.

369
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:12,651
- Shall we? - Yes.

370
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
Let's go.

371
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,795
What's wrong?

372
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,339
Hey.

373
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,184
What is it? What's wrong?

374
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,996
That's So Ra and Do Yeon.

375
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,059
They have a test tomorrow. Why aren't they studying?

376
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,920
Hey.

377
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,860
By the way,

378
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,498
this is very thrilling and nice.

379
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:02,918
Hey, you might get a heart attack next time.

380
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,758
Don't wear the school uniform when we date.

381
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,050
Stand at least 1m away from me at school.

382
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,319
(Week 4 Placement Test)

383
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:18,892
Excuse me, sir.

384
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,115
I don't see In Ho.

385
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,950
In Ho?

386
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,268
- Kang In Ho in Wildflower Class? - Yes.

387
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,461
No. Kang In Ho in Ivy Class.

388
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,730
Kang In Ho isn't in my class.

389
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,578
I think you're mistaken.

390
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:34,630
This is Ivy Class.

391
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,809
In Ho is taking a test in Wildflower Class.

392
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,801
Be quiet.

393
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:51,611
Wildflower Class.

394
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,769
Mom.

395
00:32:39,949 --> 00:32:41,849
- Ma'am. - How could you?

396
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,219
How could you do this to me?

397
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,937
How long were you going to lie to me?

398
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,712
Goodness. Ivy?

399
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:48,970
Die.

400
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,388
- Just die. - Ma'am.

401
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:53,328
Just die!

402
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:54,975
So Jeong, wait.

403
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,159
Kids are watching. Stop.

404
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,846
Let go. Let go of me!

405
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,599
I'm going to die with him.

406
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,206
This isn't how I raised you!

407
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,109
- In Ho! - In Ho.

408
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,999
So Jeong. Wait.

409
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,636
So Jeong. Please. Calm down.

410
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:20,462
Why didn't you tell me?

411
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:24,088
If you knew about it,

412
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,373
you should've told me.

413
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,929
Was it fun to just watch...

414
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,545
and do nothing?

415
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,142
You're the same.

416
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,067
If In Ho's mom is Bok Su's older sister...

417
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,764
Bok Su is In Ho's uncle.

418
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,031
Do you remember...

419
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,917
bullying Bok Su's nephew and making him...

420
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,101
buy snacks for us?

00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:35,386

423
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,342
Mom.

424
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,716
- Mom. - What is it? What's wrong?

425
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,981
How about ramyeon and gimbap?

426
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,518
Let's eat meat.

427
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,089
You're weak because you don't eat well.

428
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,898
Gosh, are you worried about me?

429
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,758
What are you saying?

430
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:14,456
I feel like eating meat today.

431
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,080
Isn't that In Ho?

432
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:26,712
It looks like he ran away from home.

433
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,461
You made a mistake too.

434
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:39,326
If you knew that your nephew was lying,

435
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,829
you should've corrected him like an adult.

436
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,329
You're an accomplice.

437
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,471
To my sister,

438
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,385
In Ho's everything.

439
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:49,839
I couldn't dare to ruin her entire world.

440
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,283
Then what about In Ho's world?

441
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,563
It was bound to come down into pieces one day.

442
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:58,079
He's been lying for so many years now.

443
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,675
He wouldn't have known how to deal with it since it got so out of hand.

444
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:06,064
My gosh.

445
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:09,429
Hey, what's up?

446
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,399
What?

447
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,143
Hey, In Ho.

448
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,928
Bok Su, your nephew has such a bright future ahead of him.

449
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,668
He can plan, act, and even forge documents.

450
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,398
He has all three abilities.

451
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,773
I can see what kind of person he'll become in the future.

452
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:31,350
In Ho.

453
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,238
What are you doing here?

454
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:37,878
I'm his homeroom teacher.

455
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,418
In Ho, get up.

456
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:42,449
I want you to go home and apologize to your mom.

457
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,285
I'm not going home. No, I can't go home.

458
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,928
- I'm not going to go. - In Ho.

459
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,748
Didn't you just hear her telling me to just die?

460
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,916
I'll just die right here...

461
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:55,939
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

462
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,586
Get up. I said, get up!

463
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,620
Let's go.

464
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,448
Let's just die, In Ho.

465
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:27,603
Let's just die, okay?

466
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:36,434
Who are you? You're not a teacher, are you?

467
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,764
What kind of sports did you play?

468
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,808
Did you do judo?

469
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,677
Ms. Kang, why don't you hear him out first?

470
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:47,589
Not all lies start out with a bad intention.

471
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,548
You know more than anyone that In Ho's not a bad kid.

472
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,845
What's going on?

473
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,024
All lies are bad.

474
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:01,229
Why did you lie to me for such a long time?

475
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:02,739
Why did you do such a thing?

476
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,750
Because...

477
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:08,221
you smiled.

478
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:10,851
What?

479
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,954
That's not how you do it. You need to do this.

480
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,376
- Do this. - Okay.

My goodness gracious.

495
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,072
My gosh, I can't believe this.

496
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,824
I can't believe I gave birth to such a smart son!

497
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:36,449
Do you want me to dance?

498
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:39,930
In Ho came in first place

499
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:46,659
You were going through such a hard time.

500
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,528
I wanted to be a good son...

501
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,528
who could make you smile.

502
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:56,240
I really tried my best.

503
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:58,971
But my scores wouldn't get better.

504
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:02,583
So I forged my report cards...

505
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,480
and awards.

506
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,575
I wanted to make you happy...

507
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,320
even if that meant I had to lie.

508
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:14,586
I actually get really bad grades.

509
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:18,527
There's nothing I want to do and I don't even have a dream.

510
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:24,652
I'm just a piece of trash.

511
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,291
I'm sorry, Mom.

512
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:37,970
Hey.

513
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:04,809
- What are you doing? - How are you so strong?

514
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,989
My sister used to beat me up a lot, so I can guarantee you this.

515
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,020
You would've won a gold medal if you became an athlete.

516
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,576
Will In Ho be okay?

517
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,958
He's a member of the Kang family and all of us know to be strong.

518
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,011
He'll overcome it.

519
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:30,042
In Ho reminds me of myself.

520
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:32,362
Just like him,

521
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,178
I might've enjoyed being praised by other people...

522
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:38,047
when I wasn't really what they thought I was.

523
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,012
That's probably why I kept everything about me a secret.

524
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,169
You can continue to keep it a secret...

525
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,270
so that I'll be the only one who knows...

526
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:48,879
that you're a really good person.

527
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:50,569

In Ho.

529
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:16,476

530

No, it's okay.

531
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:21,582
I don't deserve to eat this anymore.

532
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,229
You'll need energy to put up with the teachers scolding you...

533
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,533
and your fellow classmates whispering about what happened.

534
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:32,251
Drink it.

535
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,495
You're not a piece of trash.

536
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,847
Ever since I was pregnant with you, you were my entire world.

537
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,427
I risked my entire life to protect you.

538
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,084
I don't care what anyone says.

539
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,465
You're still my precious son, so keep your chin up.

00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:16,629
Hey.

542
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,598
What about me? Where's mine?

543
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,518
Go ask your mom.

544
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:22,934
This is for my son.

545
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,269
Let's go.

546
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,185
Gosh, we're here.

547
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,302
I guess people will finally know about our relationship.

548
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:47,949
I couldn't call you my nephew,

549
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,848
and I couldn't tell your mom that you were in Wildflower Class.

550
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,668
Do you know how frustrating that was?

551
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,223
Why couldn't you tell everyone that I'm your uncle?

552
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,578
Uncle Bok Su, I'll go to school next time...

553
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,071
In Ho.

554
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:06,027
School is exactly where you belong.

555
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,050
Trust me.

556
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,258
I'm telling you as someone who's been there.

557
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:25,314
<font color="#0080ff">[Kocowa Ver] </font>

558
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,100
Are you okay?

559
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:37,179
Your mom threw a really strong punch.

560
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,746
Oh, yes.

561
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:41,868
I know, right? Was she an athlete?

562
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:45,678
Yes, my mom's a gold medalist.

563
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,020
Really?

564
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,879
My gosh, did she play in the Olympics? What sport did she play?

565
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,828
No, she played in the Asian Games.

566
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:53,778
Sepak takraw.

567
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:55,308
What? Sepak...

568
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:57,844
Hey, don't you even know what Central Park is?

569
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,059
Are you bragging?

570
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:06,901
Soo Jeong.

571
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:08,840
Hey.

572
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,774
Can we talk for a moment?

573
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:17,367
It's something I need to tell you today.

574
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:24,589
Soo Jeong.

575
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,725
Do you remember asking me...

576
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,533
why I keep staring at you?

577
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,830
Hey.

578
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,405
Why do you keep staring at me?

579
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,933
Soo Jeong,

580
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:40,774
I can sense your loneliness.

581
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:44,349
You've lived all your life being so defensive.

582
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:46,411
I know what it's like.

583
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,786
I want to make you happy.

584
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:51,160
- I'll try my best to... - Oh Se Ho.

585
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,454
I'm not you.

586
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,825
Don't reflect yourself in me.

587
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,731
I don't need your help and...

588
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,972
I don't feel lonely.

589
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,454
- Son So Jeong. - I'll have to turn down on you.

590
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,593
I'm not the person who can comfort your loneliness.

591
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:28,482
Your reason of rejection is...

592
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,892
because of Kang Bok Su?

593
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:35,619
Yes.

594
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,149
I don't get it!

595
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,443
What's so good about that shabby ring and Kang Bok Su?

596
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:46,649
Why are you choosing him over me?

597
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,483
You also liked Kang Bok Su as much as I did.

598
00:46:58,099 --> 00:46:59,150
I don't know.

599
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:02,621
I don't remember.

600
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,065
You are going to regret...

601
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:15,161
your choice.

602
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,028
It's all going to be tougher now.

603
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:22,404
Don't mess with Kang Bok Su.

604
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:25,321
He suffered enough because of you and me.

605
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:28,146
Is this the best you can do?

606
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:29,681
If I don't do this.

607
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:34,008
You are only going to remember me as someone from the same class,

608
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:35,959
a chairman, or a nobody.

609
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,491
I don't want that.

610
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,123
You made your own choice.

611
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,443
If you change your mind, let me know.

612
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,874
I'm always open for you.

613
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,424
Do you really want...

614
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,228
a girl like that?

615
00:48:48,779 --> 00:48:49,860
Son Soo Jeong.

616
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:53,344
She's the teacher of Wildflower Class which you made.

617
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,208
Did you really think that I wouldn't know?

618
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,831
That's none of your business.

619
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,569
What?

620
00:49:01,089 --> 00:49:02,908
Don't mess with Son Soo Jeong.

621
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:08,941
Mother.

622
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,439
Intermittent explosive disorder is a disease.

623
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,611
Oh Se Ho.

624
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,139
How dare you!

625
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,058
Don't ever mess with Son Soo Jeong.

626
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:18,954
I don't need your help.

627
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,168
If I can't have her,

628
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,932
I will ruin her myself.

629
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,152
You shouldn't make the same mistake again.

630
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:48,311
It's better to crush others than to be crushed.

631
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:57,939
(Mr. Yoon)

632
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,170
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

633
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:11,813
Please proceed.

634
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,445
I'll take care of the rest.

635
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:24,566
You are going to regret your choice.

636
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,198
It's going to be tougher now.

637
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:31,679
What are you up to, Oh Se Ho?

638
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:40,041
Kim Myung Ho?

639
00:50:42,529 --> 00:50:44,999
Hello, hi, hello.

640
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,090
Hello, nice to meet you.

641
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,412
You've become even prettier.

642
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,588
It seems like you've lost weight.

643
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,690
Nice to meet you.

644
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:55,627
How dare that punk come here?

645
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,970
Attention everyone, this is Kim Myung...

646
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,167
You should all know him.

647
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,440
He will reinstate to the Administration Office today.

648
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:10,839
He came back so...

649
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:12,908
Please get along well.

650
00:51:13,259 --> 00:51:15,755
Have you all been well?

651
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:17,929
I'm grateful to be back.

652
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,568
I'm glad I can work with great teachers like yourselves.

653
00:51:20,569 --> 00:51:22,014
Thank you for calling me in again.

654
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:24,966
For the tremendous success of Seolsong High School...

655
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:27,332
I will do my best.

656
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,921
Thank you.

657
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,730
Se Ho.

658
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:40,518
You shouldn't do that.

659
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:43,247
Although it's a private school, there are laws.

660
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,959
How can you rehire someone who has committed such corruption?

661
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,343
Mr. Park Dong Jun.

662
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:51,773
This is the chairman office.

663
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,068
A normal teacher like yourself...

664
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,321
can't come in without permission.

665
00:51:57,799 --> 00:51:59,899
- Se Ho... - The authority over personnel...

666
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,808
is completely the private school foundation's discretion.

667
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:03,729
This recruitment is not against the law.

668
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,758
Which means your personal opinion...

669
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,496
is not important at all.

670
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,761
Do you have anything...

671
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:11,059
further to say?

672
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:23,874
The principle between people is more important than the law.

673
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:25,441
Whenever...

674
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,118
you feel like you were wrong...

675
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:32,501
please look back, Chairman.

676
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:52,137
You are still the same.

677
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:54,989
How long do you think you can last?

678
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,858
What's up with the Chairman?

679
00:52:56,859 --> 00:52:58,446
How can he bring back someone like him?

680
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,729
I know.

681
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,699
He was only a contract worker and now he's an administrator?

682
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,770
He's just like his mother.

683
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,402
I heard he also offered a permanent position...

684
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:10,529
to a contract teacher here.

685
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:12,338
If the money was sent.

686
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:13,390
What?

687
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:23,348
Gosh, what nonsense!

688
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:25,339
That's not possible at our school.

689
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:27,258
You're right.

690
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:30,260
You should never spread a rumor like that.

691
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:37,788
- Hello. - Hi.

692
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,963
Hey, how dare you come here again?

693
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:46,463
Who are you going to bleed dry?

694
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,607
What are you talking about? I already gave back all the money.

695
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,379
What? Don't you remember the 50,000 dollars?

696
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:54,618
Shut your mouth.

697
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:56,018
How dare you come back?

698
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:57,707
He called me in.

699
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,230
Ms. Son.

700
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:01,828
This is my permanent job.

701
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:03,576
Let's get along well.

702
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:08,328
- Hey, that hurts! - Don't talk nonsense.

703
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,714
This is a school.

704
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,268
This is a place where a criminal like you shouldn't come.

705
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:13,622
Seriously!

706
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,583
Why are you so confident?

707
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,750
Let go.

708
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:19,038
If I say a word,

709
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:21,409
you can be kicked out just like that.

710
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:22,460
What?

711
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,342
Let's get along well again, Ms. Son.

712
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:31,434
My goodness.

713
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,558
Hey, why are you blocking...

714
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,820
Kang Bok Su.

715
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,348
The school uniform looks good on you.

716
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:56,709
Why are you here?

717
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,740
I was reinstated, I'm back.

718
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:09,570
Was it Oh Se Ho?

719
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,798
Why did Oh He Ho call you in again?

720
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,068
That's because...

721
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:18,239
I was a good teacher so he gave a second...

722
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,310
Keep in mind.

723
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,897
That second chance can drag you to inferno.

724
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,080
What? Did you call for Kim Myung Ho?

725
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,282
You're pretty quick-witted.

726
00:55:49,269 --> 00:55:51,768
Don't you know what he did to Soo Jeong?

727
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:53,012
How can you bring him back?

728
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:56,484
That's why I brought him back.

729
00:55:57,609 --> 00:55:59,933
Do you even have the right...

730
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,598
to worry about Soo Jeong?

731
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,373
You're the most dangerous thing to Soo Jeong.

732
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:09,872
- What? - You're a student in uniform.

733
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:11,504
And Soo Jeong is your homeroom teacher.

734
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:15,429
A teacher is dating her student...

735
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,540
in school.

736
00:56:22,029 --> 00:56:24,867
What will happen if parents and students...

737
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:27,619
found out?

738
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,221
Bok Su.

739
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:33,549
Will you...

740
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:38,112
still date Ms. Son?

741
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,700
Yes.

742
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,444
I will.

743
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:51,159
Whatever you do, I'll never break up with her.

744
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,298
She'll lose the hard-won permanent teaching position.

745
00:56:53,299 --> 00:56:54,784
You can't break the news.

746
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,639
Can't I? What makes you think that?

747
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,709
I know why you brought me back to school.

748
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,409
If I quit being a student,

749
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,025
you can't be cocky to me.

750
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,008
The board chairman and you...

751
00:57:07,009 --> 00:57:10,312
tried to toy Soo Jeong and me.

752
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:12,094
Just expel me.

753
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:16,054
It'd be nice if Soo Jeong never had to see you again.

754
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:23,509
Bok Su, you've gotten pretty smart.

755
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,578
What did I do wrong to you?

756
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,169
- What? - Like how I hurt...

757
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,422
Soo Jeong without realizing it,

758
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,525
did I hurt you too?

759
00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:40,567
You used to not be like this.

760
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,202
What was I like...

761
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:57,274
to you then?

762
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,388
A wuss that was always smiling?

763
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,466
You've always been like that.

764
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,672
You pretended to be righteous. You acted like you knew everything!

765
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:27,901
But you don't know...

766
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,270
how miserable...

767
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:36,691
my life became because of you.

768
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:45,089
You two...

769
00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:49,090
can never...

770
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,695
be happy.

771
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,960
(My Strange Hero)

772
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,879
Make a list of teachers you hired by bribery.

773
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,319
We have to do something about Se Ho.

774
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,718
I like school.

775
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:28,419
Me too. I like the school you're in.

776
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,488
Make a forced transfer.

777
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:31,118
This is why I made Wildflower Class.

778
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,459
- What if they don't stay put? - That's what I want.

779
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,753
I will protect Bok Su. Trust me!
