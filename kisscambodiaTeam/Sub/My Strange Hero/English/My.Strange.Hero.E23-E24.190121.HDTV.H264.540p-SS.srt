1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,778
Mr. Park really wants you to graduate.

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,992
I understand him.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,903
So Bok Su...

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,226
I know what I should do.

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,418
I'll expose the corruption,

6
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:22,309
and get a diploma too.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,458
Let go. Let me go, sir!

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,408
If something goes wrong again...

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,894
If I can't protect you this time...

10
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,621
I can't...

11
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:46,096
I can't stand that.

12
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,559
So...

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,936
focus more on the kids.

14
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,427
(Episode 23)

15
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,964
Spiraea prunifolia.

16
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,101
Ixeris stolonifera.

17
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,849
Their names are ugly,

18
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,989
and people don't know that they're flowers.

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,519
But even if they get stepped on,

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,954
wildflowers bloom again and never die.

21
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:36,829
You must be upset, hurt, and angry.

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,329
But even if you were stepped on, you can bloom again.

23
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:46,702
You can do well on the class placement test.

24
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,907
What will Mr. Park do now?

25
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,504
He doesn't even answer his phone.

26
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,989
I know. He doesn't even have a family.

27
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,777
I wonder where he is and what he is doing.

28
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,241
We have no time to be sad.

29
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,528
Getting back at this rotten school and Se Ho...

30
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:17,166
would be taking revenge for Mr. Park.

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,315
(Lim Se Gyeong, Oh Se Ho)

32
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,969
(Oh Se Ho)

33
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,111
Here's what you asked for.

34
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:39,002
(Breakdown of Donations)

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
Please double check to see if you left out any parents.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,223
- Okay. - Also,

37
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,779
does the principal know about this list?

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,288
Of course.

39
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:51,945
You can say that he was in on it too.

40
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,288
I don't see the list of teachers who bribed to get hired.

41
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:56,603
I thought I asked for it a while ago.

42
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,374
It'll be prepared soon.

43
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,274
I'm still working on it.

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,268
Good work.

45
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,644
Thank you. Bye.

46
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,586
- Kim Myung Ho. - Yes?

47
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,599
I need you to do another job.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,939
Even when I'm absent,

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,262
I feel relieved thanks to you.

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,078
We have a history working together.

51
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,928
There's no need to worry.

52
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,749
We'll just continue how we always have done.

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,578
Your son's working quite well too.

54
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,711
He got rid of a teacher that was a headache.

55
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,388
He's also trying to make the problem students transfer.

56
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,188
By the way, it looked like your son...

57
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:33,083
figured out our business in detail.

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,554
Do you plan on having him take over?

59
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,402
I was curious about that too.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,921
I thought your son was filling in temporarily,

61
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,572
but he's working harder than I expected.

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,018
I've seen many instances where things went wrong...

63
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,767
because people trusted their children.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,172
I asked to meet today to talk about holding a board meeting.

65
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,996
A board meeting? About what?

66
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,625
The dismissal of the current board chairman, of course.

67
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,599
Gosh. But he's your son. Would you be okay with it?

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,984
Blood doesn't matter.

69
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,094
Our business is what matters.

70
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,319
A board meeting to dismiss him? Is Oh Se Ho getting fired?

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,571
It looks like it.

72
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,306
I'm so happy.

73
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:37,570
This is great.

74
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,699
The business we're doing with the school...

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,829
goes through us.

76
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,498
There's no need for her son to be in that position.

77
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,246
Ms. Lim is wise.

78
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,969
By the way, we won't get fired too, will we?

79
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,238
They can't fire us.

80
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,639
It's been 10 years.

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,255
They'll all die if they fire us.

82
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:54,465
I've figured out ways to look out for myself too.

83
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,306
You'll save me with you, right?

84
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,459
Are you okay?

85
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,519
Gosh.

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,988
- Are you the driver? - Yes.

87
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:12,424
Driver? Over here.

88
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,058
- I'll drive him home safely. - Okay.

89
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,311
Bye.

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,643
He drinks so much, but he's fine in the morning.

91
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,497
What does he eat?

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,894
Only if you weren't around...

94
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,572
Hello, ma'am.

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,259
Is it necessary for Chae Min...

96
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,623
to get the best scores for the class arrangement exam?

97
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,569
There were some problems,

98
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,899
so you should spare yourself this time.

99
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,769
The finals are more important,

100
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,244
so I'll promise you to do my best then.

101
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,530
Okay. Goodnight.

102
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,981
He can't give us the answers for the class arrangement exam.

103
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,288
I'll start getting them again for the finals.

104
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,380
- Mom. - If you studied well,

105
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,681
I wouldn't have to pay attention to such a thing.

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,069
Chae Min, don't be so pathetic.

107
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,769
If you can't get the best score,

108
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,861
how will you survive in the future?

109
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,150
This time,

110
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,632
I'll do my best to do better.

111
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,615
Let's sort things out one by one.

112
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,399
The apparatus they purchased...

113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,298
Just the quote alone proves it's a problem.

114
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,390
Each desk for the science lab...

115
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,322
was charged 5,000 dollars.

116
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,579
I found the same product on the Internet...

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,748
that sold for less than 500 dollars.

118
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,449
How much are they adding on?

119
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,489
It's too much.

120
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,288
Also, I need to check if what the principal said today...

121
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,804
is the truth.

122
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,918
We need to closely mark Chae Min's mom.

123
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,288
Okay. I'll be in charge of that.

124
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:24,885
If what he said is true, we must find the evidence.

125
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,989
I'll be covering your eyes.

126
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,279
Okay.

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,856
It's to help tighten your skin.

128
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,774
Ma'am, please give me your hands.

129
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,606
Give me your phone for a second.

130
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:52,629
Here.

131
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,959
Stretch.

132
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,606
- Gosh. - Stretch.

133
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:58,639
Stretch.

134
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,907
You seem to be stiff, so I'll help you stretch.

135
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,322
Stretch.

136
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,226
I'll help you stretch out.

137
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,353

I heard that a new general manager came.

151
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,228
I'm sorry I didn't visit you earlier.

152
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,744
Since you didn't show up, I decided to come myself.

153
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,478
By the way, what brought you here?

154
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,529
Mr. Lee?

155
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,421
It's expensive. It's way too expensive.

156
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,758
I was looking at our ledger,

157
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,398
and I noticed that the 1,000-dollar table in our meeting room...

158
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,824
costs 173 dollars and 90 cents on the Internet.

159
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,337
I guess they didn't train you properly.

160
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,579
This is because we make some profit in between.

161
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,286
What kind of situation is this?

162
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:40,116
I noticed that you recently changed your car.

163

164
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,300
What?

165

What does that have to do with you?

166
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,544
Of course it has to do with me.

167
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,898

He asked me why we're the ones always getting beat up.

170

I think we have a lead.

193
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,589
Now we have to figure out...

194
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,387
how to put it together and release it.

195
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:22,758
Judging by what happened to Mr. Park last time,

196
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,395
there's no use in meeting reporters. We need to bet big.

197
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:32,007
If only we had a witness to prove that people bribed him to get hired.

198
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,058
No one would step forward to prove that.

199
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,408

Seung Woo got the highest score. This is great.

- Are you serious? - What about Chae Min?

207
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,530
He shouldn't have asked for a retest.

I hope you look forward to it.

211

Don't be so obsessed with your grades.

212
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,179
You look down on people based on their grades,

213
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,705
and you act like everything's over now that your grades went down.

214

00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:03,629
Are you okay?

Hey, are you okay?

226
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,799
What? He doesn't want to move classes?

227
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,969
Young Min already refused to go, and now Seung Woo's also refusing...

228
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,130
even after he got the highest score? Is he nuts?

229
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,209
I know, right? He must be nuts.

230
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,539
He insists on staying in Wildflower Class...

231
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,079
saying he likes it there.

232
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,079
I don't want to force a student to come to my class.

233
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,493
He's like a gangster anyway.

234
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,278
Yes, I agree. Seung Woo is a gangster.

235
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,148
He's a gangster for being smart.

236
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,758
He's a gangster for being nice.

237
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,305
And he's a gangster for his good looks.

238
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,454

243
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,319
I'm here as the class leader of Wildflower Class...

244
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,340
Get out.

245
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,714
Maybe it's because I'm old, but my bottom feels so heavy,

246
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,797
and my legs feel weak. So please let me sit down for a bit.

247
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,874
Seung Woo. Young Min.

248
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,873
I want you to go to Ivy Class.

249
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,314
- I don't want to. - Me neither.

250
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,983
Please let us stay in Wildflower Class.

251
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,599
You need to follow the school rules.

252
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,468
You can't just do whatever you want.

253
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,768
Since we're on the subject,

254
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,709
our average score exceeded 50,

255
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,439
so we're not going to be forced to transfer schools, right?

256
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,601
It was a special transfer program recommended by the principal.

257
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,933
I'll keep my promise.

258
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,688
You won't transfer schools, and you won't go to Ivy Class.

259
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,386
You're rejecting a favor that's being offered to you,

260
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,803
and it's very disappointing.

261
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,687
Don't you think it's unnecessary to discriminate the students...

262
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,958
by treating each class differently?

263
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,798
What's the use of hierarchy when the top student is in the lowest class?

264

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,339
How are you so bold?

273
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,935
I know, right? Maybe it comes with age.

274
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,333
How can you talk back looking into those scary eyes?

275
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:29,972

276
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,247

I feel so relaxed now that I'm with you.

278
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,045
I shouldn't feel like this.

279
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,571
Why not?

280
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:16,069
Se Ho has his eyes on us,

281
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,958
and we don't know what he might do.

282
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,998
So we need to stay alert.

283
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,304
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

284
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:32,401
We just need to...

285
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,278
overcome it together like this.

286
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,610
Should I...

287
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,449
go inside?

288
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,839
You should go home. Your mom will be waiting.

289
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,809
No, my mom will have no problem sleeping...

290
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,940
even if I don't go home tonight.

291
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,072
It's too late. You should go.

292
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,079
Okay, go inside. Sleep tight.

293
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,140

294
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,250

00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,677
I'm writing my journal.

299
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,428
Every time something good happens, I need to write it down.

300
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,529
I got to tease Mr. Song and Mr. Kim today,

301
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,269
and it felt really nice.

302
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,481
Then write this down as well.

303
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,448
S. Crystal told Se Ho a very wise saying today.

304
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,013
"Wildflowers bloom again even after they get stepped on."

305
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,648
Spiraea prunifolia. You should've said this part too.

306
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:06,791
I did.

307
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,277
Gosh, you should've seen Se Ho's face.

308
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:30,821

309
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:33,421

310
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,491
Se Ho.

311
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,467

319
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,900
I told him the information.

320
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,515
How did you...

321
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,139
Make a wish.

322
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,410
Blow the candle.

323
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,963
Don't wish for getting the top score.

324

This is a special gift from me.

326
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,541
What? Bok Su. Are you going to drink this?

327
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,202

328
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,789
This isn't my type.

329
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,375

331
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:38,454
My face is a bit red, but I'm fine.

332
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:39,980
Maybe I'm a good drinker.

00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:08,757
because you told me to.

363
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:11,504
But I feel bad about it.

364
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,515
You may leave.

365
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:20,893
- Mr. Kim. - Yes.

366
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,696
Yes, Chairman Oh.

367
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,551
Take Ms. Son out of the employment solicitation list.

368
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:32,623
Pardon? You told me to put her in...

369
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:33,634
Take her out.

370
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:36,338
Don't make me tell you twice.

371
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:38,704
Yes, sir.

This... Where did this...

375
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:55,283
Where do you think? I got it from Kim Myung Ho's computer.

376
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:57,984
That's not important. Is this true?

377
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,832
Did you really pay him to become a teacher?

378
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:04,709
Gosh. You're terrible.

379
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:07,548
I guess having been the top student doesn't mean anything.

380
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:09,394
I got scammed.

381
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,993
Scammed? Do you think I'll believe that?

382
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:14,085
A smart person like you doesn't get scammed.

383

But why are you on this list?

384
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:24,094

I'm sorry.

388

389

Get a life, Soo Jeong.

Why would you give me that money?

424

You were having a hard time.

having a hardship.

431
00:30:58,195 --> 00:30:59,952
Then you knew everything.

00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,429
You knew I tried to buy a teaching position.

433
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,634
And you knew that I got scammed like a fool.

All you care about is yourself.

442
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:47,144
You gave 50,000 dollars back.

443
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,213
When things didn't go your way,

444
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:49,814
you put me in the corrupted teachers' list.

445
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:52,238
Then you took me out and acted like you did me a favor.

446
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:53,626
What is it?

447
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,051
Did you want to boast about taking my name off of it?

who gave you the 50,000 dollars, and Bok Su...

452
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:22,297
who didn't do anything even when he knew?

453
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:26,174
- What? - Bok Su...

454
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,173
was fooling you too.

455
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,212
I bet the great Bok Su didn't tell you this, did he?

456
00:32:33,354 --> 00:32:34,537
It was me nine years ago...

457
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,386
who told everyone about you being on food stamps.

458
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,648
I had my doubts,

459
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:44,647
but that was you too?

460
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,644
It's something only Bok Su and I knew. How did you find out?

461
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:49,786
I told you.

462
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,092
I was always watching you.

463
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,833
Why did you say such a lie?

464
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,043
To split you and Bok Su apart.

465
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,680
That's how you two broke up, right?

466
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:31,684

467
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:33,371
How will people react when they find out?

468
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:44,680
You should break up with him...

469
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,580
if you want to protect him.

470
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:58,550
Why did you say such a lie?

471
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,653
To split you and Bok Su apart.

472
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:06,261
That's how you two broke up, right?

473
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:14,029
Soo Jeong.

474
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:15,596
Are you here?

475
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,107
Hey.

476
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:21,306
Are you sick?

477
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:23,008
No.

478
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:26,126
I think you are. Do you have a fever? Is it hot?

479
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:29,255
- Here, let me fan you. - Bok Su.

480
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:34,202
I'm fine. You should go. The kids might see you.

481
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:36,723
See what? They're all in class.

482
00:35:36,944 --> 00:35:38,344
It's okay, I'll...

483
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,455
I said, go.

484
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:08,333
What is it? Are things not going well with your girlfriend?

485
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,374
No, it's going very well.

486
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,759
I'm the happiest man on earth right now.

487
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:14,388
What did she say?

488
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:17,539
She told me to leave because you guys might see us.

489
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:19,126
She's right.

490
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:22,173
While we're on that,

491
00:36:22,324 --> 00:36:24,980
you shouldn't date at school.

492
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,447
You shouldn't do this during class.

493
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:29,876
Or this.

494
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,913
It's so annoying to see.

495
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,734
I might just tattle on you.

496
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,604
What is this? Did you see all that?

497
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:39,130
You're always sleeping in class. When did you see that?

498
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,463
It's obvious you're new to this dating thing.

499
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:51,144
As you expected, the members of the foundation...

500
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:52,754
were replaced once nine years ago.

501
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,270
Nothing has changed since then.

502
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:56,323
They made the replacements nine years ago because...

503
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:57,870
I bet Mother got rid of them so that she won't get caught.

504
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:00,311
Yes, that's right.

505
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:03,696
If something goes wrong, who will she blame this time?

506
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:05,845
One of the board members?

507
00:37:06,595 --> 00:37:07,846
You?

508
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:11,134
Or, me?

509
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,903
There's someone I think she might blame.

510
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,843
This time, we'll have to make her take responsibility for it.

511
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:23,000
I wonder if it was the same for Mother.

512
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:25,256
Pardon?

513
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:28,201
Although I know things are going wrong,

514
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:32,966
I can't seem to stop.

515
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:39,646
Hey.

516
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:41,706
Hey.

517
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:44,604
What are you going to do about it?

518
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:46,856
- I'll take care of it myself. - What?

519
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:50,073
What can you do? Your name's on the list.

520
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:51,874
It's my business, not yours.

521
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,614
Do you think I'm doing this because I care about you?

522
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:54,974
I'm doing this because of Bok Su.

523
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:57,711
If you keep on acting like this, I'm going to tell him.

524
00:37:57,914 --> 00:38:00,379
He already knows.

525
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:03,165
He does?

526
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,293
Things are complicated as it is even without you,

527
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:08,293
so just leave me alone. Okay?

528
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:09,376
Are you serious?

529
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,724
This isn't working.

530
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,360
Follow me.

531
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,587
Hey, look at this.

532
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,018
If we add up the pay back amounts from the last three years...

533
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,045
Hey, did something happen?

534
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:39,793
- Soo Jeong... - Stop. That's enough.

535
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,354
You have to date on your own.

536
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:43,486
Let's just take revenge. Let's do it.

537
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:45,693
Gyeong Hyeon, please hear me out.

538
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:47,594
She won't take my calls or answer my texts.

539
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:48,816
That's the situation.

540
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,219
Hey, where are you going?

541
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:00,898
If Kim Myung Ho is a crook,

542
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:03,001
then what did you do wrong?

543
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,810
I was trying to buy a teacher's position.

544
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,227
No wonder...

545
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:09,553
Bok Su didn't dig about the hiring corruption.

546
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:11,141
We need witnesses too.

547
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:13,107
Witnesses?

548
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,206
Forget it.

549
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:22,234
By the way, what's wrong with Se Ho?

550
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,881
I thought he liked you.

551
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:38,342
What's this? A paparazzi?

552
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:39,697
Is Se Ho behind this too?

553
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:43,754
He's really something.

554
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,340
Why did he get so nasty?

555
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:49,423
I'm the one that's the most dangerous to Bok Su right now.

556
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:52,222
I'm a teacher, and he's a student.

557
00:39:52,495 --> 00:39:54,181
Se Ho is using that fact.

558
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,635
Se Ho kicked Mr. Park out too.

559
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:01,467
I think it's time I protect Bok Su.

560
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:04,097
Why are your fates so tangled up?

561
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:07,455
Soo Jeong.

562
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,634
Just wait until he graduates.

563
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,017
Just stay apart for a little while.

564
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:17,548
You couldn't get over each other for nine years.

565
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:20,553
You won't fall apart if you wait a little longer.

566
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:22,036
I...

567
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:24,537
want Bok Su...

568
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:27,845
No.

569
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:32,000
I want the two of you to be happy now.

570
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:36,507
In order to do that, you two need to act...

571
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:38,831
more wisely.

572
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:55,107
It's cold.

573
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:04,724
What's this? Is that you, Min Ji?

574
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:10,415
It's the CEO.

575
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:12,244
Look at you.

576
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:14,443
It's late at night.

577
00:41:14,444 --> 00:41:16,637
Why did you drink so much?

578
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:19,033
You're a dangerous woman.

579
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:23,272
Get on my back. You should go home.

580
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,551
What are you doing? I said, get on my back.

581
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:41,041
Your back looks so huge all of a sudden.

582
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:43,021
It's so hot.

583
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,666
Gosh. This girl.

584
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:50,480
You may be drunk, but you only speak the truth.

585
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:54,289
Okay, I get it. But you need to get on my back first...

586
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:55,695
so that we can go home.

587
00:42:00,794 --> 00:42:02,239
Get on my back.

588
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:18,249
<font color="#0080ff">[Kocowa Ver] </font>

589
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:31,845
This doesn't count.

590
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:38,563
Gosh, I don't want to be drunk for this.

591
00:42:38,564 --> 00:42:42,443
I wanted it to be romantic.

592
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,700
It's my first kiss.

593
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:54,661
I wanted to be manly and romantic when I did it.

594
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:56,999
I'm not drunk.

595
00:42:57,215 --> 00:42:59,710
I'm not drunk at all.

596
00:43:01,884 --> 00:43:02,966
Whatever.

597
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:06,836
Gyeong Hyeon.

598
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:14,678
Raise your pretty face...

599
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:19,118
up high.

600
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:24,103
How long were you here? It's cold.

601
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:25,186
It's okay...

602
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,534
because I'm a passionate man.

603
00:43:34,284 --> 00:43:36,002
Why did you come all the way here?

604
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:39,806
I came...

605
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:43,577
because I was worried.

606
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:51,276
Bok Su.

607
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:55,493
I have something to say to you.

608
00:43:58,745 --> 00:43:59,927
Bok Su.

609
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:05,258
Let's break up.

610
00:44:13,094 --> 00:44:15,176
Let's not date until you graduate.

611
00:44:16,495 --> 00:44:18,413
We were able to wait for nine years.

612
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:20,848
It took us nine years to finally get together,

613
00:44:23,665 --> 00:44:25,018
and you want to do that again?

614
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,333
Why? Did Se Ho threaten you again?

615
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:31,436
Did he ask you to resign if you want to keep your job?

616
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,939
If that's why, I can just...

617
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:36,684
I can just drop out of school.

618
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:38,230
"Just drop out of school"?

619
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:41,214
Then what does that make Mr. Park for quitting his job...

620
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:42,567
just so he could protect you?

621
00:44:43,354 --> 00:44:44,883
And what about your mom...

622
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:47,419
whose wish is for you to graduate although she never says it?

623
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:53,808
And I...

624
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:57,587
I want to protect you as well.

625
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:02,596
So many people want to protect you.

626
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:04,585
Don't you get it?

627
00:45:07,044 --> 00:45:09,135
I'm not saying we should break up forever.

628
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:12,776
We just need to bear with it until you graduate.

629
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:15,427
Just until then.

630
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:17,996
Just for a little while.

631
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:22,364
Soo Jeong.

632
00:45:26,394 --> 00:45:27,848
Did you forget my dream?

633
00:45:34,804 --> 00:45:36,319
Let's not ignore Mr. Park and your mom...

634
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:39,028
just so the two of us can be happy.

635
00:45:39,374 --> 00:45:41,193
If you get kicked out of school again,

636
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:44,408
I don't think I'll ever be able to look at you.

637
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:50,236
So...

638
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:54,208
let's break up.

639
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:01,344
Soo Jeong.

640
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:21,867
I'll go now.

641
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,734
"Just drop out of school"?

642
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:14,873
Then what does that make Mr. Park for quitting his job...

643
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,289
just so he could protect you?

644
00:47:17,344 --> 00:47:18,873
And what about your mom...

645
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:21,338
whose wish is for you to graduate although she never says it?

646
00:47:23,245 --> 00:47:24,628
And I...

647
00:47:26,114 --> 00:47:28,407
I want to protect you as well.

648
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:49,133
The final exams are coming up.

649
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:51,373
So hurry up and get the questions ready.

650
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:53,714
There are always a few people who hand it in after the deadline.

651
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:55,533
But please don't do that this time.

652
00:47:57,215 --> 00:48:00,548
Will Ivy Class be able to regain their reputation this time?

653
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:03,550
Yes, don't worry.

654
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:06,784
The top student will come from my class this time.

655
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:12,335
It doesn't work.

656
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,217
Hello.

657
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:26,265
Ms. Son, are you sick?

658
00:48:26,574 --> 00:48:28,414
You look like a panda.

659
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,373
No, I'm fine. Maybe my mascara smudged.

660
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:53,167
Guys, we don't have much time left until the finals.

661
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,474
Now that you've tried studying, isn't it fun?

662
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:57,120
- No. - No.

663
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:17,075
Let's break up.

664
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:20,413
Okay, fine. Let's break up since it'll be best for everyone.

665
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:22,788
I'll just think of it as sending my girlfriend to the army.

666
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,178
You better not abandon me once it's over.

667
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:30,216
And don't drink the yakult that strangers give you.

668
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:32,463
Okay, I won't.

669
00:49:32,945 --> 00:49:36,418
I won't drink yakult until you get me one yourself.

670
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:42,627
I'll take revenge...

671
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:45,798
and graduate.

672
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:48,905
So wait for me.

673
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:50,835
Sure.

674
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:53,284
You can do everything you want.

675
00:49:54,965 --> 00:49:57,025
See you. Oh, and one more thing.

676
00:49:59,104 --> 00:50:00,418
This time, I dumped you.

677
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:04,572
I didn't get dumped. I dumped you, okay?

678
00:50:07,644 --> 00:50:08,685
I'm really going to go now.

679
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:23,179
How typical of him.

680
00:50:23,794 --> 00:50:26,259
Gosh, I was so cool.

681
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:28,812
That was really cool, Bok Su.

682
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,416
Good job.

683
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:54,466
Hey!

684
00:50:56,525 --> 00:50:57,635
Gosh.

685
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:00,464
Myung Ho, until when...

686
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:02,687
- are you going to live like this? - What?

687
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:05,103
Do you think you'll get promoted and get a raise...

688
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,933
if you do stuff like this?

689
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:15,774
How do you think people like us manage to keep our jobs?

690
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,945
Do you think they'll stay still if we refuse to do what we're told?

691
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:22,443
Bok Su, maybe it's because you're still young,

692
00:51:22,614 --> 00:51:23,783
but you really don't know the real world.

693
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:25,524
You keep doing everything for them...

694
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:27,110
regardless of whether it's legal or illegal.

695
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:29,615
But don't you know that it's getting your hands dirty?

696
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:31,435
Myung Ho.

697
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:34,010
Do you really not get it?

698
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:38,341
They'll cast you out because of everything you've done.

699
00:51:40,175 --> 00:51:41,851
You should side with the right person.

700
00:51:42,074 --> 00:51:44,831
They won't just end it by firing you.

701
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:48,970
You could get framed for everything.

702
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:52,238
You'll get ditched first.

703
00:51:57,485 --> 00:52:00,254
Then raise the price for employment.

704
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:03,800
They should pay that much for a teaching position at Seolsong.

705
00:52:06,294 --> 00:52:10,244
Principal Kim. Is this how you'll handle things?

706
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:13,586
How much?

707
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:18,004
How much do you get for hiring a teacher?

708
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:20,543
Keep your nose out of my business.

709
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:21,655
It's my school.

710
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:23,826
Your school?

711
00:52:23,985 --> 00:52:25,630
Is your school any different?

712
00:52:26,044 --> 00:52:28,609
I'm very different from you who run a business.

713
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:30,853
Different?

714
00:52:30,854 --> 00:52:33,353
You framed an old teacher and kicked him out.

715
00:52:33,354 --> 00:52:36,053
You created Wildflower Class with plausible causes.

716
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:38,216
But you're trying to get rid of the whole class.

717
00:52:38,665 --> 00:52:39,675
What's different?

718
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:42,694
Do you think what you're doing is refined?

719
00:52:42,695 --> 00:52:44,434
That has nothing to do with running the school.

720
00:52:44,435 --> 00:52:46,121
You're still making excuses.

721

Se Ho, you're my son.

722

You're just like me.

723
00:52:58,384 --> 00:52:59,668
Look at what you've done.

724
00:53:00,384 --> 00:53:03,656
Do you really think you're different from me?

725
00:53:03,854 --> 00:53:04,966
I'm different.

726
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:10,898
I'll show you that I'm different.

727
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:31,416

wish for?

Soo Jeong, you went through a proper procedure to...

746
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:48,227
I'm a corrupted teacher.

747
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:52,323
If I had wealthy parents, If I had money,

748
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:54,154
I would've been the first one to pay money...

749
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:55,305
to become a Seolsong teacher.

750
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:57,793
Whether Myung Ho took the money for himself or not,

751
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:00,390
I gave 50,000 dollars to buy a teaching position.

Well, I think there will be a more effective way.
