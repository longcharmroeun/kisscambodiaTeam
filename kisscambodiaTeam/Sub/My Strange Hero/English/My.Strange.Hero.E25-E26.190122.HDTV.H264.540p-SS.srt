1
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:12,478
Why would you leave out the employment irregularity issue?

2
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:17,094
That's the core of Seolsong's corruption.

3
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:20,965
- Soo Jeong, that's... - I'll testify.

4
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:29,983
(Must find witness)

5
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:31,167
(Witness found)

6
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,555
(Witness found)

7
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:39,916
I'm the witness and evidence that will reveal...

8
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,216
this rotten school's true color.

9
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:43,863
Hey, Soo Jeong.

10
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:46,389
You need a witness.

11
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:48,685
Did you forget?

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,091
I'm the corrupted employee.

13
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,003
You were scammed.

14
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,751
You know what you're talking about, don't you?

15
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,194
I do.

16
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:05,540
And I'm prepared.

17
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:13,436
We need to talk.

18
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:18,094
Don't do it, Soo Jeong. Stay out of this.

19
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,434
I'll do it. You need a witness.

20
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:22,174
I'll find a witness if we need one.

21
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,434
If we can't find one, we'll fill it with other evidence.

22
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,904
What evidence? Is there a better one than me?

23
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:27,915
Soo Jeong.

24
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:30,191
The moment you get involved,

25
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,385
your time as a teacher is over.

26
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,367
Don't you really get it?

27
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,512
I always had a debt of gratitude.

28
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,764
I felt ashamed whenever I saw the students.

29
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,260
I handed him money to get a permanent teaching position.

30
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:54,184
I knew it was wrong, but I turned a blind eye.

31
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,090
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

32
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,643
Students follow the path that's been made by the previous wayfarers.

33
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:05,029
That's what Mr. Park said.

34
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:07,840
I want my path to be something...

35
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:10,812
that the students aren't ashamed of.

36
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:13,546
Though I can't be a great teacher,

37
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:15,914
I want to be a good guide.

38
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,542
So let me be the witness.

39
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:21,738
It was your dream...

40
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,245
to become a teacher.

41
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:33,775
You found me that dream anyway.

42
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:39,150
Find me a different dream.

43
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,340
We found a photo...

44
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,748
of the answer sheet in Chae Min's mom's phone.

45
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,563
That's a clear test paper leak.

46
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:56,634
(Evidence of test paper leak found)

47
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,756
Donations were the price for it.

48
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,974
Donations were made regularly during exam periods.

49
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:04,056
That means it's been a regular practice.

50
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:06,989
How could they...

51
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,373
So many irregularities have been committed.

52
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,213
They pretty much did anything for money.

53
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,843
Chae Min, that jerk.

54
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:16,248
This was what made him so stuck-up.

55
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,754
Chae Min's mom having the answer sheets is circumstantial evidence.

56
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:23,294
But it's not direct evidence that proves Chae Min copying the answers.

57
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:27,234
If Chae Min did copy the answers,

58
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:30,394
that means he undermined all the other kids' hard work.

59
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:35,239
A student's life depends on it, so I want to be more careful.

60
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,755
I'll check one last time.

61
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,071
(Episode 25)

62
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:01,387
Hey, why are you following me?

63
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:03,548
Don't you know that we broke up?

64
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,963
Of course, I do.

65
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:08,358
That's why I'm keeping this much distance.

66
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:13,341
Go. Keep walking. Ex-girlfriend.

67
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:32,947
You better go home, ex-boyfriend.

68
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:34,682
Don't you think you're being too clingy?

69
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:37,686
- Bye. - Hey, Soo Jeong.

70
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,629
You know people live up to 100 now, right?

71
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,052
No one sticks to a single job all their life.

72
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:49,344
I'll help you find another dream.

73
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,741
I'll help you find your 2nd and 3rd dreams.

74
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:54,926
So...

75
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:57,770
don't be worried.

76
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:00,736
You have me.

Okay, everyone. I need your attention.

81
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,308
Starting from today,

82
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:36,220
Ms. Hong will replace Mr. Park.

83
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,270
I hope we continue to get along each other.

84
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,984
Right. Ms. Son.

85
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,133
You know the test questions are due today, right?

86
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,457
You're the only one who hasn't handed them in. Hurry up.

87
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:50,593
Okay, I'll send them to you today.

88
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:36,327
As for the class placement test we recently had,

89
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,453
it doesn't have much influence on your college entry.

90
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,101
You know that the finals...

91
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,271
are more important, right?

92
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,517
All you have to do is do well on your finals.

93
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:51,205
This time, the top score must come from our class...

94
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:53,423
to live up to our name.

95
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,997
I trust in you.

96
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:57,846
Especially...

97
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,245
Chae Min.

98
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,579
Hey, Chae Min.

99
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,926
I know you're good. What's the matter?

100
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,274
You must remain calm at a time like this...

101
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,474
so you can show off what you're capable of.

102
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,221
I know you're capable enough.

103
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,829
I heard you, so stop.

104
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,840
That punk.

105
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:19,997
Look at him.

106
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,547
He sleeps at school because he studies at home?

107
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:24,510
No wonder he always sleeps.

108
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:26,339
Does that mean he was studying every night?

109
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,480
He betrayed us.

110
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,785
Seung Woo. Hey.

111
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:33,478
Why are you so selfish?

112
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:36,329
- We should study together. - Yes.

113
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:39,055
Do you want to?

114
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:42,001
Are you up to studying intensely like Spartans?

115
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:45,803
- Yes. - Yes.

116
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,384
This one is the hardest...

117
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,425
Move.

118
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:53,183
- You little... - I don't understand this one.

119
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:54,639
Can you teach me?

120
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,737
Did you think I wouldn't hit you?

121
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,075
Gosh.

122
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:12,040
If Chae Min did copy the answers,

123
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:15,536
that means he undermined all the other kids' hard work.

(Status of Rebate Board Member Kim Ki Ho)

130
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:04,532
Just as you asked, I've organized rebate documents per board member.

131
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,223
For each company the board members are involved with,

132
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,563
I collected manipulated quotes and double bookkeeping,

133
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,594
as well as the money they collected personally.

134
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:15,004
Good work.

135
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,404
I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision to make.

136
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:19,828
Are you ready?

137
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:21,358
I was ready ages ago.

138
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:26,409
When and how I'll use these documents...

139
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,882
depend on my mother.

140
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:35,553
We'll now start the 49th board meeting...

141
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:36,705
of Seolsong Foundation.

142
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,664
We'll start with the chairperson's opening remarks...

143
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,108
and introduction.

144
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,965
Have you been well, everyone?

145
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:52,136
Next, we'll deliberate on today's agenda.

146
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:55,671
First on the agenda.

147
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:58,644
I'd like to propose the dismissal...

148
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:00,704
of the current chairman, Oh Se Ho.

149
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:11,221
If you have any opinions on this item, please share.

150
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:14,798
Chairman Oh Se Ho did his best,

151
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:16,833
but considering the problems...

152
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,664
we had with the Education Office and the parents,

153
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,203
it looks like he's not competent enough...

154
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,973
to run this school.

155
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,343
I believe it was good to have him as a temporary chairman...

156
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,364
at the time the school became a hot topic.

157
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,573
He's also too young.

158
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:34,083
Chairwoman Lim. I mean, Ms. Lim...

159
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,784
is still competent, so she should come back.

160
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:38,553
What do you think about...

161
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:41,413
having Chairman Oh come back later on?

162
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:45,340
Any other opinions?

163
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:50,134
Then this item will follow the majority's vote...

164
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,145
I do.

165
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,489
My opinion is a little different.

168
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,030
you each had with different companies.

169
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:36,713
Double bookkeeping allowed you to grow the rebate...

170
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,987
by ridiculous amounts.

171
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:41,703
I may not be competent...

172
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,136
and I'm a young temporary chairman.

173
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:47,754
The highly competent Chairwoman Lim and the board members...

174
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:49,442
have been working on this enormous rebate,

175
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,621
all the while using this school as a business to make a profit.

176
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,778
I want to join you.

177
00:12:58,064 --> 00:12:59,852
Please give me a position too.

178
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:02,530
It would be nice to work together, don't you think?

179
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,794
I think I'd be really upset...

180
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:11,261
if you left me out of this wonderful business.

181
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,423
According to the votes, the dismissal of Chairman Oh...

182
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,845

183
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,140
I told you to try...

184
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,038
to take the school away from me.

185
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:29,844
What's wrong?

186
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:34,128
Isn't this the kind of son you wanted?

187
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,827
You find people's weaknesses to control and threaten them.

188
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,603
Are you satisfied?

189
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,715
Satisfied?

190
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:43,359
Do you still not know me?

191
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:47,786
No matter what you do, you can never satisfy me.

192
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:50,070
You were wrong before you were even born.

193
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:03,497
I'm so sick of hearing such things...

194
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,678
from you.

195
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,769
Do you feel relieved?

196
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:17,325
I'm not sure.

197
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,529
I thought I would be,

198
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,198
but I don't feel as good as I expected.

199
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:25,795
Not yet.

200
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,553
- So? - What do you mean?

201
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:37,127
Se Ho stabbed his mom in the back in front of the board members.

202
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,851
It hit her hard.

203
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:42,359
Se Ho is young, but he's so sly.

204
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:47,174
Gosh, I really don't know whose side I should be on.

205
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:49,073
Should I choose Oh Se Ho or Lim Se Gyeong?

206
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:52,346
We're going to have to make a decision pretty soon.

207
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:57,522
What do you think? Who do you think seems better?

208
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:02,366
Gosh, my retirement is going to depend on this one choice.

209
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:05,124
Goodness, this is really confusing.

210
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,193
I need to choose the right person...

211
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:09,286
so that I won't end up wrecking my career.

212
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:14,988
By the way, what is that?

213
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:16,648
It's tonic juice made with 10 medicinal herbs.

214
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,890
Why don't you share...

215
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,267
Hey, Mom. What did you just say?

216
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:23,759
What an annoying little...

217
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,443
Gosh.

218
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:30,080
You all heard that they rejected the chairman's dismissal, right?

219
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:32,683
Does that mean Chairman Oh is going to continue being in charge?

220
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:35,323
To be honest, the school's been pretty chaotic...

221
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:38,124
ever since Chairman Oh was put in charge of the school.

222
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,624
He made Wildflower Class, accepted Bok Su, and fired Mr. Park.

223
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,664
Bad things keep happening.

224
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,917
I have this nervous feeling that something really bad...

225
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,203
is going to happen.

226
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,680
It kind of feels like the calm before the storm.

227
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:50,134
I have this weird gut feeling.

228
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:52,255
I totally agree with you.

229
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:57,774
We need to stay low at times like this.

230
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,511
You all better be careful not to stand out.

231
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:03,754
Ms. Son, did you make sure there weren't any mistakes...

232
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,353
with the final test questions and answer sheet?

233
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:06,364
Pardon?

234
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:09,404
- Yes. - Okay.

237
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,134
Okay, we got evidence to prove that the test questions were leaked.

238
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,245
Nice.

239
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,174
You don't seem very focused these days,

240
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,881
so I even got you the answer sheets for this semester's final test.

241
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:02,343
You'll become the top student as long as you stick to the answers.

242
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,941
Make sure you get the highest score this time, Chae Min.

243
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,156
Mom.

244
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,243
What if I get caught?

245
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:15,643
I'm scared, Mom.

246
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:20,793
I'll just try studying harder this time, so I can just...

247
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,583
You said you'd do better this time,

248
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:24,394
but you came in fifth place.

249
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,634
You're already doing your best.

250
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:29,765
You're just not competent enough.

251
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,037
Chae Min, you're useless if you're not the top student.

252
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,557
So what else can I do?

253
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,844
I have no choice but to help you out.

254
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:40,946
Fortunately, you have a very competent mom.

255
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:45,487
Just make sure you memorize all the answers.

256
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,235
I'll...

257
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,921
help you maintain your grades as the top student.

258
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:02,125
Goodness, wait right there.

259
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,703
Delicate women shouldn't carry heavy stuff like this.

260
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:08,836
You should ask So Jeong to carry stuff like this.

261
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:11,864
Your sister's also a woman.

262
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:15,922
No, she's not. She's like a general.

263
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:20,365
Meanwhile, you're very delicate, so you should take some rest.

264
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:28,618
I have something to say...

265
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:31,345
to you.

266
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:34,834
You're scaring me. What's wrong?

267
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,916
I'm...

268
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,187
going to take revenge.

269
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:43,644
You little punk. Just focus on studying!

270
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,314
You barely got back into school, and you're going to do what?

271
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:47,844
Studying isn't important right now.

272
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:50,253
The school's become a complete mess.

273
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,183
It's turned into a corporation.

274
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:53,983
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

275
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:56,624
Plus, Mr. Park got kicked out for trying to lead the school...

276
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,372
in the right direction.

277
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:01,909
That's why you want to take revenge?

278
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:04,085
I want to take revenge for making me get kicked out of school...

279
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:08,776
and for ruining the school for all the current students.

280
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,005
Then go ahead. That kind of revenge is acceptable.

281
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,086
"That kind of revenge"?

282
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,093
What kind of revenge did you think it would be?

283
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:20,844
I got worried thinking you might...

284
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:24,253
barge into the chairman's office with a knife or something.

285
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:26,523
I thought you might end up on the news.

286
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:27,983
What do you take me for?

287
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:31,459
But promise me one thing.

288
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:34,311
Promise me that you'll graduate.

289
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,664
You didn't leave school because you wanted to.

290
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:41,139
You made a tough decision to go back to school,

291
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,361
so please graduate this time. Okay?

292
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:46,585
Okay.

293
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:51,447
I'll graduate no matter what.

294
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:54,665
I'll make your wish come true.

295
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,065
What? What is this?

296
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,102

297
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:24,773
We're trying to get positive energy from you.

298
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:25,943
We figured we'll get one more question right...

299
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,114
if we touch the top student. Get back to sleep.

300
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:29,344
- Go back to sleep. - Get away from me.

301
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:31,054
- Get back to sleep. - Gosh, go away.

302
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,713
- Go away. - Give us positive energy.

303
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,384
Hey, give me your hands.

304
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:35,723
What's a wildflower?

305
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:37,394
- Spiraea prunifolia. - Spiraea prunifolia.

306
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,253
- Even if we get stepped on... - We will bloom!

307
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,864
- We can... - Do this!

308
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,905

Why? Do you think you would've gotten a better score than me again?

316

You're probably hoping I didn't do well.

If Seung Woo comes in first place again,

320

00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:53,956
Will you be all right?

360
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:57,443
By the way, Bok Su, if you fall in danger because of this.

361
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:00,777
Come on. We broke up. Why are you being so clingy?

362
00:26:04,885 --> 00:26:06,742
Reporting it to the media...

363
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:09,810
and to the education office were no use.

364
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,493
Something like this should be let out in the open,

365
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:13,706
that way they wouldn't dare touch us.

366
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:15,338
Because they're conscious of the public opinion.

367
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,378
Don't worry too much.

368
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:21,079
This is something I should do.

369
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:39,819
Ms. Son, I think the answer to this Korean question is wrong.

370
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:42,581
This short-answer question...

371
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:43,735
You're right.

372
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,811
I know that the answer is wrong.

373
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,343
(Episode 26 will air shortly.)

374
00:26:57,935 --> 00:26:58,994
(Teachers' Office)

375
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:01,963
Ms. Son. What were you thinking?

376
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,233
You've never made...

377
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,395
such a mistake before. Why now?

378
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:08,304
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:09,820
Gosh.

380
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:12,060
Correct the answer and post it.

381
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:27,353
You know it happens sometimes. Why is everyone making a fuss?

382
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,893
Well, Chae Min's score will drop because of this.

383
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:31,975
Really?

384
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:34,033
Chae Min's mom will be furious.

385
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:38,003
I'm more scared of Chae Min's mom than the other loud moms.

386
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,549
Anyway, Ms. Son.

387
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:43,478
Did Chae Min get this question right then got it wrong?

388
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,073
How did he get it right?

389
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:47,064
The answer was completely different.

390
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:49,914
- Was it impossible to get it right? - That's right.

391
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:53,083
It's a short-answer question. How can he write the wrong answer?

392
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:56,323
The question is so easy, level four students could get it.

393
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,454
Did Chae Min really get it wrong?

394
00:27:57,455 --> 00:27:58,536
Ms. Hong.

395
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,178
Please watch your mouth.

396
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:05,383
You're talking about our students.

397
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,080
Do you want people to gossip about it?

398
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,696
This was wrong.

399
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:28,795
I knew it.

400
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:31,414
I didn't think I'd get such an easy question wrong.

401
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:32,523
I got it too.

402
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,616
Ms. Son must've lost it after going to Wildflower Class.

403
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:35,704
You're right.

404
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,091
Chae Min. Did your score go up too?

405
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:45,251
But you got perfect on the test.

406
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:56,834
Be quiet, jerk.

407
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:59,634
Well, it's strange.

408
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:01,870
Did you get this question right?

409
00:29:02,985 --> 00:29:04,975
The answer was completely wrong. So how?

410
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:08,284
- It was a coincidence. - I see.

411
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:10,694
Writing three wrong answers...

412
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:12,180
to three wrong short-answer questions...

413
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,020
I think there's zero percent chance.

414
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,016
Bok Su.

415
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:55,961
You seem busy these days.

416
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:58,669
Keep in mind that you're a student here.

417
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:01,867
For Mr. Park who left the school for you,

418
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:03,843
you better stay low.

419
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:08,329
Don't ever talk about Mr. Park again.

420
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,747
Okay, Bok Su.

421
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:20,548
You do your thing.

422
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:23,420
I'll do mine.

425
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:30,996
Okay.

426
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,728
Drink it. It's instant coffee.

427
00:30:35,445 --> 00:30:36,884
You need a sugar fix now.

428
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,571
Right on time.

430
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:45,053
Team Manager Yang. You've done well.

431
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:48,194
I just did my best for the client.

432
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:51,963
Team Manager Yang, you're so professional.

433
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:55,438
A professional gets paid and does the work.

434
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,903
Bok Su paid us.

435
00:30:57,904 --> 00:31:00,763
Let's return the money to Bok Su.

436
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,773
Nine years ago, I felt really bad for Bok Su.

437
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:07,088
Because I couldn't do anything for him.

438
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:12,694
This isn't a job. I'm paying Bok Su back.

Mr. CEO.

441
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,323
I was thinking the same.

442
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:23,283
You're the best.

443
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,086
Let's do a good job until the end.

444
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,063
Because it's about our friend Bok Su.

445
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:32,165
And after we finish this,

446
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,485
let's go...

447
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:36,085
on a trip.

448
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,584
A trip?

449
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,157
Yes, let's go.

450
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,495
Us.

451
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:48,376

It's the New Year, so we'll mentally get prepared.

455
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:02,834
We'll plan our company's future together.

456
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,133
It'll be a meaningful time.

457
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:05,144
I won't go.

458
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,957
My parents won't allow me to sleep out.

459
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:17,664
I was going to say it was just me and her.

460
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:20,937
Can't she really sleep out?

461
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,809
Then what should I do with the reservation?

462
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:29,620
What? Didn't we break up?

463
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:31,682
Why do you keep calling me?

464
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:35,768
Are you usually this clingy when you date?

465
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:40,196
I need to be clingy for a minute.

466
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:44,344
"I can't live without you. Please go out with me again."

467
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:46,613
If you're going to say that, save it.

468
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:49,412
I'm not interested in women who are clingy.

469
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:51,833
Sure. I won't be.

470
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:54,113
I'll keep it somewhere...

471
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:57,356
really deep in my heart where you can't find it.

472
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:01,901
Well... Not too deep, so I can find it again.

473
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,175
By the way, why?

474
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:10,545
Bok Su.

475
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:15,708
I gave 50,000 dollars back to Se Ho.

476
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:20,994
I heard you already knew.

477
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:23,557
Why didn't you tell me?

478
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:32,426
It might sound like an excuse,

479
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:36,525
but I thought you should...

480
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:38,908
hear it from Se Ho.

481
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:43,338
If I told you, then you...

482
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:46,892
might feel more miserable.

483
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:55,214
I heard you knew nine years ago that it was Se Ho...

484
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:59,255
who spread the rumor about me living on food stamps.

485
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:03,424
I was afraid you might get hurt again...

486
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:05,415
because of...

487
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:07,266
the same thing.

488
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:10,791
It's been tough for you too,

489
00:34:11,235 --> 00:34:14,527
and we barely got to resolve our misunderstandings.

490
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,332
I didn't want you to feel guilty again.

491
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:24,066
I should've told you earlier.

492
00:34:25,514 --> 00:34:28,242
It was just a little hard to do.

493
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,271
I'm sorry, Soo Jeong.

00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:37,404
There's nothing else I don't know about, right?

495
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,171
No. Nothing at all.

00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:45,128
No matter what situation we're in, let's trust each other from now.

00:36:58,094 --> 00:36:59,447
Look at the view count.

539
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:04,546
Actually,

540
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:08,144
they were exaggerating the prices...

541
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:10,165
to get a payback.

542
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:14,828
We were able to get our hands on the double bookkeeping...

543
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:16,426
between the school and the partner companies.

544
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:21,698
We always promise to donate enough.

545
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:27,593
In exchange of donations, test questions were leaked.

546
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:29,009
(Video of Seolsong High School's test paper getting leaked)

547
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:32,056
The teacher is like the sky.

548
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:34,387
It's a position we all should look up to,

549
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:38,340
but at Seolsong High school, it was purchased and sold.

550
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:44,273
Today, we brought an anonymous whistleblower...

551
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:47,505
who had to make a very difficult decision.

552
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:50,309
I'm a teacher at Seolsong High School.

553
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:53,313
At Seolsong High School, the teacher's positions...

554
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,143
are being bought and sold with money.

555
00:37:55,684 --> 00:37:57,776
I'm someone who was offered such a deal.

556
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,353
Aside from me, other teachers were tempted...

557
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:03,648
and they made the wrong choice. There is a list of our names.

558
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,634
- Honey. - Seolsong High School...

559
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,063
has a very big problem with employment corruption.

560
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:10,333
If an investigation starts,

561
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:13,364
I'll reveal my identity and stand as a witness.

562
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:17,244
I don't want to stand in front of the children...

563
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:18,843
- in shame anymore. - What happened?

564
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:20,431
That's why I volunteered to stand up.

565
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:23,544
I'm so sorry.

566
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:24,998
(Seolsong High School's teacher)

567
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:27,070
We need your help...

568
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:30,049
to get the related organization to officially investigate...

569
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,316
Seolsong High School's corruption.

570
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:37,128
I'm sure the school will sue me for defamation,

571
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:39,933
but would such a school...

572
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:43,504
have any honor left to protect?

573
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,615
Here's the next story.

574
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:46,933
A video about the corruption...

575
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:50,541
of a certain school has gone viral on a streaming site.

576
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:54,374
I told you to get rid of Bok Su.

577
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,405
Did you have to ruin my school like this?

578
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:07,238
Bok Su is smarter than I thought.

579
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:10,681
We need to meet up right away.

580
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:19,159
Chairwoman Lim, what do you mean?

581
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,567
Since the situation came to this,

582
00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:25,713
you need to be responsible.

583
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:26,874
Chairwoman Lim,

584
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,244
did I do this by myself? I only followed your orders.

585
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:30,255
Exactly.

586
00:39:35,354 --> 00:39:37,101
We did it together.

587
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:43,125
You can't get out of this.

588
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,147
Don't you get it?

589
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,455
Just consider it as a way to save the school.

590
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:52,944
Are you telling me...

591
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:55,619
to take all the blame by myself?

592
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:59,134
Are you cutting me off so that only you can get away from this?

593
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,035
I'm a teacher too.

594
00:40:03,214 --> 00:40:05,083
I taught kids for a long time.

595
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:07,205
If I count all the kids that have gone through me so far...

596
00:40:08,954 --> 00:40:11,682
I can't do it. I still can't.

597
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,834
Mr. Kim.

598
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,277
You have to be extra wise...

599
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,612
when faced with a crisis.

600
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,864
What are you doing? Hurry up and go!

601
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:32,686
I...

602
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:35,858
really can't go.

603
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:39,295
What do I do now?

604
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:43,284
All the kids must know. Everyone would know.

605
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:46,426
You must act more shameless at a time like this.

606
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:48,693
How can I do that?

607
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:50,078
Because you must.

608
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:57,566
Go to school and say that it wasn't you.

609
00:40:58,005 --> 00:41:01,166
Tell them it's a coincidence, and tell them not to suspect you.

610
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:05,472
- Mom. - You can't take time off school.

611
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:09,442
That means you admit to everything. Don't you get it?

612
00:41:12,314 --> 00:41:13,769
There's no place to step back.

613
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,902
If you can't become shameless,

614
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:19,466
then it's over.

615
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:28,631
Hey, hey, our school's name is being researched the most.

616
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:30,764
Isn't it a first?

617
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:32,233
This school was the top trending topic before...

618
00:41:32,234 --> 00:41:33,803
thanks to Young Min and Bok Su.

619
00:41:33,804 --> 00:41:35,562
I didn't notice when I was in Ivy Class,

620
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:38,044
but our school discriminates a lot.

621
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:41,544
I can't believe I get low grades because our family's poor.

622
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:42,827
Hey, that's not right.

623
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:45,639
Why not? They bought test answers with money.

624
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,300
I could get 100 percent if I had that.

625
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,835
Do you think so?

626
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:50,668
Hey, old man.

627
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:52,607
Are you here?

628
00:41:53,824 --> 00:41:56,349
"Are you here?" Why are you awkwardly being polite?

629
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:59,727
Bok Su, you're the hero in my life.

630
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,047
Gye So Ra.

631
00:42:02,165 --> 00:42:03,820
The hero in your life is you.

632
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:08,159
By the way, is everything true?

633
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:11,404
Would I have released it if it wasn't true?

634
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,566
I knew it. Money was the problem.

635
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,044
Wake up.

636
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:16,683
Why didn't you tell me if you were going to shoot?

637
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,284
The editing style was old-fashioned.

638
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,853
How could I ask you guys for help?

639
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:20,983
This is too dangerous.

640
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:22,154
What about you?

641
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:23,497
What if you get into danger?

642
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:25,571
You shouldn't live so rough.

643
00:42:25,694 --> 00:42:27,412
Stop making us worry.

644
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:29,847
Should we become his bodyguards?

645
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:30,924
Get close, come on.

646
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,764
What are these young kids doing?

647
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:35,058
We're in the same class, so we're all friends.

648
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:36,664
Let's go, Bok Su!

649
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:38,004
You must be nuts.

650
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,803
I look older than you.

651
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:41,374
I agree completely.

652
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,443
- That's true, but I'm older. - Let's go.

653
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:44,657
Let me go, you punks.

654
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:57,194
Okay.

655
00:42:57,584 --> 00:42:59,723
- I'm so sorry. - Don't worry, ma'am.

656
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:01,613
We'll be in touch when things are sorted out.

657
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,543
- Yes, sure. - Don't worry.

658
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:07,634
No. That never happened.

659
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,634
How can our school have such corruption?

660
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:11,796
No, of course not.

661
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:13,433
Of course not, ma'am.

662
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:15,090
What? The evidence?

663
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:18,507
They were all forged. Yes.

664
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:22,044
You shouldn't doubt us so easily.

665
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:25,852
Never. It never happened.

666
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,806
What's going to happen to this school?

667
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:35,323
Wouldn't it become more transparent? I noticed so many irregularities.

668
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:38,596
Exactly. I can't believe the school accepted bribery to hire teachers.

669
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:43,203
That means there are teachers among us who paid money to get hired.

670
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,073
I'm sure that's not true.

671
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:54,590
We're already busy dealing with the parents. Don't add onto this.

672
00:43:56,745 --> 00:44:00,149
Gosh, I can't believe Bok Su caused this mess.

673
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:01,936
Ms. Son.

674
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:04,169
Did you really not know about this?

675
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:09,305
No.

676
00:44:10,794 --> 00:44:13,865
Who do you think paid money to get hired as a full-time teacher?

677
00:44:13,964 --> 00:44:18,075
I never imagined something like that would happen in our school.

678
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:22,203
Gosh, let's not doubt each other.

679
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,574
She's right. Nothing's been proven yet.

680
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:26,796
The whistleblower didn't even reveal his or her identity.

681
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:30,241
That person's even willing to get investigated by the police.

682
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:34,067
Let's see.

683
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:39,208
Ms. Hong, it's not you, is it?

684
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:41,065
Hey!

685
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:44,539
Are you serious right now?

686
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,963
Gosh, you startled me.

687
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:51,459
Ms. Hong, I'm joking.

688
00:44:57,145 --> 00:44:58,285
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:58,504 --> 00:45:00,939
Forget it. Answer your phone.

690
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:05,266
Yes, this is Seolsong...

691
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:07,428
Hello, ma'am.

692
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:10,200
No, ma'am.

693
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:14,363
No, that was all fabricated.

694
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:18,862
Yes, we'll call you as soon as we check the facts.

699
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:49,745
Of course, it was him.

700
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:51,610
He's unbelievable.

701
00:45:52,264 --> 00:45:54,718
- I'm surprised he came to school. - That's how he got full marks?

702
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,703
He's seriously something.

703

- Unlike him, I have to study. - Exactly.

704
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:00,092
- He's so brazen. - I'm kind of jealous of him.

705

Kang Bok Su!

706
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:15,324
How can you be so confident?

707
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:17,523
Do you know what kind of trouble you've caused?

708
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,736
No, I don't.

709
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:20,105
And...

710
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:23,424
I'm not the one who caused trouble. It was the school.

711
00:46:23,425 --> 00:46:26,033
Hey, are you even aware of what you've done?

712
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,493
You ruined the lives of so many students.

713
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,003
They need to go to prestigious universities,

714
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:31,433
but you ruined everything!

00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,733
I only stated the truth.

716
00:46:33,734 --> 00:46:36,199
But if that truth ends up ruining the students' lives,

717
00:46:36,345 --> 00:46:38,163
would I really be the one to blame?

718
00:46:38,274 --> 00:46:39,874
Shouldn't the ones who schemed things...

719
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,460
behind people's backs hold responsibility?

720
00:46:57,994 --> 00:46:59,307
Who do you think you are...

721
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:01,714
Mr. Song, you need to watch the television.

722
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:03,514
What's going on?

723
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:10,802
I am responsible for everything that got revealed.

724
00:47:10,905 --> 00:47:12,560
I'm sorry for causing a stir.

725
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:15,674
I'll resign from my position as the principal and receive my punishment.

(Seolsong High School Press Conference)

727
00:47:25,895 --> 00:47:28,652
Chairman Oh, a press conference is being held in the auditorium.

728
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:31,709
It's happening way faster than I expected.

729
00:47:32,994 --> 00:47:34,933
Are you saying you're fully responsible...

730
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:37,732
for all the irregularities that got revealed?

731
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:39,773
(I am solely responsible for all the irregularities.)

732
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,774
Yes, I did everything on my own.

733
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:45,763
And once again, I'd like to apologize for everything.

734
00:47:57,425 --> 00:48:00,930
I feel greatly responsible for not being aware...

735
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:06,544
of all the irregularities that were happening in the school...

736
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:08,110
after I had resigned from my position as the chairwoman.

737
00:48:10,004 --> 00:48:12,458
In order to take responsibility of the incident,

738
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,834
the principal...

739
00:48:14,835 --> 00:48:17,835
and the current chairman will be dismissed.

740
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,942
And our foundation will make sure things go back to normal...

741
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:23,668
so that Seolsong stays as the most prestigious school in the area...

742
00:48:23,845 --> 00:48:26,178
for the sake of our students.

743
00:48:26,184 --> 00:48:27,467
I really...

744
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:31,136
I'm sorry.

745
00:48:36,694 --> 00:48:40,471
I really think of this school like my own child.

746
00:48:41,895 --> 00:48:43,752
So I will do my best to protect it.

747
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:47,198
Once again, I'd like to deeply...

748
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:52,153
and sincerely apologize for what happened.

(Seolsong High School Press Conference)

750
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:24,874
Mr. Kim, why did you lie?

751
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,743
I know you didn't do it alone.

752
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:29,683
You already saw the CCTV footage. You're the one who revealed it.

753
00:49:29,684 --> 00:49:30,844
Did you also lend your bank account to the school?

754
00:49:30,845 --> 00:49:33,541
Yes. I mean, no. That's not it.

755
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:37,894
Mr. Kim, the money that was involved adds up to millions...

756
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:39,993
Actually, it adds up to tens of millions of dollars...

757
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:41,824
if you consider the fact that it's been done for 10 years.

758
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:44,793
And you're saying you're responsible for all that money?

759
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:46,410
Why are you lying?

760
00:49:49,305 --> 00:49:50,664
I did everything.

761
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:52,826
I'll go to court if I have to.

762
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:05,105
Being a high school principal...

763
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:07,475
isn't the only academic profession you can have.

764
00:50:08,115 --> 00:50:11,215
You should invest wisely in your future.

765
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:12,909
Think about what that would be.

766
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:14,723
What do you mean?

767
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:16,714
If you help me deal with this case,

768
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:20,466
I'll make sure you become the president of a university.

769
00:50:21,264 --> 00:50:23,064
Doing business in education...

770
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:25,661
safely guarantees profits like no other.

771
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:28,703
And universities make the biggest profit.

772
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:32,473
With the money I've earned and gathered in Seolsong,

773
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:35,513
I was in the process of drawing a very big picture.

774
00:50:35,514 --> 00:50:39,454
And you were included in that blueprint of mine.

775
00:50:42,684 --> 00:50:45,825
Let's be honest. You played a very big part...

776
00:50:46,024 --> 00:50:47,843
in my business anyway.

777
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:50,621
So it's only right that you partially take responsibility.

778
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:54,293
And while you're at it, just take responsibility for everything.

779
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:56,718
Then I'd like you to become...

780
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:59,120
the president of Seolsong University.

781
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:02,933
You know that I'm a woman of my word, right?

782
00:51:04,274 --> 00:51:05,516
Keep this in mind.

783
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:08,730
If I go down,

784
00:51:10,514 --> 00:51:13,646
your career of the past 30 years...

785
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,670
will end up disappearing as well.

786
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,466
I made a good deal.

787
00:51:22,024 --> 00:51:25,024
So many people take the blame and return to better lives.

788
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:44,443
You really know how to cut people off.

789
00:51:44,444 --> 00:51:47,009
I already had it prepared just in case you caused trouble.

790
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:50,684
I can't believe you let Bok Su beat you with something like this.

791
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:54,094
It was just bad timing. It's not over yet.

792
00:51:54,095 --> 00:51:55,337
It's over for you.

793
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:57,944
And it's all because of Bok Su.

794
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,263
All you had to do was hire someone...

795
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:02,804
and just get rid of...

796
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,955
both Bok Su and Soo Jeong.

797
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:08,948
Are you so happy...

798
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:11,786
that it's over for me?

799
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:14,728
I'm your son.

800
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:21,380
Earlier, you said you thought of this school like your own child.

801
00:52:24,454 --> 00:52:25,839
And I was really dumbfounded.

802
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:29,011
Do you even care about your child?

803
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,763
Why is it that I've never felt that from you?

804
00:52:32,764 --> 00:52:33,804
You're right.

805
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:38,289
I never thought you were precious.

806
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:41,296
- Mom. - Don't even call me that.

807
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,473
You once said I should love you no matter how incompetent you are...

808
00:52:44,474 --> 00:52:46,231
because I'm your mom.

809
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:47,890
If you really think of me as your son,

810
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,713
you should love me...

811
00:52:49,714 --> 00:52:52,067
even though I'm so incompetent and unsatisfactory.

812
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:54,253
I had to become strong and sturdy...

813
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,213
in order to protect Seolsong. But what did you do?

814
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:59,414
You kept whining for me to love you.

815
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,408
Oh, and there's one more.

816
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:04,394
You jumped from the rooftop because you were so weak.

817
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:05,394
Mom!

818
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:07,864
You and this school are the only two things I got...

819
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:09,622
as alimony from that family when I got abandoned.

820
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:15,206
I dedicated my entire life to this school, and this is all I get?

821
00:53:17,345 --> 00:53:18,718
Aside from the fact that I'm your mom,

822
00:53:19,214 --> 00:53:20,892
as a human being,

823
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,031
I really despise...

824
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:25,303
weak people like you.

825
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:36,034
I also...

826
00:53:38,964 --> 00:53:40,782
really hate...

827
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:43,676
you.

828
00:53:45,335 --> 00:53:46,345
No.

829
00:53:46,504 --> 00:53:48,604
You've always acted like...

830
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:51,170
a dog that needed affection.

831
00:53:51,474 --> 00:53:54,474
No matter how much I hit you, you kept wagging your tail.

832
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:56,128
Don't you think I know that?

833
00:54:00,355 --> 00:54:02,031
You've never given me...

834
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,567
affection.

835
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:11,099
I can't believe you're my son.

836
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:14,064
Even if I hate you, you're my only child.

837
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:17,135
So after I die, this will all be yours, right?

838
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:21,164
Just be satisfied with it and leave.

839
