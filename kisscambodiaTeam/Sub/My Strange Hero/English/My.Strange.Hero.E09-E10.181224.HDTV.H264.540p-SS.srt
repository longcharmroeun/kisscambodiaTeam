1
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,050
Bok Su is...

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,479
the most dangerous student...

3
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,520
this school has ever seen.

4
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,670
Since his homeroom teacher thinks that way...

5
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,000
But what he did was damaging school property,

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,040
and the punishment that can be given is volunteer work,

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,180
not expulsion.

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,909
Just volunteer work?

9
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,150
He's not an ordinary student.

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,019
You acknowledged it yourself.

11
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:51,750
He's the most dangerous student this school has ever seen.

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,349
Yes, that's right.

13
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,120
He's dangerous.

14
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,500
But he's a student of Seolsong High School.

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,800
He's a student who has a lot to learn.

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,470
If you expel a student every time they do something wrong,

17
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:12,170
how many students do you think would be left in our school?

18
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,810
He's 27 years old. He's not a student.

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,379
He's in school right now, so he's a student.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,280
Does such a dangerous student also deserve to be protected?

21
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:25,220
A school should protect all the other virtuous students...

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,989
and provide them with the best possible environment...

23
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,019
for concentrating on their studies.

24
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,920
We will impose sanctions on him if he becomes a threat...

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,129
to the other students.

26
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,230
Who will do that?

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,560
You?

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,330
You only just got hired as a full-time teacher.

29
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:42,599
I don't think it's the right time for you to recklessly act out.

30
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,670
I'll take responsibility.

31
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:51,810
What did you say?

32
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,950
- What did you just say? - I said I'll take responsibility...

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,489
of Bok Su.

34
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,530
How? How are you going to take responsibility?

35
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,500
- Well... - If Bok Su causes trouble again,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,499
how about you give up...

37
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:16,839
your position as a full-time teacher to take responsibility?

38
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:20,670
If you can't do that, we will go ahead and punish...

39
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,209
Okay, I'll take responsibility...

40
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,510
and give up my job if necessary.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,989
Do you realize what you're putting yourself into...

42
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,519
by saying that?

43
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,160
Of course. I may be a teacher that doesn't know much,

44
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,290
but I still know that I should protect my students.

45
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,300
And dangerous students also have the right...

46
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,230
to be protected by the school.

47
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,999
That means he shouldn't be expelled due to the selfishness...

48
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,999
of the top students' parents.

49
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:54,369
Listen to me, Ms. Son.

50
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:55,980
Do you know who I am?

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,309
Yes, of course.

52
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,610
You're Chae Min's mother.

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,149
But to me, Chae Min and Bok Su are both...

54
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:07,749
the same students that I must try hard to protect.

55
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,290
Keep in mind that everyone here...

56
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,999
has heard your thoughts.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,369
We will deliver your thoughts to the chairman on behalf of the committee.

58
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,040
You used the word "responsibility" very thoughtlessly.

59
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:28,469
And you'll have to take responsibility for having done so.

60
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,860
Are you okay, sir?

61
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,830
Ms. Son!

62
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,300
Don't you know how much authority she has?

63
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,510
Why did you have to handle it that way?

64
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,880
You better deal with this.

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,249
Why did you do that, Ms. Son?

66
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,650
Soo Jeong.

67
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,389
Are you crazy?

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,489
Why did you get involved?

69
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,989
Why did you risk your job?

70
00:04:54,989 --> 00:04:56,230
I'm your homeroom teacher.

71
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,660
Who else would step up for you?

72
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,030
Hey, you even paid 50,000 dollars for...

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,369
That's none of your business.

74
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,069
Just thank me if you're grateful.

75
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,210
Hey, I never asked you to do this.

76
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,949
I'm not grateful at all.

77
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,650
And I hate that you're getting involved in my business.

78
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,749
Then you shouldn't have become my student.

79
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,819
I'm not doing this for you.

80
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,520
I'm just doing what I need to do as a teacher.

81
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,189
If you no longer want to get involved with me,

82
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,230
you better not cause trouble again.

83
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,110
What do you mean "why"?

84
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm the homeroom teacher of Wildflower Class.

85
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,020
Even so, why are you taking things so far?

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,590
The president of the committee has a lot of power over the school.

87
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,689
The mothers move in a group.

88
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,460
If they start to speak negatively about you...

89
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,600
- Bok Su's my student. - Exactly.

90
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,160
We're talking about Bok Su here.

91
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,699
Why did you make such a decision?

92
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,939
Why are you so curious?

93
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,619
The school bell will ring soon. I have to get to a class.

94
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,489
I'll be off now, Chairman Oh.

95
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:39,670
She's right.

96
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
Why am I still curious?

97
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,239
I must be crazy. I must've been out of my mind.

98
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,079
It's only been a few days since I became a full-time teacher.

99
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,040
How could I risk my job because of that punk?

100
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,980
No, I'm not a petty person that takes revenge on my enemies.

101
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,819
Did you see that, Bok Su?

102
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,989
I'm your teacher.

103
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,629
Let's see. Ta-da.

104
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,900
Here.

105
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,040
Drink everything. Great job.

106
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,949
Gosh, it tastes so bitter.

107
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,809
It helps you become smart.

108
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,550
You're already smart as it is.

109
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,249
I'm worried that you might become even smarter.

110
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,689
I don't want any of that, So Jeong. You're so cheap.

111
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,660
This is good for the stamina.

112
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,300
But you're already so full of energy.

113
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,100
So full that you even caused trouble at that age.

114
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,600
So what's the use of taking tonics?

115
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,139
See? I told you.

116
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,379
I told you this was going to happen.

117
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,179
Come talk to me if you ever get in trouble again.

118
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,420
I'll tell you exactly what will happen then.

119
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,980
- Stop acting out. - Hey, hey.

120
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,119
- What? - Don't mess with my son.

121
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:20,329
By the way, thanks for earlier.

122
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,939
Don't cause trouble, and just graduate.

123
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,970
I'll earn a lot and buy you tonics that will help with your studies.

124
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,910
My son.

125
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,379
Let's go inside.

126
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,879
I'll give you a really nice scalp massage. Come on.

127
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,520
Mom, why are you carrying something so heavy?

128
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,189
No, don't bother. It'll only bother with your studies.

129
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:42,250
I'll just carry it until there.

130
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,660
This isn't heavy at all.

131
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,459
- It's okay. - Excuse me.

132
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,599
What brings you here at this hour?

133
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,829
You little punk.

134
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,400
Do you know how worried I was?

135
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,829
- But I couldn't reach you all day. - Be quiet. Wait.

136
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:55,870
What is it?

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,839
I know our restaurant makes really delicious jjajangmyeon,

138
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,410
but you can't come after business hours.

139
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,309
It's not like I'm not allowed to come.

140
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,839
- Goodness, Mr. Park. - Hello, Ms. Lee.

141
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,079
- You're here. - Yes.

142
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,809
I'm here to use my coupons.

143
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:13,050
You can only use them before 8pm.

144
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,990
- Pardon? - You can't use them today.

145
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,760
Then... Then I'll just pay.

146
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,689
Instead, I'll fix you a meal. You should eat with us.

147
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,699
Goodness, that's not really necessary.

148
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,130
- No, wait. Let's go. - What? Why?

149
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,530
- I'll buy you dinner. - Wait.

150
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,939
- Ms. Lee, I'll come back next time. - Okay. Bye.

151
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,640
My gosh, okay.

152
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,760
I was worried. I'm so relieved.

153
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,290
This is all thanks to Soo Jeong, you know.

154
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,370
She gets paid to be a teacher. It's the least she could do.

155
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,670
Hey, getting paid isn't all there is to a teacher's job.

156
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,339
Seeing you guys grow.

157
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,939
Helping you guys get back on your feet whenever you fall down.

158
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,240
That's what makes it so worthwhile.

159
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,809
Not all teachers are like that.

160
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,550
She's just doing it for the money.

161
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,809
How do you know that?

162
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,880
Do you think it's easy to step up in that kind of situation?

163
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,890
Just thank her if you're grateful.

164
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,319
Me? I'm not grateful.

165
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,359
Who says I'm grateful? She's such a headache.

166
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,030
I mean, who ever asked her for help?

167
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,459
Why did she have to step up and put her job at risk?

168
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,530
Look at you. You must be worried.

169
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,339
Worried, my foot.

170
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:39,439
She's responsible for all the bad things that happen to her.

171
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,640
My gosh, you punk.

172
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,780
Will you please grow up?

173
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,179
Soo Jeong's a true teacher for standing up...

174
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,510
for a guy like you just because you're her student.

175
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,650
Mr. Park.

176
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,689
Why do you think...

177
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,699
Soo Jeong did that for me? I don't really get it.

178
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,839
Why do you ask? Do you still have lingering feelings for her?

179
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,569
No, even if that's not the case...

180
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,079
Perhaps, I might.

181
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,679
I'm not sure. No one can tell how Soo Jeong feels.

182
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,420
But it was the right thing to do as a teacher.

183
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,819
As a teacher?

184
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,130
What an amazing teacher.

185
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,890
Anyway, from now on,

186
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,959
you two share the same destiny.

187
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,300
If you fall into a ditch,

188
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,699
so will Soo Jeong.

189
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,510
That's why you need to wake up.

190
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,620
I forgot.

191
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,929
I'm so cold. What is it?

192
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,099
Don't tell me you got fired.

193
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:17,800
I knew this would happen.

194
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,170
No.

195
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,170
Why not? Why didn't you get fired?

196
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,109
Because of Soo Jeong.

197
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,079
What about Soo Jeong? What did she say?

198
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,510
She said,

199
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,819
"Okay, I'll take responsibility and give up my job if necessary."

200
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:33,849
"To me,"

201
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:36,890
"both are the same students that I must try hard to protect."

202
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:38,589
That's what she said.

203
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,229
Take responsibility? Give up her job?

204
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:42,559
That's crazy.

205
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:43,900
But why?

206
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,699
Did you find her weakness?

207
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,069
Does she still have feelings for me?

208
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,969
This will make things complicated.

209
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:54,709
I went back for my revenge.

210
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,939
I'm cold.

211
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,050
I'm leaving.

212
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,849
If it's something like this, do it over the phone.

213
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,349
Why does Soo Jeong confuse me so much?

214
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,890
Hey.

215
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,800
Hey, wait for me.

216
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,809
I'm home.

217
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,949
Mr. Yoon called.

218
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,819
I heard you haven't dealt with Kang Bok Su yet.

219
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,990
Things got a little complicated.

220
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,120
- Mother. - That's all you're capable of.

221
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,929
I shouldn't expect any more from you.

222
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

223
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Next time...

224
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,300
I won't disappoint you again.

225
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,770
That's all you're capable of.

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,439
I shouldn't expect any more from you.

227
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,949
That's all you're capable of.

228
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,059
I shouldn't expect any more from you.

229
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,000
Hey, hey, hey.

230
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,740
The exams are over. Why do you look so depressed?

231
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,179
Let's go. I'll treat you.

232
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,780
- It's okay. - Hey. Class President.

233
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:42,780
Class President!

234
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,550
- Do you want to eat jjajangmyeon? - Yes.

235
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,089
Bok Su, your friends are so good-looking.

236
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:55,829
This is Oh Se Ho. He just transferred here.

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,459
- Hello. - How handsome.

238
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,900
I think you're more handsome than my son.

239
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,569
No way.

240
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,939
This is Son Soo Jeong. You met her before, right?

241
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,140
She's my...

242
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:09,839
You know...

243
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,439
I'm Son Soo Jeong.

244
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,709
How can you be so pretty?

245
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,050
You're eating so well.

246
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,620
Right?

247
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:23,990
You're the top student at school,

248
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,790
and you're the second top student.

249
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,530
Why do you guys hang out with Bok Su?

250
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,660
He gets the worst marks.

251
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,699
No, Gyeong Hyeon gets the worst marks.

252
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,469
Does he know your weakness or something?

253
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,300
Do you have to be smart to become friends?

254
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,170
Enough about marks. Stop nagging at In Ho too.

255
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,839
You used to get bad marks too. Why do you nag at him?

256
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,280
Mom.

257
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,349
It's okay to get bad marks.

258
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,520
Why aren't you eating?

259
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,359
I never had it before.

260

261
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,979
Here.

262
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:24,079
Thank you.

263
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,030
How is it? It's good, right?

264
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,969
We only use good ingredients, so have your fill.

265
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,109
Thank you, Mother.

266
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,949
- Gosh, he called me "mother". - "Mother"?

267
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,819
He talks so elegantly.

268
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,650
Can you say it one more time? Call me "mother".

269
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,859
Mother.

270
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,829
Gosh. That's so nice to hear.

271
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,000
Bok Su, will you call me "mother" from now on?

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,069
What are you saying?

273
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,270
I like calling you Jeong Soon.

274
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,270
You little punk.

275
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,770
What? Hit me.

276
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,010
Let me see. I'll get you.

277
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,639
- What? - I'll do it for you, Mom.

278
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,649
- Mother. - What's wrong with you?

279
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,349
- Stop. - Don't say that.

280
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,079
- Seriously. - Mother.

281
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,379
Mother.

282
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:35,149
Why are you doing that? Stop.

283
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,990
Bok Su is so lucky.

284
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,260
Why?

285
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,829
His mom...

286
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,599
is like those moms in dramas.

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,069
That's true.

288
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,079
Hey.

289
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,409
Was it really your first time having jjajangmyeon?

290
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,750
I heard that a celebrity only ate beef.

291
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,849
They had pork belly for the first time in university.

292
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:09,919
It's almost the same thing.

293
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:13,790
Pork belly?

294
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,960
Don't tell me you never had it before.

295
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,059
Is that good too?

296
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,899
Should we go eat it?

297
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,270
I'm already upset that I ate jjajangmyeon...

298
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,339
18 years later than other people.

299
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,879
I don't think I ever saw your eyes smile too.

300
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,010
You would only smile with the ends of your mouth.

301
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,550
It looks better when you really smile.

302
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,069
As for her family, she has a grandmother.

303
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:02,770
Her grandmother is currently hospitalized in Hanguk Hospital.

304
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,339
She's suffering from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

305
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,950
It can't be fully cured, and she often gets pneumonia.

306
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,550
The hospital bill has become a problem...

307
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,349
as her grandmother frequents the emergency room.

308
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:13,319
Okay, thank you.

309
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,389
Mr. Yoon.

310
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,790
About...

311
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,190
Ms. Son.

312
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,970
Don't tell my mother.

313
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,700
Bok Su has to fill volunteer hours.

314
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,169
That's pretty long.

315
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,710
- Bok Su is always making trouble. - I know.

316
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,710
(Kang Bok Su must volunteer for five days for damaging property.)

317
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,440
What's wrong with him?

318
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,859
(Oh Young Min)

319
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,990
Clean it well.

320
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,220
Make up for what you did by making it squeaky clean.

321
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,559
You must aim for a transparent life.

322
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,990
I'm going to come check later.

323
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,829
Okay, Ms. Son.

324
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,950
It must be hard work to volunteer, Bok Su.

325
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,220
Hello, Mr. Ma. Good morning.

326
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:01,760
It's me. Ma Young Jun.

327
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,430
Yes, I know. You teach English.

328
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:08,030
By any chance,

329
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,599
did we go to school together? I can't remember...

330
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:13,839
I mean, I'm really sorry if I didn't recognize you.

331
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,540
Look at me carefully. It's me.

332
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,419
The guy who used to deliver bread?

333
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,569
Are you Ma Young Jun, the guy who used to deliver bread?

334
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:46,339
I'm so glad to see you.

335
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,210
I can't believe you remember me. Thank you.

336
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,440
Are you sure we used to be this close?

337
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,710
Of course, Bok Su.

338
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,510
You used to help me out a lot in the past.

339
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,950
So this time, I'll help you out in return.

340
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,149
Because I'm a teacher now, and you're a student.

341
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,389
Oh, okay.

342
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,990
Okay, good luck.

343
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:25,980
This is a way of disciplining your mind.

344
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,649
By repeating simple actions again and again,

345
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,720
you must concentrate...

346
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,619
and think about what it is that you did wrong.

347
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,790
Gosh, I really can't do this.

348
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,490
This really takes up a lot of energy.

349
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,059
Why are we even doing this?

350
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,000
Because our mileage is full.

351
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,599
Mileage?

352
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,869
There's no way he'd know what that is.

353
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,530
He's talking about penalty points.

354
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,970
Why don't you have any hair?

355
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,510
Stop taking photos.

356
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,409
Are you going to take responsibility if I become famous?

357
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,540
You're so ugly.

358
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,780
What are you talking about? My mom thinks I'm the most handsome.

359
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,210
Don't you know that she's lying?

360
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,059
My gosh, what kind of situation is this?

361
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,159
The biggest attention-seeker...

362
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,530
of Seolsong High School just entered Wildflower Class.

363
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,869
Hey, hey. Wait.

364
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,339
What are you doing?

365
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,369
I got transferred to Wildflower Class today.

366
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,339
Did you get kicked out of Ivy Class?

367
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,280
Why did you come here instead of going to Sky Class?

368
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,710
Don't you know what this place is?

369
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,950
Wildflowers are pretty.

370
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,780
What a lunatic.

371
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,119
Can I sit here?

372
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,849
Hey, I didn't give you permission yet.

373
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,690
We're already close enough.

374
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,730
What kind of relationship do you think we have?

375
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,260
We're best friends.

376
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,599
"Friend"?

377
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,599
Hey, I'm nine years older than you.

378
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,639
And you think we're friends?

379
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,339
You better treat me like an older brother.

380
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,470
Okay

381
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,250
Everyone, please go to your seats.

382
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,589
Young Min, what are you doing here?

383
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,460
Class will be starting soon. Go back to your class.

384
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,230
I guess you haven't heard yet.

385
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:23,800
I got transferred to Wildflower Class.

386
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,859
What?

387
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,730
Why did you get transferred to our class instead of Sky Class?

388
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,770
It's not like I have any choice in going up,

389
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,639
so let me at least choose to come down.

390
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,740
Where's Seung Woo?

391
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,040
He's not here yet.

392
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,510
Is he late to school? Have you tried calling him?

393
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,550
He won't pick up.

394
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,520
Tell him to come see me once he comes.

395
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,220
Make sure you don't get yourselves in trouble today.

396
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:49,990
Get ready for class.

397
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,389
Young Min, I'd like to have a word with you.

398
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,059
Hey, So Ra. Take this.

399
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,399
I know how you feel,

400
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,869
but you're way smarter than the kids in this class.

401
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,040
And this class doesn't receive a lot of support from the school.

402
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:08,169
This place is like a battlefield.

403
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:10,010
It may be different from your old class,

404
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,309
but it's a lot more fierce than Ivy Class.

405
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,510
Instead, I get to have comrades.

406
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:18,649
- What? - I won't be lonely.

407
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,419
If I fight and bleed, a medic will be there to help me.

408
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,859
And the platoon leader will take care of me if I fall behind.

409
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,859
Please add me to your class student list.

410
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,609
What's wrong? Do you want to return to Ivy Class after seeing the menu?

411
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,609
Are you starting to regret having walked out of there?

412
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,680
Look at all the vegetables. It'll be good for my health.

413
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,550
Look at you smiling. Go on. Hurry up.

414
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,000
That's enough.

415
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,540
Min Ji, what are you doing here?

416
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:16,669
Have you gone mad?

417
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,609
I told you that I'll come.

418
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:21,809
Will you use your tenacity to do something else?

419
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:23,050
Like what?

420
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,579
You're everything to me.

421
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,919
What about work?

422
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,149
Work is useless when you're not there.

423
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,659
- My gosh. - Eat up.

424
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,030
I'll take care of your meals from now on.

425
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,030
Why don't you take care of your own life?

426
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,530
Why did you come here?

427
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,200
Why do you think? I'm here to protect...

428
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,339
you.

429
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,520
Enjoy your meal.

430
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,720
Can I have some more?

431
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,399
Can I have some more?

432
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
Some more, please.

433
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,139
Thank you.

434
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,510
Can I have...

435
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,180
You still have an amazing appetite.

436
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,829
Do you still lie these days?

437
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,300
You're good at lying.

438
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,369
Oh, right. You're good at stabbing people in the back as well.

439
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,800
Hey, Min Ji. I never lied.

440
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,770
I'm really not going to forgive you this time.

441
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,970
If you mess with Bok Su one more time,

442
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,639
I'm really going to kill you.

443
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,409
- Who are you to say that? - Me?

444
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,010
I'm his girlfriend.

445
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,079
I stayed by his side for nine years.

446
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,619
So?

447
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,419
Do you know what kind of life he's lived until now?

448
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:13,589
Must I know?

449
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,460
You're still a brat.

450
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,230
I like that attitude.

451
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,740
Keep that attitude and don't ever become curious of Bok Su.

452
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,040
But then again, you won't be able to...

453
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,940
because I'll always be by his side.

454
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,379
My gosh.

455
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,589
They should've buried them completely...

456
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,250
in order to commit a perfect crime.

457
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:44,619
What a bunch of losers. They still have a long way to go.

458
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,829
I hope you guys become better.

460
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:54,869
Gosh, you startled me.

461
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,399
What are you doing?

462
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,339
You have a knack for surprising people.

463
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,540
Gosh, my heart. I'm cleaning right now.

464
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,609
Really?

465
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:05,639
It must mean that I made your heart skip a beat.

466
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,609
Min Ji, I know you're free to interpret things your own way,

467
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:11,879
but you really go overboard and think whatever you want.

468
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,349
What's that?

469
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,220
Did you get a new accessory?

470
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,460
- Wait a second. - Hey.

471
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,930
My goodness. I must've worked way too hard.

472
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:28,530
This is what you call professionalism.

473
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,349
Bok Su, isn't there any on this side of my hair?

474
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,089
What are you doing? Gosh, hair grease.

475
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,460
- Did you wash your hair? - What?

476
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,589
Shouldn't you be hygienic if you work in the cafeteria?

477
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:54,960
Gosh, I have to say,

478
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,700
you really are the only person that cares for me so much.

479
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,559
- Let me go. - How about we watch a movie later?

480
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:03,970

Once upon a time a magpie returned the favor,

a snake did too, and a tiger as well.

486
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:29,990
So I, a human being, must repay my teacher's kindness.

487

Right. If I don't, I'm worse than an animal.

489
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,829
can't stand being in debt.

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,770
I think I have indigestion.

491
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:49,139
I think I ate too fast.

Gosh, it's me.

I feel sick to the stomach.

497

If you take the wrong medicine, you'll get really sick.

Is it okay if that person becomes really sick?

499
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,339
Why are there so many people coming to get medicine...

538
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:47,950
Bok Su.

539
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,550
Volunteer work is important, but don't be late.

540
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,719
Bok Su, is there something you need to say?

541
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,170
Don't get into trouble.

542
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,069
Especially, Bok Su.

543
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,580
(Yoon Seung Woo)

544
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,150
Both of them aren't picking up.

545
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,920
Seung Woo wouldn't miss school without any reason.

546
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,390
I know.

547
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,129
He never really pays attention in class,

548
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:32,860
but he's never missed a class.

549
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,300
He's always been the top student in middle school.

550
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,200
Really?

551
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:41,499
Perhaps you're mistaken.

552
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,240
He's at the bottom of Wildflower Class.

553
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,170
I have a hunch,

554
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,309
but since you say he's never missed a class,

555
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,779
let's ask his friends where he could be.

556
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,979
Okay.

557
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:01,859
Tell me, Soo Jeong.

558
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,830
Why is there a picture of you in Se Ho's office?

559
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,159
Why did that punk draw you?

560
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,200
Why?

561
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,039
Why this mop isn't getting any cleaner?

562
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,070
It's just like somebody.

563
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,779
Gosh!

564
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:30,020
Sir.

565
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,320
Kang Bok Su.

566
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:36,859
Dirty water... You punk!

567
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:46,200
You said you'd take the responsibility.

568
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,299
Ms. Son Soo Jeong.

569
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,239
Won't you monitor Bok Su's volunteer work?

570
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,140
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,440
- I'll dry clean your clothes... - They're dry already.

572
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:03,080
How can you get scolded for not washing a mop properly?

573
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,419
What's wrong with you?

574
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,289
Hey, Bok Su. Do you have something to say?

575
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:14,859
Hey.

576
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,750
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

577
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:37,690
Get a hold of yourself. Focus on taking revenge.

578
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:44,429
(Si On)

579
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:51,429
(You have 2 missed calls.)

580
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:57,270
(Call history)

581
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,940
(Mom)

582
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,049
(Delete)

583
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,120
(Delete contact?)

584
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,109
I'm telling you because it's you.

585
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,810
You have to keep the secret.

586
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,349
He's doing that to make money because he needs it.

587
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,380
He looks older than his age.

588
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,489
Still, he shouldn't work at a pub.

589
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,989
That punk.

590
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,359
Gosh!

591
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,599
Bok Su?

592
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,409
Does Seung Woo really work here?

593
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,210
Hey, do you work here too?

594
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,580
I'm an adult, Ms. Son.

595
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,450
- Did you forget? - You're a student right now.

596
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,020
Why are you talking so awkwardly?

597
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,690
I should talk formally to you since you're my teacher.

598
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,659
Who do you think you can fool with that low-grade ID?

599
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,929
Just be thankful I allowed you to work.

600
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,200
I worked, so give me my money.

601
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,330
I gave it to you.

602
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,339
You didn't even pay me minimum wage.

603
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,469
Are you kidding me?

604
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,770
You should report it if you want to get expelled.

605
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,039
You...

606
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:45,750
Let go. You punk.

607
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,179
Don't do it, Seung Woo. Don't make trouble.

608
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,679
What are you doing here?

609
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,089
How did you know?

610
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:54,989
Did you tell her?

611
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,489
- Why would I? - Are you here, Bok Su?

612
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:00,789
This part-timer is super rude. Wait a minute.

613
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:01,900
I'll teach you a lesson.

614
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,929
Are you his teacher? I'm glad you're here.

615
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,600
Your student is saying that he worked at our bar.

616
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,970
Yes. I heard that he did.

617
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,539
It looks like you're not paying him properly.

618
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,610
He's going to quit today, so pay him properly.

619
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,850
I gave him the money, but he still grabbed my throat.

620
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,850
You paid him below the minimum wage.

621
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,819
Seung Woo, how much are you short?

622
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:29,159
Make sure you calculate it to the penny.

623
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm short 814.40 dollars.

624
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,130
Even your teacher's crazy.

625
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,059
Your student worked at a bar.

626
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,770
You're in no place to quibble over not getting paid properly.

627
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,140
Watch it.

628
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,840
Don't get involved.

629
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,340
You're a student right now.

630
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,909
What? Are you a student too?

631
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,110
What a mess.

632
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,789
Hey.

633
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,919
If the school finds out about Seung Woo,

634
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:05,659
he'll get punished, and that's it.

635
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:06,890
But you.

636
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,159
Mister.

637
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:12,169
If people find out that you hired someone underage,

638
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:13,870
your business will get suspended.

639
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,970
You can try to save your 814.40 dollars...

640
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,840
and lose much more.

641
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,840
Let's go.

642
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:23,039
Now I see why. Your teacher's the problem.

643
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,909
If you don't have any parents, at least get a proper teacher.

644
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,549
What's wrong with not having any parents? Why?

645
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:36,490
Don't you feel embarrassed for sponging off...

646
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,860
of a kid without any parents?

647
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:40,929
You're an adult. You should help, not exploit him.

648
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,400
Is that how your parents taught you?

649
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,970
You're the one who should stop shaming your parents.

650
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:47,429
I had enough of you.

651
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,939
You know what?

652
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,010
I hate people like you who look down on people...

653
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,179
who have less than you and feel superior by it.

654
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,809
It means you're really pathetic.

655
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:00,110
Did you know that?

656
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,350
Are you crazy?

657
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,990
Are you a P.E. teacher?

658
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,819
You...

659
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,650
What are you doing, Bok Su? Let go.

660
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,850
Are you on her side?

661
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,650
Well, I have a mother,

662
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,759
but not a father.

663
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,459
Listening to you makes me mad.

664
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,000
This isn't your first time, is it?

665
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,829
You hired teenagers at your business on purpose...

666
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,340
and you cut their wage. I bet you're a habitual offender.

667
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:05,449
Our homeroom teacher will cooperate,

668
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:09,020
so let's go by the law.

669
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,090
What do you say, Ms. Son?

670
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:16,720
What are you saying? Let me go.

671
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,189
What are you two doing right now?

672
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,230
Are you dating?

673
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,459
Hold on.

674
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,959
Isn't this an assault?

675
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,770
Should we charge you for causing bodily harm too?

676
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:06,510
Leave. Leave. Don't come back.

677
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,939
Leave. You too.

678
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,880
That jerk.

679
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,720
Did he pay you properly?

680
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,490
What a cheapskate.

681
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,390
He forgot a dime.

682
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,120
Forget it. Let him have it.

683
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,890
Gosh.

684
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,069
What is it?

685
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:49,819
You should come back to school.

686
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:51,390
The other kids are worried about you.

687
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,720
I'm going to.

688
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,390
Sir.

689
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,360
Hey, Bok Su.

690
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,510
Don't go off somewhere else. Go straight home.

691

692
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:34,799
Why do you keep on getting involved, Bok Su?

693
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:47,209
I'm speechless. How can he grab my hand?

694
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,510
It's his teacher's wrist.

695
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:55,520
How can he do that? On top of that, he went like this.

696
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:58,049
Like this.

697
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:06,289
Bok Su.

698
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,029
Who taught you how to do that?

699
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,500
Where did you learn such a bad habit?

700
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:28,949
You're making me age.

701
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:32,449
Bok Su, you're making me age!

702
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,390
(Calling)

703
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,760
What do I do?

704
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,760
What's wrong with you?

705
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,900
You keep on talking to yourself like a crazy person.

706
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,270
All of the other customers ran away because they're scared.

707
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,870
If you have something to say, call him.

708
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,740
Welcome.

709
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:56,279
(Board Chairman Oh Se Ho)

710
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:04,049
Hello?

711
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,829
Do you know how well we get paid to lipsync?

712
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,429
Why did you ruin our gig?

713
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,970
Hey, I'm the CEO.

714
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:22,400
How dare an employee make a decision like that?

715
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,939
Our sales were cut by half. Did you know?

716
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:26,539
Of course you didn't.

717
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,579
How would an employee know how a CEO would feel?

718
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,340
You have no idea how I feel.

719
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,449
Why do you keep on smiling? Did you get hurt in the head?

720
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,390
Soo Jeong is still the same.

721
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,419
What? Is she still pretty?

722
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:46,630
Her temper.

723
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,029
She's tenacious, and she snaps back at you.

724
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,059
I was wondering why she looked so weak,

725
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,730
but she's still the same.

726
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,199
You're still the same too.

727
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:01,240
You become dumb whenever you see Soo Jeong.

728
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:03,510
What about your revenge?

729
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,409
Did you even talk to Soo Jeong?

730
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:07,880
I missed a call.

731
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,779
(Mean Girl)

732
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,990
What is it? Who is it?

733
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,819
What? "Mean Girl"? Who is this?

734
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,289
Is this Soo Jeong?

735
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,900
Hey, Bok Su.

736
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,270
Why are you taking a detour when there's a faster route?

737
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,640
All you have to do is ask.

738
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,010
If she called you, it means she has something to say.

739
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,539
Isn't that what you're more curious about?

740
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,179
Why she did that to you?

741
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,419
Hey, Bok Su. This isn't like you.

742
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,540
My gosh, look who's here. It's Chairman Oh.

743
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,110
Why are you so drunk?

744
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,640
How much did you drink?

745
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:10,439
Two cans of beer.

746
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,709
I might start crawling if I drink another can.

747
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:14,919
So be careful.

748
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,019
- Why are you here? - Because you seemed drunk.

749
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:20,820
So?

750
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:22,659
Are you my friend?

751
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:23,919
Am I not?

752
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,489
Then what am I?

753
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,499
You're the chairman.

754
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:31,060
You're the chairman of Seolsong High School.

755
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,100
You're my boss.

756
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,070
In other words, you're my employer.

757
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,179
I have a lot of things I don't have.

758
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,249
And friends are one of them.

759
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,159
Soo Jeong, what are you doing?

760
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,370
It's so warm.

761
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,479
Where are you going?

762
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,749
You should lie down as well.

763
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:40,100
It's nice and warm, isn't it?

764
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:46,769
Yes.

765
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:49,810
It's very nice.

766
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,999
Hello.

767
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,040
- Bok Su, your volunteer work... - I get it, so stop talking.

768
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:20,239
You reek of alcohol.

769
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,540
I don't reek of alcohol.

770
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:26,449
Bok Su, hurry up and clean the gym.

771
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,449
You better do it properly. I'm going to check later.

772
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,519
You must enjoy doing this.

773
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,659
Get lost. Stop provoking me.

774
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:20,870
Did you get in trouble again?

775
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,800
It took a long time for Soo Jeong to become a full-time teacher.

776
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:24,769
Do you want to get her fired?

777
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,439
Since when did it start?

778
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,509
- What? - You and Soo Jeong.

779
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,509
What are you guys doing?

780
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:34,350
What are you saying?

781
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,949
What kind of relationship do you have with her...

782
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:37,780
for you to be asking me such a question?

783
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,890
She's my homeroom teacher, and I'm her loyal class president.

784
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,499
I heard some rich jerk is hitting on her these days.

785
00:53:48,499 --> 00:53:50,229
Isn't a rich jerk...

786
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,729
better than a loser going back to school?

787
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,140
Hey.

788
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:03,310
- Do you like Soo Jeong? - Why?

789
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,310
Am I not allowed to?

790
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:10,050
Don't even think about fooling around with her, Se Ho.

791
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,419
With what right are you meddling with her life?

792
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,719
"With what right"? Are you crazy?

793
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,019
You don't even deserve...

794
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,530
- Because of you... - What?

795
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,269
Things are different from before.

796
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:29,499
Now, anyone would think...

797
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,269
that I'm a better match for Soo Jeong than you.

798
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:40,409
- What's this? - It seems like you want to fight.

799
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:41,509
Well, so do I.

800
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:45,320
I'll teach you a few moves. Grab the bokken.

801
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,959
Are you going to cry after I beat you up and kick me out?

802
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:53,090
I won't hold you responsible regardless of what happens.

803
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,159
The same goes for you.

804
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,459
You better not cry after I beat you up.

805
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,540
If that's the case,

806
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,080
I'll fight.

807
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,060
You should wear the training suit. If not, you'll get hurt.

808
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,159
I don't need the suit.

809
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:31,030
How about the loser grants the winner a wish?

810
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,800
Why don't you stick to the rules?

811
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,169
I have my own set of rules.

812
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,150
You jerk.

813
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:04,259
- Can I tell you my wish? - It's too early for that.

814
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,159
See? I told you I'd win.

815
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,729
What's your wish?

816
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,370
Should I get on my knees?

817
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:41,840
Is that what you were going to ask?

818
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:43,870
But that's too bad.

819
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,439
Because I won.

820
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:47,840
Bok Su, are you done cleaning?

821
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,209
Bok Su!

822
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:09,130
Bok Su, I told you not to cause trouble.

823
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:11,130
Are you crazy? How could you...

824
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,269
Why do you care?

825
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,769
It's none of your business.

826
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:18,439
I'm your teacher.

827
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:20,169
I'm responsible for all the troubles you cause.

828
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,110
Let's go to the infirmary.

829
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:32,290
What do you want?

830
00:57:33,689 --> 00:57:35,219
Move. What's wrong with...

831
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,689
Why don't you ever ask?

832
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:43,600
Nine years ago and now.

833
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,169
Why don't you ever ask me what happened?

834
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:55,709
Can you please tell me now?

835
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,830
(My Strange Hero)

836
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,919
Where did you get 50,000 dollars? Wait a minute.

837
00:58:37,919 --> 00:58:39,390
Did you get 50,000 dollars from Se Ho?

838
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,390
Let's have three meals together and call it a date.

839
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,489
I want to live the present moment with you. I mean, right now.

840
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:45,459
Why do you think she didn't believe me?

841
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:47,590
Was my love for you back then not enough?

842
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,459
I should've lied and said I didn't see...

843
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:52,929
or hear anything.

844
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,130
It's all over now.

845
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,999
I feel like I'm the only one living in the past.

846
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,640
You're not the only one living in the past.

847
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,169
I looked down on my feelings.

848
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,570
Is everything over now?

849
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,009
Let me ask you two questions.

850
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:05,310
Did you really push Se Ho from the rooftop that day?

851
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,580
Were you the one who spread the rumor?
