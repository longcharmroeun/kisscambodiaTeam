1
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:12,670
You two...

2
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,610
can never...

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,415
be happy.

4
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,240
Hey.

5
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:45,050
I don't know how I wronged you,

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,997
but isn't what you did to me nine years ago enough?

7
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,191
Soo Jeong and I won't be apart again because of you.

8
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,856
Now it's your turn to suffer.

9
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,415
You'll regret...

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,298
the choice you made.

11
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,798
Because you guys will suffer a lot.

12
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,399
Gosh. If I talk,

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,864
you'll go down in a flash.

14
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,230
Every moment is a crisis.

15
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,018
I really shouldn't let Se Ho slide.

16
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,629
That's why you went back to school.

17
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,761
But you went back to school and started dating.

18
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,199
Guys, let's do it together.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,684
Help me take revenge.

20
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,408
Isn't taking revenge self-service?

21
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,288
Of course.

22
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,410
Water, pickled radish, and revenge are self-served.

23
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,968
I'm making an official request.

24
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,540
Goodness, Mr. Client.

25
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,629
I withdrew it from my savings.

26
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,189
I've been saving up diligently.

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,845
I'll give you an employee discount.

28
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,112
Where should we start?

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,738
Thank you so much for calling me back to...

30
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,409
I want you to write up a list...

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,309
of all the teachers you hired by bribery...

32
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,865
including Ms. Son.

33
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,319
Ms. Son is an exception because I scammed her...

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,167
for my personal financial benefit.

35
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,317
But then again, I guess you could also say I borrowed money from her.

36
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,682
Whatever the case, I need to know...

37
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,910
how much the teachers are paying to get a full-time position.

38
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,915
You're acquainted with Kim Myung Ho, right?

39
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,868
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:04,828
I'm the one that gave him a job here.

41
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,162
He was about to talk to the press, but I brought him back.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,663
We need to share both our responsibilities and profits...

43
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:11,539
in order to prevent people from causing trouble.

44
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,934
I hope you make good use of him this time around.

45
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,008
What do you mean by that?

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,465
You should continue with what you were doing.

47
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,319
I'm talking about the business that was being carried out...

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,612
by my mom, the directors, the principal, and vice-principal.

49
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,328
I'm the former chairwoman's son.

50
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,659
There's no reason for me to get in the way.

51
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,861
Yes, you're right. I guess this can be considered as a family business.

52
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,599
I fully understand what you mean.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,751
Get ready to transfer the kids in Wildflower Class to other schools.

54
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,237
Sir, you want us to transfer them to other schools?

55
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,309
That's not something we can do so easily.

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,838
You can use vocational training or penalty points...

57
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,379
as an excuse to transfer them.

58
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,925
You can make up whatever reason that needs to be made.

59
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,753
But this is too sudden. The kids won't be able to accept it.

60
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,418
And you're the one who created Wildflower Class.

61
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,570
This is exactly why I made Wildflower Class.

62
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,483
I wanted to get rid of students that aren't up to our standards.

63
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,047
What a rude little jerk.

64
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,969
He must be completely crazy.

65
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,515
He's even worse than his mom.

66
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:12,868
Did he get dumped or something?

67
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,062
He probably got dumped and is taking it out on us.

68
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,238
That's what people go through at his age. He's so young.

69
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,592
Back when I was his age,

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,525
I used to get dumped all the time.

71
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,009
I've never been dumped,

72
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,474
so I really don't understand what he's going through.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,549
Regardless of what he's going through, this is a school.

74
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,888
We can't just transfer kids as we wish.

75
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,687
That's exactly my point. This is so absurd.

76
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,028
At times like this,

77
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,959
we need to work together and overcome it.

78
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:43,840
Let's cheer up.

79
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,039
- Let's do this. - Yes.

80
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:01,962
Let's cheer up.

81
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,544
I need to stay more focused in times of crisis.

82
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,739
You didn't become a full-time teacher by bribery.

83
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,200
Don't get intimidated.

84
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,720
You didn't forget that we agreed to meet today, right?

85
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:18,389
I'm not really in the mood to go somewhere.

86
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,538
No, I shouldn't worry Bok Su.

87
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,107
What kind of awkward gathering is this?

88
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,517
We're not exactly close enough to eat chicken together.

89
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:43,641
I know.

90
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,423
I'd like to officially introduce you guys...

91
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,313
to my girlfriend,

92
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:53,149
Son Soo Jeong.

93
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,490
Min Ji.

94
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,988
I was able to endure everything because you were by my side...

95
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,438
for the past nine years.

96
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,889
I'm really grateful for that.

97
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,218
And I'm really sorry...

98
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,786
for ignoring your feelings...

99
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,655
even when I knew that you liked me.

100
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,775
Even after all this time,

101
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,227
you're still going to choose Soo Jeong?

102
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,057
I'm the one who kept liking you even though I knew...

103
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,460
that you didn't feel the same way.

104
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,435
So there's no need for you to feel sorry, Bok Su.

105
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,956
If you're sorry,

106
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,051
don't ever...

107
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,203
Don't ever go through a hard time.

108
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,278
And I hope you really become happy.

109
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,207
I hope you become happy.

110
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,779
Let's go.

111
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,289
You guys can have chicken by yourselves.

112
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,222
Come on.

113
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,391
Thank you...

114
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,218
for staying by Bok Su's side for the past nine years.

115
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:53,831
And...

116
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,195
I'm sorry for hurting you.

117
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,340
Come on.

118
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,900
That wench.

119
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,440
Why did she have to say that?

120
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,577
I can't even badmouth her anymore.

121
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,341
Stop crying.

122
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,290
I'll buy you something even better than chicken.

123
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,720
How about we eat steak?

124
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,050
Kim Myung Ho threatened me.

125
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,530
But I couldn't do anything because of what I did,

126
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,681
and I feel so embarrassed by that.

127
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,413
To be honest,

128
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,728
I'm scared I might get fired.

129
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,176
The fact that I feel so scared because of that darn money...

130
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,260
makes me feel miserable.

131
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,809
Anyone in your shoes would've been scared just like you.

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,369
They wouldn't have been able to step up either.

133
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,291
Se Ho's the problem for having hired someone like him.

134
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,935
Se Ho...

135
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,305
apparently likes me.

136
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,600
I know.

137
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,685
But wait a minute. Did he tell you that himself?

138
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:45,738
When I rejected him, he told me that we'll become miserable.

139
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,058
Then Kim Myung Ho showed up right away.

140
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:51,774
He told me that you'll be put in danger because of me.

141
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,850
Soo Jeong.

142
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,062
If...

143
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,605
If I feel like you're really going to have a hard time,

144
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,308
I'm going to drop out of school.

145
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:05,962
You can't do that.

146
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,135
You can't drop out of school twice.

147
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:23,979
Bok Su.

148
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,520
Let's...

149
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:34,119
not sacrifice the present by worrying about the future.

150
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:35,792
I don't want to do that.

151
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,629
Okay.

152
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,535
Let's overcome it together...

153
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,230
no matter what.

154
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:49,680
Hey.

155
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,040
Hey.

156
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,280
Hey.

157
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,382
Hey.

158
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,030
Why do you keep calling me? I'm right here.

159
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,165
You're not Son Soo Jeong.

160
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,941
Soo Jeong's not this ugly.

161
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,761
You little punk.

162
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,714
Hey, you better be ready.

163
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,612
You're going to become really busy from now on.

164
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,740
Why?

165
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,063
We have to catch up and go on all the dates we missed for nine years.

166
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,614
So we'll be really busy.

167
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:26,607
There are so many things we need to do.

168
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,325
Do you know...

169
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:34,100
how much I missed out during the past nine years?

170
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,889
I'll repay you for having hurt you...

171
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,536
for the past nine years.

172
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,976
I'll protect Kang Bok Su.

173
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,671
Trust me.

174
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,669
Get on my back.

175
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,468
I'm not drunk yet.

176
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,825
Gosh, it's cold.

177
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,221
Come on.

178
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:20,245

179
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,799
I wonder whose son you are. You're really good-looking.

180
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,414
He's my son.

181
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,581
Thank you for what you did for In Ho last time.

182
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,348
It was nothing. Of course I should...

183
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,248
By the way, what kind of sport did you play?

184
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,937
You had a really strong grasp.

185
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:51,519
What is it?

186
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,478
Can I call you Aunt now?

187
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,606
I can't believe you're my aunt.

188
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,680
- What? - Who says she's your aunt?

189
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,098
Ever since you came clean,

190
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:03,292
you must feel comfortable.

191
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:08,805
Someone of your stature would be too much pressure for us.

192
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,639
- What do you mean? - A teacher.

193
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,023
Don't you feel pressured, Mom?

194
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,699
- I'm against this. - I'm for it.

195
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,348
You guys are distracting me. Go to bed.

196
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,218
Why do you keep on telling me to go to bed?

197
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,937
I have a lot I want to ask.

198
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,889
You and Bok Su had something nine years ago.

199
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,616
Bok Su isn't your son, he's mine.

200
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,929
Don't get involved in my son's business,

201
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,515
and go to bed.

202
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,529
Gosh, look at the time.

203
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,598
I better get going. See you at school tomorrow, In Ho.

204
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,399
Gosh, it's late. You should sleep over.

205
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,669
The buses stopped running. It'd be too dangerous to go now.

206
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,809
What are you saying? It wouldn't be dangerous for her.

207
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,627
She could kill a cow with her bare hands.

208
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,890
Wait, Ms. Son.

209
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,130
Aunt.

210
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,207
Let's take a picture to celebrate you becoming my aunt.

211
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,037
1, 2, 3...

212
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,819
You should sleep over here. My room is up there.

213
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,052
- Get up already! - I want a picture...

214
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,891
Don't you hate me?

215
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:21,651
Back then...

216
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,668
I know you weren't comfortable.

217
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,347
For that long period, you had to suffer...

218
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,539
just as much as Bok Su.

219
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,408
Why would I hate you?

220
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,232
I only feel sorry for you.

221
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,429
You got involved in my son's life,

222
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,631
and after that, your life hasn't been all that easy either.

223
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:43,799
Kids are clumsy and they make mistakes.

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,799
However, it's us adults' fault for failing...

225
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,234
to help the kids get back on the right track.

226
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,308
I promise not to become an adult like that.

227
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,038
I won't become a teacher...

228
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,470
like that.

229
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:19,683
I feel like...

230
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,558
something good happened.

231
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,657
I'll protect Kang Bok Su.

232
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,791
Trust me.

233
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,485
I'll repay you for having hurt you...

234
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,266
for the past nine years.

235
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,031
Right, school.

236
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,750
In Ho, we have to wake up and eat before going to school.

237
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,671
What?

238
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,022
What's this? Why are you here?

239
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,527
Is that a new hairstyle?

240
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,253
Come and eat breakfast.

241
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,462
My hair?

242
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,606
Eat a lot, Aunt.

243
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,987
I call you Ms. Son at school.

244
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:21,358
So Jeong, there's no need for him to study well.

245
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,368
Look how quick-witted he is.

246
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:25,699
He won't have any trouble living his life.

247
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,618
In my opinion, he's a genius.

248
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,590
- Have some meat. - Thank you.

249
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,690
Have it.

250
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,988
Soo Jeong likes meat.

251
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,680
So does my son.

252
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,199
Make sure you hand in...

253
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,269
the list of participants for the debating contest today.

254
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,795
The results will be recorded in their student records,

255
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:09,717
so the teachers who will be judging should prepare themselves well.

256
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,988
It's an event to give kids in Ivy Class more awards.

257
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,359
Is it necessary to make our kids participate in it?

258
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,988
It would be too obvious if the awards were just given out.

259
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,528
I'm sure the principal and the vice principal...

260
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,227
would love to present the awards to the Ivy Class kids,

261
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,449
but there are procedures for everything.

262
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:34,624
Just like how there are procedures for dating.

263
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:41,909
I wonder if there are procedures for rejection.

264
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,637
Ms. Son, who will participate from your class?

265
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,803
Hello.

266
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,473
Guys, you all know about the debating contest, right?

267
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,031
Raise your hand if you want to participate.

268
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,079
If you win the contest,

269
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,079
the whole class will get a perfect performance assessment,

270
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,379
and it'll be recorded in your student record.

271
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,571
We're in Wildflower Class. What are you dreaming?

272
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,345
We can barely keep a conversation for a minute.

273
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:30,058
Participation is mandatory, so I need three volunteers.

274
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,574
I'll do it.

275
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,445
Great, Young Min. Thank you.

276
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,057
I still need two more.

277
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,939
Great, Yoon Seung Woo.

278
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,323
This is your punishment for being late.

279
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,892
You have to participate in the debating contest.

280
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,179
Then, the last person...

281
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,634
I want to recommend Kang Bok Su.

282
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,119
Hey, I'm bad at debates.

283
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,189
Why not?

284
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,889
You were good at talking when you got me out of that glass booth.

285
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,258
Okay. The last member will be the class president...

286
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,258
thanks to a recommendation.

287
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:10,411
We can't change this later.

288
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:12,481
Ms. Son?

289
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,950
Hey.

290
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,481
You little...

291
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,731
I'm here.

292
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,241
Hey.

293
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,017
Hey, are you...

294
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,049
going on a blind date?

295
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,568
That's a good idea.

296
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,409
Bok Su is with someone else now.

297
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,580
Instead of a crush, have a proper relationship.

298
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,045
No, I'm not going on a blind date.

299
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,849
I have an interview at Seolsong High School today.

300
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,048
Really? Okay, then.

301
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,342
Dig about the Administration Office first.

302
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:10,870
How annoying.

303
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,972
Right.

304
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,699
I have free movie tickets,

305
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,588
but I have no one to use them with.

306
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,304
I want to watch a movie after the interview.

307
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,753
What should I do?

308
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:26,538
I really don't want to go to a movie alone.

309
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,459
Should I throw them out?

310
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,037
Really? Then give them to me so I can go with Bok Su.

311
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,818
Why would Bok Su go with you?

312
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,536
He'd go with Soo Jeong.

313
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:39,529
How annoying.

314
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,028
I should just quit this place.

315
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:47,251
Why do I even like such a slow guy?

316
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,595
What? Like who?

317
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,793
Yang Min Ji, wake up.

318
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,130
If you fall for an ugly guy,

319
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,657
there's no cure.

320
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,951
I know the basics of Excel and PowerPoint.

321
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,679
My dad used to run a printing house,

322
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,670
so I'm really good at photocopying.

323
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:18,119
I also have fast hands.

324
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,859
I see. I like that you have fast hands.

325
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,020
Focus. Focus.

326
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,380
Ta-da.

327
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:04,151
You're hired.

328
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,478
Do you want to run a business with me as my partner?

329
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:10,842
If we work together, I think we'll make a fortune.

330
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,419
(While I Am Waiting for You)

331
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,420
All right. Start writing now.

332
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,308
Are you crazy?

333
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:40,391
Yes.

334
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,051
I'm crazy about you.

335
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,213
Hey, Bok Su. Are you crazy?

336
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,823
- In the middle of class... - What? We didn't get caught.

337
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,399
This isn't going to work.

338
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,929
Until you graduate,

339
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,757
our relationship will be platonic.

340
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,738
Platonic?

341
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,632
Okay. Yes. I'll say yes to everything you want.

342
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,579
Yes. Platonic.

343
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,278
Our relationship will be platonic.

344
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,409
I'll protect you.

345
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,369
What will you protect?

346
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,882
Stop protecting your grown-up student and guard your desk.

347
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,988
You're never at your desk.

348
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,746
If you want to protect something, be at your desk first!

349
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,770
Gosh.

350
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,950
Go. Just go.

351
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,344
(Platonic)

352
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,758
(It's a type of love that is non-sexual.)

353
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,181
What? Gosh, this is wrong.

354
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,419
I mean...

355
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,149
How old does she think I am?

356
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,149
How can love be non-sexual? I mean, why would you do that?

357
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,119
Hey, Soo Jeong. Why would you protect me?

358
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:03,329
Gosh.

359
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,006
This is nonsense.

360
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:10,611
Bok Su.

361
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,429
Revenge is important, but since you're in school,

Hey. Do you know what "Platonic" means?

366
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:26,567
Platonic?

367
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,940
I know gin and tonic. Is that liquor?

368
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,137

He's coming.

371
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:40,163
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - No.

372
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,129
What? Why are you here?

373
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,314
Did your company go bankrupt?

374
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,169
I have two jobs because my business isn't doing well.

375
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,968
Look at you two. You seem very suspicious.

376
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,409
What are you up to? Why is he here too?

377
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,079
Sir, don't sneak up on us like that.

378
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,433
You're the most suspicious.

379
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,691
Let's go.

380
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,514
They really look suspicious.

381
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,887
I finished writing a debate plan.

382
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:22,625
They'll tell us the topic at the contest.

383
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,109
I'll tell you how the contest goes.

384
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,928
We won't even make the cut.

I'm good at writing a debate plan.

386

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,160
In my point of view,

543
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,679
money is an important value...

544
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,326
that has formed in our society.

545
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:02,272
And it's something we cannot go against.

546
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,679
Therefore, we agree with the statement...

547
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,527
that money should be our standard when choosing a job.

548
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,689
We already ended transferring kids to other schools...

549
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,609
regarding their change of career in the first semester.

550
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,099
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here...

551
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,543
meeting the principals in person.

552
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,754
I'd like to receive the principal's recommendation for this issue.

553
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,311
But...

554
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,500
I don't understand why the chairman of a prestigious school...

555
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,768
like Seolsong is so involved with the kids' transfer.

556
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,264
It's natural that I step up since it's about my students.

557
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:35,949
Our school is focused mainly on getting kids into universities.

558
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,648
So the kids with bad grades seem to be getting left out,

559
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:39,367
and that has always upset me.

560
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:40,659
I see.

561
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:44,189
There will be financial support...

562
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,358
since I'm asking you to do a favor for our students.

563
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:47,369
First,

564
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:49,158
we could start off by supporting Yumin High School...

565
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,644
with new tools and equipment for practice classes.

566
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,413
Goodness, that's too much.

567
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:55,228
Yumin High School has the highest employment rate in the country,

568
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,341
so I'm the one that's honored to help.

569
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,408
I'll try my best to make sure Seolsong High School kids...

570
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,621
could get transferred to our school.

571
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:04,091
Thank you.

572
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,928
- Let's eat. - Okay.

573
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,118
Now, it's time for the opposing side to make...

574
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,332
their first argument.

575
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,518
We disagree...

576
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,155
with the statement that money should be our standard...

577
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,472
when choosing a job.

578
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,199
The Easterlin Paradox shows that not all rich people...

579
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,190
are happy.

580
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,873
The hypothesis saying a higher income will lead to happiness...

581
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,849
was also proven wrong by many research...

582
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,878
that have been conducted in advanced countries.

583
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,679
According to the Korea Health Industry Development Institute,

584
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,719
when young people search for jobs,

585
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,118
the most important thing they consider...

586
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,988
is the job's stability and long-term availability.

587
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:55,488
Unlike what Young Min claimed, they considered stability...

588
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,258
as the most important factor instead of high income.

589
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:00,188
And the next factor was money.

590
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,169
It seems like our peers from Wildflower Class...

591
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,695
failed to do research on the most basic information.

592
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,306
Please make statements that are related to the debate.

593
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,340
If no one wishes to make any additional arguments,

594
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,478
we'll end the debate with the final speech.

595
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,228
According to Gallup and many surveys,

596
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:36,057
our GDP has been constantly increasing...

597
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,059
for the past 50 years.

598
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,694
And the overall individual income has also increased.

599
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,939
However, people's happiness...

600
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,233
didn't increase at all.

601
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,290
Therefore,

602
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:51,081
money should not be the standard when it comes to choosing a job.

603
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,318
That is the end of Ivy Class' final statement.

604
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,785
Wildflower Class, please make your final statement.

605
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:09,444
People seem to be embarrassed...

606
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,364
about showing people that they think money is important.

607
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,468
But you see, money is an inevitable factor in our lives.

608
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,551
Right?

609
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,579
Regardless of how cheap and dirty it might seem,

610
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,878
trying hard to endure everything...

611
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,209
because you're scared that you might lose your job,

612
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,846
and trying hard to protect your job because of money...

613
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,361
is not...

614
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,910
an embarrassing thing at all.

615
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,997
To be honest, I'm scared I might get fired.

616
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,675
The fact that I feel so scared because of that darn money...

617
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,681
makes me feel miserable.

618
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:53,034
There are some people who disregard money...

619
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,378
when they've never even earned a single penny themselves...

620
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:57,278
and were born in a rich family...

621
00:38:57,279 --> 00:38:59,340
who are used to taking care of everything with money.

622
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:04,388
But if you're not paid, it's not considered a job.

623
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,379
It's considered as volunteer work.

624
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,004
Someone once said this.

625
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,689
"If you don't think you can buy happiness with money,"

626
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,184
"check if you actually have enough money."

627
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:15,297
What's the point of self-realization when you can't even get paid...

628
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,087
as much as you work?

629
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,200
Gosh, how materialistic. You're so shallow.

630
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:24,541
- What? - Why did you return to school...

631
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,800
at that age when it doesn't even...

632
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:28,419
pay you any money?

633
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,345
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

634
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,200
Hey.

635
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,792
Why do you think it's shallow to like money...

636
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,069
when you're experiencing all the benefits...

637
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:57,451
money can give you?

638
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:01,006
You spend money for private lessons and school.

639
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,584
By any chance, did you pay money to get such textbook arguments...

640
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,710
such as the importance of self-realization...

641
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,605
and community services?

642
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,312
Why don't you be honest and think about it?

643
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:18,824
Let's say there's a job that doesn't pay you a single penny...

644
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,495
but that's self-fulfilling and helps with community services.

645
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,181
Would you...

646
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,880
actually...

647
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,650
choose that job?

648
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,549
This is why money should be our standard when choosing a job.

649
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,849
My name is Yoon Seung Woo, and that is the end...

(Total score: 78)

656
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,050
Mr. Park, did you accidentally switch the score cards?

657
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,388
What's wrong with Ivy Class' score?

658
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:22,289
I scored them according to my standards.

659
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,784
Don't you know how important it is for them to get into university?

660
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,299
You should've given more points to the ones who have hope.

661
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,768
Why did you give more points to Wildflower Class?

662
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,759
A teacher should be fair.

663
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:33,391
What exactly are you saying right now?

664
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:46,264
We lost?

665
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:49,316
Why? What were your grading criteria?

666
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:53,033
A debating contest...

667
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:55,782
teaches you to listen to what other people say...

668
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:58,048
to respect them as well.

669
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:00,689
You can't look down on someone else's opinion...

670
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:03,299
and act like you're above everyone else.

671
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,350
That's a mistake.

672
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,238

673
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,156
reading research papers.

674
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,552
Wildflower Class...

675
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,278
lacked in many ways and was inexperienced,

676
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:18,068
but they stated their opinion...

677
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:19,695
and was polite.

678
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,506
That's the reason for this result.

679
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,857
I'm going to make an official complaint.

680
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,992
Ask yourself what exactly the complaint is about.

681
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,719
Make sure it's not something you'll embarrass yourself with.

(The 15th Debating Contest of Seolsong High School)

683
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,988
Mr. Park, you need to work on that temper of yours.

684
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,606
You still live such a tiring life.

685
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,679
What? It's not like I said anything wrong.

686
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,280
That's true. You never do.

687
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:04,823
Anyway, good work.

688
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,299
You should still try doing things you don't want to do.

689
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,829
You should work hard even if you're not good.

690
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,345
That's school.

691
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,581
You're right.

692
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:13,898
By the way, you should be more careful.

693
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:15,656
You're worse than me.

694
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:18,031
You're going to get an earful today.

695
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,867
I'm not scared of things like that.

00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:51,334
You should do something about that stupid head.

701

Are you that proud to be a student with good marks?

702
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:58,541
Does it make you feel like you've become someone important?

Hey. You must not know,

704
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,589
but Chae Min is the top student at our school.

705
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,740
I see. Is that so?

Mr. Park used to also say that seeing us smile made him full.

720
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:17,651
I don't know about feeling full,

721
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,537
but I want to help the kids smile more.

722
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:25,511
Me too.

723
00:45:26,939 --> 00:45:27,979
I want to...

724
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:30,756
make you smile more too.

725
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,779
Now that we're talking here, I feel like we're students again.

726
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,738
Well, it's true I'm a student right now.

727
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,027
I still like school, Soo Jeong.

728
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,370
Me too.

729
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:48,944
I like the school with you.

730
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:58,968

731
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,065
No. Not until you graduate.

732
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,940
What are you saying "No" to?

733
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:13,734
- What? - Tell me.

734
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,905
What are you saying "No" to?

735
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,938
You're making me so curious.

736
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,002
Gosh.

737
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,340
Leave.

738
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,128
I said, go.

739
00:46:25,129 --> 00:46:26,169
Gosh.

740
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:29,656
Right. By the way,

741
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,084
what is it that you have to do...

742
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:38,462
at school with Yang Min Ji?

743
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,092
Why won't you tell me?

744
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:43,967
- Soo Jeong. - Yes?

745
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:45,690
Are you being jealous now?

746
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,490
No, I'm not.

747
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,274
I think you are.

748
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:53,602
- I'm not. - You are.

749
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,675
- I'm not. - You are.

750
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,810
By the way, Soo Jeong, there's something you should know...

751
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:05,384
about that problem.

752
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,509
They're forging student records? That's ridiculous.

753
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,236
That ridiculous thing is happening at the school.

754
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,108
Money was involved in the debating contest too.

755
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:17,009
I heard Lee Chae Min talking about it.

756
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,678
We have four more intramural contests,

757
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:20,498
but I never thought holding them could cause trouble.

758
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,618
Are you saying the parents of Ivy Class...

759
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,812
paid to hold these contest?

760
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,040
- No way. - That's not all.

761
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:30,289
The college entrance consulting centers pay money the school...

762
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,858
to tell the students what topics the contests will be about,

763
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:35,152
and give them the answer sheets.

764
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,928
As for the debating contest,

765
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:39,239
all the students in Ivy Class who voted for and against the contest...

766
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,996
had the answer sheets.

767
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:44,490
Take a look.

768
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:48,523
(Lee Chae Min)

769
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,519
Are they crazy?

770
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,640
College admission is important. How can they...

771
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,918
- What? - I like it when you swear.

772
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:07,489
Are you serious? Go outside for your date.

773
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:09,428
You went to school for revenge, but you've been dating instead.

774
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:11,388
Now you're even dating at the office.

775
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,200
As the CEO, I forbid dating between colleagues.

776
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,420
Get out.

777
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,224
Thank you. Let's go.

778
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,119
Hold on.

779
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,361
Hey, CEO...

780
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,718
Is dating forbidden between colleagues?

781
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,366
Yes. It's forbidden.

782
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,675
Then what about us?

783
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,759
What?

784
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,858
The parents of Ivy Class...

785
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:37,355
already started to make complaints about the debating contest result.

786
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,978
What were you doing? You just let this happen?

787
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,339
Mr. Park is a stubborn person.

788
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,039
He won't listen to us.

789
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,262
I'm in a tough spot too.

790
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,108
Change the winners to the Ivy Class.

791
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:55,279
Make an announcement saying there was a problem...

792
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,408
with the evaluation,

793
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,904
and tell Mr. Park to write a letter of apology as disciplinary action.

794
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:03,967
He won't accept it very well.

795
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,275
That's what I'm aiming for.

796
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:08,740
Let's go.

797
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,259
(Correction to the winning team of the debating contest)

798
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,299
(After a reexamination, we found an error...)

799
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,329
(in the judge's evaluation.)

800
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,389
(The related judge will receive disciplinary action,)

801
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,188
(and the final winning team will change to Ivy Class.)

802
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:23,679
Darn it.

803
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,998
Don't get worked up.

804
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,157
You have to take revenge rationally. You know that.

805
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,038
This is the evidence we need.

806
00:49:36,689 --> 00:49:39,114
Bok Su, follow the plan.

807
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,898
Darn.

808
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,029
Are you kidding me? We beat Ivy Class good yesterday.

809
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,070
We did, and they probably didn't like that.

810
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,239
I overheard something yesterday,

811
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:57,708
and apparently the kids from Ivy Class gave the school money.

812
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:58,791
They bribed?

813
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:01,608
What?

814
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,579
You startled me. When did you get here?

815
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,590
Is this the truth?

816
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:06,718
All intramural contests...

817
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,275
are held for Ivy Class and their student records.

818
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,004
I never paid.

819
00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:14,339
Not you, but your mom probably did.

820
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,361
Here. Eat this and calm down.

821
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,883
Don't ruin your own name.

822
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,758
Did you say I made an error when evaluating the debate?

823
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,739
I did it precisely and fairly.

824
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,009
How can the school...

825
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,479
strip away the rights of a teacher?

826
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,408
Exactly. You shouldn't have evaluated them...

827
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,579
according to your own criteria.

828
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,580
Don't you know you shouldn't have marked them that way?

829
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:45,609
Do you really not get it?

830
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,741
I'll make...

831
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:51,259
an official complaint to the chairman.

832
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,499
You have so much energy even at your age.

833
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,025
You should quit this job and go into farming.

834
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,769
You can do something more productive with that energy.

835
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,325
This place will run well...

836
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,280
even without you.

837
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,653
Bok Su, Mr. Park is in trouble.

838
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:26,182
He went to argue with Se Ho.

839
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:33,888
I'll talk to the chairman.

840
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,251
No, Ms. Son.

841
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:38,722
I'll take care of this.

842
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:41,424
It's about my students.

843
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,504
Wildflower Class is my class.

844
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,289
Rather than the judge,

845
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,440
I should make an official complaint as the homeroom teacher.

846
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,610
Right. Speak calmly.

847
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,810
Be logical and consistent. Don't get worked up.

848
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,693
You can do it, Soo Jeong.

849
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:28,903
Hey, you crazy jerk.

850
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:34,221
Are you done? Do you want some tea?

851
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,209
Mr. Chairman.

852
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:45,008
Please change this nonsensical decision.

853
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:47,976
You know Wildflower Class won fair and square.

854
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:52,176
The result being changed by one person's judging criteria,

855
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:53,948
is that fair and square?

856
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:55,031
Then,

857
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:57,019
changing the result...

858
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,050
to let the pre-arranged winner win, is that fair and square?

859
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:02,529
You're making a risky comment without any proof.

860
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,075
You know it's true.

861
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:06,458
Is teaching an unfair defeat to the kids...

862
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:07,913
your philosophy?

863
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,366
You said you'd correct Seolsong.

864
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,185
You asked me to watch.

865
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,299
From now on, I'm going to correct...

866
00:53:17,669 --> 00:53:19,326
all the wrong things that have settled in Seolsong High School.

867
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,930
Soo Jeong. You are...

868
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,900
in no position to stand up straight.

869
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,430
What about Kim Myung Ho?

870
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:32,275
What will you do about that?

871
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,176
Fine. What about you?

872
00:53:39,859 --> 00:53:41,749
Is your conscience clear?

873
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,545
Where did all that money go?

874
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:44,938
It went to you or your mother.

875
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:45,979
That's right.

876
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:48,457
So we're accomplices.

877
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:51,503
You can't hate me like this when we're in this together.

878
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,693
Don't touch my kids.

879
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:57,648
That's right. Because of that petty money,

880
00:53:57,649 --> 00:54:00,019
I sold my conscience, so I can't hold my head up high.

881
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,293
But if you do anything to the kids,

882
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,635
that'll be the end for both of us.

883
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,035
I won't go down alone.

884
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:13,342
I mean...

885
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:15,829
"Leave the kids alone."

886
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,749
"Leave Bok Su alone." Then...

887
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:21,051
what should I do?

888
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:24,051
I...

889
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,127
I made a mistake,

890
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,795
so I deserve this.

891
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,537
But the kids didn't do anything wrong.

892
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:33,466
Bok Su also didn't do anything wrong.

893
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,812
And you know that, you crazy jerk.

894
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:46,293
You should know that the more you act like this...

895
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,611
the more I want to get rid of Bok Su.

896
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:54,116
Try it, you crazy jerk.

897
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:57,263
I'll show you who's crazier.

898
00:55:06,919 --> 00:55:09,919
(Counseling Room)

899
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,859
Why are you still here?

900
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:35,629
Mr. Park told me.

901
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,890
Are you okay?

902
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,403
Bok Su.

903
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,223
You look so good in uniform.

904
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,750
I...

905
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,732
really want to help you graduate.

906
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:13,291
Don't worry.

907
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,170
I'll get the diploma myself.

908
00:56:17,649 --> 00:56:20,347
I want you...

909
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:21,801
to give me the diploma, okay?

910
00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:29,143
What am I going to do?

911
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,598
I want to stand up to Se Ho.

912
00:56:34,669 --> 00:56:38,548
But because of my mistake, I can't even fight him.

913
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,601
I really regret what I did in the past.

914
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,293
(Counseling Room)

915
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:28,799
(My Strange Hero)

916
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,938
It's not a school. It's a corporation.

917
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,269
Is this all true?

918
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,509
Mr. Park sent an anonymous letter to the Education Office?

919
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:50,908
Stop tarnishing my school and leave!

920
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:52,408
It's my school now.

921
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:54,378
If you want to kick me out, wait. Or take it away from me.

922
00:58:54,379 --> 00:58:56,509
I'm a teacher. What should I do?

923
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:57,549
Don't worry.

924
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,718
I'll take care of it. Trust me.

925
00:58:58,719 --> 00:58:59,749
Call the School Violence Prevention Committee.

926
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,349
Transfer him to another school.

927
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,049
- If you do this suddenly... - It was refused.

928
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,989
My good intentions were refused. So I'll have to force them.

929
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,319
Umbrella. Don't you have an umbrella?

930
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,559
Are you crazy? We're in school.

931
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,989
- You're in school uniform. - Uniform isn't a problem.

932
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,329
Are you sure you won't let her get hurt?

933
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,029
I'll never let her be alone.

934
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,099
I want to be a teacher like you.

935
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,099
Mr. Park did it, didn't he?

936
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,339
I'm the evidence of...

937
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,839
your failure as a teacher.

938
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,667
As the board chairman, I'll fire Mr. Park.
