1
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,121
Oh Se Ho.

2
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,098
This place is off limits for students.

3
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,502
It's been a long time...

4
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,822
since all three of us were up here.

5
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,689
My life got ruined here.

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,338
Because of the lies you told.

7
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:56,925
I didn't tell any lies.

8
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:00,828
- Me neither. - Nonsense!

9
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,849
When did I ever push you?

10
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,729
You came up here to commit suicide.

11
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,219
At one point, I wondered...

12
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,019
what your nonsense meant.

13
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,766
But not anymore.

14
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:13,707
It's none of my business...

15
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,472
to know why you wanted to die.

16
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,042
That hurts.

17
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,415
Cruel Kang Bok Su.

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,352
Hey, Soo Jeong. Did you really think...

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,831
I was someone who'd push him off to die?

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,080
I heard you.

21
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,628
Se Ho begged you to save him.

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,422
Bok Su.

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,303
Please save me!

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,358
You should've believed me even if everyone else didn't.

25
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,915
How could I believe you?

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,349
Let's quit it.

27
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,994
Did my feelings for you...

28
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,154
mean nothing to you?

29
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,519
What if I can't go to college?

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,045
I told you to get a different math tutor.

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,470
Soo Jeong.

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,971
Yes?

33
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,370
Did you place number one again?

34
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,340
Yes.

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,158
Did you hire an expensive tutor? How much?

36
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,381
Yes, how much?

37
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,303
The homeroom teacher asked me to come to the office.

38
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,611
I'll be back.

39
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:40,538
Gosh.

40
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,979
How much is she paying her tutor?

41
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,149
She acts like she's the only rich one.

42
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,848
Both her parents are professors.

43
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,519
No, they're school commissioners.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,702
That's why she takes all the school scholarships.

45
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,788
- She's so annoying. - Why...

46
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,941
Hey, sit down.

47
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,907
You can never win against a girl.

48
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,843
Why did she speak like that?

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,326
Bok Su. Why are you following me?

50
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,521
Follow you?

51
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,594
I'm walking you home.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,248
Don't mind me. Just keep studying.

53
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:18,563
No. I'll go home by myself.

54
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,238
I don't like walking home with someone.

55
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,359
Don't follow me.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,680
This is it.

57
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,111
Soo Jeong, your house is huge.

58
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,960
- You can go now. - I'll see you go in first.

59
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,220
You go first.

60
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,839
It feels like we're really dating.

61
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,166
Why don't you go home now?

62
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,806
Okay, I'll go home.

63
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,628
Bye.

64
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:08,711
Okay, bye.

65
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,068
See you tomorrow. Bye. Good night.

66
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,242
Go home, quickly.

67
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,820
Who is it?

68
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,538
Oh, that's right.

69
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,048
- Who is it? - I'm sorry, I got the wrong house.

70
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,767
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

71
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,499
Soo Jeong.

72
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,151
Stop following me.

73
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,027
I'm not following you.

74
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,691
I'm walking you home.

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,588
I never lied.

76
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,848
I just let them believe what they wanted to believe.

77
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,335
I never said...

78
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,102
a lie.

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,419
I know.

80
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,592
Wherever you live,

81
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,060
you're...

82
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,336
still Son Soo Jeong.

83
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,070
Right?

84
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,281
This is it.

85
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,594
This is my real house.

86
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,080
I see.

87
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,278
Now that I know your house,

88
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,693
I'll walk you home every day.

89
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,602
Stop it. Go home.

90
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,963
I'll see you go in first.

91
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:20,148
- I'll... - No, wait a second.

92
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,411
Well...

93
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,691
- Bye. - Bye.

94
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,900
That's right.

95
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not embarrassed.

96
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:51,344
What's wrong with being poor?

97
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:59,439
Gosh, who the heck did this to my gate?

98
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,269
Whoever it was,

99
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,259
he did such a nice job.

100
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,024
Goodness.

101
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,867
The door opens so easily.

102
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,778
Gosh, he's good.

103
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,738
I wonder who did this.

104
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,432
Goodness.

105
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,656
Isn't the gate as pretty as Soo Jeong now?

106
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,157
See you later.

107
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,303
Bok Su, you're silly.

108
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,234
I'm much prettier.

109
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,461
Soo Jeong. Don't go in now.

110
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,101
- What? - You'll get hurt if you do.

111
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,422
What do you mean?

112
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,161
I think...

113
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,898
Bok Su said something he shouldn't.

114
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:24,900
Soo Jeong is here.

115
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:32,571
Come here.

116
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,514
I'll take care of myself.

117
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,528
- What's going... - Hey, Soo Jeong.

118
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,419
I hear you live on food stamps.

119
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,839
How can you fool us like that?

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,011
You must've laughed at us when we asked you about your tutor.

121
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,149
Right?

122
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,808
I didn't fool you.

123
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:55,759
Hey, we all thought you were from a rich family.

124
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,485
You laughed every time when we asked you about your tutor.

125
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:01,472
Why are you lying?

126
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,250
I never lied.

127
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,522
She's so cunning.

128
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,698
She must've thought we were ridiculous.

129
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,538
You just thought whatever you wanted.

130
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,963
Why didn't you correct us then?

131
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,763
I'm human too.

132
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:26,897
It's not something to boast about.

133
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,730
I'm not...

134
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,001
a liar.

135
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,311
Why are you hiding, Soo Jeong?

136
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,654
Is this all you got?

137
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,721
Get a hold of yourself...

138
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,720
and face them.

139
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,680
How pitiful.

140
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,668
I can't believe she receives basic livelihood security.

141
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,771
Hey, you're going to end up offending that poor girl.

142
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,318
Bok Su seriously cares too much. His hobby is to help people.

143
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,548
No wonder he was so nice to Soo Jeong.

144
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:36,801
I guess he felt sorry for her.

145
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,280
Are you okay?

146
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:56,651
Se Ho.

147
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,159
Is this what you meant when you told me that Bok Su said something...

148
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,289
he shouldn't have?

149
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,938
He would never do something like that.

150
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,969
I'm sure he didn't mean any harm.

151
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,675
He apparently felt sorry for you. That's why...

152
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,077
I heard he even painted your front gate.

153
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,267
What do you know about trust?

154
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,034
Because of you,

155
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,173
I don't trust anyone anymore.

156
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,880
Fine.

157
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,159
I'm no longer going to ask you guys...

158
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,225
why you did that to me.

159
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,421
I'll just return...

160
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,399
as much as I received.

161
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,178
After you both ruined my life with misunderstandings and lies,

162
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,998
one became a teacher, and the other one became a chairman.

163
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,710
Neither of you deserve to live such a decent life.

164
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,916
You're both going to regret...

165
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,452
bringing me back to school.

166
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,150
Ms. Son.

167
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,032
- Ms. Son. - Yes?

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,760
Right.

169
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,762
Today, we'll learn about novels that finish off where they started.

170
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:55,688
Let's start by reading the first paragraph.

171
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:56,840
Young Min, please read it out loud.

172
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,122
Ms. Son wants you to read it out loud.

173
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,118
Get lost if you're going to disturb her lecture.

174
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,376
"I was also worried that someone might overhear us."

175
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,711
"So I looked over to the person that seemed suspicious..."

176
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,676
Chae Min, what are you doing?

177
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,244
It just seemed like he wasn't concentrating.

178
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,485
You should leave if you're going to keep being like this.

179
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,872
I said, I'm not going to leave.

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,424
I'm not going to leave. I'm going to stay, okay?

181
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,880
Young Min.

182
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:50,504
<font color="#0080ff">[Kocowa Ver] </font>

183
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,460
Drink it before it gets cold.

184
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,106
You seemed startled earlier.

185
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,448
You said you don't trust anyone.

186
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,240
Is that true?

187
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,756
I'm hoping you'll at least trust me.

188
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,850
Just like you did...

189
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,281
in the past.

190
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,361
The past?

191
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,912
I did feel the need to talk about that incident at least once.

192
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,736
I didn't take your side back then.

193
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,849
I just testified what I heard.

194
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,914
Even so, I felt really grateful.

195
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,684
It felt as if I was fighting alone against the incredible Kang Bok Su.

196
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,441
But you testified.

197
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,042
And I felt grateful for that.

198
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:45,922
Bok Su doesn't seem to have changed at all, right?

199
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,889
It's funny how he's determined to take revenge.

200
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,411
Gosh, that's hot.

201
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,152
Are you okay?

202
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,263
Stop laughing.

203
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:58,760
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,531
Well,

205
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,210
I actually called you here because of the kids in Wildflower Class.

206
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,349
What? Did they cause trouble?

207
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,138
No, that's not it.

208
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,388
I made that class so that they can focus on finding a career path.

209
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,499
I'm thinking about inviting lecturers from outside...

210
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,681
to give them career education as an after-school activity.

211
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,869
The school should help students find a way if they aren't able...

212
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,880
to go to college.

213
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,993
What do you think about trusting me...

214
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,650
and see how I'll change...

215
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,928

216
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,823
Can I take this call?

217
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,663
Yes, this is Son Soo Jeong.

218
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,259
I'm calling from Hana Nursing Home.

219
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,688
Your grandmother's condition suddenly worsened.

220
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:47,028
So she's being transferred to Hanguk Hospital.

221
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,111
You should hurry over there.

222
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,031
Right now, she has pneumonia.

223
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,634
But she also has a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

224
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:06,959
Yes.

225
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,749
She was okay for a while.

226
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,760
As you already know,

227
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,349
we can't stop her lungs from malfunctioning due to that disease.

228
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,138
She managed to endure it for a long time,

229
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,328
but due to her old age, she'll get pneumonia a lot more often now.

230
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,875
So you should take good care of her.

231
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,125
She needs to get hospitalized for a week and receive treatment.

232
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,350
Okay.

343
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,839
for people to date within the school.

344
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,697
Did they look like they're dating to you?

345
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,649

346
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,033
to date her.

347
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,418

350
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,008
is all connected to money for you.

351
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,186
You should know since you lost a big sum of money.

352
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,910

353
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,398
You're still good at hurting people without having a clue.

Actually,

355
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,494

Well,

362
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:21,529
I think Bok Su took this chance...

363
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,631
to get over the pain from the past.

364
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,385
I believe that's why he came back.

365
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,639

but ever since that incident happened,

367
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:35,311
he struggled to become an adult way too fast.

368
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,715
It hurt me to watch him like that.

369
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,018
I believe Bok Su...

370
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,323
gave me another chance too.

371
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,589
This time, I'll surely...

372
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,388
protect him until the end.

373
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,438
This isn't much.

374
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:04,762
Please accept it as a token of thanks.

375
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:08,508
No, no. You can't do this. I'll be in big trouble.

376
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:10,731
I'll be fired. No, no.

377
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,434
You can't do this if you're thinking about Bok Su.

378
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:16,001
I'm doing this for Bok Su.

379
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:20,187
I'm an old-fashioned woman. This is the only way I know how.

380
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,615
Please accept it.

381
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:26,579
I'll get going now.

382
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:30,909
Ma'am, you can't... Wait. Ma'am. Ma'am.

383
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,983
Hey...

384
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,551
(Coupon for Sojunggak)

385
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,823
(Collect 40 for a medium tangsuyuk. Collect 50 for a large tangsuyuk.)

386
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,217
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)

387
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,968
Hey, you...

388
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,279
You've been placing last in Ivy class for five weeks.

389
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,349
What are you going to do? You should go to SKY class.

390
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,804
You can be number one in SKY class.

391
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,019
Gosh.

392
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,656
Clear out your glass booth today.

393
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,131
Got it?

394
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,506
Answer me!

395
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,753
Hey! Oh Young Min!

396
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:25,841
I'm an Ivy.

397
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,682
- I won't leave. - Hey, trash.

398
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,352
Take the garbage out.

399
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,009
The whole class is feeling down...

400
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,736
because of you, so you should volunteer to do this.

401
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,509
At least this can be recycled.

402
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,732
What will you do?

403
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,465
Why am I trash?

404
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,569
You little...

405
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,709
Young Min, are you crazy?

406
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,256
That's enough. His nose is bleeding.

407
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:58,780
Go away.

408
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,999
Just leave like everyone else. You never cared about me before.

409
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,454
Just get lost!

410
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,080
Hey, stop!

411
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:06,550
Stop, stop.

412
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,558
What do you think you're doing, punks?

413
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,704
Chae Min! Everyone, into the study hall.

414
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,969
What are you doing? Do you want to get penalty points?

415
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,180
Where are you going, Young Min? Young Min.

416
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,241
Where are you going, Young Min?

417
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,143
Young Min! Young Min! Open up!

418
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:41,560
You're supposed to go to SKY class now.

419
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,094
Open up, Young Min!

420
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,449
Young Min, let's talk.

421
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,460
Young Min!

422
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,318
The board chairman will get mad once he hears about this.

423
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,348
Open the door!

424
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:53,788
This is my desk.

425
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,406
This is where I belong!

426
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,540
Young Min.

427
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,868
We're planning to install...

428
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:05,768
a snack bar exclusive to the Ivy class students.

429
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,639
This is the new board director's idea.

430
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,094
Gosh. How did he come up with such an idea?

431
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,039
It's actually a waste of time...

432
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,509
for Ivy class students to even go to the snack bar.

433
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,909
Oh Young Min! Open the door!

434
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,364
Why did you go in here?

435
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,129
What's going on?

436
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:23,967
Well...

437
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,618
Open the door, Young Min!

438
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:28,245
Young Min. Open the door.

439
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,248
Don't you have the key?

440
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,829
Young Min's a little worked up. Have the other kids move out.

441
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,229
- Guys, get out. - Let's go.

442
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,876
- Go, go. - Get out.

443
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,422
Young Min! Oh Young Min!

444
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,216
Is that Oh Young Min?

445
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:45,197
Call his mom right now and tell her to take him away.

446
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:46,997
Gosh, he's not normal.

447
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,909
Mr. Kim, please show the parents out.

448
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,161
Yes, sir.

449
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,502
- Young Min, please calm down. - Hey!

450
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,020
It's so annoying. I can't watch any longer.

451
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,057
Move. Get out of my way.

452
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,651
Move.

453
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,427
- Hey! No. - Bok Su.

454
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,507
- What are you doing? - What do you think?

455
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,514
Can't you see I'm trying not to ignore you?

456
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,949
Young Min.

457
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,656
Bob Marley said this once.

458
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,208
"None but ourselves can free our minds."

459
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,748
The one that's locking you up isn't your mom...

460
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:37,506
or the school. It's yourself.

461
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,371
See?

462
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,575
It's nothing once you break it down.

463
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,781
I broke this ridiculous prison cell for you,

464
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:49,542
but you should free yourself...

465
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,814
from the prison in your heart.

466
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:40,318
How can our kids go to school with a thug like him?

467
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,734
That's what I mean.

468
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,589
Don't you think we should do something about this?

469
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,710
Kang Bok Su needs to be expelled right away.

470
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,928
We should form a school violence prevention committee...

471
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,258
to make him transfer or expel him.

472
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,987
Just imagine our kids going to school with such a guy.

473
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,284
How vulgar.

474
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,932
Let's wait and see how the new board chairman...

475
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,982
deals with the situation.

476
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,389
Bok Su,

477
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:12,360
now...

478
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,031
is not the time.

479
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,889
- Does it sting a lot? - Of course.

480
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,452
A glass this big cut me.

481
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:40,490
Ms. Son.

482
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,896
Gosh, sorry.

483
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:46,023
I think that's enough disinfectant.

484
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,259
Come here.

485
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,851
I almost died from excessive bleeding.

486
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,111
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,709
For what?

488
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,225
You know,

489
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,602
we almost died side by side.

490
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,586
We're like comrades who almost saw death together.

491
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,019
My comrade was fighting alone without a gun...

492
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,171
at a warzone called school.

493
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,237
I didn't even get you some ration.

494
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,984
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

495
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,199
It's okay.

496
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,944
You're on contract.

497
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:34,747
Hey, I'm a full-time teacher now.

498
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:36,740
You little...

499
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,638
Anyway, just sleep here...

500
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,983
until they clean up the study hall.

501
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,932
You know, I used to memorize vocabs...

502
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,373
even when I was sick in bed.

503
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,190
I was too anxious.

504
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,433
Do you want me to bring you your vocabulary notes?

505
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,930
No.

506
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,840
Gosh.

507
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,621
Hey.

508
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,523
Why didn't you twist my arm today?

509
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,563
What is it?

510
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,183
I can't scold you nor praise you.

511
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,789
Why did this school end up like this?

512
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,870
Is this right?

513
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,985
I don't know. How did it become like this?

514
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,387
I don't know where or how it could be fixed.

515
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,651
If you don't know, who does?

516
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,129
Here, put this on.

517
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,029
No, no! Don't gross me out.

518
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,698
What? Your mother will be startled.

519
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:50,830
How can you make such trouble when you just got into school?

520
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,509
You said you can't scold me.

521
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,708
Just give it to me. I'll do it.

522
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:55,208
Are you saying what you did was good?

523
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,909
You should talk things out.

524
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,379
Why do you always take action first?

525
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,818
What do you use that mouth for?

526
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:01,049
Is it only for eating?

527
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,948
You're scolding me again. I'm leaving.

528
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,505
- Hey. - No, no. I don't care.

529
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,646
He grew up well, that Bok Su.

530
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:14,780
Hey, school's not over yet! Come back here!

531
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,688
You punk. Come here.

532
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,880
Come back here!

533
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:28,861
Are you home, son? Are you tired?

534
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,912
I didn't have a fight.

535
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,318
I was playing basketball with the kids.

536
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,958
I don't know if it's because they're young,

537
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,159
but they got so into it.

538
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,228
The ball kind of went like this.

539
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,503
I didn't ask.

540
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:51,889
Give it to me, I'll do it.

541
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,854
Give it to me.

542
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,988
Why are you staring like that?

543
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:10,401
I'm sorry.

544
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,188
Rumors about the student spread at our school already.

545
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:15,229
We can't accept him.

546
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,058
He's violent. The nature of his crime is bad.

547
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:24,629
If I may be frank with you,

548
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,568
even all of the parents know...

549
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:29,024
about your son.

550
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,224
Do you think he'll be able to adjust here?

551
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,335
The other students are already scared of him.

552
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,564
He should just write the qualification exam.

553
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:37,989
Please.

554
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,795
Please, just this once.

555
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,063
Please, just this once.

556
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,322
Why aren't you coming?

557
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,088
My gosh. You look incredible from behind, Mom.

558
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,376
I still have what it takes.

559
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,456
Bok Su, do you want to eat tteokbokki?

560
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,772
Let's go on a date.

561
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,709
Come on.

562
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,490
By the way,

563
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,801
is there anything you want to say to me...

564
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,293
now that I'm back in school?

565
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,848
Do you want me to study harder?

566
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:54,588
Or maybe you want me to stop fighting with others.

567
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,983
If people suddenly change, that means they're about to die.

568
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,807
You never studied until now.

569
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:02,129
And you'd have to be crazy to get into fights...

570
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,583
when you're 27 years old.

571
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,410
Right.

572
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,973
Gosh, then I guess there's nothing much I can do for you.

573
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,251
A diploma.

574
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,537
I just want you to get a high school diploma.

575
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,350
Shim Ran.

576
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,859
What's wrong? Do you feel upset again?

577
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,654
You became a full-time teacher.

578
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:47,331
Yes, I know.

579
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:51,208
But being a teacher really isn't easy.

580
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:53,442
Stealing, fighting,

581
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,600
sewing, and pointing fingers at people.

582
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,717
Anyway, everything is hard including all the things I mentioned just now.

583
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,130
There's one thing that's easy.

584
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,071
It's munching on snacks.

585
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,670
Ma'am, you can't eat stuff when you haven't paid for them yet.

586
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,433
I wanted to become a good teacher.

587
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:24,532
And I mean, a really good teacher.

588
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,478
Not the kind of teacher...

589
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:29,550
who contributes in making the kids feel suffocated and suicidal.

590
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,022
What kind of teacher do you think is a good teacher?

591
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,899
Someone that helps clueless students find their dreams.

592
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,242
What's your dream?

593
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:44,968
I don't have a dream yet.

594
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,504
Then what do you think about becoming a teacher?

595
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,021
A teacher?

596
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,480
What do you think I'm doing?

597
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,728
Can't you see I'm trying not to ignore you?

598
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:56,696
A teacher that doesn't disregard...

599
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,051
his or her students just because they're busy with their own lives.

600
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:10,158
(Seolsong High School)

601
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:12,828
I watched that video of Bok Su breaking the glass booth...

602
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,576
over and over again yesterday.

603
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,528
Bok Su can be a reckless troublemaker at times,

604
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,650
but that video actually helped me relieve my stress.

605
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,554
- Hello. - Hello.

606
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,301
My gosh, what's this?

607
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,596
"A disciplinary committee"?

608
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:35,038
I've always been curious...

609
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,548
about why people love you so much.

610
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,919
Stop talking to me.

611
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,878
Your voice is enough to get me agitated.

612
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,272
I told you...

613
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,151
that being nosy will do you more harm than good.

614
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,228
You should use your brain.

615
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:53,698
Are you torturing your students because you're using yours?

616
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,369
You line them up according to their grades.

617
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,009
And they get terrified that their grades might drop.

618
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,080
Can you call this a school?

619
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:01,763
Do you remember telling me that you don't like your mom?

620
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,778
But you're no different...

621
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,531
from your mom.

622
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,632
No, I'm different.

623
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,910
I'm not neglecting the ones falling behind.

624
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,746
I made Wildflower Class so that I could take care of them.

625
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,329
Hey, cut the nonsense and take a look around you.

626
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:21,698
Students complain because they're studying so hard...

627
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,254
and they even study inside weird glass booths.

628
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:29,863
You just wait and see. Things will change.

629
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,758
You'll be able to find out how shallow...

630
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:41,730
your thought was.

631
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:52,700
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:56,263
We're planning to punish him accordingly.

633
00:43:56,429 --> 00:43:57,928
Don't worry so much.

634
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:00,098
Okay, bye.

635
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:02,098
Gosh, what a headache.

636
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,059
First, it was Young Min. Then, Bok Su added onto it.

637
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:05,421
Ms. Son.

638
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,494
You should treat us to a meal.

639
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:10,892
Don't even get me started.

640
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:13,348
I even got complaint texts last night.

641
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:14,591
You should treat us to some drinks as well.

642
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,619
What do they say?

643
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,418
What do you think? They want us to expel Bok Su.

644
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,688
"I'm scared that gangster will have a bad influence on my kid."

645
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:24,477
"Shouldn't that be considered as school violence?"

646
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,322
That's not school violence. He had a good reason...

647
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:28,739
Ms. Son.

648
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,612
Come to the chairman's office right now.

649
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:42,322
Hello, Chairwoman Lim.

650
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,608
I'm glad you're all here.

651
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:49,609
Were you not planning on reporting to me about what happened yesterday?

652
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,049
Of course we were going to report to you.

653
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,989
We just thought it'd be best to tell you...

654
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,273
once things got settled.

655
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,128
What brings you here? You didn't call beforehand.

656
00:45:00,129 --> 00:45:03,603
Must I let you know before visiting my own school?

657
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:08,649
Take a seat.

658
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:17,673
<font color="#0080ff">[Kocowa Ver] </font>

659
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,095
Ms. Son, please come inside.

660
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,271
She's Bok Su's homeroom teacher, so we asked her to come.

661
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:33,558
Please keep your answers short and simple.

662
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:35,114
What do you plan to do?

663
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,729
After holding the disciplinary committee...

664
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,840
Expel him.

665
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:44,868
Bok Su may have broken nothing but a glass booth for now,

666
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:48,779
but that could lead to breaking our school's educational philosophy.

667
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:52,148
We worked hard to come up with a differentiated system.

668
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,219
But once the kids start to realize that it can be broken very easily,

669
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,633
things will become very dangerous.

670
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:59,171
We need to get rid of him before things get worse.

671
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,929
Gosh, you do have a point.

672
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,161
Chairwoman Lim, you really do come up with great solutions.

673
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:11,394
They say violence is like a contagious disease.

674
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,939
But when the school expels a student,

675
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,495
there are certain procedures that need to be taken.

676
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,818
And the press is still focused on Bok Su right now.

677
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,228
What do you think, Ms. Son?

678
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:25,859
Pardon?

679
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:30,155
As his homeroom teacher, what do you think of Bok Su?

680
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,628
Ms. Son, are you sleeping?

681
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,040
I agree with Chairwoman Lim.

682
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:10,088
Whatever the reason may be, breaking the school's property...

683
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:13,322
is still an act of defiance, so I think we should deal...

684
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:15,912
with him objectively.

685
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,204
Hello, sir.

686
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:44,669
Sir, my foot.

687
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:47,571
It did feel nice.

688
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,269
I wanted to break that glass booth ever since a long time ago.

689
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:53,452
My gosh, you were so manly. Pow!

690
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,089
That's enough.

691
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,549
He did nothing good.

692
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,949
A student should never do anything so dangerous.

693
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,465
Someone could've gotten seriously injured.

694
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,945
Ms. Son, what's...

695
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:16,343
What's going to happen to Bok Su?

696
00:48:16,419 --> 00:48:18,783
Can't we just compensate for the broken glass booth?

697
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,358
I'll pitch in and donate 100 dollars.

698
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,956
100 dollars? Give me the 50 cents you borrowed from me first.

699
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,712
He'll probably get expelled.

700
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,051
"Expelled"?

701
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,408
Hey, back when I broke a door, I just had to do volunteer work.

702
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,733
Breaking a door is nothing compared to breaking a glass booth.

703
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:38,479
The glass booths are a symbol of our school's hierarchical system.

704
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,722
And he broke that.

705
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:40,991
Is that true, Ms. Son?

706
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,230
What do you think?

707
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,530
Will I get expelled?

708
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:54,895
Do you also think that what I did was wrong?

709
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:02,398
Then do you think breaking a glass booth with a chair...

710
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,209
when a person was inside was right?

711
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,886
Should I have ignored him...

712
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,108
when he was suffering so bad?

713
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:10,483
Young Min was yelling for help because he was in misery.

714
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:13,131
Should I have just left him?

715
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,911
Even if you didn't help him, I would've,

716
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,358
no, the teachers would've helped him.

717
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,309
You wouldn't have shattered the glass booth though.

718
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,158
Bok Su.

719
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,806
Things like that need to be shattered.

720
00:49:28,129 --> 00:49:29,644
We're all the same students.

721
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,580
Aren't we?

722
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,311
He's right.

723
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,753
I kind of liked it.

724
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,500
- Why? - Well...

725
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:43,024
Until now,

726
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,571
only the students who were in there seemed special.

727
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:48,476
It was as if there was a line that divided us.

728
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:50,567
When I saw it get shattered,

729
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,905
I felt relieved actually.

730
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,029
- Yes. - That's right.

731
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,474
Are you crazy?

732
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,558
We're still just Ivy class' sidekicks.

733
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,711
What do you mean?

734
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,272
Students are students all the same. Nobody is special.

735
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,165
No, everyone is special.

736
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,298
Ms. Son!

737
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,548
- Ms. Son! - Ms. Son!

738
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,688
- Ms. Son! - Ms. Son!

739
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:34,282
- Ms. Son! - Ms. Son!

740
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:41,167
Why am I excluded from the disciplinary committee?

741
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,239
I'm the head teacher, but if I'm excluded...

742
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,239
Well...

743
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,522
It's because you have a special relationship with Bok Su.

744
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,938
I'll make an official complaint to the principal.

745
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:56,388
Goodness. You love making complaints too much.

746
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,088
The principal made the decision himself.

747
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,877
So do whatever you like.

748
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,299
They can't do this to Bok Su again.

749
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,885
They can't do this.

750
00:51:15,399 --> 00:51:16,409
Excuse...

751
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,199
Principal Kim.

752
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,600
Why am I excluded from the disciplinary committee?

753
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:28,418
Mr. Park. You can't make a nuisance here. Get out.

754
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,588
Don't ignore the kids just because they're young.

755
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:33,479
They all know what's being done to them.

756
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:35,759
The school locked Young Min up in there.

757
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,088
The school system did.

758
00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:39,058
And Bok Su broke that system.

759
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,282
We don't want that system to be shattered.

760
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,128
Thanks to Bok Su's return,

761
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:45,598
the angry public sentiment died down.

762
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,317
Education should provide a chance.

763
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:49,892
A chance. What should we do?

764
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,168
We already decided to not give him...

765
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:53,483
that chance.

766
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,993
What are you doing? Take him out.

767
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:00,279
Mr. Park.

768
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,949
You shouldn't raise your voice here.

769
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,118
He had a really tough time to get here.

770
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:06,674
The school shouldn't do this to him.

771
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,205
Wait a minute.

772
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:16,636
He hasn't changed.

773
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,640
Bok Su, where is your guardian?

774
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:42,919
Don't you know how old I am? I'm an adult.

775
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,058
I'm my own guardian.

776
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,252
Do you think this is a joke?

777
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:57,299
No, I didn't mean it like that...

778
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,537
Bok Su's guardian is here.

779
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:10,700
So Jeong?

780
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:17,529
Hey, you have a guardian.

781
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,640
How did you...

782
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,831
I apologize for my lateness.

783
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,292
Bok Su's mom. You're here.

784
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,257
I'm his older sister.

785
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,739
How can you say I'm his...

786
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,265
Why didn't his mother come?

787
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,301
My mother doesn't know yet.

788
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,249
I couldn't make her come here twice for something like this.

789
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,260
That's no excuse.

790
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,075
Parents should know what their kids are up to.

791
00:53:46,149 --> 00:53:49,118
I heard he destroyed school property.

792
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:51,044
Of course that was wrong.

793
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:55,898
Still, I heard he saved a student who was in there.

794
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,011
Saved a student?

795
00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:00,299
Do you think he was locked up in there?

796
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:02,825
He should be punished for his wrongdoings,

797
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,048
but he had good intentions. Please believe him.

798
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,065
He doesn't say it,

799
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,674
but he's excited to go to school.

800
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,951
At first, I wondered why he'd return to school...

801
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,665
at his age.

802
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,888
But looking at how the uniform and backpack...

803
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,738
still suits him well,

804
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:28,337
I think to myself, "Yes, Bok Su belongs to school."

805
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:31,614
I really do.

806
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:39,843
Punish him for what he did wrong.

807
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,578
But school is a place where students learn...

808
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:46,580
to fix their wrongdoings.

809
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,747
Please. Give Bok Su,

810
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:55,057
poor Bok Su, a chance just this once.

811
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,886
I beg you.

812
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,489
School isn't a daycare.

813
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,752
You can embrace him at home.

814
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,299
You're probably a parent too.

815
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,969
You shouldn't be like that.

816
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,969
Your kid will learn from you.

817
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,980
What?

818
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,520
I'm sorry.

819
00:55:22,379 --> 00:55:25,049
He's very good at apologizing...

820
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,807
for what he did wrong like this.

821
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,533
He says he's sorry.

822
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:31,248
I'll take care of it from here, so go home.

823
00:55:34,629 --> 00:55:36,276
Excuse me, Miss.

824
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,740
I mean...

825
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:41,221
Bok Su's guardian should wait outside.

826
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,349
Good luck.

827
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,877
Please take good care of Bok Su.

828
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:06,067
It's a good thing Bok Su knows...

829
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:07,471
that he did wrong.

830
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:13,342
I'm sorry I destroyed school property.

831
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:15,379
But...

832
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:19,070
I don't think I did wrong.

833
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,709
What are you joking about?

834
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,850
I did the right thing.

835
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,495
Young Min smiled.

836
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,668
He probably have never smiled like that.

837
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,232
Bok Su!

838
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,348
There are laws to follow...

839
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:34,542
and rules to obey at school.

840
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,088
You're old enough to know...

841
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,907
Yes, I know.

842
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,765
That class system pretending to be customized education is a rule.

843
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:45,493
The resulting benefits and discrimination are also rules.

844
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:46,909
But...

845
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,592
S Crystal said this.

846
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,597
S Crystal?

847
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,276
There are many variables in rules.

848
00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:01,144
- Me? - Just memorize them.

849
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:06,687
S Crystal? Who is S Crystal?

850
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,402
So just memorize this.

851
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:12,583
Seolsong's numerous variables of rules...

852
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,515
will be me.

853
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,771
He's crazy.

854
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,828
Are you trying to teach us? You're so arrogant.

855
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:23,799
Force him to transfer to another school.

856
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:28,308
Expel him. He should be expelled.

857
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,979
Ma'am, please calm down.

858
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,130
We haven't heard from his teacher.

859
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:36,791
Ms. Son,

860
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,709
what do you think?

861
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:00,668
Are you trying to be a teacher by bribing him?

862
00:58:00,669 --> 00:58:01,979
Why couldn't you become...

863
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,779
a permanent teacher even though you spent 50,000 dollars?

864
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,819
You know what?

865
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,633
A fake doesn't last long.

866
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,432
Bok Su is...

867
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,633
the most dangerous student...

868
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,248
this school has ever seen.

869
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:42,444
(My Strange Hero)

870
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,098
How stupid. You always came short.

871
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:05,108
I'm jealous of Bok Su.

872
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:07,209
His mom is like those moms in dramas.

873
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,509
I didn't ask her to help me.

874
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,479
Why did she get involved and put herself in the spot?

875
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,549
How dare you grab my hand?

876
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,179
Like this.

877
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,348
Bok Su, you're making me age!

878
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:19,449
I'm dating Bok Su. Do you know how he lived until now?

879
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,418
Why is Soo Jeong coming out from here?

880
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:24,058
What? Se Ho, was it about this all along?

881
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,358
Isn't a rich jerk...

882
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,147
better than a loser going back to school?

883
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,699
I, Kang Bok Su,

884
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,720
won't ever lose.
