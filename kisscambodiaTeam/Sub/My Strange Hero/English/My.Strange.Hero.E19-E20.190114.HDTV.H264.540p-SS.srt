00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,822
(Counseling Room)

2
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,970
Gosh, how bold of them.

3
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:32,595
Wait.

4
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:39,377
This can't be happening. We're finally dating in nine years.

5
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,474
No, this can't happen.

6
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:44,149
Things still need to stay nice and sweet between us.

7
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:47,994
I need to stop him. I must stop Seung Woo no matter what.

8
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:49,348
Hey, Seung Woo!

9
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:57,916
We need to talk.

10
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:00,293
(Episode 19)

11
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:06,430
Well...

12
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,326
What were you doing here at such a late hour?

13
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:14,114
I left my cell phone at school.

14
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,755
Oh, really? You should've been more careful.

15
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:23,164
By the way, Seung Woo, do you tend to have...

16
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:24,579
a big mouth?

17
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,303
- What? - You're not someone...

18
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:28,604
who's disloyal, ungrateful, and rude enough...

19
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:31,473
to reveal your classmate's privacy...

20
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:35,250
just so you could ruin his life and humiliate him, right?

21
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:38,139
What are you trying to do right now?

22
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:43,972
Are you trying to keep my mouth shut?

23
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:46,274
I guess I wasn't mistaken about what I saw after all.

24
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:49,137
I'll think about it...

25
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:51,375
depending on how you behave.

26
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:56,946
This little punk.

27
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,743
What should we do? What am I going to do?

28
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:06,543
I'm a teacher. What am I going to do?

29
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:09,213
You need to calm down first. Calm down and...

30
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:12,316
Why did you have to hug me right then?

31
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,453
I mean, you were feeling all upset.

32
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,724
So I felt upset as well, and I wanted to console you.

33
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,493
Then you should've just consoled me. Why did you hug me?

34
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,869
You should've thought about the kids.

35
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:25,599
You shouldn't have hugged me so tenderly and warmly.

36
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:28,876
Gosh, whatever.

37
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,404
What if the kids spread rumors?

38
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:33,526
Don't worry too much.

39
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:34,716
I'll take care of this.

40
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,456
How?

41
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,124
Seung Woo.

42
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:44,926
Seung Woo.

43
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:49,766
Follow me outside.

44
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:52,735
- Let's go. - Okay.

45
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,854
Hey, I don't want any one of you following us outside.

46
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:58,363
What? But we're a set.

47
00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,733
A thread and needle are inseparable.

48
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,654
Just like how bulgogi burgers are with milk.

49
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:05,263
I made myself clear that I need to talk to Seung Woo in private.

50
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:07,147
I said, follow me outside!

51
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:33,675
Bul...

52
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,760
- Bulgogi... - What?

53
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,499
Hey, order three bulgogi burgers and whatever else you want.

54
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:45,400
I won't ask why you're doing this.

55
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,430
Thank you, sir.

56
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:48,585
Go on.

57
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,503
I suddenly have a huge appetite.

58
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,033
I'd like a nanocone, comiball, fish cake,

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,114
milk, and chocolate ice cream.

60
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:56,801
- All right. - Wait.

61
00:04:57,284 --> 00:04:58,684
Three of each, please.

62
00:04:58,685 --> 00:04:59,705
You got it.

63
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,364
You're so determined about coming to the snack bar.

64
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:06,283
You memorized all the English terms for placing orders here.

65
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:09,679
It's just basic English.

66
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:15,403
Hey, I know what you're imagining right now.

67
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,061
But you're completely wrong...

68
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:20,363
- Actually, you're right. - My gosh.

69
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,126
I...

70
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:28,612
like Soo Jeong.

71
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,094
It's been nine years.

72
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,509
You're a romanticist.

73
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,393
So let me tell you something.

74
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:39,093
Every Korean man needs to know how to keep a secret.

75
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:41,794
And you see, you might now know this,

76
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,304
but you need to give a chance and let the adults...

77
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:46,773
take care of their matters on their own.

78
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,552
So this is...

79
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,544
I don't know what I'm saying, but can you just keep it a secret?

80
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,643
That depends on how you behave.

81
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,028
You're unbelievable. Hey.

82
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,444
When an adult asks you for a favor, you should say "Okay, sir."

83
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,232
But what? It depends on how I behave?

84
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:00,565
- You little... - Gosh.

85
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,953
I really feel the urge to tell everyone about what I saw.

86
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:03,995
Here.

87
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,393
Look at you eat.

88
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,824
- What do you want? - I want a drink.

89
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,893
A drink? What do you want? Milk?

90
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,844
- I don't like milk. - Oh, okay.

91
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,006
Hey, guys.

92
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,403
Did you guys not like the lunch menu today?

93
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,868
What's with the negative atmosphere?

94
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:31,124
Today, we're going to study Yeom Sang Seop's "Mansejeon"...

95
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,712
What's wrong with you guys? Open your books.

96
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:42,516
What's going on right now?

97
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,813
Why don't you try asking yourself...

98
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,618
what it is that we're trying to protest against.

99
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,618
That's enough.

100
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,155
Young Min.

101
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,764
How much did you pay Mr. Park?

102
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,783
How much did you pay for him to give you more points...

103
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:09,906
You're the one who bribed the teachers.

104
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,523
Gosh, are you crazy?

105
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,141
I have one more question.

106
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,741
Did you actually study for your grades?

107
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,336
Or did you pay someone...

108
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:23,375
You little...

109
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:37,695
Hey, hey.

110
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:41,453
Why are you getting involved? Move.

111
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:42,495
Young Min.

112
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,438
Things will become difficult for you if you use violence.

113
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:46,324
Don't do it.

114
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,840
What do you think you're doing?

115
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,124
Get out of the way!

116
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,519
What do you think you're doing in school?

117
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:53,347
You little punk.

118
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,786
- Chae Min. - Young Min, are you okay?

119
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:04,404
Chae Min, are you okay?

120
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,556
What's going on?

121
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:14,884
Did Bok Su cause trouble again?

122
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,642
It wasn't Bok Su. Chae Min's the one...

123
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,254
I want you to write up a report.

124
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,466
I'll call the School Violence Prevention Committee.

125
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:29,307
My goodness.

126
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:43,074
Sir, we heard there was a fight.

127
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:44,883
You just heard of it?

128
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:46,158
Call the School Violence Prevention Committee.

129
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:58,863
Gosh, he practically lives in school.

130
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:00,963
He's a young man. He should be going on dates.

131
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,086
Why does he keep taking over my job?

132
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:05,714
Do you think...

133
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,574
he's trying to fire me?

134
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,423
Gosh, no way.

135
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,003
But then again,

136
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,671
he might be pressuring you to leave on your own.

137
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,405
Mr. Song, please excuse me.

138
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:27,787
I could become the principal if you're not around.

139
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:31,324
- That hurts. - Stop being a crybaby.

140
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,112
Chae Min had to go to the hospital.

141
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,011
You didn't even get hurt that much.

142
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:36,764
Do you think Chae Min's just pretending to be hurt?

143
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,564
I'm not sure. Chae Min's mother came the moment she heard...

144
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,150
and threw a huge fit.

145
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:45,473
You don't seem like it, but do you fight well?

146
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:47,213
I know, right? It was like a scene in a movie.

147
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:48,932
Why did you let them bully you like that until now?

148
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:51,265
My mom told me not to fight people.

149
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:54,414
Hey, you really shouldn't talk.

150
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:56,172
You sound like a loser every time you talk.

151
00:09:58,254 --> 00:09:59,295
Look at me.

152
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,524
Are you sure that Chae Min hit you first?

153
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,605
Yes.

154
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:05,209
Everyone saw him.

155
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:06,336
Okay.

156
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:07,707
I'm relieved.

157
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:10,934
When you write the report, you need to be accurate and precise.

158
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,246
That's the most important part.

159
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,314
Bok Su, you're so nosy.

160
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:28,830
Why did you have to get involved?

161
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,296
You really are trouble.

162
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,524
I heard Chae Min mentioned something about Mr. Park.

163
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,565
Is he okay?

164
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:35,894
He needs to write up a explanatory statement...

165
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,683
regarding how he graded the debating contest.

166
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:39,209
So I'm sure he's a little upset about that.

167
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,733
The kids from Ivy Class aren't going to be happy.

168
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,388
(Letter of Apology)

169
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:56,257
(Statement)

170
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:00,828
(Anyway, Lee Chae Min hit Oh Young Min first.)

171
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,373
(It was Oh Young Min who started the fight.)

172
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:09,051
Mr. Kim and Ms. Son, come over here.

173
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,963
They're saying the opposite things.

174
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,804
Ivy Class says Young Min is the one who started it,

175
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,174
while Wildflower Class is saying Chae Min started it.

176
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,603
Was this planned?

177
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,144
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,914
- The kids said Chae Min... - Come on.

179
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:29,613
Chae Min was hit a lot more.

180
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:34,059
Also, he's not the type to start a fight.

181
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,054
It's Wildflower Class that's the problem.

182
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:39,684
Mr. Kim, Young Min wouldn't hit Chae Min out of nowhere.

183
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,876
- He would've beat him up if... - Enough!

184
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:44,317
I'll decide on my own, so go back to your desks.

185
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,180
Gosh.

186
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:00,086
Hello.

187
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,324
Yes, Chae Min's Mom.

188
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,753
Yes. Don't worry.

189
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:16,593
Yes, yes. The school will take care of it.

190
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,824
Can you take this to Ivy Class?

191
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,534
- I have to go to the station. - Okay.

192
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:21,777
Yes, Ma'am!

193
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,821
Yes.

(Volunteer Award)

199
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:54,794
How does this make sense? It was him who started it.

200
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,564
Lee Chae Min, that jerk.

201
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:58,164
This is unfair.

202
00:12:58,165 --> 00:12:59,904
I'm going to report a complaint.

203
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,904
I'll write a bill of indictment one can't read without tears.

204
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,144
Our poor Young Min.

205
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,396
- What's wrong with you? - What?

206
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:16,253
Why is Young Min the subject of school violence?

207
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,123
All the kids testified that Chae Min hit him first.

208
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:21,324
Yoon Seung Woo, Kim Jae Yoon, and Yoo Si On...

209
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:24,294
are dumbheads who reached the maximum mileage.

210
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:29,704
The testimonies from kids of Ivy Class are more dependable.

211
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:33,133
This is why your day to day conduct is important.

212
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:36,503
Mr. Kim, how can you doubt kids depending on their marks?

213
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:39,838
I trust in my kids too.

214
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,174
Ms. Son.

215
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:44,644
The students in Ivy Class are still our kids.

216
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:47,453
On what grounds are you doubting their testimonies?

217
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:48,914
That's enough.

218
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,853
If you have more to say,

219
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:52,441
do it at the School Violence Prevention Committee.

220
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,058
I have a good idea. Just trust me.

221
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,233
Young Jun, thank you so much.

222
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,144
If something happens to you...

223
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:12,356
Don't worry about me, Bok Su.

224
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:15,848
I can put up with anything if it's for you.

225
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:19,162
What?

226
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:25,008
- Thank you. I'll get going. - Go, go.

227
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,554
Bye, Bok Su.

228
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,545
I won't tell anyone.

229
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,754
You surprised me! What are you doing there?

230
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,463
Tell me the truth.

231
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,404
Is it true what I just saw?

232
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:41,103
What's going on between you and Bok Su?

233
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,488
Should I be honest with you?

234
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:49,274
He's someone I really like...

235
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,355
Stop!

236
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:52,655
That's enough.

237
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,613
When you wouldn't accept my feelings,

238
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,049
I wondered if this was the case.

239
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:01,294
You're a bad man. Why did you win over my heart?

240
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:03,174
Why? Why?

241
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:10,445
A friend.

242
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,427
He's a friend I really like.

243
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:16,114
Ms. Jang,

244
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:19,202
what are you imagining?

245
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,875
Go in. Hurry. Hurry.

246
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:27,853
Go.

Shoot, where do we start?

252
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,683
I only know how to shoot. I don't know how to use this.

253
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:03,496
Move out of my way.

254
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,453
Hey, do you know how to use that?

255
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:08,353
Yes. I was in the broadcasting club when I was in middle school.

256
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:11,152

What's wrong with him?

It's Jae Yoon. This is ridiculous.

Hey.

265
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,534
Why did you turn this on? It'll make people lose their appetite.

266
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,251
It must be the next video.

267

Force Oh Young Min to transfer to another school.

270
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:04,372
He caused so much trouble, so it wouldn't be too hard.

271
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:08,113
What about Lee Chae Min who also resorted to violence?

272
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,713
Isn't he the most brilliant student we have?

273
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:11,138
That's true.

274
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:14,454
Board Chairman, do you really intend on proceeding...

275
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,716
to get Wildflower Class students to transfer out?

276
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,214
Does your mother know?

277
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,546
Mother...

278
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,550
will compliment me.

279
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:27,734
How much will the average rise once Wildflower Class is gone?

280
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:31,103
It's just that you originally wanted to support them...

281
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:33,173
by bringing in guest speakers for Wildflower Class.

282
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:35,044
But you changed all of a sudden.

283
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,328
I was rejected.

284
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:39,325
Pardon?

285
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,868
I mean, the idea to get speakers was rejected.

286
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,284
My good will was rejected,

287
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:46,950
so I have no other choice but to be coercive.

00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm sorry, Board Chairman.

290

I have something urgent to tell Mr. Kim and Mr. Song.

291
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:02,903

294
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:10,900
I have one more question.

295
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,083
Did you actually study for your grades?

296
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:14,267
Or did you pay someone...

297
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:18,465
Wait...

298
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,123
I'll run over and stop this right now.

299
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,423
- Mr. Kim, lead the way. - Okay.

300
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:26,980
Hurry.

301
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:30,481
Move out of the way.

Bok Su, move! I said, move out of my way!

305
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:47,054
- Do you love me this much? - Bok Su.

306
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:48,083
I'll give you a hug.

307
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:50,623
- Bok Su. - I have the spare key!

308
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:54,391
- Move, Bok Su. - Spare key! Spare key!

309
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,711

That spare key is ours.

312
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:27,893
Ms. Son. If you had such a video,

313
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,153
why didn't you check as the homeroom teacher...

314
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:31,964
and bring it over to us?

315
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,064
Why did you make things bigger than it had to be?

316
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,564
Exactly.

317
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,704
If I was there, I would have reported it to you right away.

318
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:41,704
The kids didn't tell me, so I feel betrayed.

319
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:44,431
I'll give them a strict penalty.

320
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:48,791
I have one more question.

321
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:51,183
You did it, Do Hyun.

322
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,103
Stop. That's wrong.

323
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:57,724
Send the video to my phone.

324
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,153
- Do you have it backed up? - Yes.

325
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,693
I backed it up on the web and on a USB.

326
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:02,209
I also spread it to the kids.

327
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:03,668
No one can delete the original.

328
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:06,114
We'll teach them a lesson with this.

329
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:08,433
You're not going to go protest to Mr. Kim and Mr. Song, are you?

330
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,464
I'm not stupid. I won't take this to them so they can delete it.

331
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,475
- It should be broadcast. - It should be broadcast.

332
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:17,057
Bok Su, why are you talking casually to Ms. Son?

333
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:25,908
I must be crazy. That was rude of me.

334
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,984
- I'm sorry, Ms. Son. - It's okay.

335
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:31,115
It's because you're old.

336
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:40,791
Giving penalty points won't solve the problem!

337
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:42,245
You're right.

338
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,262
Then Chae Min should get more than penalty points too.

339
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,419
Right, Mr. Song?

340
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,600
Well, it looks like...

341
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:59,083
they just had a small argument.

342
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:03,457
Don't give them penalty points. Don't be so heartless.

343
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,363
He pretended to be a victim.

344
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:17,804
- He's so mean. - He's crazy.

345
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:19,249
- Gosh. - That's creepy.

346
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:22,828
We might lose the prize because of him.

347
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:27,325
Hey, Chae Min.

348
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:29,566
I wrote what you told me to write down on the statement.

349
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,443
I won't get a penalty, will I?

350
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:32,929
You jerk, how can you say that?

351
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,345
- What? - Young Min.

352
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,893
Chae Min. You choose.

353
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,077
Choose what, jerk?

354
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:46,781
We have video evidence.

355
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:49,494
It won't be a problem to degrade your student records.

356
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:52,535
Isn't that what you and your mom are most afraid of?

357
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,057
Don't harass my classmates anymore.

358
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:58,426
Also return the award you bought with your dirty money.

359
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:02,099
Isn't this a pretty sweet deal for you?

360
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:08,071
I'll assume that we have a deal.

361
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:21,962
Hey, aren't we a bit useful?

362
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:25,026
Not just a bit. A lot.

363
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,755
You were pretty good.

364
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:31,597
It was nothing.

365
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:34,843
He was the most useful, wasn't he?

366
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:36,714
That's the power of media.

367
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:39,943
My face being on air was the highlight.

368
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,298
I won't forget it.

369
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:45,637

370

Ms. Son.

371
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:21,613
Are you really returning it to us?

372
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:25,193
Well, Chae Min confessed...

373
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:29,003
that he didn't write the debate paper.

374
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:31,177
By the way, Ms. Son.

375
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,701
I'm getting so stressed out because of Wildflower Class.

376
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:36,853

This person is awarded this certificate for achieving...

385
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:38,163
excellent grades with logical thinking...

386
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:41,673

389
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:37,947
It all worked out. Thank you.

390
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:41,770
I want to be a teacher like you.

391
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:47,403
(Mr. Park, thank you and I love you.)

392
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,051

395
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:58,544
(Seems extremely nervous these days.)

396
00:25:58,545 --> 00:25:59,613

399
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:28,673
Bok Su would never do something like that.

400
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:31,441
He would never hurt Se Ho.

401
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:32,544
Can you please talk to Se Ho...

402
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:34,099
Are you saying that...

403
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:38,283

(Episode 20)

406
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,008
Hey, who's the person in charge of cleaning today?

407
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,180
I need to get it checked after you're done cleaning.

408
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:15,759
Me.

409
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:29,284
I'll clean and get it checked.

410
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:32,213
You can go home now. Go on.

411
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:36,606
Bye. See you.

412
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,193
I'm guessing it'll be just you and Ms. Son...

413
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:39,749
when you get the classroom checked.

414
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:45,794
Gosh, Seung Woo. You're really funny.

415
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,096
- You should go. Go home. - Wait.

416
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,889
I don't care much about you,

417
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,873
but I won't ever do anything to make Ms. Son cry.

418
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:55,440
Gosh, of course. I also don't want Soo Jeong to cry...

419
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,455
Wait a minute.

420
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,983
Why? Why do you care whether Soo Jeong cries or not?

421
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:02,994
Why do you think?

422
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:07,053
I'm not really sure.

423
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:08,771
I'm saying you have another competitor.

424
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:11,110
You should put in more effort, sir.

425
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:22,221
Are you guys done cleaning?

426
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,643
What? Why are you cleaning all by yourself?

427
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:30,502
Seung Woo's the other person in charge of cleaning today.

428
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:38,498
Did you clean well?

429
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:42,508
Of course.

430
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:47,865
Because I'm really diligent...

431
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,615
and...

432
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,699
really smart,

433
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,622
I even got an award for the debating contest.

434
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,330
Aren't you going to give me an additional reward for that?

435
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:14,768
Do I really get nothing?

436
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:26,434
Hey, have you gone mad? What if someone catches us again?

437
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:27,773
We're in school right now. You're wearing a uniform.

438
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:28,845
Does that matter?

439
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:18,937
They aren't as steamy as us, right?

440
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,088
Where should we go now? Is there somewhere you want to go?

441
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:34,884
There's a place I really want to go with you.

442
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:37,325
Where? Let's go there now.

443
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:39,686
Will you be okay with it?

444
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:42,146
Where's the place?

445
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:45,090
You're the gate, right?

446
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,061
The gate?

447
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:51,222
- Well... - Yes, I'm the pink gate.

448
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:54,653
You son of a gun.

449
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:56,153
Because of that flashy pink color,

450
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:58,684
I had a terrible headache every time I passed by it.

451
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,674
I should just...

452
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:04,127
How could you paint it pink? You're so insensible.

453
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:08,493
My grandma usually talks very sweetly.

454
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,977
Do you take after your grandma?

455
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:13,736
So do you make good money?

456
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:17,236
A husband shouldn't let his wife starve.

457
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:20,674
Even if she eats a lot,

458
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,229
I'm confident that I won't let her starve.

459
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,953
What about gambling or running after women?

460
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:28,013
I don't do those.

461
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:31,054
Did you ever guarantee someone's debt?

462
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:32,912
I don't lend people money, not even to my family.

463
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:37,193
Can you promise me that...

464
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,312
you won't disappear...

465
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:43,597
like her dad and hurt her?

466
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,128
Why can't you answer me?

467
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:58,443
I will never...

468
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,397
leave her alone.

469
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:03,649
Good. That's good.

470
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:07,187

Ms. Son is our Korean teacher.

476
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:36,601
And this is geography class.

477
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:40,020
How nice that you know what this class is.

478
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:43,124
Geography teacher couldn't come to school because she's sick.

479
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,763
So I'm supervising you today.

480
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,410
Be quiet and study.

481
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:51,603
Gosh, you guys.

482
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,645
Mr. Park.

483
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:54,387
Thank you.

484
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:55,634
For what?

485
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:56,654
The debating contest.

486
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:59,905
You made an official complaint, so we got our awards back.

487
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,674
Right. Good.

488
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:04,310
I wasn't going to say this, but I will.

489
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:06,062
You punks.

490
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:07,783
You should be studying.

491

493
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:14,523

494
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:17,120
and aired videos without permission.

495
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,083
You've gone too far.

496
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,163
There are rules to follow in school.

497
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:23,356
You should be respectful of teachers.

498
00:34:23,704 --> 00:34:26,734
Who taught you to be so rude?

499
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:36,424
That's my official opinion.

500
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,396
What about unofficial opinion?

501
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:40,794
Good job.

502
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,474
You did great.

503
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,453
Gosh, that old geezer startled us.

504
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,445
He has a knack for that.

505
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:52,309
You guys are all grown up.

506
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:56,263
Yes. That's what becoming an adult is like.

507
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:59,103
Not turning a blind eye. Not letting things slide.

508
00:34:59,104 --> 00:35:00,674
Seeing what's right.

509
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:02,958
Noticing what's wrong and fixing it.

510
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:05,288
That's an adult.

511
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:08,938
In that regard, you are...

512
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,244
50,000 times better...

513
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,406
than the class next door.

514
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:16,010
You guys are awesome. Great job.

515
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:22,415
But you should study a little.

516
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:24,077
I don't want to study.

517
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:28,546
Gosh.

518

They picked the winners for the contests...

523
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:43,583
that haven't even been held yet.

524
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:44,843
And they prepared the certificates already.

525
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,500
Didn't I do a good job of finding it?

526
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:49,414
They're all given to Ivy Class students.

527

Who is Lee Chae Min?

529

The debating contest winners were changed because of what he said.

530
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:58,694
He hit Young Min first, but Young Min became the attacker.

531
00:35:58,695 --> 00:36:01,093
A school like that isn't normal.

532
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:03,993
There must be transactions between the school and the parents.

533

It's not a school, but a corporation.

534

535
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:12,267

00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:00,158
All right, all right.

719
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,256
There must be something wrong with me, Bok Su.

720
00:49:15,094 --> 00:49:16,539
I hate you.

721
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:23,045
I don't like you.

722
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:34,089
If it wasn't for you,

723
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:36,925
I would've lived...

724
00:49:40,985 --> 00:49:42,933
without feeling this way.

725
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:57,174
Mother.

726
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:00,175
What about Bok Su?

727
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:04,123
- What about Bok Su? - Bok Su...

728
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:07,590
pushed you, right?

729
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:17,169
Bok Su is the one...

730
00:50:17,854 --> 00:50:19,774
who pushed you, right?

731
00:50:25,624 --> 00:50:26,705
Yes.

732
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:37,556
Ms. Lim.

733
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:40,244
Bok Su would never do something like that.

734
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,971
He would never hurt Se Ho.

735
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:45,014
Can you please talk to Se Ho...

736
00:50:45,015 --> 00:50:46,357
Are you saying...

737
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:50,610
that my son is lying?

738
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:05,254
Tell the kids in Wildflower Class that they'll be getting transferred.

739
00:51:05,434 --> 00:51:06,564
Board chairman.

740
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,474
You're being too extreme.

741
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:09,615
Do it right now.

742
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:11,343
I gave you enough time.

743
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:12,557
But...

744
00:51:14,045 --> 00:51:15,055
Okay, sir.

745
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,498
Let's go. Hurry.

746
00:51:24,955 --> 00:51:27,724
Mr. Park was the one who wrote the indictment, right?

747
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:28,794
Yes, sir.

748
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:31,552
He apparently admitted that it was him.

749
00:51:46,174 --> 00:51:48,033
Let's go see him.

750
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,770
If he had a lot to say, he could've just said it himself.

751
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:55,769
Why did he have to upset his former student?

752
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:09,619
Everybody, attention.

753
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:21,790
I'm here to relay...

754
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:24,158
a message from the chairman.

755
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:29,515
The chairman has decided to start a special program for you guys...

756
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:32,808
by letting you transfer schools with the recommendation...

757
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:37,439
of the school principal.

758
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:39,906
A transfer program?

759
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:45,766
For us? Are you telling us to go to another school?

760
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:49,955
Well, in a way, yes.

761
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,156
But let me give you an example.

762
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:55,214
When it comes to your school grades, it might be more beneficial...

763
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:58,851
to go to a lower-grade school rather than staying in Seolsong.

764
00:52:59,815 --> 00:53:01,976
And as for the students who don't wish to go to college,

765
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:05,054
you can go to a school that provides vocational education...

766
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,843
regarding the kind of job you want to have...

767
00:53:07,124 --> 00:53:08,236
after you graduate.

768
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:11,844
Do you all understand?

769
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:16,797
We'll send a notification to your address regarding the details.

770
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:19,676
What if I don't want to go?

771
00:53:22,775 --> 00:53:25,304
Well, that's...

772
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,354
Mr. Kim.

773
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:29,235
I want to stay.

774
00:53:29,944 --> 00:53:32,113
You can go back to Sky Class.

775
00:53:32,114 --> 00:53:35,386
No, I want to stay here in Wildflower Class.

776
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:40,694
They're right.

777
00:53:41,325 --> 00:53:44,254
I also want to graduate Seolsong as a Wildflower Class student.

778
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,340
Does that mean I don't need to go?

779
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:08,087
The school has already decided to proceed with the transfer program.

780
00:54:08,384 --> 00:54:10,314
After we talk to each of your parents,

781
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:12,954
you'll get to go see the schools that have signed a treaty with us.

782
00:54:12,955 --> 00:54:14,853
So refer to the notification letter, and choose a school...

783
00:54:14,854 --> 00:54:16,542
among the list of schools.

784
00:54:16,955 --> 00:54:19,393
Let me tell you one more time that this is an open opportunity...

785
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:20,577
for you guys.

786
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:23,674
That will be all.

787
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:30,989
What was that?

788
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:34,277
He made it sound all fancy, but it just means they want us gone.

789
00:54:34,844 --> 00:54:36,474
I'm pretty sure my mom will be happy...

790
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:37,898
if she hears that I'll be getting transferred.

791
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,729
Se Ho, you jerk.

792
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:46,006
You're going to kick us out of the school?

793
00:55:03,904 --> 00:55:05,116
Mr. Park.

794
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:08,189
Yes, sir.

795
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,655
You must have...

796
00:55:11,745 --> 00:55:13,633
a lot of complaints regarding our school.

797
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:20,608
A teacher is someone who was born before the students.

798
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:27,159
That means we're teachers because we were born first.

799
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:30,833
As someone who's living my life ahead of my students,

800
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:32,522
I feel like it's important to lead them...

801
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:34,321
toward the right path.

802
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:37,333
That's because kids tend to follow the path...

803
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,224
that was walked by the ones before them.

804
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:41,143
Can you guarantee...

805
00:55:41,144 --> 00:55:43,467
that the path you're walking can benefit...

806
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:45,125
the kids?

807
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:48,839
I don't know if it'll benefit them or not.

808
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:53,021
But I at least know that I won't be embarrassed.

809
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:54,974
I'm sure the kids are aware of that as well.

810
00:55:56,154 --> 00:55:58,791
Yes, I understand your educational philosophy.

811
00:56:00,465 --> 00:56:02,110
But do you think this school belongs to you?

812
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:09,417
If you don't like Seolsong...

813
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:13,423
No. If you don't like my Seolsong,

814
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:16,058
you can just leave.

815
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,714
I hope you'll be able to find a school in Korea...

816
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:22,714
that perfectly coincides with your educational philosophy.

817
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,423
I figured it'd be a hassle for you, so I wrote it for you myself.

818
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,636
You just need to sign it.

819
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:29,945
(Letter of resignation, Park Dong Jun)

820
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:34,015
Please think of it as my last gesture of courtesy...

821
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:36,375
as your former student.

822
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:41,560
I'm now going to fire you, Mr. Park Dong Jun,

823
00:56:43,134 --> 00:56:44,457
as the chairman of the school.

824
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:57,383
Sir, this is not the right kind of education for the kids...

825
00:56:57,384 --> 00:56:59,809
The kind of education you pursue no longer exists.

826
00:57:01,694 --> 00:57:02,806
Mr. Park.

827
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,517
You always try to pursue the right kind of education,

828
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,612
but I know more than anybody...

829
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:13,256
that it's just an empty promise. You know that, right?

830
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,490
You were never...

831
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,000
Maybe you were a good teacher to Bok Su,

832
00:57:21,114 --> 00:57:22,327
but not for me.

833
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:27,044
- Se Ho. - I'm living proof...

834
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:28,670
that your way of education is a complete failure.

835
00:57:30,215 --> 00:57:32,073
Because back when I used to be your student,

836
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,568
I died.

837
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:03,834
- No, Mr. Park. - Don't get involved, Soo Jeong.

838
00:58:28,844 --> 00:58:31,106
Chairman Oh Se Ho.

839
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:46,310
You're not...

840
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:49,451
the owner of this school.

841
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:03,192
(My Strange Hero)

842
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:05,113
What if we get better grades?

843
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:06,113
I'll accept the offer.

844
00:59:06,114 --> 00:59:07,314
I'll look forward to it, but it'll be impossible.

845
00:59:07,315 --> 00:59:08,353
Let's study.

846
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:10,484
I'll be your dad, your brother,

847
00:59:10,485 --> 00:59:11,554
and your husband.

848
00:59:11,555 --> 00:59:13,224
So many bad things are happening,

849
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:14,593
but I'm not scared like I used to be.

850
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:17,054
I'm sorry I couldn't embrace you a lot more back then.

851
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:18,193
How is that going to change anything?

852
00:59:18,194 --> 00:59:19,324
There's no turning back.

853
00:59:19,325 --> 00:59:20,724
Are you regretting what you did?

854
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,663
You can sleep over. Are you really going to just sleep?

855
00:59:22,664 --> 00:59:25,264
I was really going to hold it in, but you're making it really hard.

856
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:26,534
You can't do this to Bok Su.

857
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:27,873
He did nothing wrong.

858
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:30,103
You're upsetting me by taking his side until the very end.

859
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:31,504
What a tearful sacrifice.

860
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:33,928
Bok Su will be expelled since he was involved in this case.
