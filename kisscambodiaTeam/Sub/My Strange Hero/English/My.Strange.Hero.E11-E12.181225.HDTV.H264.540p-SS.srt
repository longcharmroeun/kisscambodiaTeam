1
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:23,640
See? I told you I'd win.

2
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:25,169
What's your wish?

3
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:27,779
Should I get on my knees?

4
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,250
Is that what you were going to ask?

5
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,149
But that's too bad.

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,820
Because I won.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,149
Bok Su, are you done cleaning?

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,859
Bok Su!

9
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:57,840
Bok Su, I told you not to cause trouble.

10
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,709
Are you crazy? How could you...

11
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:00,910
Why do you care?

12
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,249
It's none of your business.

13
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,020
I'm your teacher.

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,720
I'm responsible for all the troubles you cause.

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,630
Let's go to the infirmary.

16
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:20,859
What do you want?

17
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,769
Move. What's wrong with...

18
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,230
Why don't you ever ask?

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,210
Nine years ago and now,

20
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,710
why don't you ever ask me what happened?

21
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,090
Can you please tell me now?

22
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,460
I saw and heard it myself.

23
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,960
What more do I need to hear?

24
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,799
You hurt him with a shinai.

25
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,769
Do you have more to say?

26
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,999
- There was a reason for... - Even if there was a reason,

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
is it okay to hurt someone?

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,510
Don't you see that I'm hurt too?

29
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,489
You're under punishment.

30
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,160
Don't cause any more trouble.

31
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,260
Clean up and go home.

32
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:28,700
Hey, Soo Jeong.

33
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,600
Let's go. I need to get this wound treated.

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,820
What we said wasn't wrong.

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,519
Soo Jeong lives on food stamps and that's the truth.

36
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,089
You're Soo Jeong's friends.

37
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,459
Didn't you think about...

38
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,660
why she would've done that?

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,889
We were never friends.

40
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,089
She's right. How is Soo Jeong our friend?

41
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,600
She lied to all of us.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,500
She acted big and condescending. She looked down on us.

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,769
She fooled you too!

44
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,269
When did Soo Jeong fool you?

45
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,399
She never lied. It was you...

46
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:10,010
who assumed she'd have enough money...

47
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,169
to have tutors because she's so smart.

48
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,940
You two believed whatever you wanted!

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,510
Then she could have said that we're wrong.

50
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,179
Is it easy for you to talk about your family publicly?

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,450
You just yapped as you pleased.

52
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:27,119
How did you find out about her?

53
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,530
Oh Se Ho.

54
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:32,160
What?

55
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,269
Se Ho looked like he liked Soo Jeong,

56
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,139
so we told him Soo Jeong doesn't like him back.

57
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,339
Then he said he doesn't like her either...

58
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,079
since she lives on food stamps.

59
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,709
Crazy jerk.

60
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,810
Hey, where's Se Ho?

61
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,619
I saw him go to the rooftop earlier.

62
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,899
No!

63
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,429
Se Ho!

64
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,739
Don't approach Soo Jeong.

65
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,480
I said, don't approach her!

66
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,329
Are you crazy, Bok Su?

67
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,599
Do you still want to say such a thing?

68
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,680
Gosh.

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,950
Soo Jeong.

70
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,719
- Yes? - I'll get the treatment alone.

71
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:10,729
Okay.

72
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,329
Se Ho.

73
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,430
Please don't cause an issue about what happened today.

74
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,339
Do me a favor, okay?

75
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,670
Don't sweat it.

76
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,810
Thank you.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,889
Why don't you ever ask?

78
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,159
Nine years ago and now,

79
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,930
why don't you ever ask me what happened?

80
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:54,469
Ask you what? Why you did what you did?

81
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,209
Why would I...

82
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,329
Soo Jeong. Don't go in now.

83
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,899
Hey, Soo Jeong. I hear you live on food stamps.

84
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,440
I never lied.

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
How pitiful.

86
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,170
I can't believe she receives basic livelihood security.

87
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,579
Bok Su seriously cares too much. His hobby is to help people.

88
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,880
No wonder he was so nice to Soo Jeong.

89
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,050
I guess he felt sorry for her.

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,289
I think Bok Su said something he shouldn't.

91
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,490
No.

92
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,500
That's impossible.

93
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,800
He apparently felt sorry for you. That's why...

94
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,300
Bok Su wouldn't do that.

95
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,139
I heard he even painted your front gate.

96
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,079
Don't you feel sorry for Soo Jeong?

97
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,889
Bok Su...

98
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:29,370
Were you really...

99
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,139
nice to me because you felt sorry for me?

100
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,089
Who says...

101
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,760
you can pity me like that?

102
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,459
Bok Su.

103
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,899
Please save me!

104
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:23,990
Soo Jeong.

105
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,789
Are you sure you saw it?

106
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,599
I didn't see it, but I heard.

107
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,200
Kid.

108
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,440
This is very important.

109
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,440
What did you hear?

110
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,810
I heard Se Ho say,

111
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,180
"Please save me."

112
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,509
What did you say?

113
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,150
"Bok Su".

114
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,459
"Please save me."

115
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,129
I heard it...

116
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,430
clearly.

117
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:35,390
Soo Jeong, did you really see?

118
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,729
Are you lying?

119
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,259
You know Bok Su well. He would never do that.

120
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,859
No.

121
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,070
Why would he push Se Ho?

122
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,640
Why is Bok Su the assailant of school violence?

123
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,670
How do I know what kind of person Bok Su is?

124
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:54,780
Soo Jeong.

125
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,810
Don't you trust him?

126
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:02,379
No.

127
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,420
Not anymore.

128
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:08,359
Hey, how...

129
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,089
Don't you know how much he likes you?

130
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,959
What's the matter with you?

131
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,329
Soo Jeong!

132
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:21,400
Hey.

133
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:24,109
You know it wasn't me.

134
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,280
Don't!

135
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,780
Soo Jeong, you know it wasn't me.

136
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,780
Why did you lie?

137
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,820
Ms. Son.

138
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,190
Ms. Son.

139
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,759
Hey! Seung Woo. You're back.

140
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,560
Yes.

141
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,329
Seung Woo.

142
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,869
Your parents wouldn't pick up their phones.

143
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,369
Why would you call them?

144
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,570
Darn!

145
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,440
I called them because you skipped school.

146
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,280
Do you really have to do so many part-time jobs?

147
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,109
You have parents.

148
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,180
No, I don't.

149
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,180
I don't have such things.

150
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:44,249
I know you're doing this because you want to act like a teacher,

151
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,849
but I don't need it. So please stop.

152
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,959
You're still underage.

153
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:53,359
You need your parents and your teacher!

154
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:06,709
Hey.

155
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,989
Seung Woo, you're back.

156
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,190
I'll kill you if you ignore my calls again.

157
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,560
Get lost.

158
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,430
We were so bored without you.

159
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,629
You have to come to school.

160
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,329
Hey, what happened to your face? Did you fight?

161
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,570
Did someone hit you?

162
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,400
I just fell.

163
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,349
Three bulgogi burgers, right?

164
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,719
Set the timer.

165
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,300
I don't want it, sir.

166
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,839
Why not?

167
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,239
Why not? Are you tired of eating bulgogi burger?

168
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,540
I also saw cheeseburgers and shrimp...

169
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,209
I'll just go buy one myself.

170
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,249
What's wrong with you?

171
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,650
What was that? That's new.

172
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,780
He says he doesn't want it. You can just take a break.

173
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,320
Hey, where are you going?

174
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,329
Please don't cause an issue about what happened today.

175
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,869
Do me a favor, okay?

176
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,239
Don't ask me to do something like that...

177
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,640
ever again.

178
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,719
Come inside.

179
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,229
Sir, did you want to see me?

180
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:05,530
Sir, what's that on your neck?

181
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,800
- My goodness. - Is that a band-aid?

182
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,629
- Are you okay? - Did you get hurt?

183
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,640
What happened...

184
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,810
to the budget compilation for Wildflower Class?

185
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,109
Are you talking about hiring after-class teachers?

186
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,410
The financial support we get from the Education Office...

187
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,079
and local government already covers all of the budget.

188
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,219
But the issue we have is whether that's fair.

189
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,190
Since when did our school ever care about being fair?

190
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,790
I mean, we can't exactly treat the students that get poor grades...

191
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:40,160
the same way as we treat our top students.

192
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,999
We also need to do what we can to support the students...

193
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,770
who aren't fit with studying.

194
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,440
Tell their homeroom teacher, Ms. Son...

195
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,910
Tell Ms. Son today and proceed with the support.

197
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,820
Hello?

198
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,229
Oh, hello. You finally called. I've been waiting for your call.

199
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,829
- What a rude little punk. - How rude.

200
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:19,629
I mean, think about it.

201
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,969
If the parents' committee finds out that Wildflower Class...

202
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,140
will be getting subsidiary financial support...

203
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,579
They'll cause a huge issue about it.

204
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,479
They're a group of selfish people...

205
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,749
who only want the school to fund their kids and no one else.

206
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,349
There's no need to even take it to the parents' committee.

207
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,680
If the former chairwoman finds out about this...

208
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:44,989
(Korean)

209
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,499
- Mr. Ma. - Yes?

210
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:58,540
Can I see the test results of Yoon Seung Woo in Wildflower Class?

211
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,209
- Seung Woo? - Yes.

212
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,579
He always gets zero points. Just a second.

213
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,849
Here you go. He got every question wrong.

214
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,790
(English)

215
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,629
My gosh.

216
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,800
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

217
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,499
He's the unluckiest person ever.

218
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,499
You'd expect to get at least one question right. How unfortunate.

219
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,430
Don't you agree, Mr. Ma?

220
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,140
I personally think I'm the unluckiest person.

221
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,109
A very dark energy keeps approaching me. I feel like I have bad luck.

222
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,640
My goodness. Don't worry, Mr. Ma.

223
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,609
I'm here for you.

224
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,390
Or maybe he knows all the right answers...

225
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,089
and purposely chooses the wrong ones.

226
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,129
Who in the world uses so much A4 paper?

227
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,160
You all should use reusable paper.

228
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,869
The school needs to pay for that. What's wrong with you people?

229
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,729
You wouldn't waste paper like that if you had to pay for them.

230
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,339
Ms. Son. Ms. Son of Wildflower Class.

231
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,709
Yes?

232
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,239
Chairman Oh wishes to give support...

233
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,910
to the kids in Wildflower Class,

234
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,809
so he wants you to counsel them.

235
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,650
Gosh, why would he bother to support those losers?

236
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,420
- Anyway, please proceed with it. - Okay.

237
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,029
Yes, this is Son Soo Jeong.

238
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,269
Ms. Son?

239
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:36,739
Ms. Son, I'll return your 50,000 dollars.

240
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,170
I put in a lot of effort to get that money, you know.

241
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:42,440
Come to the locker area at the subway station after work.

242
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:45,880
Open locker number 18.

243
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,819
The passcode is 4873.

244
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,719

245
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,350
(Store with fingerprint, Parcel storage)

246
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,539
What? Where's my 50,000 dollars?

247
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,279
(Go to Sunho Park)

248
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,779
Go to Sunho Park.

249
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,450
Sunho Park?

250
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,180
Is he crazy?

251
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,019
(Sunho Historical Park Station)

252
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,930
Dig underneath the pine tree that's next to the swing in the playground.

253
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,170
50,000 dollars. 50,000 dollars.

254
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:42,600
My 50,000 dollars. My 50,000 dollars.

255
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,039
Kim Myung Ho, that scumbag.

256
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,110
Dig the garbage bag that's next to the public restroom in the park.

257
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,549
That darn little jerk!

258
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,959
This better not be a joke.

259
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,759
I'll do everything in my power...

260
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:23,580
50,000 dollars!

261
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,759
Yes, I just gave it to her. Bye.

262
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:47,170
- I'm home. - Can you deliver this, please?

263
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,469
I'm a student that needs to study.

264
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,809
I'm the head of the household that earns money for you.

265
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,239
My gosh, where do I need to go?

266
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,880
The real estate office at the intersection.

267
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,680
They ordered yangjangpi, palbochae, and kkansho shrimp.

268
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,180
All the expensive dishes.

269
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,279
So get there as fast as you can, and be nice to them.

270
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,450
- Okay? - Okay.

271
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,650
Go on.

272
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,569
Kim Myung Ho?

273
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,160
What kind of jerk...

274
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,259
Long time no see, Myung Ho.

275
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,670
Gosh, I'm really glad to see you since it's been a while.

276
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,640
But that must not be the case for you.

277
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:58,940
I'm also very glad to see you,

278
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,610
but I also feel like we're not exactly that close.

279
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,080
Gosh, I just want to talk to you. That's all.

280
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,049
I just saw Se Ho...

281
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,779
Talk to me about what?

282
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,489
I gave it back. I gave everything back to her.

283
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,650
I already returned 50,000 dollars to Ms. Son.

284
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,059
So what more is there to talk about?

285
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,660
What? What do you mean?

286
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,789
If you can't trust me, why don't you check for yourself?

287
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,559
Are you serious?

288
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:24,269
All you ever do is gambling. Where did you get the money...

289
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:25,269
to pay back 50,000 dollars...

290
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,840
Hey, Myung Ho. Was Se Ho the one who gave you...

291
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:34,509
50,000 dollars?

292
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,410
I can't tell you that.

293
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,150
You're getting a call.

294
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,749
You can take it if it's urgent.

295
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,590
What?

296
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,059
I'm going, okay? Plus, I'm almost there.

297
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,729
My gosh.

298
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:06,009
What's wrong with our sales? Darn it.

299
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,650
Hey, what does it mean when a guy gives money...

300
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,709
to a woman?

301
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,920
- How much? - 50,000 dollars.

302
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,850
That's true love.

303
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,160
No one could do that without love.

304
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,620
There's nothing else that can explain that.

305
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:29,029
Did Kim Myung Ho give money to Soo Jeong?

306
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,469
Is that what happened? Am I right?

307
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,640
Gosh, I just got goosebumps.

308
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,140
Does he like Soo Jeong?

309
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,269
What kind of nonsense...

310
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,769
Whatever.

(Bankbook)

312
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,440
By the way, why did he return the money?

313
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,170
Something's fishy.

314
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,380
No, forget it. I got my money back.

315
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,080
I got my money and got the permanent position.

316
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,410
Soo Jeong, it's better to be ignorant.

317
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,279
(Tiger, the best predator)

318
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,890
It's better to be ignorant, right?

319
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,259
(Chairman's Office)

320
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,370
Sophocles said,

321
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:41,170
"Deities never help the man..."

322
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,640
"who will not act."

323
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:45,269
You're doing well, Bok Su.

324
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:46,469
Never give up.

325
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,479
What are you doing?

326
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:56,479
Having a chairman as an alumnus is nice.

327
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,049
Let's get it straight.

328
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,519
You never graduated.

329
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,459
Ask me in person if you have a question.

330
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:06,789
Don't sneak in here like a rat.

331
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,370
You ordered Kim Myung Ho to give Soo Jeong money, right?

332
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:17,769
So you know him? Bok Su, you're pretty good.

333
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,009
I did it for someone I like.

334
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,140
Is that wrong?

335
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,110
You... You like her?

336
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,979
I'm sure you saw this coming.

337
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,219
Don't we look good together?

338
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,759
Do you think Soo Jeong will say thank you if she finds out?

339
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,319
Are you threatening me?

340
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,830
Please go and tell her.

341
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,830
"Se Ho is a competent man."

342
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,559
"Se Ho is the knight in shining armor..."

343
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,529
"that can turn your life around."

344
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,640
If you aren't busy, will you go tell her that?

345
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,269
Why are you telling me this?

346
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:55,580
Because she won't believe what you say anyway.

347
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,640
What?

348
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,309
Didn't you hear me?

349
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:01,150
She won't believe anything you say.

350
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,120
What?

351
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:08,259
If you don't believe me, go and check it.

352
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,229
See if she believes you or not.

353
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,059
You crazy punk.

354
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,360
Thanks for the compliment.

355
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:26,309
Hey.

356
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,479
Hey, don't twist my arm.

357
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,080
It's me.

358
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,180
It's me. That hurts.

359
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,650
Gosh, you little punk.

360
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,090
Here.

361
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,190
Stop drinking sweet stuff. Your teeth will rot.

362
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,930
Stop nagging.

363
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,229
Why were you in his office?

364
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,569
Se Ho and I had something to talk about.

365
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,979
Sir.

366
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,779
Why didn't...

367
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,489
Soo Jeong believe me back then?

368
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,690
If Soo Jeong pushed someone before my eyes...

369
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,860
"She must have a good reason for that."

370
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,630
"She would never do that."

371
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,930
I would've believed her.

372
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,069
But why didn't she believe me?

373
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:34,039
Was it because she didn't like me?

374
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:38,580
Hey, Bok Su.

375
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,279
I think Soo Jeong and you have something to talk about.

376
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,090
Right?

377
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:57,229
(Episode 12 will air shortly.)

378
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,390
(Episode 12)

379
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,529
Okay, let's go!

380
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,429
Smile.

381
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,700
- Something I'm good at? - My dream?

382
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,099
I think lying is what I do best.

383
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:12,999
Earning a lot of money and getting plastic surgery.

384
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,669
- Actually I'm... - My whole face.

385
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,669
a famous writer.

386
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,709
I actually want to counsel you.

387
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,779
I write fan fiction.

388
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,709
I write and sell secret stories of idols.

389
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:22,049
Don't apply pink lipstick.

390
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,049
- It's true. - Your skin looks dark.

391
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,250
I make good money.

392
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,250
My dream?

393
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,320
To graduate and quit coming to this sick place.

394
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,430
(Counseling report)

395
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,960
Kang Bok Su.

396
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:42,900
The hardest student is left.

397
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,079
What is it?

398
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,680
Hey, why are you being serious?

399
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,320
I'm treating you like a teacher.

400
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,449
Counsel me.

401
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,119
Okay.

402
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,059
What's your dream?

403
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,229
My dream?

404
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:12,759
I don't know.

405
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,130
I've forgotten about it a long time ago.

406
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,800
Bok Su, be serious. Think before you answer.

407
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,999
I'm serious right now.

408
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,639
With only a middle school diploma,

409
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:22,639
people kept telling me...

410
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,109
I'm not qualified to do anything.

411
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:27,809
So I never...

412
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,180
thought about doing anything.

413
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,320
Are you protesting?

414
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,919
I'm being honest.

415
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,729
The world is so cruel to someone who isn't a student...

416
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,529
when he should be.

417
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,669
Did you hear? Bok Su will get expelled.

418
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,139
His life is over now.

419
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:57,169
I'd say he's done for.

420
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,040
He deserves to be expelled.

421
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,779
How can he push someone off the roof?

422
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,979
He should get shackled and get sent straight to...

423
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,219
Hey!

424
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,390
How can you do that to Bok Su?

425
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,719
Would Bok Su do that?

426
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:13,360
Have you ever seen him harass anyone?

427
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,629
We don't need to see that to know.

428
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,029
Se Ho said that's what he did. The police said so too.

429
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,099
You!

430
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,930
Bok Su saved you from the school bullies.

431
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,300
Did you forget that?

432
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,469
Bok Su helped you many times.

433
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:28,610
How can you do this to him? You're so ungrateful.

434
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,369
Bok Su...

435
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,980
You all know what a good kid...

436
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,349
Bok Su is.

437
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,749
Why are you pretending not to know that?

438
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,629
Why are you crying? Stop crying.

439
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Min Ji. Snap out of it.

440
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,029
It doesn't matter what he was like before.

441
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:56,599
Now his life is trash.

442
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,670
So give up and stop it.

443
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,869
Hey, say that again.

444
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,869
Say that again, jerk.

445
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,110
Why is my friend trash?

446
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,980
- Let go. - Hey.

447
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,010
Say that again.

448
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,920
Why is my friend trash?

449
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:14,490
Gosh. Say that again.

450
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,150
Stop it.

451
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,659
Hey. Say that again.

452
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,029
Don't fight. Stop it.

453
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:22,930
Don't fight.

454
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,230
Grandma.

455
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,069
What? Why are you crying?

456
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:34,469
Grandma.

457
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:37,610
Who made my granddaughter cry?

458
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:38,779
What is it?

459
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,650
Grandma.

460
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:46,879
- I should've just lied. - What?

461
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,319
I should've said I didn't see or hear anything.

462
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,420
I should've just lied.

463
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,189
- Well... - If I did...

464
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:00,800
Why would you lie?

465
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,830
You didn't do anything wrong.

466
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,400
Lying is a wrong thing to do.

467
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,770
He wouldn't do that.

468
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,510
He really wouldn't do that.

469
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:17,549
Did you go and ask him?

470
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,250
Did you ask him...

471
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,049
if he really did that?

472
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,460
I'm going to forget it now.

473
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,789
I'm going to...

474
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,260
erase it from my head.

475
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:35,330
Goodness.

476
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,750
Bok Su. How could you?

477
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,020
Why did you do that?

478
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,320
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

479
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,529
He says it wasn't him.

480
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,330
He says he didn't do it!

481
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:05,429
Mom.

482
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,799
It doesn't matter whether he did it or not.

483
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,739
Being expelled wasn't enough.

484
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:14,510
He's a problem student, so no school will take him.

485
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,770
What will he do now?

486
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,510
How will he get a job?

487
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:19,779
What are you going to do?

488
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,450
(Sojeonggak)

489
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,989
Soo Jeong.

490
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:32,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

491
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:37,729
This is no time...

492
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,960
It was upsetting when people misunderstood and swore at me.

493
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,669
However, I got over it all.

494
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,500
The reason why I still remember it all these years...

495
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,070
is because you...

496
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,409
didn't believe me.

497
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,279
I think that's why.

498
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,380
If people misunderstood you, I would've still taken your side.

499
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,779
Why? Because I know you.

500
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,919
Also, I liked...

501
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,299
Didn't I show you my feelings enough back then?

502
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,500
Why won't you trust me?

503
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,710
Don't you feel sorry for Soo Jeong?

504
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,289
I don't want to talk about the past.

505
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,159
If you say you don't understand,

506
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,659
then I have nothing else to say.

507
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,500
Yes. It's all over now.

508
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,169
I'm the only one still stuck behind.

509
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,339
I'll go.

510
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,060
I know what I want to be now.

511
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,029
Son Soo Jeong's...

512
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,299
boyfriend.

513
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:29,770
Is it really over now?

514
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,890
It wasn't...

515
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,520
just you who suffered,

516
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,760

(Seolsong High School)

519
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,330
I don't have any announcements.

520
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,130
Anyone absent?

521
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,400
Bok Su.

522
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,299
Did he go out to volunteer?

523
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,840
No. He didn't come.

524
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,340
He's not picking up his phone either.

525
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,309
He said he was going to school. Where did he go?

526
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,110
The elderly must be sleeping in.

527
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,750
If one shows up,

528
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,289
another doesn't.

529
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,289
I'll call him.

530
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:55,490
Don't make trouble today.

531
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:58,730
Right. The troublemaker isn't here.

532
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,429
Okay. Have a good class.

533
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,679
What is this? Are you skipping school?

534
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,850
Yes.

535
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,919
Why? You never missed a class before.

536
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,650
That's true.

537
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,620
Hey, about school...

538
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,020
School?

539
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:27,760
What about school?

540
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,159
- What? - Forget it.

541
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,730
How frustrating.

542
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,730
Hey, what about your revenge?

543
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,740
- Did you talk to Soo Jeong? - Should I...

544
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,909
just...

545
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,409
quit school?

546
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:50,709
Will you? I had Min Ji prepare everything for you.

547
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,779
I wasn't sure when you would change your mind.

548
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:02,159
When you think you're late, that means you're really late.

549
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
I'm glad you changed your mind.

550
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:05,360
(Application to Drop Out)

551
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,100
How about a team dinner today?

552
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Let's have something expensive. It's on me.

553
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,039
(Mean Girl)

554
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,760
Forget it. It's his life.

555
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:34,590
I can't tell an adult what to do.

556
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,659
I heard Bok Su missed school.

557
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,569
I wonder why he didn't come.

558
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,169
Is he not picking up his phone?

559
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:45,600
Gosh.

560
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,809
Is he never going to come back?

561
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,179
I'll keep on calling him.

562
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:54,439
There's no need.

563
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,949
He'll come if he wants to.

564
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,199
This expired eight minutes ago. You can eat it.

565
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,870
A freebie.

566
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:20,299
They have expiry dates...

567
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,970
for these rice balls.

568
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,480
When it just expires, either someone like you eat it,

569
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,380
or part-timers like me eat it.

570
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,750
If a lot of time passes after expiry,

571
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,110
it'll end up going in the trash.

572
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,350
What are you talking about?

573
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,990
It's the same for misunderstandings between people.

574
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,260
If you let too much time pass, your heart will rot.

575
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,429
Sometimes you scare me.

576
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,699
Eat it.

577
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,010
Welcome.

578
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:57,569
Soo Jeong.

579
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,779
What are you doing here?

580
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,579
I got thirsty, so I came to buy some water.

581
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,490
All the way here?

582
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,659
The water here tastes good.

583
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,990
I tried it last time when you were having beer.

584
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,870
If you haven't had dinner yet, do you want to go get some?

585
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,799
Are you buying?

586
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,669
Okay, then.

587
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,539
Let's eat here.

588
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,909
Here?

589
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,010
This is the best combination of convenience foods.

590
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,779
Intense spicy, salty,

591
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:40,020
and sweet taste of MSG!

592
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,090
Spicy. Salty. Sweet. Spicy.

593
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,319
Ta-da!

594
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,159
Soo Jeong.

595
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:53,100
- Yes? - Eat with me.

596
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,029
We're eating right now.

597
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,539
Let's have three meals together and call it a date.

598
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,069
If you don't want to do that, then as friends.

599
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:07,439
If you don't like that either, then as the chairman and a teacher.

600
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,449
Like you said, I'm the boss here.

601
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:13,319
You have to listen to me.

602
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,730
- Mom. - Yes?

603
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,959
One more bowl, please.

604
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,900
- Do you have a good appetite? - Yes.

605
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,669
Right. I have afterschool class. I'm late.

606
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,340
- Okay. - I'll have it afterwards.

607
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,370
- I'll be back. - Okay, bye!

608
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,650
I can hardly breathe.

609
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,289
Bok Su.

610
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,459
If you were going to quit after a few days,

611
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:52,990
why did you make a commotion?

612
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,289
So Jeong.

613
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:56,890
What? Did I say something wrong?

614
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,730
Since you didn't go to school,

615
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,059
In Ho started to get his appetite back.

616
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,970
It must have been so tough to look after you.

617
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,909
Don't mind me.

618
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:11,409
You should do what you want. It's fine.

619
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,880
It's so cold.

620
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:17,809
It's cold.

621
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:21,020
Gosh.

622
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,189
- Hello, Mr. Park. - Hello.

623
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,959
I came to use my coupons today.

624
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,029
Okay.

625
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,669
I'll have a samseon jjamppong.

626
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,970
A menu that costs over 8 dollars...

627
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,380
requires 5 more coupons.

628
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,419
That was good.

629
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Please tell your mother I enjoyed it.

630
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,159
There's no need. You paid for it.

631
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,760
Still.

632
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,760
- I'm leaving. - Wait.

633
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,459
Are you really leaving?

634
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:07,360
Then do you expect me to live here?

635
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:11,329
You're going to leave without saying anything?

636
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,970
"Why haven't you been coming to school?"

637
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,939
"Are you going to keep this up?" Aren't you going to ask me anything?

638
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,510
I was worried that you might've hurt your legs or something.

639
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,610
But you seem fine.

640
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,709
Goodness. I'll be off now. Gosh, it's cold.

641
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,179
- Are you really going? Mr. Park. - See you.

642
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,140
What's this?

643
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,169
Where did Bok Su go after leaving his bag on his desk?

644
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:50,740
Hey, that's my bag.

645
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,579
I put it there because it was empty.

646
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,049
Ms. Son, Bok Su hasn't come to school again.

647
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:00,319
Do you think he really quit?

648
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,689
Seeing Bok Su was what gave me energy.

649
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:05,390
Do you think he collapsed?

650
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,520
He must've overstrained himself by coming to school so early...

651
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,090
in the cold every day at such an old age.

652
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:12,059
Coming to school really isn't an easy task.

653
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,199
Gosh, I'm tired.

654
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:21,569
I think I'm going to quit working at the cafeteria.

655
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:24,409
You threw me a resignation letter and went off to work there.

656
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,079
There's no point in working there anymore since Bok Su's not there.

657
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,949
Are you really not going to go to school?

658
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:36,250
You told me it's already late when you think it's too late.

659
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,159
You're all going to drink coffee, right?

660
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,360
- Are you buying us coffee? - Yes.

661
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:45,100
Bok Su, let's go together. We should have our coffee at the cafe.

662
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,829
Let's think of it as a date.

663
00:43:51,853 --> 00:43:56,853

(Mean Girl)

665
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,019
Hey.

666
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,759
Bok Su, why aren't you coming to school?

667
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:20,699
Did you forget that our destinies coincide?

668
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,370
If you don't come, it'll harm my career.

669
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,570
Soo Jeong, it's me.

670
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,600
Bok Su's girlfriend.

671
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:29,870
What?

672
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,310
Why are you answering his phone?

673
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,310
Listen to me carefully. I won't repeat.

674
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,580
Bok Su's no longer going to go to school.

675
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,350
You won't get to see him again.

676
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,479
So stop calling him, and stop wondering about him.

677
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:42,919
You need to start living separate lives from now on.

678
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,689
What? He's not coming to school?

679
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:48,290
But this is so sudden.

680
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,729
Let me talk to him.

681
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,300
- I need to talk... - Soo Jeong.

682
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,759
If you really think of yourself as a true teacher,

683
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:57,900
you should think of his future and stop here.

684
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,340
Stop harassing Bok Su!

685
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,150
What? What?

686
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,749
I didn't say anything wrong.

687
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:26,100
Bok Su, I just meant...

688
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
It's okay.

689
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,429
- What? - I said, it's okay.

690
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,100
I'll go home first.

691
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,610
Bok Su, don't get me wrong.

692
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,019
Is Bok Su absent again?

693
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,959
Gosh, is he really going to quit?

694
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:55,830
Have you talked to him, Ms. Son?

695
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,800
I think there's something he wants to talk to you about.

696
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:02,499
Ms. Son.

697
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:04,630
If you're done counseling the kids,

698
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,739
you should report it to the chairman yourself.

699
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,540
Make sure he doesn't call me in his office.

700
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:09,909
Okay.

701
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:12,479
Ms. Park, I'm a little busy right now.

702
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:15,080
I need to organize the counseling results by today.

703
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,050
Okay, good luck.

704
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,209
I'm sorry for being late. I was on my way to report...

705
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:48,550
What are you doing?

706
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,110
We're late for dinner. You promised me three meals.

707
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,249
I'm hungry. Let's go.

708
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:20,040
Hey.

709
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:22,610
Are we allowed to use this place without permission?

710
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:25,550
I think you keep forgetting that I'm the chairman.

711
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,280
I'm the employer of everyone who works here.

712
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:32,489
If that was a joke, it wasn't funny.

713
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:34,360
And if you were being serious, it was annoying.

714
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:37,890
Really? I guess I'm annoying then.

715
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,310
I can't guarantee the taste, but try a bite for the sake of my effort.

716
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:21,739
I organized the counseling reports.

717
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,080
But is it okay to hire after-school lecturers...

718
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,880
for our kids only?

719
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,209
I feel like it'll be controversial.

720
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:32,719
Especially with the parents' committee.

721
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,320
Are you worried about me?

722
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:36,890
What?

723
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:40,390
How touching. I can't believe you're worried about me.

724
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,429
No, that's not it.

725
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,630
Soo Jeong.

726
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,870
I like you.

727
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,840
I like you too.

728
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,310
You're a pretty decent employer.

729
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:05,580
I'm serious.

730
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,489
What's wrong? Aren't I okay?

731
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,620
Think about it.

732
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,060
I'm good-looking. I'm rich. And I'm fun...

733
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,360
Maybe not fun.

734
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:23,100
You don't like someone just because of such conditions.

735
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:25,870
Is it because of Bok Su?

736
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,380
After what happened that day,

737
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,780
I left Korea as if I was running away.

738
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,479
And I thought about you from time to time.

739
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,290
I wondered if you were okay...

740
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,419
and if you were doing well.

741
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,959
I was fine.

742
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,959
After all, it was all true.

743
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:56,199
I wondered how you'd be dealing with all the harassment.

744
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:58,370
It was upsetting when people misunderstood and swore at me.

745
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,939
However, I got over it all.

746
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,269
The reason why I still remember it all these years...

747
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,280
is because you...

748
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,080
didn't believe me.

749
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,449
I wasn't okay.

750
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:18,890
Everything became difficult for me after that day.

751
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,689
With only a middle school diploma,

752
00:50:20,689 --> 00:50:21,719
people kept telling me...

753
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,090
that I'm not qualified to do anything.

754
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:26,429
So I never...

755
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,669
thought about doing anything.

756
00:50:33,439 --> 00:50:34,499
Soo Jeong.

757
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,840
I no longer...

758
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,979
want to live in the past.

759
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:41,880
Why don't you ever ask?

760
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,519
Nine years ago and now,

761
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,090
why don't you ever ask me what happened?

762
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:56,330
Let's forget about the past.

763
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,100
Didn't I show you my feelings enough back then?

764
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,269
It doesn't matter where you live.

765
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,570
Son Soo Jeong is still the same Son Soo Jeong.

766
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,009
Your front gate is as pretty as you now.

767
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:17,880
Son Soo Jeong's...

768
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,919
boyfriend.

769
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:23,689
What's with you?

770
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,890
I want to live...

771
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:32,959
the present moment with you.

772
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:35,900
I mean, right now.

773
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,800
Can you please tell me now?

774
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:45,909
I'm sorry. I need to go.

775
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,659
Forget the past?

776
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:08,999
How?

777
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,769
It's something that isn't over for me yet.

778
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:20,540
Bok Su.

779
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,880
How can you be so frank?

780
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:24,810
Isn't there anything you're sorry about?

781
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,419
I thought I knew you.

782
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,919
Did you think you could...

783
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,729
play with my feelings?

784
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:40,429
Yes.

785
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,199
It's all over now.

786
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,509
I'm the only one still stuck behind.

787
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,280
Bok Su.

788
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,780
You're not the only one who's stuck in the past.

789
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:21,870
(Sojeonggak)

790
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:54,269
What?

791
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,070
Is this how teachers visit a student's home?

792
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,409
That day...

793
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,850
Nine years ago, that day.

794
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,890
Let me ask you two questions.

795
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:17,189
Did you...

796
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:27,140
push Se Ho from the rooftop that day?

797
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,880
Answer me.

798
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:41,449
Did you really...

799
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:43,820
push Se Ho from the rooftop?

800
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,320
No.

801
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,689
I didn't.

802
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,100
I didn't push him.

803
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,310
Did you tell everyone that I was...

804
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,580
living on food stamps?

805
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:09,780
No.

806
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,850
What are you talking about?

807
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,919
I heard it that day.

808
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,550
You said you felt sorry for me.

809
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:22,890
Did you just...

810
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,600
find me pitiful?

811
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:32,870
Did you...

812
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:36,640
walk me home every day, smile at me,

813
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:39,580
find my dream, and paint my gate because...

814
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:45,009
I was pitiful?

815
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,159
You aren't answering me.

816
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,070
No.

817
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,769
Because I liked you.

818
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,140
Not because you were pitiful.

819
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,919
I did it because I liked you.

820
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,519
I'm sorry.

821
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,320
For asking you too late.

822
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,130
I'm sorry.

823
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,080
When we were all immature...

824
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:23,009
When I believed in someone...

825
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,050
That time was...

826
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:30,050
the warmest time of my life.

827
00:57:31,419 --> 00:57:32,620
Now I remember that.

828
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:02,019
(My Strange Hero)

829
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:18,469
See you in school. Kids are waiting for you.

830
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:20,370
What are you looking at so vacantly?

831
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,370
You were looking at Soo Jeong, weren't you?

832
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,640
I've been trying to forget you for nine years.

833
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,269
It's a good thing I didn't.

834
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:27,380
Should I be nice to the kids to make you smile?

835
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,509
Shall we go eat then?

836
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,280
I haven't tried samgyeopsal yet.

837
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,150
Do you still like Bok Su?

838
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,919
If you don't like him, you should end it.

839
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:36,919
I've been wanting to come here.

840
00:58:36,919 --> 00:58:38,419
Boundaries are there to be crossed.

841
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:41,320
Did you forget my dream? Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

842
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,360
I'm sorry I didn't believe you back then.

843
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,729
I'm really okay...

844
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,400
because you're with me now.
