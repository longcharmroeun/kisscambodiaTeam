(Episode 5)

3
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,489
Hey, what are you doing?

4
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,842
I'm going to school.

5
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,314
I still look good in my uniform, right?

6
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,180
Why are you going to school?

7
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,038
For revenge. There's an old quote that says...

8
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,200
you should go to a fox's cave if you want to catch a tiger.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,945
I'm going to play their game.

10
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,931
I'm off to school.

11
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:08,861
What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,130
Why would you go to a fox's cave to catch a tiger?

13
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,401
Is that how the saying goes?

14
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,811
Hey, Bok Su!

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,228
Hey, isn't he so cool?

16
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,411
- Who? - What is it?

17
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,769
- Gosh. - Gosh.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,198
He'd be the winner if there were Olympics for good looks.

19
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,552
He'd win five medals.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,427
Who are you talking about?

21
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,153
I have some really exclusive news, so hear up.

22
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:36,689
What is it?

23
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,674
He's actually our senior.

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,637
- Our senior? - What about it?

25
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,013
Don't you know about our school's legend?

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,288
Listen carefully.

27
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,248
This is 100 percent a fact.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,088
It was nine years ago...

29
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:55,837
when Typhoon Kujira was cutting through Korea.

30
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,799
At the time, a girl in his class who took a year off...

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,898
for health reasons returned to school.

32
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,960
I hear she was kind of pretty.

33
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,634
She was a little like Son Ye Jin.

34
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,739
- Son Ye Jin? - You surprised me.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,178
- Are you sure? - Stop interrupting.

36
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,261
Hurry up.

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,149
A bully from a school nearby...

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,488
had been stalking this girl for a long time.

39
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,659
When he heard that she came back,

40
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,689
he brought all his boys...

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,244
over to our school.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,014
She was on her way home...

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,268
when the bullies surrounded her.

44
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:31,328
She was weak as it is,

45
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,668
so she was shivering in fear.

46
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,608
The weak girl screamed for help,

47
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,238
but everyone ignored her and avoided her.

48
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,379
Weren't there anyone around after school?

49
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,500
- Stop it. - Keep your mouth shut.

50
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,445
I'm curious. I almost hit you.

51
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,788
When the bully was just about to...

52
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,709
drag the girl away with him,

53
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,817
our hero protected her.

54
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,880
Right then...

55
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,989
Gosh.

56
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,125
The girl was distressed.

57
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,220
Blood?

58
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,953
Our beautiful hero's face received a scratch.

59
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,370
She couldn't forgive herself.

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,366
Then, he finally opened his mouth.

61
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,710
When you come across a stone on your path,

62
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,083
the weak would say that it's an obstacle.

63
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,858
But the strong would say that it's a stepping stone.

64
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,948
So? What happened to Son Ye Jin?

65
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,172
Are you writing a novel?

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,610
Hey, isn't that Kang Bok Su?

67
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,209

71
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,334
What is he doing here?

73
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,384
You'll regret...

74
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,886
having me back.

75
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:55,210
Hey! Come here, you punk!

76
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,368
Stay right there, punk!

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
- Did you jump over the wall? - What?

78

- Wait, wait, wait. - Where's your nametag?

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,898
Look at this hairdo.

82
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:18,025
Also, your pants are about to rip.

83
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,351
Come here.

- Come! - Sir.

85
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,230
Come on, come on.

86
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,666
Great timing.

87
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,376
He actually came.

88
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,248
This is good news.

89
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,179

Okay.

but you'll regret how you dressed when you get old.

96

You can let him go. It's his first day back at school.

Now, our new board chairman, Mr. Oh Se Ho,

will announce an official statement.

122
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,269
(Seolsong High School's Press Conference)

123
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,380
Hello,

124
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,033
Seolsong High School students and faculty.

125
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,625
I was just appointed as the new board chairman.

126
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,119
My name is Oh Se Ho.

127
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,480
Today, I'm standing here...

128
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,370
with a heavy heart.

129
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,389
Until now, our school focused solely on helping students...

130
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,988
get enrolled in universities.

131
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,029
We failed to give proper attention...

132
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,827
to each of the students and understand their characteristics.

133
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,898
This pushed one student to almost take his life...

134
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,829
and we barely avoided a terrible incident.

135
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,908
From now, as a representative of Seolsong High School,

136
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,978
I'll have the school break away from any old customs,

137
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:50,807
and create a school that's fitting for the current times.

138
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,719
The old board chairman's retirement...

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,305
is a start of this promise. In addition,

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,811
Seolsong High School failed to embrace students...

141
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:01,184
such as Kang Bok Su in the past. Their readmissions...

142
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:03,754
will play as the first step to practice...

143
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,788
the philosophy we have here at Seolsong High School.

144
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,460
Was it the school's project to bring Kang Bok Su back?

145
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:13,900
Kang Bok Su, why did you previously drop out of school?

146
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,108
Are you trying to cover up the school's issues with this...

147
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,786
instead of changing your system?

148
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,796
Is Kang Bok Su influential enough...

149
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,201
to cover up the issues around our school?

150
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,998
Could I have the two of you look to the front for pictures?

151
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,785
Can you smile for us?

152
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,482
My gosh, my eyes must've seen so many filthy things until now.

153
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,849
My eyes are being cleansed just by looking at those two.

154
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,749
My goodness, we're so blessed to be able to see them together.

155
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,419
Which one is closer to your ideal type?

156
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,219
Is it the untamed wild horse or the smart gentleman from a rich family?

157
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,806
I already like someone else.

158
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,744
Bok Su's eyes...

159
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,059
- are full of energy. - By the way,

160
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,130
what kind of trouble did he cause to drop out of school?

161
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,059
Mr. Park, I heard you used to be his homeroom teacher.

162
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:54,058
Why did Bok Su drop out of school?

163
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,844
See? I knew you'd come.

164
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,648
My gosh, you really put in a lot of effort to plan all this.

165
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,731
It's nothing...

166
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,978
compared to you who decided to come to school at your age.

167
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,459
It won't take too long.

168
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,408
Have fun in school until then.

169
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,712
You should go down now.

170
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,888
Why? Let me say a word.

171
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,669
Hello, everyone. I'm Kang Bok Su.

172
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,458
Well, Se Ho...

173
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,616
I mean, Mr. Oh. It may seem like...

174
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,452
he did me a huge favor by letting me get readmitted to school.

175
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,148
But that's not the case.

176
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,290
It's just how things are with the Education Act.

177
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,858
"An individual that once got expelled..."

178
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:55,758
"or dropped out of school is allowed to get readmitted..."

179
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,526
"as long as there aren't any special reasons against it."

180
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,883
This means...

181
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,745
the school is obligated to accept the students who wish to return.

182
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,371
And it also means that I came here on my own will.

183
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,789
Anyway,

184
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,719
I got the chance to receive education again.

185
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,284
So I, Kang Bok Su, will do my best and live diligently.

186
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,723
- My gosh. - Incredible.

187
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,142
What a lunatic.

188
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,014
Attention, everyone.

189
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:37,851
Attention.

190
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,302
He's not even that big of a deal.

191
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,761
Let me deliver the orders made by our new chairman.

192
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,680
A new class will be made starting from today.

193
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,294
It will be called Wildflower Class for now.

194
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:01,829
It will be consisted of a few troublemakers that we picked out...

195
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,599
from each and every class.

196
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,969
So I hope all the teachers make sure the students...

197
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,757
don't feel too agitated about it.

198
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,977
Mr. Song, are you trying to worsen the discrimination?

199
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,096
It's customization, not discrimination.

200
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,562
Se Ho!

201
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,488
Mr. Oh, this is a violation against human rights.

202
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:27,671
Mr. Park.

203
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,280
Mr. Park.

204
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,907
How many students stay awake during your lecture?

205
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,478
We need to acknowledge that all of our students...

206
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,176
have different academic levels, concentration levels, and interests.

207
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,778
Forcing everyone...

208
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,349
to meet the average standard under the name of equality...

209
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,167
can be seen as violence to the ones who fall behind.

210
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,658
Educating students based on their academic levels is true equality,

211
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,306
not discrimination.

212
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,142
That's my philosophy on education.

213
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,757
So your educational philosophy is to discriminate students?

214
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,087
Where's Ms. Son Soo Jeong?

215
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,580
I'm here, sir.

216
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,368
The foundation has decided to appoint you...

217
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,258
as a full-time employee starting from today.

218
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,870
Thank you very much for saving Oh Young Min.

219
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,518
All... All of a sudden?

220
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,077
And that was Bok Su...

221
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,461
- I'm a full-time employee? - Ms. Son, wake up.

222
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,296
Everyone, let's give her a round of applause.

223
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:50,953
You're happy, right?

224

225
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,972
Mr. Oh.

226
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:18,910
Yes, Ms. Son?

227
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,250
You can go first.

228
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,439
It's about Bok Su's readmission.

229
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,402
He came before I even asked him to come.

230
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:37,366
So I don't think I deserve this.

231
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,618
I didn't bring him here.

232
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:41,731
That's what you wanted to say?

233
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:45,010
That's not the reason why you got hired as a full-time teacher.

234
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,628
- What? - You got...

235
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,459
the highest class evaluation points for the past three years.

236
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,651
And you even took the test to become a full-time teacher.

237
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,890
Your appointment kept getting rejected for doubtful reasons.

238
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,272
I'm just relieved that it wasn't too late to set things right.

239
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,867
From now on, I'm going to correct all the wrong things...

240
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,326
that have settled in Seolsong High School.

241
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:12,567
You're more than qualified for the position.

242
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,239
Congratulations.

243
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,180
Yes.

244
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,026
I'm more than qualified.

245
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,174
The world is finally spinning properly.

246
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,925
What's this? We're in the Wildflower Class.

247
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,221
Is it a class full of losers or what?

248
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,528
I like the name.

249
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:01,669
The natural nature. It's nice.

250
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,268
If you like natural beauty so much, why are you wearing full makeup?

251
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,289
- You actually need makeup. - I'm wearing makeup.

252
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:09,841
What? Kang In Ho's also in Wildflower Class.

253
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,378
We must be destined to be together.

254
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,218
Does that mean we have to learn the basics again?

255
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,519
Are you dumb? They're just going to give up on us.

256
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,918
Then nothing's going to change.

257
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,789
I'll keep sleeping, and you can keep putting makeup on in class.

258
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,688
And as for In Ho, he can continue being our slave.

259
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,773
You really should study more.

260
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,389
(Kim Myung Ho, 50,000 dollars)

261
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,260
(Kim Myung Ho, 50,000 dollars)

262
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,448
Congratulations, Ms. Son.

263
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:46,448
I'm happy for you too. I hope we become closer...

264
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,136
now that you've become a full-time teacher.

265
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,176
She's right. Think of us as your older sisters.

266
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:55,858
They're going to hire another contract teacher, right?

267
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,759
The office is already full.

268
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,180
Ms. Son.

269
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,129
We're all busy, so let's delay the congratulations party.

270
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,220
Here's your roll book.

271
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:14,847
You're the homeroom teacher of the new Wildflower Class.

272
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:18,309
Pardon? Me?

273
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:21,678
But you said that class is made up of troublemakers.

274
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,349
Today's my first day as a full-time teacher.

275
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,016
That's why you should start from the very bottom.

276
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:27,601
Take it.

277
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,524
(Name of Students)

278
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,554
Oh, right. Wait.

279
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,928
There's one missing student.

280
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,383
What? Who?

281
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,569
Mr. Song!

282
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,509
What? I'm just really busy.

283
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,995
I'll print out a new copy for you later.

284
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,178
Bok Su's in the Counseling Room.

285
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,998
So you can take him to class.

286
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,513
- What? - Take him to Wildflower Class.

287
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,266
And get him to sign this as well.

288
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,307
(Name of Students, Kang Bok Su)

289
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,156
My gosh. Kang Bok Su.

290
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,329
Will you please disappear from my life?

291
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,155
My gosh, I'm so exhausted.

292
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,208
(Ms. Son, I'm always grateful for your help.)

293
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:27,079
(Ms. Son, since when were you so pretty?)

294
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,878
(Thank you, Ms. Son)

295
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,210
(Ms. Son, since when were you so pretty?)

296
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,370
Soo Jeong...

297
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,881
was pretty ever since she was young.

298
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:48,966
What did I just say? My goodness.

299
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,051
Pretty, my foot.

300
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,293
(Pretty people die fast.)

301
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:08,301
Yes.

302
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:11,153
He's a student, and I'm a teacher.

303
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,291
Don't be scared.

304
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,336
I guess you're good at acting like a teacher.

305
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,660
You seem popular.

306
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,989
Why are you here? I told you not to come here.

307
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,757
Come on. Don't say like that.

308
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,037
You're getting the permanent position thanks to me, aren't you?

309
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,752
News travels fast.

310
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,481
But...

311
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,638
I didn't become a permanent teacher because of you.

312
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,993
Are you a permanent teacher already?

313
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,362
Gosh, Se Ho's fast.

314
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,941
Do you know how hard I worked?

315
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,648
According to the evaluation and test scores,

316
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:10,089
I was supposed to get the job.

317
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,749
But then why couldn't you become...

318
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,183
a permanent teacher even though you spent 50,000 dollars?

319
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:16,199
That's strange.

320
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,143
What do you want from me?

321
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,282
What do I want from you?

322
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:28,166
"I tried to buy the permanent position with 50,000 dollars."

323
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,908
Make a confession and acknowledge that you aren't...

324
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,021
qualified to be a teacher.

325
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:35,779
What if I won't do that?

326
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,173
Then I'll help you until you do.

327
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,849
Who do you think you are? Why are you doing this to me?

328
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,637
After nine years?

329
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,549
Hey, I should be the one asking you.

330
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,277
Why did you do that to me back then?

331
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,375
I thought you...

332
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,290
I thought there was something between us.

333
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:04,552
Between us?

334
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,626
Was there something between us?

335
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,464
Words are vain, aren't they?

336
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,148
I thought there were a lot of things between us.

337
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,705
But now that we're talking about it,

338
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,372
I see it was nothing.

339
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,824
Hey, Soo Jeong. You know what?

340
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,462
A fake doesn't last long.

341
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,220
Right.

342
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,427
A fake doesn't last long.

343
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,570
That must be why you and I are this way.

344
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,283
If you were sincere, you wouldn't have done that to me.

345
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:50,699
What do you mean?

346
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,905
I have no time to talk about the past.

347
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,001
Just fill this out.

348
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,580
(Seolsong High School Readmission Application Form)

349
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,440
Hey, Soo Jeong.

350
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,799
What should I write for reasons for a leave of absence?

351
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,438
I think you might know.

352
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,938
Because I really don't know...

353
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,509
why I had to quit school.

354
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,025
Why are you asking me?

355
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,773
You haven't changed. You're still good for nothing.

356
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:22,141
Remember. I'm a teacher.

357
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,159
Don't talk down to me.

358
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:29,771
Yes.

359
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,606
Ms. Son.

360
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,157
All right. Let's go in.

361
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,299
Guys, this isn't a bad thing.

362
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,438
We're trying to provide lessons that are perfect for you.

363
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,378
Isn't it nice to be with close friends?

364
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:52,511
So don't take this too seriously.

365
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,519
Don't send any anonymous letters to the education office.

366
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,751
All right. Get ready for class.

367
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,900
Good luck.

368
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:01,873
- Good luck. - Okay.

369
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,432
(Wildflower Class)

370
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,014
Nothing changed.

371
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,430
I'm reminded of the old days. Aren't you?

372
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,648
(Wildflower Class)

373
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:27,034
This is Wildflower Class.

374
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,066
It's a new class for problem...

375
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,903
Special care class.

376
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:34,669
I'm the homeroom teacher.

377
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,517
That's good. I'll have at least one person I know.

378
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,898
"Wildflower Class."

379
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:43,627
Is it asking us to be tough and survive?

380
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,688
Cute. Wildflower Class.

381
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:53,965
He's still so positive for no reason.

382
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,531
Bok Su.

383
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,211
Quiet down.

384
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,966
As you all know, I'm Son Soo Jeong.

385
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm the homeroom teacher of the new Wildflower Class.

386
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,882
Looking forward to it.

387
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,158
Ms. Son. Do they hate you?

388
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,875
Why did they make you take the troublemaker class?

389
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,373
Hey, it should be called as the recycle class.

390
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:37,648
Why don't you use that clever brain for something productive?

391
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:39,888
Aren't you going to stand up for us anymore?

392
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,879
That's why I like Ms. Son.

393
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,252
She's unpretentious and has no love for us.

394
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,525
All right. We'll get to know each other slowly.

395
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,729
We have a return student. You know him, right?

396
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,619
The brave citizen, Kang Bok Su!

397
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:58,181
Bok Su. Say hello.

398
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:00,151
I'm Kang Bok Su.

399
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,225
I hope we get along.

400
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,962
I hope so too.

401
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,389
Kang Bok Su.

402
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:13,618
Hi, I'm Oh Se Ho. I hope we get along.

403
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,791
Our class' handsome level has just gone up.

404
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:20,333
He's charming in a different way compared to Bok Su. Hi.

405
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,698
Hey. Do you want to die?

406
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:24,468
How dare you compare him to Bok Su?

407
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:25,681
Be quiet.

408
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,768
Soo Jeong should show him around school.

409
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,258
Me! Sir, I'll do it.

410
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,581
What? You?

411
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:34,938
I want to show him around.

412
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:36,608
- Sit down. - No.

413
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:39,004
I will take... Oh Se...

414
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:40,948
I want to show Se Ho...

415
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:42,696
around school.

416
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,749
There's the cafeteria. Go through that door.

417
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,858
You have to go quick.

418
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,529
Over there is the library, which I think is a place you'd like.

419
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,973
I've never been there though.

420
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:54,074
Anyway...

421
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:58,163
Well, I think I've seen enough.

422
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,809
Hey, Oh Se Oh.

423
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,908
It's Oh Se Ho.

424
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,969
How about Oh Se Yo for your nickname?

425
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,070
But that's not important.

426
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,801
Hey.

427
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,630
Have you been in a relationship?

428
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,770
A relationship?

429
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,114
Don't look.

430
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,120
She saw us because of you. Why did you look?

431
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,135
Hey, Se Ho.

432
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:53,958
You're so unlucky.

433
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,081
You transferred a day before the exams.

434
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:58,209
I like exams though.

435
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,718
It's the fairest game in the world.

436
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,475
Is that right? Good luck.

437
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,128
Good luck.

438
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,241
(School Report)

439
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,471
Soo Jeong, are you number 1? I placed last. 300.

440
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,497
Wait a minute. Does that mean...

441
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,272
we're partners again?

442
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:47,219
Can I eat this?

443
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,864
- Thanks. - Cheers.

444
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:29,490
Hey.

445
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,902
Why do you keep looking at me?

446
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,571
I don't know.

447
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,712
Why do I keep looking at you?

448
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,070
All right. Who will be the class president?

449
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,133
- Seung Woo? - Why would I be a teacher's pet?

450
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:01,459
Okay.

451
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:03,564
Any volunteers?

452
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:07,411
Guys, the class president gets extra points.

453
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,690
If there's no volunteers, should I pick?

454
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,299
Ms. Son, I didn't think you were...

455
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,829
so authoritative.

456
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay. Under my authority, you can be the class president.

457
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:20,868
No, I don't want to be the class president.

458
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:23,069
I'm going to file a complaint saying it interferes with my studies.

459
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,139
So Ra, let's not lie to ourselves.

460
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,622
Then who wants to be the class president?

461
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,438
We need to abide by the rules.

462
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,793
Just choose anyone, Ms. Son.

463
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,178
Okay, then let's be fair and choose the one on the top of the list.

464
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,930
Kang Bok...

465
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,958
Bok Su returned to school after a long period of time.

466
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,979
He'll need time to get used to the place.

467
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,650
Kang In Ho. Where's In Ho?

468
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,029
- My gosh. - I can't believe it.

469
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,545
- Hey. - Come on.

470
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:57,781
That little...

471
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,744
What's wrong, Bok Su? Hey, Bok Su.

472
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,600
Bok Su!

473
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,922
What do you think about becoming the class president, In Ho?

474
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:23,773
I... I don't want to.

475
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:27,094
"I... I don't want to." Didn't I sound just like him?

476
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,559
In Ho's so cute.

477
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,880
I'll do it.

478
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,860
I'd like to be...

479
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,565
the class president.

480
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:49,858
Then I guess our class president is going to be that old guy.

481
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:51,102
- Nice. - Great.

482
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,588
Okay, then.

483
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,301
Kang Bok Su will be our class president.

484
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:07,793
I'll see you guys later.

485
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,898
- My gosh. - Nice.

486
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,235
Hey, come outside.

487
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,031
What's going on?

488
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,358
In Ho's busy because he needs to level up.

489
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,858
He's a nice fellow...

490
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,092
who plays games on my behalf during all recess and self-study sessions.

491
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,370
So what do you need from him?

492
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,901
Are you telling me that he's playing with your ID on your behalf?

493
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,149
Why?

494
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,269
Going up to the next level is really hard.

495
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,825
I need to be on the phone all day.

496
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:42,138
I have weak fingers.

497
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:44,937
And he insisted on helping, so I just let him.

498
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:47,690
Right?

499
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,430
Come outside.

500
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:57,899
What's his problem?

501
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:01,184
(Episode 6 will air shortly.)

502
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,257
Sojunggak's light, hope, and star, In Ho.

503
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,945
Why are you in that class?

504
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,229
Because I bombed at the level test.

505
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,674
I should be in Ivy Class.

506
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,820
Don't tell Mom, okay?

507
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:23,642
Hey, In Ho. Tell me the truth.

508
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,109
It's the truth.

509
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,309
Are you really going to lie to me?

510
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,137
What was that game about?

511
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,259
Game.

512
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,375
We're friends, so we were helping each other.

513
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,258
They're actually really nice kids.

514
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:40,189
It's because you don't know them well.

515
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,339
That's right.

516
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:48,183
I'm stupid and I'm being bullied.

517
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,018
So why did you have to return...

518
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,008
to school at an old age?

519
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:55,929
Get a hold of yourself.

520
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,300
You're your mom's only hope.

521
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,349
You saw how your grandmother suffered because of me.

522
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,549
How can you be like this when you saw all that?

523
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,589
How can you lie?

524
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:10,118
Uncle Bok Su. I'll do whatever you say.

525
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:13,190
Please don't tell Mom.

526
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,484
Lying isn't going to solve this problem!

527
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,613
- Hey. - What?

528
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:22,311
Hey.

529
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,999
Has In Ho ever knelt down and begged to us like that?

530
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,049
No, right?

531
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,724
Who is that old thug?

532
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,968
Are they brothers? It's Kang Bok Su, Kang In Ho.

533
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:34,813
Just because their family names are the same... Are they brothers?

534
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,618
Anyway, In Ho can't have another bully.

535
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:44,103
Which of the following is the writer's argument?

536
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,853
Who wants to read it?

537
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,717
How about Bok Su?

538
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,830
Okay. Since it's your first day back,

539
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,383
I'll read it.

540
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,765
We'll continue next class.

541
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,478
- Gosh. - Attack.

542
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,763
Attack.

543
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,839
Give me one.

544
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:15,779
Do you want to go watch something?

545
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:17,971
Hey, In Ho.

546
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:20,042
Go get some bul-burg.

547
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,454
Okay. I will.

548
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,710
Gosh.

549
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,850
Hey!

550
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,798
What?

551
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,708
I can run 100m in 11 seconds.

552
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,333
What is he saying?

553
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:52,082
I'll go get that bul-burg.

554
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,743
What is bul-burg by the way?

555
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,622
It's bulgogi burger.

556
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:00,289
Okay. Time me.

557
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:05,521
He's a real wacko.

558
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,165
Upper body at a 45 degree angle.

559
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,964
Must reduce wind resistance.

560
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,594
Center of gravity is to the left.

561
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:21,168
Maintain speed while not falling down.

562
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,718
My feet remembers the height and the number of stairs.

563
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,819
9, 10, 11. Land.

564
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,599
Using athleticism and instinct,

565
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,771
dodge obstacles.

566
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,001
I have to be faster than In Ho.

567
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,149
What can I do for you?

568
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,322
English?

569
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,465
Give me three bul-burg.

570
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:53,136
Give me three ball bugs.

571
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,234
You're fantastic.

572
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,186
My family's hope, In Ho, is being bullied?

573
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,751
My poor sister.

574
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,176
I have to be faster than In Ho.

575
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,008
Gosh, you're fast.

576
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:16,222
3 minutes and 15 seconds.

577
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:21,932
In Ho's fastest record was 4 minutes and 28 seconds.

578
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,918
Still, it's more delicious when In Ho buys them.

579
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:26,988
Don't you think so?

580
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:29,719
That's right. You might collapse, old man.

581
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,275
I'll trust you with our snacks from now on too, In Ho.

582
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,341
Gosh.

583
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,300
Hey.

584
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,795
I'll open it for you. Are you surprised?

585
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:54,774
Hey, listen carefully.

586
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,079
I'm the snack shuttle from now on.

587
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,642
I'm the snack shuttle, okay?

588
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,280
Don't you forget that.

589
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,688
It's amazing.

590
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:09,286
Complaint calls declined drastically.

591
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,561
Demonstrators in front of the gate will stop protesting as well.

592
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:14,469
But are you really...

593
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,964
letting Kang Bok Su return to school?

594
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:19,853
He's already our student.

595
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:21,749
What's wrong?

596
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,939
I'm wondering if it's just temporary.

597
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:27,709
Well...

598
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,658
We don't know what kind of trouble he may cause.

599
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:34,748
He's bound to make problems.

600
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:36,819
Then I guess he will.

601
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,486
You should take care of it when that happens.

602
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,269
I think In Ho will make a good janitor.

603
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,329
- It suits him. - He's good. Kang In Ho.

604
00:38:58,539 --> 00:38:59,590
Look at this.

605
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:01,769
Gosh, those kids.

606
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:04,241
Hurry. Put that down and do it.

607
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,933
I'll hit you.

608
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,219
- Hey. - You missed a spot.

609
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,300
This one too.

610
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,881
I have no time for this.

611
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:18,264
In Ho, you're getting in the way of my revenge.

612
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,058
My plan's going awry.

613
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,529
(Reason for leave of absence)

614
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:44,018
(Personal reasons)

615
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:54,310
Let go, let go.

616
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,139
I told you not to approach me from the back.

617
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,886
Gosh. You bastard.

618
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,752
Why are you so serious on your first day of school?

619
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,921
Let's go.

620
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,319
Where? No, I won't go.

621
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,532
Just come.

622
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,300
Come.

623
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,075
Wait, Mr. Park.

624
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:22,728
Here. Congratulations on becoming a student again.

625
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:27,012
Why is a teacher making a student drink?

626
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,651
Here.

627
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,381
All right.

628
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:41,108
Eat up.

629
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:43,372
I knew it'd take time for you to come back,

630
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,539
but I knew you'd return.

631
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,724
Punk. You're all grown up.

632
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:57,972
I prefer wings.

633
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,367
- Hello. - Come in, come in.

634
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:09,893
Hello.

635
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,321
What's wrong with him?

636
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,649
Did the kids suck up your energy?

637
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,709
He must be tired from going to school.

638
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,997
Congratulations on going back to school.

639
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,835
Sorry I couldn't tell you.

640
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,589
I didn't want you to worry about me.

641
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,236
Of course I'm worried.

642
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,488
There will be so many beautiful young girls.

643
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:28,159
They're young, so they'll have good visions.

644
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,659
They'll be able to see my handsome Bok Su so well.

645
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,457
I can't fight age no matter how pretty I am.

646
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:37,233
I have to watch Bok Su be surrounded by girls again!

647
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,842
Mr. Park, are you his homeroom teacher again?

648
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,839
Should I ask you to treat him well?

649
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,449
No, no. I have to go to the toilet.

650
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,008
- Where are you going? - The washroom.

651
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:49,232
- Mr. Park. - I have to go.

652
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,907
It looks good, right?

653
00:41:57,659 --> 00:41:58,801
Congratulations.

654
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,070
You didn't even tell me.

655
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,599
3, 2, 1.

656
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:20,761
That's five dollars.

657
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:23,549
Don't ever say "five" in front of me again.

658
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,219
I said it's five dollars because it's five dollars.

659
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,633
Should I say it's 50,000 dollars?

660
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,931
Hey!

661
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,339
- Son Soo Jeong? - Son Soo Jeong?

662
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,708
Is Soo Jeong your homeroom teacher?

663
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,169
Are you saying...

664
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,025
Soo Jeong is at the school you're at?

665
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,891
- Calm down... - I heard it all.

666
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,242
I'm going to go to school too.

667
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,638
I'll go there too.

668
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,039
Why would you go back?

669
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,959
Bok Su! Soo Jeong!

670
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:49,634
I can't watch the two of you together.

671
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:59,441
How did she become your homeroom teacher?

672
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:02,106
It's not even funny.

673
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:04,689
How does it feel to see her again?

674
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,447
Does your heart still race?

675
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,488
I told you our family has a heart problem.

676
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:09,611
Sure, sure.

677
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:10,940
Stop asking me.

678
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:14,020
So, what do you want to do?

679
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,669
I was worried you'd break everything at school.

680
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,537
I'm too old now. Why would I do something like that?

681
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,839
I know Se Ho will definitely have a weakness.

682
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,253
And I'm going to crush him.

683
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,321
As for Soo Jeong...

684
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,082
I'm going to hear her out and see why she did that to me.

685
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,518
You still have lingering feelings.

686
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,549
No, I'm curious. That's why.

687
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:43,426
I'm really curious why she did that to me.

688
00:43:48,229 --> 00:43:49,856
Why isn't Mr. Park back?

689
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,008
Hey, did he drink?

690
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:54,050
Yes, he had one beer.

691
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,278
A single drink can get him drunk. He always goes home when he's drunk.

692
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:00,390
He goes home.

693
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:02,461
Here.

694
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,665
See you next time, kids.

695
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,922
I had them pay extra attention since you're here.

696
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:18,269
Sit down.

697
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,309
You still love seafood, don't you?

698
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,127
Meat isn't good for you.

699
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:31,950
Thank you.

700
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:35,597
There's a lot for you to do now.

701
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,706
We also can't guarantee such a thing won't happen again.

702
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:41,908
Okay. I'll do my best.

703
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,319
Why aren't you eating? Are you still a picky eater?

704
00:44:52,343 --> 00:44:57,343

705
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,019
It's delicious.

706
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,259
Yes?

707
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,201
And?

708
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,429
Are you okay?

709
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,528
Chef. I'm allergic to shellfish,

710
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:29,631
so don't use any in my food from now on please.

711
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,558
I'm sorry, sir. I'm new.

712
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:35,143
Your mother told me you're not allergic to anything.

713
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,424
She probably forgot.

714
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,895
It's been a while since we saw each other.

715
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:16,665
Bok Su!

716
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,988
Did you get wet?

717
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:22,343
What's with you? You're acting strange.

718
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,991
So Jeong always does this with In Ho.

719
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,902
- I'll do it too. - You surprised me.

720
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,017
Are you sure you went to school?

721
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,910
Mom, kids leave books at school these days.

722
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:42,968
Also, the blackboards erase on their own. Did you know?

723
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,532
Is it controlled by AI or something?

724
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,829
Can they clean my restaurant too?

725
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,804
- Right. Did you eat? - I ate.

726
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:00,571
What is it, Mom?

727
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:05,068
It's been a while since you wore your uniform. You look good.

728
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,243
Gosh.

729
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,731
You were nagging at me about going back before.

730
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,222
Let's go.

731
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:18,757
- I'm cold. - Gosh.

732
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,526
- You little punk. - Okay.

733
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,663
Hey, Bok Su.

734
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,339
Don't act like you know In Ho.

735
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,719
Don't go to his class and act like you're his uncle.

736
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,921
You'll bring down his class. Do you understand?

737
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,388
You better be quiet.

738
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:34,471
You don't even know anything.

739
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:36,858
(Sojunggak)

740
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,559
I know what's going on.

741
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,449
I've been a parent for many years.

742
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,509
Gosh!

743
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:51,254
Watch how you talk.

744
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,700
Your baby isn't the only precious one!

745
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,705
- Come on, Mom. - Bok Su!

746
00:47:57,149 --> 00:47:59,179
In Ho must be so embarrassed.

747
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,037
Also, I'm your baby too!

748
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:15,095
Right. A fake doesn't last long.

749
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:17,592
That must be why you and I are this way.

750
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:30,952
If you were sincere, you wouldn't have done that to me.

751
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,464
What are you saying,

752
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:36,170
Soo Jeong?

753
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,705
Do I have menopause?

754
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,689
This part feels stuffy, right?

755
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,719
You can't sleep at night, you have indigestion,

756
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,052
you're always angry, and you feel like you have a fever, right?

757
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:16,916
How did you know?

758
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:19,969
- Did you buy any stocks? - No.

759
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,528
Your symptoms are exactly the same when...

760
00:49:22,529 --> 00:49:25,296
Mr. Kim lost 50,000 dollars from stock investment.

761
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,839
How strange.

762
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,162
These kind of symptoms show up when people lose money.

763
00:49:29,409 --> 00:49:30,419
It's stress caused by anger.

764
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,822
"Stressed caused by anger"?

765
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:38,349
- Here. - Will this help me feel better?

766
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,875
They're just vitamins, so they won't help.

767
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,418
But you should find the cause and get rid of it.

768
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:46,329
The fact that he wrote these poems...

769
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,699
during the Japanese colonial era when everything seemed gloomy...

770
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,998
tells us that poets and writers are greatly affected...

771
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:54,528
by the time period they live in.

772
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,569
The feeling of anxiety, depression, and fear...

773
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,528
from the poem we learned today show us just that.

774
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,108
By the way, is everyone doing well...

775
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:06,608
with preparing a parody or a reinvention of a poem...

776
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:08,124
you learned this semester?

777
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,570
Does anyone happen to have theirs prepared today?

778
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,606
Whoever goes first will get extra points.

779
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:20,854
- I guess there's no one. - Can I go?

780
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:22,344
I'm ready. I'm ready.

781
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:25,651
I'm impressed.

782
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,581
Okay.

783
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,354
Go ahead, then.

784
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:38,138
I tried reinventing the poem we just learned, "Crow's Eye View".

785
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:40,735
The title is "50,000-dollar View".

786
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:46,388
They say the 1st teacher is scary. They say the 2nd teacher is scary.

787
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:49,618
They say the 3rd teacher is scary. They say the 4th teacher is scary.

788
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,188
They say the fifth teacher is scary.

789
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:53,614
Stop! What kind of poem is that?

790
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:57,259
The authority of teachers have plummeted...

791
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,128
along with their conscience and sense of duty.

792
00:51:00,129 --> 00:51:03,039
As a representative of our 50 million citizens,

793
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,638
I made this poem...

794
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:07,809
to express the fear of 5,000 teachers.

795
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,960
Okay, that's enough for today.

796
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,438
It's very unique and difficult.

797
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:13,479
And I couldn't understand a single word.

798
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,681
I'll check everyone else's work in detail once you hand them in.

799
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,066
Bok Su, I'd like to have a word with you.

800
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,860
Okay, Ms. Son.

801
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,118
Why are you being so immature?

802
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,312
Bok Su, is this why you came to school?

803
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:31,529
No, this isn't why I'm back.

804
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,145
Then why did you come back?

805
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:34,982
Is that...

806
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,153
all you have to say to me?

807
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,358
What else is there for us to talk about?

808
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:48,407
You're a student, and I'm a teacher.

809
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,310
Bok Su, where are you going?

810
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,101
You have nothing to say?

811
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,129
Then...

812
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,674
let me help you remember.

813
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,461
Where are we...

814
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,488
My gosh, it's been...

815
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,110
It's been so long.

816
00:52:34,189 --> 00:52:35,846
It's been about nine years, right?

817
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:39,729
The school closed the rooftop. Let's go to the Counseling Room.

818
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,083
It seems open to me.

819
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,280
What?

820
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:46,740
(Do not enter rooftop.)

821
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:39,271
Hey.

822
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:41,699
You jerk.

823
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:46,416
Hey. Hey.

824
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:50,720
- Wait. - Hey, come here.

825
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,599
It hurts.

826
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,822
How did you know that?

827
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,055
No. Why did you tell her?

828
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,095
Because I don't like her.

829
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,838
I've never lost to anyone when it came to studies.

830
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:07,816
And I was really nice to her, but she kept ignoring me.

831
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,780
She's my girlfriend, you jerk.

832
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,770
So what?

833
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:15,888
What does that have to do with me?

834
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:16,909
Hey.

835
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,249
Don't you feel sorry for Soo Jeong?

836
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:26,662
Then what about me? Don't you feel sorry for me?

837
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:30,629
I pity myself the most.

838
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,053
Why?

839
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,297
What's so pitiful about you?

840
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:38,991
Bok Su. You...

841
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:42,336
You never know anything.

842
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:45,631
You jerk.

843
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,189
You crazy jerk.

844
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,341
Bok Su. Kang Bok Su.

845
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,300
Look at me.

846
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,741
What do you want, you jerk?

847
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,522
Should I just...

848
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,793
kill myself?

849
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,290
Hey.

850
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:47,289
What... What are you doing? Come down from there.

851
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,037
Isn't it all just useless?

852
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:51,709
I'm sick of trying so hard to live.

853
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:56,501
If I jump from here,

854
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,915
I think everything will become so peaceful.

855
00:56:03,169 --> 00:56:04,179
Hey.

856
00:56:16,449 --> 00:56:17,691
Fine, do whatever you want.

857
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,766
There's a limit to joking around.

858
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:25,074
Wait. Bok Su.

859
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:27,559
Bok Su.

860
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,059
I'm really going to jump, okay?

861
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,777
Bok Su, wait. Don't go!

862
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:42,220
Fine.

863
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,123
Goodbye, Bok Su.

864
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,268
Thanks for everything.

865
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,720
Bok Su.

866
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,101
- You care too much. - Come on, Se Ho.

867
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,019
Hurry up and hold my hand. Hurry!

868
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,160
Bok Su.

869
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:29,662
Can you please save me?

870
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:39,010
Bok Su.

871
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:46,793
Please save me!

872
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,320
No.

873
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,331
No!

874
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,300
Se Ho.

875
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,090
Oh Se Ho.

876
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:32,161
(My Strange Hero)
