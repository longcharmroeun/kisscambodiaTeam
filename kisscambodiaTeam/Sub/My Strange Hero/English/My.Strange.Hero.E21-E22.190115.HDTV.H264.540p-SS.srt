1
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:30,734
Chairman Oh Se Ho.

2
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:37,988
You're not...

3
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:41,079
the owner of this school.

4
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,525
Bok Su.

5
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:52,855
What's your point?

6
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,224
I'm asking Mr. Park to hold accountable...

7
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:58,834
for making a false accusation...

8
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,134
and damaging our school's reputation.

9
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:02,165
Hey.

10
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,275
I mean, Chairman Oh.

11
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:08,604
Even so, you can't do that in front of a student...

12
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:09,645
A student?

13
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,784
I guess you forgot. I'm a student.

14
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,555
Then, like a student,

15
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,485
stay out of teachers' business.

16
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:25,155
Hey!

17
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:27,324
Bok Su, you punk.

18
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:43,905
(Letter of Resignation)

19
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:51,085
Chairman Oh.

20
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:54,154
You know better...

21
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:57,085
than anyone else...

22
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,555
that the accusation wasn't false.

23
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:02,494
You can accept...

24
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,464
this letter of resignation anytime.

25
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:10,065
I'll do my best until my time...

26
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,205
at Seolsong is up.

27
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:20,744
Think carefully...

28
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,315
what your best would be.

29
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:00,855
(Episode 21)

30
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,925
Se Ho!

31
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,355
Just take it out on me.

32
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,055
Firing Mr. Park, threatening Soo Jeong,

33
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:07,494
and transferring Wildflower Class by force.

34
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:08,925
What are you doing?

35
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:10,994
Transferring by force?

36
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,934
It's a special transfer recommended by the principal.

37
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,235
I know what your plan is.

38
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:17,675
You're kicking out students with bad grades.

39
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,474
It's better to be transferred than be at the bottom of the school.

40
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:22,075
There are students at the bottom everywhere.

41
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,474
If we leave, there will be new students at the bottom.

42
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,645
That's none of my business.

43
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:34,525
Then...

44
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:37,754
can we stay if we're not at the bottom?

45
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,525
- What? - Will better grades do it?

46
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:46,735
- You? - No.

47
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:48,765
Us.

48
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,305
If we get better grades,

49
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:53,775
what will you do then?

50
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,275
That's nice.

51
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,775
I'll take your proposition.

52
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:02,444
I'll look forward to it.

53
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,284
Even though that's impossible.

54
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,295
We'll have to be really careful.

55
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,164
This is brutal.

56
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:19,994
A blank resignation letter?

57
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,235
It's gotten too scary to teach students.

58
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,305
Anyway, will Bok Su be okay?

59
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:28,045
Is it true that Bok Su...

60
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:30,474
and the chairman used to be friends?

61
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:32,675
What? Friends?

62
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,744
I'd believe it if they were sworn enemies.

63
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,825
Ms. Son.

64
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:46,094
Bok Su told the chairman that Wildflower Class would...

65
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:50,395
raise their class average scores of the upcoming placement test.

66
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,594
Pardon?

67
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:54,904
Well, the last class average grade...

68
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,705
was 29.5.

69
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:03,804
I heard he said, If the class brings their average scores to 50,

70
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,815
they won't transfer schools...

71
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:06,674
that have been recommended by the principal.

72
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:09,685
What do you mean, the principal recommended transferring schools?

73
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,085
How should I know what they're thinking?

74
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:13,854
It's what the board chairman ordered.

75
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,924
I know he's the board chairman, but how can he decide on that?

76
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,594
The parents won't accept this.

77
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,364
The chairman plans on meeting the parents...

78
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,065
of Wildflower Class himself.

79
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:28,065
Bok Su says he'll make sure that Wildflower Class...

80
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:30,265
get better average scores.

81
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,604
Who knows? They might not end up transferring.

82
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,775
Hey, wildflowers!

83
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,114
"Wildflowers"?

84
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,284
What's wrong with you?

85
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,385
We...

86
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:53,594
need to study.

87
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,495
What is this? Did I just hear him right?

88
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,534
Did you just say we need to play basketball?

89
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:04,505
Bok Su, I like you a lot,

90
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,575
but this isn't right.

91
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,335
My uncle finally lost it.

92
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:11,775
Then do you want to get kicked out by this school?

93
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,784
We have no other choice if they're kicking us out.

94
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,515
The owner of the school is telling us to leave.

95
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,255
Students are the owners of this school, not the chairman.

96
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,924
But realistically,

97
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,755
we don't have any power.

98
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,525
We don't have to transfer if we bring up our average.

99
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:31,995
Isn't it funny?

100
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:33,135
They're looking down on us and discriminating us...

101
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:34,534
because our marks aren't as good.

102
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,705
We might as well give it a try.

103
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,344
It's upsetting.

104
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,385
Yes. Let's try it, guys.

105
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,154
I'll do my best to help you.

106
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:56,085
I don't want to send you off.

107
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,424
I hate the thought.

108
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,995
We never studied before.

109
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:17,205
Just tell them to transfer.

110
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,544
It's easier than studying.

111
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,645
There's an easy way out right in front of you.

112
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,844
Why do you bother to take the difficult route?

113
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,214
We're gathering as seniors to help our juniors.

114
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:28,125
Doesn't that make you feel proud?

115
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,354
Isn't it a senior's duty to help their juniors...

116
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,955
find the easier path?

117
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,325
I'll make an official request.

118
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,525
Gosh, ma'am.

119
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,294
I'm sorry we didn't recognize you.

120
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:38,534
We need to strategize if we want them...

121
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:39,765
to bring up their marks in a short time.

122
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:42,904
It'll be hard for them since they're not used to studying.

123
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:47,304
We need to work on their concentration first.

124
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:50,044
I'll look for a special method.

125
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:52,544
It's hard to bring up math marks in a short period of time,

126
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,745
so we need to focus on English and Korean.

127
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,544
I can work on Korean,

128
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,585
but what do we do with English?

129
00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:59,455
English?

130
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,585
I know someone who can help us.

131
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:08,065
- Young Jun. - Yes?

132
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:11,695
You said you'd help me, right?

133
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:14,135
Yes. What can I help you with?

134
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,705
I'm sorry, Mr. Ma.

135
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,464
Bok Su is usually not this rude.

136
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,404
Bok Su, are you crazy?

137
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,075
Guys, it's me. Ma Young Jun.

138
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,344
I went to school with you.

139
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:35,255
When I was in school, I used to deliver snacks.

140
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,195
You're that Ma Young Jun?

141
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:46,935
Ma Young Jun?

142
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,034
Unfortunately, time took a toll on him.

143
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,265
He aged pretty fast.

144
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,304
Yes, it indeed took a toll.

145
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:53,804
I was so surprised.

146
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:55,844
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

147
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:57,445
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,614
It's okay.

149
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:02,445
It's so nice to have all of my old schoolmates...

150
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:04,955
gathered together.

151
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,365
You might have been a true teacher to Bok Su,

152
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:23,434
but not to me.

153
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,105
- Se Ho, I... - I'm the evidence...

154
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:28,875
that proves you failed as a teacher.

155
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:32,115
Back then when I was your student,

156
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,584
I died.

157
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:52,664
Mr. Park.

158
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:00,135
How about some soju tonight?

159
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:11,615
Mr. Park.

160
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,995
Hey, it's going to spill.

161
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:20,895
This is how much I love you.

162
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:24,064
Please drink it and forget about what happened today.

163
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,304
How did you end up making such a promise with Se Ho?

164
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,904
You just watch.

165
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,605
Did you forget how Soo Jeong brought up my marks by 50 points?

166
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,275
Right.

167
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:43,745
I admit, you and Soo Jeong have strong wills.

168
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:58,294
You look a little pale.

169
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:06,334
A student of mine is behaving in the wrong way,

170
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:10,005
but I can't seem to correct him. That is breaking my heart.

171
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:13,314
The parents are the primary carers of children,

172
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:17,245
and teachers are secondary.

173
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:20,054
If you've let go of a student by mistake,

174
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,885
then go and grab them now.

175
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,324
Kids misbehave...

176
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:29,595
when they want attention or help.

177
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:31,635
I think it's a cry for help.

178
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,044
How are the preparations going for your move?

179
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:53,154
I'll hurry up and take care of the problem.

180
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:54,715
It's too bad you had to waste time and effort...

181
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,225
on figuring out the school's businesses.

182
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,725
We'll see if it was a waste or not.

183
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:04,324
Don't you dare touch what I'm planning.

184
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:05,664
Of course not, Mother.

185
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:07,034
I'll see you later.

186
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:16,674
(Student Performance Record)

187
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,715
Bok Su's friends got hired by the school.

188
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:22,145
Are you just going to let them be?

189
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,385
Why not? It's fun.

190
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:27,084
Did they find out anything?

191
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:28,324
Should I look into it?

192
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:32,194
It looks like they're digging around the school here and there.

193
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:33,294
Just let them be.

194
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:37,495
For once, Bok Su and I have the same goal.

195
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:39,965
We both want to turn the school around.

196
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,135
Do you plan on using them?

197
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,904
It would've been nice if they were that useful.

198
00:12:47,304 --> 00:12:50,145
Parents are filing complaints about me?

199
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,204
Yes.

200
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:52,775
To give you an example,

201
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,515
aside from during the time of Young Min's incident,

202
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,145
we haven't had this many complaints since the founding of the school.

203
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:01,515
In any case, we decided to take disciplinary action.

204
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,324
For a while, other Korean teachers...

205
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,125
will take over your classes.

206
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,865
We'd like you to be in charge of keeping the school clean.

207
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,395
What do you mean I'll miss my classes?

208
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,804
What did I do so wrong to miss my classes?

209
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,434
Then take a look at these.

210
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:20,975
This is how the parents feel, and what the students see.

211
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:22,674
You need to communicate more.

213

(Complaint Report)

214
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,025
It offended me when he favored the Wildflower Class...

215
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:43,664
during the debating contest.

216
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,995
During class, he makes our kids...

217
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:48,965
do many ridiculous things unrelated to college admission.

218
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,365
Shouldn't his priority be about helping the kids get into college?

219
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,605
He was scored low in the teacher evaluation.

220
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:55,775
Why was he assigned to Ivy Class?

221
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:56,904
Please switch him with someone else!

222
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:00,574
I'd like to request Mr. Park to resign.

224
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,595
Mr. Park.

225
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,865
Why are you cleaning?

226
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,674
You're only supposed to supervise.

227
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:30,105
Did you already hear about my new post?

228
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:37,015
Mr. Park.

229
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:39,985
Why are you letting them do this to you?

230
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,084
Are you worried about Se Ho?

231
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:45,824
Because of what he said?

232
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:51,865
I don't know why Se Ho is going this far,

233
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,934
but there's something that bothers me.

234
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,404
I failed to embrace him as his teacher.

235
00:14:58,135 --> 00:14:59,174
I also feel sorry for that.

236
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,375
As for our family,

237
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:03,645
my mom, sister, and I were all focused on raising In Ho,

238
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:06,544
but we still didn't know how he truly felt.

239
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,814
It's hard for parents to even figure out their own children.

240
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:13,584
But how do you expect to take care of all the kids you teach?

241
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,054
You're not a deity.

242
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,255
From what I remember,

243
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:22,765
you always tried your best to hear us out and help us.

244
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:26,194
If Se Ho asked you for help, you would never have ignored him.

245
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,365
Right? Aren't I correct?

246
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:35,404
Don't you think you should keep fighting back?

247
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:37,704
What's the use of wasting time by being concerned?

248
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:41,845
It'll only cause more students to follow the wrong path.

249
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:58,595
Se Ho.

250
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:01,465
I clearly recall telling you to call me by my position, Mr. Park.

251
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:04,135
No, I'm here to talk to my student,

252
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,434
Oh Se Ho.

253
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:08,944
Let me warn you.

254
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,204
Don't you ever call me your student again.

255
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,245
I'm sorry...

256
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:16,015
I couldn't embrace you a lot more back then.

257
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:17,985
- That's what you're here to say? - Back then,

258
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,084
you just seemed like a naive and kind kid.

259
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:25,294
So I wasn't able to see what kind of pain you were experiencing.

260
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:28,495
But at this point where it seems like you've exploded with anger,

261
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:32,034
I can finally see a little bit of the pain.

262
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:36,605
Se Ho, can you give me one more chance?

263
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,534
It may be a little late, but will you do that for me?

264
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:40,534
You should leave.

265
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,845
How is that going to change anything?

266
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:46,044
We can't undo what's already been done.

267
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:49,444
Are you regretting the choice you made in the past?

268
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:56,225
No.

269
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,125
- Never. - We can't change the past,

270
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,765
but we can change the future.

271
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:07,895
I'm sorry I couldn't be a good teacher to you in the past,

272
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:12,674
but I'm still going to try for a better future.

273
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:15,375
What you're doing right now is wrong.

274
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,845
And in order to fix that,

275
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,145
I'm going to continue to fight.

276
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,034
This is so frustrating.

277
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:43,865
I've never studied properly in my entire life.

278
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:45,175
How am I going to get better grades?

279
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:47,175
I never liked studying, but I did like coming to school.

280
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:48,544
Our school uniform is pretty.

281
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:50,804
Me too.

282
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,915
I was just starting to enjoy coming to school.

283
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:56,844
I don't want to get forced to transfer schools.

284
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:00,384
I hate it even more because it feels like we're being discriminated.

285
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:02,624
I know, right? They want us to leave just because we get bad grades.

286
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:05,324
- Isn't it so mean? - Exactly.

287
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:08,394
That's why we should study, you guys.

288
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:09,925
- Hey, let's go. - Bye.

289
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,525
Hey, wait for me.

290
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:15,405
Hey, Seung Woo. Get over here. Hey.

291
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:29,185
So here's the main point.

292
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:31,114
Utilitarianism aims for the greatest well-being...

293
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,054
of the greatest number of people.

294
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,394
Why don't you guys just transfer schools...

295
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:42,165
for the greatest well-being of the greatest number of people?

296
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:46,364
Okay, then. You may go home now.

297
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,235
Guys, let's study!

298
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,794
- What are you doing? Bok Su? - Be quiet.

299
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:20,165
- Get inside. - Why?

300
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:24,804
What was that? Gosh, darn it.

301
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,844
What a bunch of fools.

302
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:41,755
Move. Move.

303
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,965
- Hey, get out of there! - Run!

304
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:56,735
- Go! - Get out of there!

305
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:16,784
What's going on?

306
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:54,324
From this moment on, we will be holding...

307
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,695
a special lecture for all of you.

308
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:05,804
Breathe in. Breathe out.

309
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:10,445
- Breathe in. Breathe out. - Breathe in. Breathe out.

310
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:15,074
- Breathe in. Breathe out. - Breathe in. Breathe out.

311
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,114
Imagine engraving an English vocabulary...

312
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:19,114
to each one of your brain cells.

313
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,084
Breathe in. Breathe out.

314
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,884
- Breathe in. Breathe out. - Breathe in. Breathe out.

315
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:29,364
- Breathe in. Breathe out. - Breathe in. Breathe out.

316
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:33,034
To be honest, covering the corruption of a private school...

317
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,094
won't be able to bring about a huge issue.

318
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,405
You'll hear the same response from any reporter.

319
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,975
The school's rotting away,

320
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:42,644
and all you care about is whether it's going to be an issue or not?

321
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:44,975
Bye, then.

322
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:47,314
Sir, wait.

323
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:54,415
Chairman Oh, Mr. Park apparently just visited...

324
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,084
Reporter Choi.

325
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,195
Is his next stop going to be the education committee?

326
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:10,534
My gosh.

327
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,735
Hello, parents of Wildflower Class.

328
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,905
I'm Oh Se Ho, the chairman of Seolsong High School.

329
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,044
(Seolsong High School)

330
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:31,884
True equality is transferring the kids based on their aptitudes.

331
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:33,854
Seolsong High School is mainly focused on studying,

332
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,594
and judging Wildflower Class students with the same standard...

333
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:39,465
could come across to them as an act of discrimination.

334
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:41,195
If they're not apt for studying,

335
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,905
we should help them find another route.

336
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:46,235
Instead of forcing the kids to follow the standardized system,

337
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,804
I think it's right to show that there are other possibilities...

338
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:50,344
they could choose from.

339
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:51,505
Excuse me.

340
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:54,644
I'm going to send Jae Yoon to college no matter what.

341
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,344
I understand, ma'am. But it's better for the kids to transfer schools...

342
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:57,814
even if they wish to go to college.

343
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:01,515
Seolsong has the highest competition rate for school grades.

344
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:05,225
So if they transfer schools, they'll be able to get better grades.

345
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:12,534
But...

346
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:15,195
if my kid still wishes to go to this school,

347
00:23:15,864 --> 00:23:17,405
I would like to let him.

348
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:23,505
Please think about what would be the best choice for your kids.

349
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,544
Our kids are still very young.

350
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:30,084
Your wise decision...

351
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:32,854
will end up becoming the right investment for your kids' future.

352
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:37,725
If my son's okay with it...

353
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,255
- I need to send my kid to college. - Same here.

354
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:42,094
- Maybe I'll ask my kid. - It could be an opportunity.

355
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:43,695
- It doesn't sound too bad. - Right?

356
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:55,675
Goodness, I'm here.

357
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:02,044
Gosh, I'm so proud of you guys. You're studying so hard.

358
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:04,284
Mr. Park, this place is really weird.

359
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:06,015
I want to go home, Mr. Park.

360
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:07,915
Yes.

361
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:09,884
I know it's hard.

362
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:13,594
But you should at least show the adults...

363
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,525
that your will is stronger than their selfish decisions.

364
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,165
Regardless of what the result may be,

365
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:22,534
it'll still be meaningful if you try your best.

366
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:25,634
Plus, it'll leave behind a lot of great memories with your classmates.

367
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:30,104
Okay, then. In order to make this experience more meaningful,

368
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,775
I'll treat you guys to a course meal...

369
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:35,814
of jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.

370
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:39,114
Wait!

371
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:41,814
Don't order tangsuyuk. Just order jjajangmyeon.

372
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,784
- My gosh. - Seriously?

373
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,324
- What? - Can we order double servings?

374
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:53,957
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)

375
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,069
Hey, dumbheads.

376
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,539
You'll get recycled soon.

377
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,950
Studying won't make any difference.

378
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:07,579
Just start packing up.

379
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,889
Start emptying your lockers, okay?

380
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,590
Hey.

381
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:17,900
You'll put us in trouble. Don't do it.

382
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,729
Hey, Young Min. Did I say something wrong?

383
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,869
Don't try to use your dumb brains.

384
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:28,439
Just leave quietly.

385
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:41,619
Getting transferred because we have bad grades.

386
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,689
I really hate that.

387
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,990
I'm sick of them looking down on us.

388
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,500
It's good.

389
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,499
Right.

390
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,309
Even if you're not good at studying, you're still my son.

391
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,949
Son.

392
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,680
Don't you want to transfer schools?

393
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,690
It doesn't sound like a bad suggestion.

394
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,719
They say you can go to college.

395
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,589
What? Transfer?

396
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,259
- Mom. - Yes?

397
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,600
I just started liking this school.

398
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,369
Also, if I transfer schools, I won't have any friends.

399
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:36,469
Right.

400
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,279
Okay. Eat up.

401
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,979
Transfer. You can learn skills and it's nice.

402
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,520
You'll take over and run my shop later anyway.

403
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,419
Learn skin care...

404
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,889
and makeup skills...

405
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,050
- from the basics... - No.

406
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:53,190
My friends are all here.

407
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:55,790
Friends aren't important.

408
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,790
Why can't you think?

409
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,930
My goodness.

410
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,200
Hello.

411
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,909
Why are you trying to make me transfer schools?

412
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,270
Should I let you do what you want then?

413
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,779
Listen to me.

414
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:15,110
The chairman is right about everything.

415
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,150
No.

416
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,550
What will you do with a high school diploma?

417
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:20,819
Just transfer.

418
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:23,319
My friends are all here. And I have memories here.

419
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,559
Just because of bad grades, you can't ruin my school days.

420
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:29,890
This tastes terrible.

421
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,599
Bulgogi burgers at my school is much better.

422
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,529
Don't eat it then.

423
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,230
Give me that. A takeout box, please!

424
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't! Don't you dare take another bite.

425
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,069
- My mom told me to transfer. - Same here.

426
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:46,710
Listening to her made me want to study.

427
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,409
But can we really do it?

428
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,110
Why can't you?

429
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,249
Why not? Let's show them.

430
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,119
How about it?

431
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,490
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

432
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:12,339
Okay. Today we'll learn about tense.

433
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,969
Sir.

434
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:15,069
What is tense?

435
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,039
Tense is...

436
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,010
like past, present, and future.

437
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,050
What's the most important is...

438
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,779
that you know the be verbs.

439
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,450
What are be verbs?

440
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,420
Be verbs are...

441
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,230
Right. It's okay not to know that.

442
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,430
I am happy.

443
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,039
I am sleepy.

444
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,210
I am a son.

445
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:51,210
(Understanding tense)

446
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,849
Let's learn...

447
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,680
the most basic be verbs.

448
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:58,520
Will you try it first, Bok Su?

449
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:03,249
This is hard.

450
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,589
"I am happy."

451
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,189
I am happy.

452
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:10,230
He's cool.

453
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,529
"I am sleepy."

454
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:15,630
I am sleepy.

455
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:19,270
"I am a son."

456
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,940
I am the sun.

457
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
Hey, old man.

458
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,510
You're pretty good.

459
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,679
Sir. So what are be verbs?

460
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,190
Okay, next question.

461
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,859
Give me examples of passive suffix in Korean.

462
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:40,289
I explained it to you a minute ago.

463
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,789
Answer!

464
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,029
Ee, Hee...

465
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:50,099
Answer!

466
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:51,539
Ee, Hee, Lee...

467
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,669
- Kee. - Correct!

468
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:01,710
Ee, Hee, Lee, Kee.

469
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,950
That's cheating.

470
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,919
I got the most of it. Next.

471
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,150
Okay, here we go.

472
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,159
What are the three Korean honorifics?

473
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,260
Answer!

474
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,529
Object honorific, subject honorific...

475
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,669
Relative honorific?

476
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,330
Correct!

477
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,299
Next question.

478
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,510
What are the examples of object honorific?

479
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,810
Support, receive, inquire, eat.

480
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,039
- Wrong! - Why?

481
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,779
Support, receive, inquire, meet.

482
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,380
Correct!

483
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:46,789
That's so scary.

484
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:49,060
- That scared me. - Sorry.

485
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,890
Ms. Son. Goodness.

486
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,330
My heart is racing.

(Standing Committee on Education)

490
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:25,359
I know Chairman Lim of Seolsong High School very well.

491
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:27,799
You're mistaken about a lot of things.

492
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,229
She wouldn't commit such corruption like these.

493
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,799
These are actually happening in school.

494
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,239
Ranking students by their grades is discrimination,

495
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:40,010
and that only makes them have...

496
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,580
a sense of inferiority and deprivation.

497
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,049
The society...

498
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,380
already works based on discrimination.

499
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,950
Because that's efficient.

500
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,250
You should...

501
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,760
teach students reality.

502
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,589
Should a school be like that too?

503
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,359
How can a member of an education committee...

504
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,560
think of education as something to be efficient?

505
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,359
Students aren't machines.

506
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,830
You're wasting my time and out of your mind.

507
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,539
Well...

508
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,289
Wildflowers, let's call it a day.

509
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:23,520
Good job. Go home now.

510
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,989
- Yes. - Nice.

511
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:32,159
Let's go. I'll take you home.

512
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,479
Bye now.

513
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,650
Hey, Soo Jeong.

514
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,650
Yes?

515
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,219
Are you okay with being in debt?

516
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:56,849
I'm not.

517
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,989
In debt? What debt?

518
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Well, you slept over at my place...

519
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,500
Here...

520
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,940
Here... You...

521
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:18,739
You know? Here... I can sleep over at my girlfriend's...

522
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,080
One night...

523
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:26,250
Sleep over then.

524
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,459
Soo Jeong sure is a modern woman.

525
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:35,650
Don't be a coward.

526
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,490
I won't do anything aside from holding your hand.

527
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,520
What?

528
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,890
Okay, then.

529
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,409
Hey, Bok Su.

530
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:55,550
Are you sleeping?

531
00:35:59,249 --> 00:36:00,550
Are you really sleeping?

532
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,960
How can you sleep in a situation like this?

533
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,529
Are we really going to just hold hands all night?

534
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,639
I must've been crazy.

535
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,609
Why did I teach him what a platonic relationship is?

536
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,170
I turned him into someone too good.

Patience strengthens the soul.

538

00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:40,190
Hey, Soo Jeong.

541
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,369
I was really going to hold it in,

542
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,340
but I can't because of you.

I'll have to fight against injustice.

557

but what if the media catches on?

562
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,600
I think they're keeping an eye on us...

563

in a substantial way.

580
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:47,050
to contribute a sufficient amount of money.

581

721
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
I see.

722
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,990
Then how are you going to explain this?

723
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,000
This situation had nothing to do with the test.

724
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,869
Then what were you doing?

725
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,510
Can you prove to us what that document is?

726
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:17,050
And I'm also doubting that you might've given...

727
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,050
private lectures to the kids in Wildflower Class after school.

728
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,159
We found signs of someone having opened the safe...

729
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:27,889
that contained the test questions on the day you met up with Bok Su.

730
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,230
The only ones who know the passcode to the safe is the principal...

731
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:35,429
and Mr. Park, the teaching director.

732
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:44,879
I swear on my life that I never did such a thing.

733
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,250
There's no need to bet your life on this.

734
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,980
You can tell the rest of the story to the disciplinary committee.

735
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,550
And Bok Su will be expelled since he's involved in this case.

736
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:56,090
Se Ho, you're crazy.

737
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,189
Do you think you're making any kind of sense right now?

738
00:49:58,189 --> 00:49:59,590
How could you do this to Mr. Park?

739
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:11,800
That means we won't be able to reveal what that document was.

740
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,010
Mr. Park, we can't let Bok Su get expelled like this.

741
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:16,780
We did nothing wrong, so let's just...

742
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,010
Due to this incident,

743
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,820
Bok Su will get misunderstood by a lot of people once again.

744
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,350
It won't be easy to uncover the truth,

745
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,659
but I can't let Bok Su get hurt again.

746
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,189
Then what are we going to do?

747
00:50:33,189 --> 00:50:34,359
It's all my fault.

748
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:37,560
I'll try to take care of this.

749
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:39,429
Mr. Park.

750
00:50:56,149 --> 00:50:57,750
I knew you'd come.

751
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,119
But I don't know if you're here to scold me or ask me for a favor.

752
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:05,060
Maybe it's both.

753
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,760
I'll take responsibility for everything and leave.

754
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,600
So please leave Bok Su alone.

755
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,899
What a tearful sacrifice.

756
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,969
You're upsetting me by taking Bok Su's side until the very end.

757
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:16,770
Se Ho, you shouldn't be...

758
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,240
like this to Bok Su.

759
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,270
Bok Su did nothing wrong.

760
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,209
(Letter of resignation)

761
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:26,409
Just finish writing this.

762
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,550
I'm sick of hearing you defend him.

763
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,119
(Letter of resignation)

764
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,830
(Letter of resignation, Park Dong Jun)

765
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,699
Se Ho.

766
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:55,040
Tormenting others...

767
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:58,980
won't make your pain disappear.

768
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:00,649
It'll only make it worse.

769
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:10,260
Just scold me! I know that's what you want to do!

770
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,260
Stop pretending like you're a good person and teacher.

771
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,590
I know you're angry!

772
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm tormenting both you and your precious student,

773
00:52:18,899 --> 00:52:20,429
Kang Bok Su.

774
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,240
How can I scold you...

775
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,439
when I know you were hurt as well?

776
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,639
Are you talking about how I fell off the rooftop?

777
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,980
I've recovered from that a long time ago.

778
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,109
No.

779
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:36,780
It doesn't seem like you've healed completely.

780
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,219
Se Ho.

781
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:48,230
I'm really sorry...

782
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:51,000
that I couldn't help you.

783
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:37,909
I can't believe this is happening.

784
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,179
I know, right? The school is starting to get really scary.

785
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,659
Why did you have to do that kind of stuff?

786
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,230
Goodness.

787
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,659
I want you to announce to all the students...

788
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:00,230
that this week's test results will be considered invalid.

789
00:54:00,899 --> 00:54:03,800
And make sure rumors don't spread.

790
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:08,240
Hurry up and get to class!

791
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,040
Think about how frustrated Ivy Class students must be.

792
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,300
Hey.

793
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,369
What's wrong?

794
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:49,780
What's going on?

795
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:14,929
Mr. Park.

796
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,270
Mr. Park.

797
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Mr. Park.

798
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,209
Give me this.

799
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,109
- Give it to me. - No.

800
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:28,550
Give it to me!

801
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,260
How can this happen?

802
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:51,169
This is all because of me. I'm just going to quit.

803
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,939
I'm okay, so...

804
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,639
I'm not okay, sir!

805
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,040
No.

806
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,080
Let go.

807
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,850
- No. - Let me go, sir!

808
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,949
If something goes wrong again...

809
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:14,590
If I can't protect you this time...

810
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,300
I can't...

811
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,570
I can't stand that.

812
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,770
I don't think...

813
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,340
I'll be able to get back on my feet.

814
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,350
Bok Su.

815
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:46,189
You must graduate this time.

816
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,230
Please.

817
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:29,460
