1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,861
School...

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,355
is not your private possession.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,307
You're being questioned for embezzling tax money...

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,768
and using it to build a privately owned school.

5
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,290
Do you want to explain yourself?

6
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:26,860
That is not true.

7
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,681
It's all fabricated conspiracy.

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,638
Kang Bok Su who raised this suspicion was...

9
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,908
the assailant of school violence...

10
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,938
who almost killed my son nine years ago.

11
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,178
He was expelled from school so he's defaming me...

12
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,860
as revenge.

13
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,823
Kang Bok Su...

14
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:07,284
Nine years ago, I was a witness of the case.

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,849
Recently I heard...

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,569
the victim admit that he jumped off at his will.

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,919
Bok Su would never do such a thing.

18
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,689
Ms. Son Soo Jeong,

19
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,407
aren't you in a relationship with Kang Bok Su?

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,468
Why should we believe your statement,

21
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,498
when you are having an immoral relationship...

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,354
with a student?

23
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,829
Yes, that's right.

24
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,305
I...

25
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,277
love Bok Su.

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,057
Nine years ago,

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,613
Bok Su had to leave school even though he was innocent.

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,986
Still, he returned to school, uncovered...

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,339
this rotten school's corruption...

30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,985
and let the world know about it.

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,352
Though I've done...

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,901
something shameful,

33
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,502
but my love for Bok Su is...

34
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,932
something I'm proud of.

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,879
(Foreign Bank Account Activities, Confidential)

36
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,123
Please give that to Bok Su.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,586
He probably won't take it if I gave it to him.

38
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,800
- You must give it to... - No.

39
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,495
You give it to him yourself.

40
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:53,685
You must. Don't run away anymore, okay?

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,539
You jerk. How dare you come in here?

42
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,078
Get out. Get out.

43
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,494
No, don't use violence.

44
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,699
Who knows how he'll frame you?

45
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:25,982
Hey, don't you dare touch our CEO.

46
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,188
I came here because I have a request for Bok Su.

47
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,959
I'm the CEO, and we won't take your request.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,040
Get lost.

49
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,140
Se Ho,

50
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,310
follow me.

51
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,689
(Episode 29)

52
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,501
Hey, why would you come here?

53
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:51,221
Did you come to ask for my favor?

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,904
I'm sorry. But if you're going to ask me to stop...

55
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,340
attacking you, your mom, and the school, I can't help you.

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,962
It's not a favor I'm here for.

57
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,012
No, maybe it is.

58
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,569
When I lived with my uncle in the United States,

59
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,296
I found out that my mom was swindling money under his name.

60
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,137
With that, she won't be able to shift responsibility to others.

61
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,091
Why are you giving this to me?

62
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,996
Can't you reveal it yourself?

63
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,364
I don't have the right.

64
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,648
I have enough evidence for the hearing even without this.

65
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,771
Also, how can I trust you?

66
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,184
- Bok Su. - This could be another trap.

67
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,759
You can trust me this time.

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,517
How can I trust a jerk like you?

69
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,647
How can you even say that to me?

70
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,588
Don't you know what you did to me?

71
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,156
Like you said, I'm trying not to run away.

72
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:56,896
I'm bringing up the courage for the first time...

73
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,890
to live properly.

74
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,129
Is it true that you fell victim...

75
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,341
to Kang Bok Su?

76
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,381
Yes. I'm the victim...

77
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,893
of Kang Bok Su's incident...

78
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,190
from nine years ago.

79
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:36,513
Also, I finally get to reveal the truth today.

80
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,813
I'm not the victim but rather the assailant.

81
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,573
- He's the assailant? - He's not the victim?

82
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,246
Nine years ago,

83
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,368
Kang Bok Su was expelled from the school...

84
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:55,652
for being mistaken to have pushed me.

85
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,521
But I fell from the roof...

86
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,382
on my own.

87
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,869
Then how did people come to misunderstand him?

88
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,197
Because I lied...

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,494
and said that he pushed me.

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,514
Why did you say such a lie?

91
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,249
I don't think the reason is important.

92
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,055
No matter what reason, my action can't be justified.

93
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,211
What's important...

94
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,999
is that Kang Bok Su was expelled...

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,494
nine years ago because of my lie. Even now,

96
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,092
he's troubled by numerous rumors and misunderstandings.

97
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,891
I know it's late,

98
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,780
but since I'm revealing the truth, I hope the truth...

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,000
will reach as many people.

100
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,606
I'd appreciate your help, everyone.

101
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,569
I sincerely apologize to Kang Bok Su...

102
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,719
who had to suffer...

103
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,890
because of my lie.

104
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,723
I returned to school...

105
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,361
to take my revenge.

106
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,947
However, that revenge isn't against...

107
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,786
specific individuals like Board Chairman Lim Se Gyeong...

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,956
and Board Chairman Oh Se Ho who kicked me out...

109
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,374
from the school.

110
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,569
Just like how the school trampled over me in the past...

111
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,538
with lies and power.

112
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,038
The kids of Seolsong High School now are attending a wrongful school...

113
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,038
where they're discriminated...

114
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,757
and are used as a means of making money.

115
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,530
They're losing their hopes and dreams.

116
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,641
For as long as Chairwoman Lim Se Gyeong is at the school,

117
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,080
victims like myself and other Seolsong High School students...

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,704
will continue to emerge.

119
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,100
Students should never have to...

120
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,126
fall victim and suffer again. Transforming this school...

121
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:02,839
is...

122
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,907
the true revenge I must take.

123
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,249
That Mr. Park.

124
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,478
I told him to go to the country and just farm.

125
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,066
How did he go there?

126
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,584
Gosh, I have a headache.

127
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,958
Is Ms. Son crazy?

128
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,817
Why did she get involved? Isn't she ashamed in front of her kids?

129
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,777
I think she might be planning to quit.

130
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,282
She looks determined.

131
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,097
Bok Su is still so cool.

132
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,864
He hasn't changed at all. He's still the same.

133
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,838
What's so cool about him?

134
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,466
The school is a mess thanks to him.

135
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,077
It's not Bok Su who made this school a mess.

136
00:08:56,979 --> 00:09:00,727
The truth about this school got to see the light of day.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,907
We should admit what's true.

138
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,248
I dedicated all my life to education.

139
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,858
How can my passion and sincerity be taken this way?

140
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,748
It was brutally condemned.

141
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,781
I'm very...

142
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,232
upset and heartbroken.

143
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,255
I'm going to fight until the end.

144
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,020
I'll be sure...

145
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,001
to reveal the truth.

146
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,431
It's Kang Bok Su!

147
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,512
- Watch it. - Stay behind the line.

148
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,277
Please say a few words.

149
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:42,299
Did you know that ex-Chairman Oh Se Ho...

150
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,999
confessed that he was the assailant of your case from nine years ago?

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,028
What?

152
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,169
He said it wasn't you who pushed.

153
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,199
He apologized and said that he jumped on his own.

154
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,452
How do you feel?

155
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,386
That's good.

156
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,263
Mr. Park, how can you do this?

157
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,208
You gave me goosebumps earlier.

158
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,809
It was the big plan Mr. Park had in mind.

159
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,335
Guys, it's too early for you to be surprised.

160
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,179
What's this? Did you know about it?

161
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,239
And you didn't report it to the CEO?

162
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,449
All right, all right. Let's all raise our glasses.

163
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,519
Who should say a few words?

164
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,559
Mr. Park returned, so he should do it.

165
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,954
No, no. Today's hero is Bok Su.

166
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,319
I don't care who does it. Let's hurry up and drink.

167
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,899
If Mr. Park says a few words, I will too.

168
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,899
Okay.

169
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,909
Then, for the prosperity of Sojeonggak.

170
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,008
Hey, hey, hey. Do something else.

171
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,939
It's a special day.

172
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,378
Please make a comment...

173
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,966
that's honest and selfish.

174
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,204
Is that so? Then...

175
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,182
Then for the second life of Park Dong Jun...

176
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,971
Cheers.

177
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:22,306
Cheers!

178
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,358
Cheers.

179
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,844
- Cheers. - Cheers.

180
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,444
What was that?

181
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,525
Okay, Bok Su is next.

182
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,884
All of you went through so much trouble because of me.

183
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,092
My family,

184
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,400
my friends,

185
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,330
Mr. Park,

186
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:53,872
and my girlfriend.

187
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,757
From now, let's...

188
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:03,452
all be happy.

189
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,038
Good. Everyone, let's be happy.

190
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,809
- Let's be happy. - Let's be happy.

191
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,263
- Let's be happy. - Let's be happy.

192
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,310
Assemblyman, I'm so disappointed.

193
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,023
If you took that much money, you should be able to resolve this!

194
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:24,988
I don't care whether the private school law revision...

195
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,228
becomes more controversial or not.

196
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,380
Do something about my sentence first!

197
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,992
Who is Bok Su to you...

198
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,126
for you to do this to me?

199
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,388
He's the first person who treated me warmly.

200
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:52,233
You lunatic.

201
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,519
That's your reason?

202
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,934
When you told me...

203
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,685
to say that Bok Su pushed me from the roof,

204
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,574
I shouldn't have done it.

205
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,315
Bok Su is the one...

206
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,088
who pushed you from the rooftop, right?

207
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,248
I should've told you that you were the reason I wanted to die.

208
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,572
And I utterly regret not saying that back then.

209
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,361
Like you said,

210
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:28,289
I was like a whining puppy that wanted to be loved.

211
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,501
And I told myself that it was because of Bok Su.

212
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:32,717
I told myself that Bok Su was the reason I wanted to die...

213
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,453
and ended up torturing an innocent person.

214
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,793
All along, the person I was supposed to loathe and hate...

215
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:42,441
was you.

216
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:43,911
Then get out...

217
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,690
of my house right now.

218
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Okay.

219
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,083
Just like how you don't think of me as your son,

220
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:54,761
I'll no longer...

221
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,192
think of you as my mom.

222
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,161
I'm going to close down...

223
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,574
Seolsong High School.

224
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,794
Hey, you'll get yourself arrested.

225
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,639
Gosh, every time I felt frustrated,

226
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,039
I used to come here and shout like this.

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,120
No one comes up here.

228
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,349
On top of that,

229
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,549
today is the day a huge knot finally came undone...

230
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,924
deep down in my heart.

231
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,464
I'm relieved.

232
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,323
It's still late, but we still managed to set things straight.

233
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,326
By the way, what do you think is going through Se Ho's mind?

234
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,660
He probably regretted what he did for the past nine years...

235
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:47,245
just like I did.

236
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,898
I personally think Lim Se Gyeong was the one who ruined him.

237
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,738
Gosh, I really can't believe...

238
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,759
she's a mother and a chairwoman of a school foundation.

239
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:57,559
She really deserves to be punished.

240
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,389
Bok Su.

241
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,444
You were really incredible today.

242
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,032
Good job.

243
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,846
Come on. You're the one who did a great job.

244
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,782
And among everything, this is what you did best.

245
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,498
"Yes, that's right. I love Bok Su."

246
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,318
Do you want to die? Don't mimic me.

247
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,219
Soo Jeong.

248
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,119
Yes?

249
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,762
I...

250
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:37,890
love you too.

251
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,030
I know.

252
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,375
I can tell just by looking into your eyes.

253
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,029
Regardless of what happens tomorrow, I want you to hang in there.

254
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,529
You really did the right thing.

255
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,328
And I'm very proud of you.

256
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
Bok Su.

257
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,205
You helped me find my dream.

258
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,263
So this time, let's find yours.

259
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:11,648
My dream was to become Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

260
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,137
Well, that already came true.

261
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,413
Okay, sure.

262
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,814
Honey, look at this.

263
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,929
Seolsong High School created a 30-million-dollar slush fund?

264
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,139
Seolsong High School has caused an issue for having committed...

265
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,089
the worst kind of private school corruption ever.

266
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,608
During the Education Committee hearing that was held...

267
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,498
due to Kang Bok Su's accusation of the school,

268
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,309
it was disclosed that the 30-million-dollar slush fund...

269
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,378
was going to be used for the establishment of Seolsong University.

270
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,966
And it has caused a huge controversy.

271
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,649
It turns out that the main culprit was Chairwoman Lim Se Gyeong.

272
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,149
And starting from today, she'll get summoned...

273
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,675
by the prosecution for further investigation.

274
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,488
Chairwoman Lim is suspected of having siphoned...

275
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,228
Seolsong High School's slush fund using a foreign bank account...

276
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,563
and having taken over land for the establishment of Seolsong University.

277
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,529
The actual owner of the site...

278
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,368
is Nicholas Lim. His Korean name is Lim Tae Hoon.

279
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,471
And it turns out he is Chairwoman Lim's younger brother.

281
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,079
This is the prosecution. Please step back.

282
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,510
We're from the prosecution.

283
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,316
And here's our confiscation warrant.

284
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:39,550
Let's begin.

285
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,488
We're from the prosecution.

286
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,479
Please stop what you're doing right now.

287
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,624
The chairwoman's gone,

288
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,322
and so is the principal.

289
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,199
Does that make me the person in charge person here?

290
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,599
Mr. Park.

291
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,283
There's no need to be disturbed.

292
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,529
I'm here as a citizen legislature...

293
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,269
and an auditor of the Education Committee.

294
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,238
From now on, I'll be in charge...

295
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,462
of managing everything that happens in Seolsong High School.

296
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,750
What?

297
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,208
My goodness, I knew...

298
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,879
I knew that he'd be capable of doing something like this.

299
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,818
I knew he'd become someone of great authority.

300
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,689
My goodness, welcome.

301
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,988
It's really nice to see you again.

302
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,039
You looked really nice on the screen.

303
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,504
Here he comes.

304
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,629
- Kang Bok Su! - Kang Bok Su!

305
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,899
- Kang Bok Su! - Kang Bok Su!

306
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,303
- Kang Bok Su! - Kang Bok Su!

307
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,524
What a joke.

308
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,949
What's going on? What are you doing?

309
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,679
You've become so famous. Let us boast a little.

310
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,335
Look over here.

311
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,465
Hey, stand in line.

312
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:09,136
Hey, get out of the way.

313
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,689
Is everything true about Ms. Son?

314
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,589
What she said at the hearing yesterday isn't true, right?

315
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,988
Ever since I saw the interview of the whistleblower,

316
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:16,728
I kind of had a feeling that it might be her.

317
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,429
If she already confessed everything, won't that get her fired?

318
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,823
How are we supposed to see her now?

319
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,738
Everyone, there's going to be an announcement.

320
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:29,468
Please turn on the TV in your classrooms.

321
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:30,692
- Hurry. - Turn on the TV.

322
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,802
(Seolsong High School)

323
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,048
Hello, everyone.

324
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,964
My name is Park Dong Joon, and I'm here as a citizen legislature...

325
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,311
and an auditor of the Education Committee.

326
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,468
Students of Seolsong High School.

327
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:58,944
I'm aware that you all feel very anxious due to that many things...

328
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:02,738
that have been happening in and out of the school.

329
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,879
Stagnant water that doesn't flow...

330
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,079
may seem clean on the outside.

331
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,718
But deep down inside, there are many pollutants.

332
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,248
Mr. Park looks great on the screen. He looks younger now.

333
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:15,340
- Gosh, let me listen. - Okay.

334
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,818
If we take out all the water to clean the inside,

335
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,485
it may cause a temporary mess.

336
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,757
But if we don't do that because we're scared of the mess,

337
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,503
we'll never be able to have clean water.

338
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,772
And that's exactly what's happening...

339
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,425
at Seolsong High School right now.

340
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,735
So I'd like all of you to stay calm...

341
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,461
and don't get swayed by what's happening.

342
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:43,649
Instead, be mischievous, have fun,

343
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,748
skip classes, and study hard.

344
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:49,386
I want all of you to behave like you normally would.

345
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,458
Seolsong High School, we can do this!

346
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,147
- We can do this! - We can do this!

347
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,617
He indeed does look good on the screen.

348
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,760
Hey, you guys.

349
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,248
Remember when we introduced ourselves to each other last time?

350
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,693
Today, I'd like to introduce myself to all of you.

351
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:10,779
I'm...

352
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:13,281
a corrupt teacher.

353
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,335
I never thought I'd introduce myself like this.

354
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,894
I had no dream.

355
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,297
All I did was study.

356
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,254
But a friend of mine found me a dream of being a teacher.

357
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,056
I shouldn't have done what I did for that friend's sake.

358
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,809
But because I wanted to be a real teacher...

359
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,428
No, because I wanted a permanent teaching position,

360
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,382
I gave them money.

361
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:45,068
And now, to take the responsibility...

362
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:46,756
for the shameful thing I did,

363
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,533
I'm going to quit teaching.

364
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,159
Guys, you raised the class average to 50 points.

365
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,745
You know you're amazing, right?

366
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,849
You gave me courage.

367
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,690
You taught me that anything is possible with effort.

368
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,814
So do it.

369
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,867
Just do what you're doing now.

370
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:23,929
I'll be leaving school,

371
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,629
but let's remember this one thing.

372
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,653
You are all flowers.

373
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,192
Whether you bloom in a mountain or in a field, you're flowers.

374
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:38,044
Like spiraea prunifolia and ixeris stolonifera.

375
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,077
Even without names, you're flowers.

376
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,536
Whether you bloom early or late, you're still flowers.

377
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:49,037
Whether you bloom during the day or night, you're flowers.

378
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:57,577
You'll have many days of frustration in your lives.

379
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,388
Please remember this every time you do.

380
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,632
You are...

381
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,063
all flowers.

382
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,135
Even if you get stepped on,

383
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,940
you'll bloom.

384
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,269
You're wildflowers.

385
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,907
Ms. Son. You aren't the only one living in this world.

386
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,079
When you work, sometimes you get displeased...

387
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,778
with things.

388
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:38,344
But you make compromises and bare with them.

389
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,419
Did you have to go and... Gosh.

390
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,919
Is it because she's young?

391
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,458
We have a conscience too.

392
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:48,287
We all knew it too, but for the organization,

393
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,683
for the whole rather than for an individual...

394
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,129
Let me give you advice about life.

395
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,997
If you live like that, you're going to break.

396
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:02,268
Don't you know that individuals make up the whole?

397
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,978
"Make compromises."

398
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,308
"Shut your mouth and live quietly."

399
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,098
"It might pass if you look the other way."

400
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,700
Will you teach that to the kids too?

401
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,748
If I have to be that kind of a teacher,

402
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,204
I'd rather break.

403
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,346
You can live your lives bent like that forever.

404
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,558
Bent and crooked.

405
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,074
Terribly lousy lives.

406
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,410
Goodness.

407
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:35,542
(Counseling Room)

408
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,629
You don't have to mention it.

409
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,119
(Dear Ms. Son, thanks to you, I found my career path.)

410
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,146
You went through so much.

411
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:24,686
I did go through so much.

412
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,905
I think that's why...

413
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,600
my time here will be very memorable for a long time.

414
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,157
Have you thought about what you'll do now?

415
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,129
I've been counseling students with their career paths.

416
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,208
But what should I do with my career?

417
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,909
Will you be my career counselor?

418
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,839
You're an adult.

419
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,021
You should take care of yourself.

420
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,879
I'm unemployed. I need compliments and encouragements.

421
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,379
So what if you're unemployed.

422
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,875
You're number one in your life.

423
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,171
You're right.

424
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,783
I used to be the top student in school.

425
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,055
Everything will be fine.

426
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,719
What are you doing? Are you seeing me out?

427
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,868
Let's say we're encouraging an unemployed.

428
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,245
I'm jealous because you don't have to come to school tomorrow.

429
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,847
Do you want to pack up and leave too then?

430
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,219
We'll help you pack.

431
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,485
Ms. Son, what will you do?

432
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,800
Can you date Bok Su out in the open now?

433
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,283
I envy you.

434
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:21,327
You can come to me when you break up with Bok Su.

435
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,580
I'll date you.

436
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,401
Seung Woo, I'm not interested in younger guys.

437
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:30,901
Don't go to Han River when you're having a hard time.

438
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,589
Hey, I want to live a long life.

439
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,149
There are so many delicious dishes in the world.

440
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,788
I can't die until I try every dish.

441
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:37,799
I won't.

442
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,500
- Aunt. - Hey.

443
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:43,317
You know Ms. Son is my aunt, right?

444
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,840
I'll see you at home.

445
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,082
Let's go, Soo Jeong.

446
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,411
We're in school.

447
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,155
Hey, they all know.

448
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,120
Let's go.

449
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:08,799
Ms. Son.

450
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,048
- You're a flower too! - You're a flower too!

451
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:18,337
(Ms. Son Soo Jeong)

452
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,993
(Episode 30 will air shortly.)

453
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,398
I'm sure everyone knows...

454
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,741
that there are people who became teachers...

455
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,186
through unlawful means.

456
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,425
You must feel ashamed to tell the kids...

457
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,206
to study hard and tell them, "If you study hard,"

458
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,964
"you can achieve your dreams."

459
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:32,139
I'd like you...

460
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,308
to return the positions to those...

461
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:37,369
who have achieved their dream of being a teacher...

462
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,341
through fair and just competition.

463
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:44,187
Please submit your resignation letters quietly.

464
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:56,710
All right.

465
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,278
Then I'll leave it up to your conscience.

466
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,828
Are you saying...

467
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,142
the former Board Chairman, Oh Se Ho,

468
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,402
He led this business from the United States?

469
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:10,457
Yes, that's right.

470
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,871
As you can see from the video of the parent that was released,

471
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,958
he became more enthusiastic about the business...

472
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,321
after he returned.

473
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:18,681
All of the corruptions.

474
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,304
Isn't he your son?

475
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,508
Are you reporting him yourself?

476
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,591
Don't you think if a child is going...

477
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,778
in the wrong direction, then the parent...

478
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,669
must set them straight?

479
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,143
Didn't you summon me...

480
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,222
as a testifier for the suspect?

481
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,028
Lim Se Gyeong pointed you out as the person...

482
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,483
directly involved with the corruption.

483
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,652
I'm not even surprised.

484
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:54,431
We were suspicious of you from the start too.

485
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,001
It's rare for a son to not know about a mother's business.

486
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,149
After all, aren't private school corruptions a family business?

487
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,948
I don't intend on pleading.

488
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,262
Do you admit to it?

489
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,304
I'll remain silent.

490
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,350
I guess you know you're at a disadvantage?

491
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,323
But choosing to stay silent might not be the best idea.

492
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,668
Do you have nothing to say about the video of you...

493
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:19,347
meeting the head of the school management committee?

494
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,150
Why did you meet her?

495
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,336
What's this? Where did everyone go?

496
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:38,503
Ta-da!

497
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,894
You worked so hard until now.

498
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,152
This is to celebrate your new start.

499
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:54,752
We prepared it for you.

500
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,362
Thank you.

501
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,679
I'm really unemployed now.

502
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,295
How will you make a living?

503
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,288
How about becoming Your Request's intern?

504
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,612
The company is too puny to have an intern.

505
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:18,628
Manager Kang, why are you being so negative?

506
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:22,194
At this rate, I could fire you and hire her instead.

507
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,046
Will you do that?

508
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,553
You know that I'm talented in diverse areas, right?

509
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,344
Yes, of course, I do.

510
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,025
Get it together.

511
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,179
You should get it together too and find yourself a new job.

512
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,439
I'm going to find a part-time job for now...

513
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,176
and think about what I can do.

514
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,408
Someone has yet to help me find a dream.

515
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,287
I think I found your dream.

516
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,058
What? What do you think I should do?

517
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,655
It's a life-long job where you don't have to worry about retirement.

518
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,299
It provides food, housing, insurance,

519
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,538
and pension. There's no need to worry about retirement.

520
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:03,822
It's the best job there is.

521
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,382
My wife.

522
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,790
Hey.

523
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,405
- Hey. - Wait, wait.

524
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,833
Hold on, I have a cake.

525
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,531
I seriously almost dropped it.

526
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,830
- Be careful. - How annoying.

527
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,277
Don't kick me. I really almost dropped it.

528
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,000
Stop it.

529
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,756
Grandma.

530
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,348
My granddaughter is here.

531
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:48,279
Grandma, I'm unemployed now.

532
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,780
I can come and see you every day.

533
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,372
I feel better now.

534
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,539
I feel like I can really start over from the beginning.

535
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,039
Whatever it is.

536
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,722
How pretty.

537
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:17,040
My sister is so pretty.

538
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,963
Thank you.

539
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:23,278
You're the only one in this world who says...

540
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:26,785
I'm pretty no matter what, so you should live long.

541
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,476
Why? Doesn't no one else say that you're pretty?

542
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,830
You're right. I have one more person.

543
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,624
You're so smart, Grandma.

544
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,521
- Grandma. - Yes?

545
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,602
I'm going to live really hard.

546
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,209
I'll stay beside you for a really long time.

547
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,229
Okay.

548
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,948
(Sojeonggak is hiring a helper.)

549
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,399
(Sojeonggak)

550
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,058
- What? What? - What is it?

551
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:54,755
What happened?

552
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,131
It's nothing.

553
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,434
("Former Board Chairman Oh Se Ho Remains Silent at Accusations")

554
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:36,878
I didn't think you'd want to see me. What is it?

555
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,131
You...

556
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,678
How did you end up getting linked to your mother's case?

557
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,006
I know about the documents,

558
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:46,377
and you never did anything directly.

559
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,728
This has nothing to do with you.

560
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,749
I'm doing this because I owe you.

561
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,057
Why are you staying silent?

562
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,684
Just tell them the truth.

563
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,179
That's it.

564
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,939
You don't know, Bok Su.

565
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,626
Is the reason you can't tell the truth nine years ago...

566
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,194
and even now...

567
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,231
because of your mom?

568
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,059
You think I don't know you? It's true, I don't.

569
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,459
I don't know why...

570
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,409
you're still living foolishly the way your mom makes you.

571
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:21,658
Aren't you upset?

572
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:22,669
Your mom...

573
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:27,510
Seriously.

574
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,291
- Bok Su... - Whatever the reason,

575
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,094
if you lie again,

576
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,666
you'll really regret it.

577
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,468
I thought you wanted to live differently this time.

578
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,155
Wake up, Bok Su.

579
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,773
Just let him be.

580
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,428
I requested to close down Seolsong High School.

581
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,291
What did you say?

582
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,706
What's wrong? It's not like I can hand it down to you.

583
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:14,849
It won't be that easy to close down.

584
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,749
All I need is the approval from the Education Office.

585
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,019
I handed out so much money so far.

586
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,089
Do you think they won't do that much?

587
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,009
If you close it down, what about the kids?

588
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:23,601
Who cares?

589
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,707
They'll transfer.

590
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:27,713
You're really...

591
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:30,728
I'll do whatever I please with what's mine.

592
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:32,781
If you don't like that,

593
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,228
then you can be responsible for everything.

594
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,521
(You Can Do It Award)

595
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,564
He still has this.

596
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,656
What's this, Bok Su?

597
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,128
He has talent.

598
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,998
If you finished cleaning, come down!

599
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,530
Okay.

600
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,400
Hey, part-timer.

601
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,080
You need to wipe every little spot and corner.

602
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,144
Gosh, look at all this dust. I really can't stand it.

603
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,963
- Wipe it all over again. - Okay, I will.

604
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,029
You're so slow.

605
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,765
All you probably ever did was study.

606
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,869
You've never done any hard work, have you?

607
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:32,923
Are you bullying her? Are you trying to be a mean sister-in-law?

608
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,807
Sister-in-law, my foot.

609
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,558
I never approved of their marriage.

610
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,772
He's my son.

611
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:41,080
Don't be mean to my son's girlfriend.

612
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:48,198
What are you doing here?

613
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,483
This is my evening part-time job.

614
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,288
I get to work part-time and see you as well.

615
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,339
Hey, quit right now. This place has a bad working environment.

616
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,048
Wipe the tables yourself.

617
00:42:58,049 --> 00:42:59,827
That's not a bad idea.

618
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,918
If you quit this job,

619
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:04,647
I'll introduce you to a more comfortable part-time job.

620
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:06,936
- What kind of job is it? - Oh, well...

621
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,274
You can be In Ho's personal tutor.

622
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,021
Why don't you help your nephew get into college?

623
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,045
Go upstairs and sleep.

624
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,028
Hurry up and just go to bed.

625
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,298
Why?

626
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,168
I'm just saying we should use her talent for the family.

627
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,438
Making her clean at a restaurant is a complete loss...

628
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,739
for the entire country. It's a waste of human resource.

629
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,931
Cut the nonsense.

630
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,149
Please go upstairs. Go on.

631
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,160

I can't help but think...

637

that you'll be a great teacher.

638

How about...

639
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,098
you give it another shot and study for the test?

Gosh, will you wake up?

641
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,609
How many times do I need to tell you that I wasn't sleeping?

642
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,519
S High School that recently caused a big social issue...

643
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,119
Hey, take a look at this. They're closing down our school.

644
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,418
What? They're closing down the school?

645
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:49,458
What are you talking about?

646
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:52,428
- And due to the circumstances, - Let me see.

647
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:54,698
they're seriously thinking about closing down the school.

648
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:55,798
What? I guess it's true.

649
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:57,798
S Foundation is currently repenting...

650
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:00,499
all the irregularities that have occurred in their school.

651
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,999
And due to the seriousness of the corruption,

652
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,408
they came to a judgment that the school cannot be maintained.

653
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,869
And therefore, they requested the Ministry of Education...

654
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,938
to close down the school.

655
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:09,438
That's Seolsong High School, right?

656
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:10,678
Along with the evidence...

657
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:13,149
- Yes. - What kind of nonsense is that?

658
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,836
Why would they close down the school?

659
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,219
Who says they can do that?

660
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,788
Once the Ministry of Education gives out an approval,

661
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:21,517
they will immediately proceed with closing down the school.

662
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,288
Why would they close down the school when there are students here?

663
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,828
- Does this make any sense? - Bok Su, what are they saying?

664
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:29,599
The foundation and ministry have made their final decision...

665
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,610
Get out of the way.

666
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,099
If the school closes down,

667
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,331
what's going to happen to all of us?

668
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,678
Vice-principal Song, did you know about this?

669
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,019
They can't have decided to close down the school all of a sudden.

670
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,489
How could I have known?

671
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,788
I feel more frustrated than all of you here.

672
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:55,780
Where am I going to find a job at this age?

673
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,084
It's not that easy to close down a school.

674
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,436
Nothing's for certain yet, so let's wait and see what happens.

675
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:06,382
I mean, come on.

676
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,536
Every private school commits irregularities.

677
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,256
Why would they close down the school for something so minor?

678
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,938
Ms. Hong, we're teachers here.

679
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,448
You shouldn't talk as if all this is nothing.

680
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,459
What?

681
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:21,398
What's that supposed to mean?

682
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,019
Are you saying I don't deserve to be a teacher?

683
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,249
My gosh, that's enough.

684
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,745
The least we can do is be supportive of each other.

685
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,086
I'm pretty sure all the parents are aware of this now.

686
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:34,877
How should we react if they ask about this?

687
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,868
What do you mean, Mr. Park? How can they close down the school?

688
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,938
These people won't stop...

689
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,031
thinking of the school as a business enterprise.

690
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:54,612
I mean, is it even possible to close down the school?

691
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,542
If the owner of the school...

692
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:01,254
applies for it and the Ministry of Education gives out an approval,

693
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,259
it's possible.

694
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,288
Then are you saying they can close down the school...

695
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,785
just like someone would close down a chicken restaurant...

696
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,698
even when the students' future is at risk?

697
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,729
That's how the law works.

698
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,428
What kind of a crazy law is that?

699
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:16,672
Anyway, they won't easily give out an approval,

700
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,969
so let's wait and see.

701
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,068
Why do we have to wait?

702
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,524
We need to do what we can to stop them.

703
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,637
I looked it up on the web, and apparently,

704
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:31,464
we have to transfer schools if the school closes down.

705
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,458
What? We have to transfer schools? We're back to that again?

706
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:36,788
This is what you call getting forced to transfer schools.

707
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:39,489
Why are they doing everything the way they want to?

708
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,028
The Ministry of Education can't give out an approval that easily.

709
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,399
Our school is a prestigious high school...

710
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,729
located in the middle of Seoul.

711
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,245
So they can't get rid of it that easily.

712
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,769
Did you not see all the irregularities they've committed?

713
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,869
This place is like a corporation.

714
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,038
What if the school really closes down?

715
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,787
We need to do what we can to stop that from happening.

716
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,931
What are you going to do?

717
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,800
We'll...

718
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:12,000
help.

719
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,599
That lady's brain works in a very peculiar way.

720
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,639
She's trying to close down the school...

721
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,698
now that things aren't going her way.

722
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:25,569
She's really something.

723
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,135
Gosh, if I could have things my way...

724
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,036
I could totally beat her if I fought her 1 on 1.

725
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,279
She's showing her true colors now that she's no longer a teacher.

726
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,678
We're cultural citizens.

727
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,418
So we just need to stay logical and cool-headed and talk about...

728
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:41,339
how we can stop the school from closing down.

729
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:44,754
First of all, we need to let everyone know about this...

730
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,141
Let us join you.

731
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:48,876
We can't let the school close down.

732
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:51,569
What can you guys do?

733
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,069
Anything. We'll do anything.

734
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,339
Uncle Bok Su, I don't want to transfer schools.

735
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,039
Who's going to fight for our school other than us?

736
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,708
He's right. It's our school.

737
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:02,144
We'll do everything that we can to help.

738
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:05,473
Gosh, these little minions.

739
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,361
Do you think it'll be okay?

740
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,889
Are you guys sure about this?

741
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:13,929
- Yes. - Yes.

744
00:49:28,939 --> 00:49:30,081
Thank you.

(Do not close down Seolsong High School)

748
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:52,988
- Hello. - Hello.

749
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,428
Can you read this and sign this sheet?

750
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,698
I'm starting a movement to oppose...

751
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:57,982
Seolsong High School from closing down.

752
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,918
You're really handsome.

753
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,111
Thank you.

754

(Petition to Oppose Seolsong High School from Shutting Down)

755
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,651
Are you done?

756
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,673
Hey, wait. Take one each.

757
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,690
Thanks. Bye.

758
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,199
Hey, you guys.

759
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,470
Come over here.

760
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,916
How about you read this and sign the sheet?

761
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,258
It's all like that.

762
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:28,329
- Hello. - Hey.

763
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,320
- Can you please read this? - What is it?

764
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,090
- Here you go. - Let's see.

765
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,208
Sir, we're trying to fight for justice...

766
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:41,089
and oppose Seolsong High School from closing down.

767
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,809
Gosh, you're really trying hard...

768
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,208
- to save your son. - Pardon?

769
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,248
What are you doing? Let's hurry up and sign the sheet.

770
00:50:48,249 --> 00:50:50,805
- Yes, of course. - Let's sign the sheet.

771
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:52,319
Let's see.

772
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,743
- Thank you. - I'll sign my name right here.

773
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,620
We're done for the day.

774
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,897
Are you here to eat jjajangmyeon?

775
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,660
Take a seat.

776
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,910
Thank you.

777
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,525
The terrible thing you did to Bok Su,

778
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,323
I did not forget it.

779
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,271
I'm not grateful for your belated confession.

780
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,920
But...

781
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:29,106
I know that you helped...

782
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,930
Bok Su this time.

783
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,345
I know that doesn't wipe out what I did wrong.

784
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,355
But I'm trying to make up for it.

785
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,916
What you did to your mother,

786
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,246
is it okay?

787
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,531
Didn't you get kicked out for giving Bok Su that document?

788
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,713
I did get kicked out.

789
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:55,628
But I kind of walked out myself.

790
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:01,547
I don't know. I feel empty.

791
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,534
Still, she and I...

792
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,775
did too many wrong things.

793
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:15,239
Yes.

794
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,258
I heard she's going to get rid of the school.

795
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,589
I think helping Bok Su and the students...

796
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,794
to stop that from happening is...

797
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:30,953
the only way to make up to them.

798
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,031
I'm sorry, ma'am.

799
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,802
Back in the day,

800
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,455
when you called me Mom and looked at me,

801
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:55,422
you seemed so hungry.

802
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,268
"That poor young thing."

803
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:01,299
"He looks at people with such love hungry eyes."

804
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,538
Even though you weren't my kid, you broke my heart.

805
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:11,776
Never do such terrible things again.

806
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:14,686
If you feel like doing that, just come here and eat jjajangmyeon.

807
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:16,912
I'll slap you in the back.

808
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,641
Okay.

809
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,025
Eat up. The noodles will get soggy.

810
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,327
- Yes? - Mr. Kang. I need to see you.

811
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,883
I have questions to ask you.

812
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:04,809
Regarding Lim Se Gyeong and Oh Se Ho.

813
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,881
Oh Se Ho?

814
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:09,196
Okay.

815
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,490
Bok Su.

816
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:12,421
We need to talk.

817
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,948
Se Ho was here? Why?

818
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,696
He came here to eat jjajangmyeon.

819
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,176
Do you think he came here for jjajangmyeon?

820
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,272
He said he was sorry.

821
00:55:24,729 --> 00:55:26,829
So, did you slap his back?

822
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,658
If that could make me feel better, I would've hit him 100 times.

823
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:34,529
Mom. Well...

824
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,318
Actually, he...

825
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,456
No. Never mind.

826
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,079
I must be crazy.

827
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,332
He said he'd stop the school from being closed down.

828
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,819
I don't know if it's possible though.

829
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,830
The school?

830
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,899
I thought you'd come running...

831
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,283
if you heard about closing down the school.

832
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:08,980
I'm disappointed.

833
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,736
I don't need to talk to you.

834
00:56:16,979 --> 00:56:19,474
We'll stop the school from being closed down.

835
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:23,819
Because the school isn't yours. It's the students'.

836
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,163
Don't worry.

837
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,105
It might not get closed down.

838
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:30,571
What do you mean?

839
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,865
Bok Su, you have such a good friend.

840
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,846
What are you saying?

841
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,991
If Se Ho gets arrested instead of me,

842
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:52,834
I said I'd cancel the request to close the school down.

843
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,970
What a sad sacrifice, don't you think?

844
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,015
Lim Se Gyeong and you are in on this.

845
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,428
Didn't you manage...

846
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:13,096
Lim Se Gyeong's slush funds under your uncle's name?

847
00:57:16,439 --> 00:57:19,369
Are you keeping quiet because there isn't any evidence?

848
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:22,879
I can put you in jail using the circumstantial evidence.

849
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,970
You got something.

850
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:27,990
What is it?

851
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,702
I didn't manage Lim Se Gyeong's slush fund.

852
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:34,662
I did everything...

853
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,073
from the beginning.

854
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:39,699
What?

855
00:57:44,999 --> 00:57:47,728
All the corruption in Seolsong High School...

856
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:48,912
wasn't done by Lim Se Gyeong,

857
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,310
but it was done...

858
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,626
by me.

859
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:03,044
Let me go! I have something to say.

860
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,393
Let go of me!

861
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,471
Hey, Se Ho!

862
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,396
Let go. Let me go!
