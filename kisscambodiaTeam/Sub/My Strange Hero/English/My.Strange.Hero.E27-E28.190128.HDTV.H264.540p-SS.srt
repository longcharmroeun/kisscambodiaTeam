1
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,831
Just kill yourself then.

2
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,931
Just...

3
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,778
die.

4
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:32,871
Se Ho.

5
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,541
You think...

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,424
killing yourself will make everything easy, right?

7
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,142
You think jumping off will put an end to everything.

8
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,000
I can guarantee you...

9
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,076
that there's nothing you can end.

10
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,006
If you jump,

11
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,043
you'll regret forever.

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,481
Whether you die or live.

13
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,901
And...

14
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,399
nobody will remember you.

15
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,561
One bad choice you make...

16
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,104
can never be undone.

17
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,135
Hey, Se Ho.

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,135
Don't talk nonsense.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,575
As long as you're alive,

20
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,452
you can always start over.

21
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,621
Chae Min.

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,161
Chae Min.

23
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,088
You can start living differently from now.

24
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,218
There will always be opportunities.

25
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,852
Take my hand.

26
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,921
It's okay. You did well.

27
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,533
It's okay, don't cry.

28
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,017
I hope Chae Min will be all right.

29
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,173
I'm sure he'll be fine.

30
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,948
I'm glad nothing happened.

31
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,084
Were you surprised?

32
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,487
How can this happen again...

33
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,060
in front of you?

34
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,453
Why did such a thing repeat at this school,

35
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,866
nine years ago and today too?

36
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,461
Chae Min,

37
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,768
and Se Ho too.

38
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,156
The school pressures students to be in first place,

39
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,314
and their parents are teaching the kids wrong.

40
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,709
Neither side realizes...

41
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,978
they're ruining the kids.

42
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,031
I hope such a thing...

43
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,319
won't ever happen again.

44
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,838
That's why you're here fighting.

45
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:36,192
You held Chae Min back today too.

46
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:42,259
Hey, is it true Chae Min almost killed himself?

47
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,159
Everyone knows the answers were leaked.

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,228
How can he survive in Ivy Class after that?

49
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:50,463
He would've made it to SKY Class even without the answers.

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,323
If I were him...

51
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,808
I can't imagine how he must feel.

52
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,949
Why is Bok Su involved in this?

53
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,307
He'll be okay, right?

54
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:07,612
Young Min, where are you going?

55
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,483
Chae Min.

56
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,763
(Seolsong High School)

57
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,599
There was a time...

58
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,409
I was willing to do anything for marks.

59
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,653
So? Does this make you happy?

60
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,038
Because I broke down just like you?

61
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,437
That's when Bok Su told me...

62
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,125
that we're the only ones who can free ourselves.

63
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,424
I hope you can become free too.

64
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,079
Lee Chae Min!

65
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,282
Hurry up!

66
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,602
If I had...

67
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,277
saved you then,

68
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,439
then...

69
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,283
would things be different now?

70
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,052
Did you forget?

71
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,529
The one who let go of you back then was me.

72
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,794
Kang Bok Su!

73
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,790
I said, save me!

74
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,693
No!

75
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,764
Did you want to run away?

76
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,878
What would you know?

77
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,124
Do you think I never wanted...

78
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,571
to run away myself?

79
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,875
What are you trying to say?

80
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,274
Don't run away.

81
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,154
You should take the chance to live differently...

82
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,005
instead of doing something you'd regret.

83
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,649
Are all the corruption Kang Bok Su revealed about the school true?

84
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,558
Where did you use the money you swindled?

85
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,631
Is it true that you committed the crimes alone?

86
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,278
I'm sorry for causing social injustice.

87
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,896
I'll be truthful to the investigation.

88
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,133
You have several charges...

89
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,508
All rebate wires from partner companies...

90
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,447
were sent to Principal Kim Gwi Chang.

91
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,908
You're testifying...

92
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,776
that it was sent to you and your family members' accounts.

93
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,074
Is this true?

94
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,988
Yes, it's all true.

95
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,808
The amount you embezzled was astronomical.

96
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,803
Why didn't you use someone else's bank account?

97
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,228
That's because I was careless.

98
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,820
Kim Gwi Chang, do I look like a fool to you?

99
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,038
Who in the right mind would send rebate money to themselves?

100
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,309
Why are you suspicious when I'm telling you I did it?

101
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,237
You'll be imprisoned right away for embezzling such a big amount.

102
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:29,382
Think carefully before you answer.

103
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:32,831
You withdrew money from your account quite regularly.

104
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,848
Where did all the money go?

105
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,491
Kim Gwi Chang.

106
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,702
You can go home for the day.

107
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,049
Aren't you going to throw me in jail?

108
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,548
We know who you are and you're admitting to the charges.

109
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,515
You'll be charged without detention for now.

110
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,004
Okay. Thank you.

111
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,268
So, is the whistleblower of the employment corruption...

112
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,891
a current teacher at Seolsong High School?

113
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,260
Who is it?

114
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,339
Is that more important right now?

115
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,674
If you find any new evidence, please bring it directly to me.

116
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,618
Don't release it through social media.

117
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,477
Thank you for your cooperation.

118
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,713
Prosecutor,

119
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,879
are you only going to interrogate the principal,

120
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,289
and no one else?

121
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,861
Yes, for now.

122
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,010
Hey.

123
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,358
Do you think it makes sense that he committed...

124
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,756
all these crimes by himself?

125
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,528
The board members...

126
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,131
I thought you would...

127
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,314
interrogate the board chairman at least.

128
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,669
Where did he use all that money?

129
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,248
The principal diverted all the money for personal reasons.

130
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,372
It's over 10 million dollars.

131
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,949
Do you think that makes sense?

132
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,010
Mr. Kang, I'm the one in charge of this case.

133
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:14,259
This is so strange!

134
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,222
The world is not as easy as you think.

135
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,900
That's how this case will close.

136
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,750
Take care.

137
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,513
I got fired right away.

138
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,508
Se Ho's mom is really scary.

139
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:39,508
She's cutting everyone off as soon as she's back.

140
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:40,631
You guys...

141
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,648
worked hard until now.

142
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,179
Se Ho got fired too.

143
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,694
Does that mean our job's done?

144
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,518
Ms. Yang.

145
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,118
We did a perfect job like always.

146
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,487
It's not over yet.

147
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,321
Right?

148
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,599
I knew you'd choose to walk the hard road.

149
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,969
You can't end it like this, can you?

150
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,179
No, I can't. I need to finish what I started.

151
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,710
Our school is just as corrupt...

152
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,478
as it was nine years ago when they kicked me out...

153
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,315
after only hearing Se Ho's side of the story.

154
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,601
No.

155
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,919
It might even be worse now.

156
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,540
It makes no sense that the principal...

157
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:23,158
was the only one behind this.

158
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,988
It hasn't even been that long since Se Ho came back to Korea.

159
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,132
But most of the irregularities happened 10 years ago.

160
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:29,627
And judging from how the prosecutor behaved,

161
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:30,955
it seemed like someone had already pulled some strings.

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,898
Who in the world has such strong connections?

163
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,839
The principal turned himself in, so it can't be him.

164
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,582
- Then does that mean... - It's Se Ho's mom.

165
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,391
Chairwoman Lim Se Gyeong.

166
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,179
Congressmen, I know you're all busy.

167
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,648
So I'd like to thank you for coming.

168
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,985
Of course, we should come. After all, it's regarding you.

169
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,549
We should be supportive at times like this.

170
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,865
You really are the only people I can trust.

171
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,211
Does that mean...

172
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,158
I no longer have to worry about the prosecution investigation?

173
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,403
I already took care of everything, so don't worry.

174
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,346
I'm also in the process of talking to the press,

175
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,188
so things will quiet down very quickly.

176
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,499
As you already know,

177
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,008
Seolsong University needs to be established safely...

178
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,886
in order for us to smoothly gather your political contributions.

179
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,246
I hope we both gain what we want by establishing Seolsong University.

180
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,743
(Chairwoman, Lim Se Gyeong)

181
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,320
Mr. Yoon.

182
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,073
Get rid of everything Se Ho has changed around here.

183
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,429
Start by firing the people he newly hired.

184
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,238
And as for the students who get good grades in Wildflower Class,

185
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,279
I want you to tell the teachers to force them to go to Ivy Class.

186
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,268
How could you just watch him ruin the system?

187
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,636
You're such a pushover.

188
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,061
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,206
And one more thing. Tell Son Soo Jeong...

190
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:57,943
to come to my office.

191
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,551
(Administration Office)

192
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,758
Mr. Yoon, how can you do this to me?

193
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,483
I only recently got hired as the administration manager.

194
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:09,998
Where's Chairman Oh?

195
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,081
Mr. Kim.

196
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:15,506
Chairwoman Lim is the owner of Seolsong now.

197
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,398
You can't do this to me.

198
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,276
I even had to do all the dirty work.

199
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,105
I won't stay still.

200
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,248
I'll make you guys regret this.

201
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:30,086
You're the one who'll end up regretting.

202
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,304
Were you not aware that everything you did until now...

203
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:35,489
were illegal?

204
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,059
If you cause an issue,

205
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,201
you'll have to take responsibility for everything.

206
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,212
The chairwoman's back in office,

207
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,738
so the school will soon become stable again.

208
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,494
I hope you guys keep up the good work.

209
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:58,508
Mr. Son, the chairwoman wants you...

210
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,569
to send Seung Woo and Young Min to Ivy Class.

211
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,179
Why? They keep saying they don't want to go.

212
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,586
How am I supposed to know? There's going to be a massacre.

213
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,355
You should be careful not to stand out too much.

214
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,089
The students aren't toys, you know.

215
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,068
- I can't... - You can't accept it, can you?

216
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,089
She actually wishes to talk to you.

217
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,398
You should go to her office, Ms. Son.

218
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,306
Gosh, I can pretty much predict everything that's about to happen.

222
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,965
I don't want you to testify as a witness.

223
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,611
A whistleblower? In my school? How dare you?

224
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,790
You shouldn't do that for Bok Su's sake. Don't you agree?

226

And I also broke up with Bok Su.

228
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,054
Now that I even handed in my letter of resignation,

229
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:17,709
you'll no longer be able to use Bok Su to threaten me.

230
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,272
Thank you for the pretty photos.

231
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,891
By the way, you better talk to me with more respect, ma'am.

232
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,627
You should keep your manners.

233
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,966
Process her resignation immediately.

234
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,685
What a bold little brat.

235
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,523

No, he'd never do such a thing.

340
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,828
- What? - Unbelievable! What?

341

342
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,469
Didn't you know?

343
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,060
Did you all know?

344
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:44,273
Gosh, I got left out again.

346
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,209
was it that obvious?

347
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,290
- Yes. - Totally.

348
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,400

349
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,391

352
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,788

353
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:08,953

354

Do we even have to ask?

355
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,699
We can tell from taking me out of the glass booth.

356
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,995
We can tell what kind of person he is.

357
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,562
Bok Su, you just worry about your love life that's in crisis.

358
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,640
We broke up already.

00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,400
Don't worry.

You don't have to lie to us.

361
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,649
Everyone knows now anyway.

362
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,749
- I'm telling the truth. - Guys, stop it.

363
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,179
He must be embarrassed.

364
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,230
Let's pretend that we don't know.

365
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,118
- Go. - Okay.

366
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,343
- Go back to your seats. - Let's go.

367
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,288
- Good times. - Go.

368
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:39,959
- What good times? - Good times.

369
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,153
Why is he hiding it from us?

370
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,995
Why are they looking at me like that?

371
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,802
(Episode 28 will air shortly.)

372
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,479
(S High School's corruption, a new phase?)

373
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,866
(Accuser A was a perpetrator in the past.)

374
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,141
Gosh.

375
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,309
(S High School's accuser of corruption Kang Bok Su...)

376
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,982
(may be having an immoral relationship with a teacher.)

377
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,665
How is Bok Su? He must've been shocked.

378
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,543
I thought he was here.

379
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,178
I can't get a hold of him.

380
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:23,638
What will Bok Su do?

381
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,251
Shouldn't we comfort him?

382
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,020
We can't comfort him by talking to him.

383
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:35,446
Soo Jeong, I believe in you.

384
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,550
What?

385
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,893
- What do you mean? - Right.

386
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:42,395
Nobody can comfort him better than you right now.

387
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,213
Go wherever you guys can be alone.

388
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,448
Hey, give her the company credit card.

389
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:03,788
Why the company credit card?

390
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:04,840
Hurry.

391
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:09,711
Use this too.

392
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,152
(Sojeonggak)

393
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:32,573
(Your Request)

394
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,249
Gyeong Hyeon, you drive...

395
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,370
Hey.

396
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,510
Get in.

397
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,381
What?

398
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,483
(Your Request)

399
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,509
Gosh, Soo Jeong!

400
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,466
Slow down. Okay? Gosh.

401
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,779
It feels good to drive.

402
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,639
Stop changing lanes.

403
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,976
Why? Are you scared?

404
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:08,053
No. I just want you to drive safely.

405
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:09,841
Bok Su.

406
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:13,558
Since you left school nine years ago,

407
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,926
was there something you really wanted to do?

408
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:20,652
Going on a school trip.

409
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,044
Okay. Let's go on a school trip.

410
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:30,009
Now? The two of us?

411
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,039
Yes. People usually go to Jeju Island these days.

412
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,762
But we can't go there now, so let's go to the sea.

413
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,409
Go, go!

414
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,009
Okay.

415
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,917
Just drive slowly.

416
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:52,855
Bok Su.

417
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,621
What's this?

418
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,109
Is this why you wanted to stop at a service area?

419
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,639
Yes. I really wanted to try this.

420
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,639
Sausage and rice cake.

421
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,619
You should eat something more delicious.

422
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,610
- Something delicious? - Yes.

423
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,146
We'll keep eating.

424
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:18,323
Bok Su.

425
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,426
Bok Su.

426
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:31,989
Well...

427
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,402
- It's good, right? - Yes.

428
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:38,592
Bok Su.

429
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,341
Bok Su.

430
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,471
Ta-da.

431
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,490
You're back.

432
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,829
(Your Request)

433
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,738
All right. Shall we go?

434
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,432
Shall we?

435
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:18,442
I regret it.

436
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,829
I regret it terribly.

437
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:24,317
Why are they eating so much?

438
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,130
Bok Su.

439
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,476
We should do everything other couples do, right?

440
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,174
Bok Su, catch me if you can!

441
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,926
I guess she doesn't know that I run 100m in 11 seconds.

442
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,571
Wait. Gosh. Wait a minute.

443
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,002
This...

444
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:27,738
It's because there's sand. So I can't.

445
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,257
Help me up.

446
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:21,112
When you go on school trips, you're supposed to have bonfires.

447
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,969
You should put in potatoes and sweet potatoes...

448
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,439
and roast them too, right?

449
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,682
Do you eat such things on school trips?

450
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:29,138
I don't know.

451
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,842
I haven't been on one either.

452
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,851
Ever since the incident,

453
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,835
I couldn't do anything...

454
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,291
I should've done with you.

455
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:50,726
I couldn't get myself to.

456
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,159
Thank you...

457
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,599
for taking me on a school trip today.

458
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:01,932
Thanks to you,

459
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:06,047
I was able to revive a memory that I lost.

460
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:11,883
It's so nice being here with you...

461
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,821
like this.

462
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,524
I handed in my resignation letter.

463
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,649
I'm sorry I'm not able...

464
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,941
to stay with you throughout your time at school.

465
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:39,329
Instead,

466
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,025
I'll give you all of my time for the rest of my life.

467
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,701
Won't you date me again, Bok Su?

468
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:54,987
Let's start over.

469
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,114
Our second first love.

470
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,170
Please give me one jjajangmyeon.

471
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:14,291
Sure. Wel...

472
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,901
come.

473
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,366
Yes. I'm here.

474
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,511
Hello.

475
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,210
Right.

476
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,857
I was worried about you.

477
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,098
I heard that you quit school because of Bok Su.

478
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:43,041
It made me feel uneasy.

479
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:46,529
I'm sorry, and I'm thankful.

480
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:48,415
It wasn't because of Bok Su.

481
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:50,301
It was because of me.

482
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,778
I felt like I would regret it for a long time...

483
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,628
if I fail to protect him again this time.

484
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:59,094
I got to say all I wanted before quitting.

485
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,885
I feel relieved, and my heart's at ease.

486
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:07,311
I'm not sure if someone jobless can say this.

487
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,978
You're saying that, but I know...

488
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:14,662
being a teacher is your vocation.

489
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:20,139
Actually, I came today because I want your support.

490
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:24,323
I intend on starting a something new.

491
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:29,583
I'm sure you'll be good at whatever you do. You'll do well.

492
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:32,910
I know so because you're a good man.

493
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:50,021
Mr. Park!

494
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,208
What happened?

495
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:54,009
You won't pick up your phone, and you weren't home.

496
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,708
Do you know how worried we were?

497
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,647
Did you miss me?

498
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,821
We thought something bad happened to you.

499
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,818
Also, you should've met me first,

500
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,829
not my mom.

501
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,193
I was craving jjajangmyeon.

502
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:09,558
Anyway, your mom gave me a lot of strength.

503
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:12,058
Mr. Park, I told you. My mom has high standards.

504
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,589
You're going to get heartbroken.

505
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,527
I'm a pretty good catch.

506
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,996
Let's go in. We can talk inside.

507
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,568
Do you really think you're good enough?

508
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:20,609
I'm good enough for my age.

509
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,960
I don't think so.

510
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,119
What are you doing here?

511
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,171
I have something to say to you.

512
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:43,197
Please spare some time for me.

513
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,163
I won't ever show up like this again.

514
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,153
It's the last time.

515
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,197
(Resignation Letter)

516
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,731
Why do you have this?

517
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,269
I got it from Mr. Yoon.

518
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,239
I heard you handed in to Mother.

519
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,705
Actually, I wanted to hand it in to you.

520
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,772
Because it was you who hired me as a full-time teacher.

521
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:11,101
It turned out for the better. You can process it for me.

522
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:16,261
I came to return this resignation letter back to you.

523
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,879
Why?

524
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,691
You're the one...

525
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:25,584
who threatened me for dating a student.

526
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,169
Aren't you the one who released the incident...

527
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,179
from nine years ago to attack Bok Su?

528
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,930
It wasn't me.

529
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:38,916
I was sincere about my feelings for you since nine years ago.

530
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,974
In the time I couldn't come to Korea,

531
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,349
I always thought of you.

532
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:49,442
I wished...

533
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:52,093
I had met you differently.

534
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,657
But in the end, this is what happened.

535
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,278
- Se Ho. - I did too many things wrong.

536
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,620
To you,

537
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:04,533
and to Bok Su too.

538
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,435
Soo Jeong.

539
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:13,224
You weren't hired full-time because of money.

540
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,300
Also,

541
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:17,112
you're a good teacher.

542
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,494
You're making the kids of Wildflower Class change.

543
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,358
I wish you wouldn't give up.

544
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,460
Even if that's the case,

545
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,083
the fact that I tried to buy my way to become a teacher...

546
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,354
doesn't change.

547
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,133
Also, I want to date Bok Su without being ashamed.

548
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:41,929
You had the best class evaluation for three years in a row,

549
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:44,356
and you even took the exam to become a full-time teacher.

550
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,881
You deserve it.

551
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,195
I was thankful...

552
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,035
that you thought I deserved it. Also,

553
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,629
I want you to tell Bok Su yourself...

554
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,682
that you wronged him.

555
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,866
Actions would be better than words.

556
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,580
I'll be going.

557
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,595
(Resignation Letter)

558
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,278
It turns out, the Board of Education...

559
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,400
is preparing a hearing regarding Seolsong High School's problem.

560
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,468
I think they plan on making your mother stand as a testifier.

561
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,749
Is Mother suspecting?

562
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,848
She's suspicious about everything in the world,

563
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:56,419
so I'm sure she won't trust me either.

564
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,749
But I think she believes you used all the information you have...

565
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,595
at the board meeting.

566
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:05,429
She must think no one would disclose the truth about the money.

567
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,022
He's being expelled?

568
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,195
I asked you to help him transfer or to let him drop out.

569
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,308
Well, ma'am. The school can't...

570
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:20,380
just ignore the public opinion.

571
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:26,478
If he drops out of school,

572
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,987
then his scores will still be acknowledged.

573
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,872
The public opinion is that they can't let him do that.

574
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:34,889
I won't sit still.

575
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,510
Don't you know how much I donated to this school?

576
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:39,513
This is...

577
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,563
This is impossible.

578
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,549
(Teachers' Office)

579
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,210
Chae Min.

580
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,886
The fact that you acknowledged your faults at an early age...

581
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,924
means you got a second chance at life at an early age as well.

582
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,322
What chance?

583
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,033
My life's about to get ruined.

584
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,473
You heard what Bok Su said.

585
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,542
You have a chance to start over again.

586
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:31,774
Back when I was your age, I also made a huge mistake.

587
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,718
But I realized that mistakes only end up...

588
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:38,269
snowballing as time goes by.

589
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:40,832
To point where it becomes irreversible.

590
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,306
I'm sure you'll become a better adult than I am.

591
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,174
Thank you...

592
00:41:58,839 --> 00:41:59,859
for stopping me.

593
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,178
You're a teacher.

594
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,989
You should be ashamed of yourself for ruining a student's life.

595
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,010
Mom.

596
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:21,128
I'm more ashamed of what we both did.

597
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,751
Chae Min.

598
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:24,190
Let's go.

599
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,614
I'm sorry for asking you to meet all of a sudden.

600
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,061
It's okay.

601
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:08,257
I wanted to meet you as well.

(Education Committee Hearing)

603
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,725
Why did I get a subpoena for a hearing?

604
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:20,088
You'll just be attending as a testifier.

605
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:22,989
The main subject of the hearing will be the principal.

606
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,682
I don't think you'll need to prepare anything in particular.

607
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,392
You should stop.

608
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:39,159
What did you say?

609
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,700
You managed to cover it up, but you can't do that forever.

610
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,808
Everything will collapse.

611
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:49,227
You're the one who collapsed Seolsong.

612
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,471
You incompetent punk.

613
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,148
You'll build another school using the money you stole here,

614
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:55,158
and you'll use the same method to do the same.

615
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,467
What's your end goal? Are you trying to build a country?

616
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:01,158
That's what business is all about, Se Ho.

617
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,929
Running private school corporations...

618
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,229
is the best way I can protect my rights and wealth.

619
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,321
Even so,

620
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:10,282
you don't deserve to participate in the education business.

621
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,608
You even think of your one and only son as a failure.

622
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,445
- So how will you educate... - The reason I'm angry with you...

623
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:17,949
is because I can't get rid of you even if I want to.

624
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,307
As for the other students,

625
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:21,283
I can just get rid of them if they fall behind.

626
00:44:22,149 --> 00:44:24,219
Just like how you tried to force the students...

627
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,157
in Wildflower Class to transfer schools.

628
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,330
Here.

629
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,830
What is it?

630
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,326
It's a scarf. Your neck seemed cold.

631
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,848
Because our CEO made a rule...

632
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:55,019
saying we're not allowed to date our colleagues,

633
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,722
he's not able to feel the warmth of a lovely lady's arms.

634
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,519
I thought about it,

635
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,466
and I'm thinking about changing the rules now that it's a new year.

636
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:09,199
How?

637
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,770
I'll encourage the employees to date their colleagues.

638
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:15,068
And it'll just be...

639
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:18,710
the CEO and the team manager going to the winter workshop.

640
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,427
I really like those new rules.

641
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,830
I'm all for it.

642
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:27,870
You should try it on.

643
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:39,751

647
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:21,021

00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:28,243
Hey, you guys.

649
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,479
I had a small fight with the CEO.

650
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:34,367
The best way to resolve a fight is to kiss each other.

651
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,276
Of course. The longer the better.

652
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,158
I'm sure you have a lot to prepare for tomorrow.

00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,844
Hello, everyone.

660
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,618
My name is Park Dong Jun,

661
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:17,434
and I will be the chairperson for today's hearing.

662
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,658
Now that we have a quorum,

663
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:26,046
we shall now begin the 264th Education Committee hearing.

664
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,356
Here's the first agenda.

665
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,351
We will begin with the hearing to investigate the truth...

666
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,272
behind Seolsong High School which is currently owned...

667
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:37,032
by Seolsong Foundation.

668
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,408
Due to the seriousness of the issue,

669
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:44,152
today's hearing will be mainly focused on the witnesses.

670
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:47,670
I hope you all give honest answers.

671
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,979
I am Kim Da Seon, the head of the school management committee...

672
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,755
at Seolsong High School.

673
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:55,118
Are you here as the suspect...

674
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,128
of Seolsong High School's...

675
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,058
exam papers leak?

676
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:01,243
Yes, that's right.

677
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,699
However, I only did that because I was tempted...

678
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,136
by Principal Kim and Chairwoman Lim.

679
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,698
What do you mean they tempted you?

680
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:12,471
They offered to help my child...

681
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,838
go to a prestigious university...

682
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,318
if I successfully gathered enough contributions.

683
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,478
They told me they could fabricate the student performance record...

684
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,181
and leak the exam papers before the exam.

685
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:26,272
(Testifier)

686
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,545
As foolish as I was,

687
00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:34,089
I eventually fell for their temptation.

688
00:49:34,399 --> 00:49:37,112
As evidence to back her statement, here's a deposit receipt...

689
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,240
that adds up to a total of 700,000 dollars.

690
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:42,638
It's a lot more money than what Seolsong High School...

691
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,808
officially reported which was only 70,000 dollars.

692
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,068
The bank accounts are owned by many different people,

693
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,338
so we'll need to track them down.

694
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,939
And we found out that a few of them were related to...

695
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,683
Kim Gwi Chang, the school's former principal.

696
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,918
Was former Principal Kim Gwi Chang the person who made that offer?

697
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:55,971
No.

698
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,106
It was Chairwoman Lim Se Gyeong.

699
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,263
That's all a lie.

700
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,624
When the exam papers got leaked,

701
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,950
I wasn't working in the school as the chairwoman.

702
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,210
Ms. Kim, are you implying...

703
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:18,239
that this isn't the first time...

704
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,408
that the exam papers were leaked?

705
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:23,239
No, this was the only time that happened.

706
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,608
You're not making any sense at all.

707
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:28,589
Chairwoman Lim.

708
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,921
You'll be given a chance to speak. Please stay quiet.

709
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,730
Okay, I'm sorry.

710
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,989
Back when you used to be a contract worker at Seolsong,

711
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,929
is it true that you approached teachers with temporary positions...

712
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,990
and offered them full-time positions in return for money?

713
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:45,696
Yes, it's true.

714
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:47,628
Here's a list...

715
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:50,833
of all the teachers that paid money to get a full-time job at Seolsong.

716
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,646
Who asked you to do this, Mr. Kim?

717
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,323
It was Principal Kim Gwi Chang.

718
00:51:04,149 --> 00:51:05,169
But...

719
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:07,618
you know the food chain, right?

720
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:10,658
There are the sun and grass.

721
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:13,077
Grasshoppers eat the grass.

722
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,574
Anyway, a tiger eats a fox in the end in the food chain.

723
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,352
What do you want to say?

724
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,477
The principal and I are just instruments.

725
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,100
Like grass.

726
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,094
We only did what we were told.

727
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,677
Kim Myung Ho offered me a permanent teaching position...

728
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,402
for a fee of 50,000 dollars as well.

729
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:46,715
Are you saying what Kim Myung Ho said is true?

730
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,299
Yes.

731
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,158
What I want to tell you is...

732
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:51,862
that the principal and Kim Myung Ho...

733
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:55,261
do not have authority over human resources.

734
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,406
The one with that authority is...

735
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,245
Board Chairman Lim Se Gyeong.

736
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,743
(Chairperson)

737
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,748
Please bring the last witness forward.

738
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,426
Thank you for coming.

739
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:33,108
I came here today to talk about...

740
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,833
the new controversy of Seolsong High School.

741
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:39,006
I'm the former Board Chairman Oh Se Ho.

742
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:50,019
Your secretary said you had something to say about...

743
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,692
the accuser Kang Bok Su's past.

744
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,158
Is it true that you were the victim...

745
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:56,282
who was harmed by Kang Bok Su?

746
00:52:58,329 --> 00:52:59,493
Yes, I was...

747
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:03,017
the victim of Kang Bok Su's case...

748
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,262
from nine years ago.

749
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,484
Earlier, I presented evidence of Seolsong High School's...

750
00:53:30,629 --> 00:53:33,469
corruptions in meal service, tools and materials related rebates,

751
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,299
school performance record,

752
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,044
and exam papers leak.

753
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:40,608
For your information, this hearing is being conducted...

754
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:42,783
based on these documents.

755
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:46,648
Since then, Principal Kim Gwi Chang...

756
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:47,873
turned himself in.

757
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,348
The prosecution is judging this case as the principal's...

758
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:52,717
personal corruption.

759
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,811
However,

760
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,260
how and where...

761
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,831
did the principal use...

762
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,285
tens of millions...

763
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:04,929
of dollars...

764
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,256
(Witness)

765
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:08,160
alone?

766
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,947
I brought the answer.

767
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,412
(Seolsong University Construction Site)

768
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,779
A site located in Yurim-dong, Jinyong-gu, Sanju-si,

769
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,618
in a nicely forested metropolitan area was...

770
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:29,782
approved as Seolsong University construction site.

771
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,259
Is Seolsong University...

772
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,898
the next school of Seolsong Foundation?

773
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:35,919
Yes.

774
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:38,138
Also, the owner of this site is...

775
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,775
Nicholas Lim.

776
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,939
His Korean name is Lim Tae Hoon.

777
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,581
It's Board Chairman Lim Se Gyeong's younger brother.

778
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:53,479
I don't have a younger brother.

779
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,148
According to your family registry, you don't.

780
00:54:55,149 --> 00:54:57,749
When your parents got divorced, he was taken out of the registry,

781
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,525
and he acquired a foreign nationality.

782
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:00,844
He's your biological brother.

783
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,505
That would be very difficult to trace, right?

784
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,898
Board chairmen of private foundations...

785
00:55:10,899 --> 00:55:13,598
must think that schools are theirs.

786
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,338
But 90 percent of the money used to run private schools is...

787
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,104
tax money.

788
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,578
Seolsong High School's corruption is...

789
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:24,538
stealing the country's money to build one's own school.

790
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:27,549
Seolsong University's foundation fund is about 30 million dollars.

791
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:31,120
That's similar to the size of Seolsong's corruption fund.

792
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:35,719
That's all I wanted to testify.

793
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,055
I expect the country to fully uncover...

794
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,410
the rest.

795
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:53,404
(Witness)

796
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,038
Board Chairman Lim, you have a chance to speak.

797
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:01,348
Please take the stand.

798
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:04,789
I did my best to make a special school...

799
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,910
that selects and educates excellent students.

800
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:10,689
Seolsong High School showed brilliant results...

801
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,526
in receiving the Ivy League admissions,

802
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:15,711
which proved that my belief is right.

803
00:56:16,129 --> 00:56:18,828
Seolsong University, which I'll establish, won't be...

804
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:20,430
about university admissions only,

805
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:24,164
but it will be a school that will educate...

806
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,908
the future leaders of this country.

807
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:27,164
This hearing isn't...

808
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,801
about promoting your school.

809
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:36,249
Like Kang Bok Su said, Seolsong High School is...

810
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,088
the people's school which receives 90 percent...

811
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:40,446
of its fund is from the country.

812
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,333
It's a school run by everyone's tax money.

813
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,459
But why do you seek an education that's...

814
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,058
only for certain students?

815
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:48,150
School is not...

816
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,636
your private possession.

817
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,581
You're being questioned for embezzling tax money...

818
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,035
and using it to build a privately owned school.

819
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:00,473
Do you want to explain yourself?

820
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:03,186
That is not true.

821
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:07,047
It's all fabricated conspiracy.

822
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:13,088
Kang Bok Su who raised this suspicion was...

823
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:15,358
the assailant of school violence...

824
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,388
who almost killed my son nine years ago.

825
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:21,628
He was expelled from school so he's defaming me...

826
00:57:21,629 --> 00:57:23,293
as revenge.

827
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:31,262
Kang Bok Su...

828
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:43,849
Nine years ago, I was a witness of the case.

829
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,449
Recently I heard...

830
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,142
the victim admit that he jumped off at his will.

831
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,499
Bok Su would never do such a thing.

832
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,569
Ms. Son Soo Jeong,

833
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:01,271
aren't you in a relationship with Kang Bok Su?

834
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,368
Why should we believe your statement,

835
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,378
when you are having an immoral relationship...

836
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,239
with a student?

837
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:38,109
Yes, that's right.

838
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:39,793
I...

839
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:44,144
love Bok Su.

840
00:59:12,769 --> 00:59:17,298
(My Strange Hero)

841
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:19,208
Changing this school so that...

842
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:22,079
every student is treated fairly, that is my real revenge.

843
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,518
Like you said, I'm trying not to run away,

844
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,349
and I'm trying to live differently for the first time.

845
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,648
How dare you make me like this?

846
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,358
Seolsong High School will be closed down.

847
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:30,418
She's closing it down because she can't do as she pleases?

848
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:33,358
We'll discuss how to stop the school from closing down.

849
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,998
- Let's do it together. - Are you sure?

850
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:36,019
- Yes. - Yes.
