1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,880
That day...

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,510
Nine years ago, that day.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,219
Let me ask you two questions.

4
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,359
Did you...

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,760
push Se Ho from the rooftop that day?

6
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,709
Answer me.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,180
Did you really...

8
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:45,650
push Se Ho from the rooftop?

9
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:49,250
No.

10
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:53,550
I didn't.

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,890
I didn't push him.

12
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,029
Did you tell everyone that I was...

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,470
living on food stamps?

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,500
No.

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,769
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,739
I heard it that day.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,480
You said you felt sorry for me.

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,619
Did you just...

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,390
find me pitiful?

20
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,629
Did you...

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,459
walk me home every day, smile at me,

22
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,300
find my dream, and paint my gate because...

23
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,840
I was pitiful?

24
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,610
Hey, don't you feel sorry for Soo Jeong?

25
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,040
You aren't answering me.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,410
No. Because I liked you.

27
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,880
Not because you were pitiful.

28
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,749
I did it because I liked you.

29
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,140
I liked school.

30
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,010
I could hide the fact that I was without parents,

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,580
living with my grandma, and living on food stamps...

32
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:03,649
as long as I had the school uniform on.

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,050
And...

34
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,749
because you were there.

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,100
After you left,

36
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,529
school was like a fiery pit.

37
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,410
The first person I ever trusted...

38
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,480
How you said you felt sorry for me...

39
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,649
hurt me for nine years.

40
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,450
And...

41
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,149
because of me,

42
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,320
you were hurt too.

43
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,929
For asking you too late.

45
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,999
I should've...

47
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,280
mustered up courage and asked you.

48
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,079
Why did you need...

49
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,679
courage to ask me?

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,949
I was...

51
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,319
afraid that you might say you really found me pitiful.

52
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,530
You know what?

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,059
Some kids made fun of me...

54
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,970
when they found out about how I lived.

55
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,699
But there were more kids who treated me nicely.

56
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,569
They gave me school supplies and snacks.

57
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:43,710
Rather than treating me as their friend,

58
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,150
they thought of me as the needy.

59
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,449
They felt a sense of pride and superiority...

60
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,980
after helping me.

61
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,449
I hated that.

62
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,660
I didn't care about other people.

63
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:02,499
But...

64
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,170
I was afraid that you might find me pitiful.

65
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,470
That really scared me, so I ran away.

66
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,210
Because I liked you too.

67
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,879
Even if you told the kids about my family by mistake,

68
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,179
I wouldn't have hated you.

69
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,150
Because it was true.

70
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,280
But I would've told you off.

71
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,090
Why didn't you?

72
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,920
Getting cursed or beaten by you would've been...

73
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,429
better than being apart because of a misunderstanding.

74
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,759
Bok Su.

75
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,100
I'm really sorry.

76
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,400
Soo Jeong.

77
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,210
I'm really sorry too.

78
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,439
I didn't know how badly I hurt you.

79
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I just hated you thinking that you didn't believe me.

80
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,619
Why don't we...

81
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,989
just forget about those kids...

82
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,989
from nine years ago?

83
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,360
Bok Su, why are you such a fool?

84
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,739
Hey, don't you know that you should be a happy fool?

85
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,239
Let's just think that we've met again.

86
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,439
As a teacher...

87
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,780
and as a student.

88
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,910
We'll start again.

89
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,550
From the beginning.

90
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,730
(Episode 13)

91
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,020
Our cute In Ho.

92
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,819
Get up. It's time for school.

93
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,360
Get up, get up, get up.

94
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:34,509
Have you finally gone crazy?

95
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,579
It's Bok Su.

96
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,050
What's this?

97
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,849
Is he back at school now?

98
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,050
Bok Su!

99
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,780
We missed you!

100
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,719
Hello, friends. Did you all have breakfast?

101
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,959
You should eat breakfast so you can study well.

102
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,130
Hey, you punk.

103
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,870
You're back.

104
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:35,939
If you didn't show up today,

105
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,040
I was going to barge into Sojeonggak today.

106
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,179
That's why I've come back.

107
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,510
Kang...

108
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,319
Kang Bok Su!

109
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,089
Hello, Mr. Kim.

110
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,760
Why are you at school?

111
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,990
Is it wrong for a student to be at school?

112
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,829
You were absent without notice for two days.

113
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,760
That's why I'm doing this volunteer work really hard.

114
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,800
You can volunteer outside of the school grounds.

115
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Come on, Mr. Kim. Go easy on me, please.

116
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:08,339
I'll try my best to work hard...

117
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:09,839
until I graduate.

118
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,010
Mr. Kim, Bok Su is determined to do his best at school...

119
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,880
Don't tell me you're on his side! Are you?

120
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,150
My blood pressure is rising.

121
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:21,650
I started taking my blood pressure pills again...

122
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,219
because of you!

123
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,589
Mr. Kim, you shouldn't stop taking your blood pressure pills.

124
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:26,660
You have to take it regularly.

125
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,229
Make sure you have it within 30 minutes after a meal.

126
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,500
Kang Bok Su!

127
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,000
Your blood pressure, your blood pressure.

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
- Calm down. - Hurry up and take him.

129
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:37,439
Bok Su! Clean until it shines!

130
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,969
Gosh!

131
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,740
The other broom is over there.

132
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,679
- You sweep it. - What?

133
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,079
- Help me. - No, you can do it.

134
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,609
Come on, help me out.

135
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,319
Good morning.

136
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,490
Anyone absent?

137
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,359
Is Bok Su absent?

138
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,099
I'm here.

139
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,709
Hey, old man.

140
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,949
Bok Su, are you back for good now?

141
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,650
Only if you want it.

142
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,990
Okay, then. No one's absent, right?

143
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:35,790
This is nice. Everyone's here.

144
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,829
I don't have any special announcements.

145
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,000
Have a safe and good day...

146
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:50,179
today.

147
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,650
We thought he quit, but Bok Su has returned.

148
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,819
Why were you absent for two days?

149
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,449
Move it, you're covering his face.

150
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:05,120
Hey, Bok Su. Did you eat breakfast?

151
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,160
Wake up. Bok Su is here.

152
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,059
- Don't overact. - It's nice to see you again.

153
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,900
Your face is as addictive as mine.

154
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,270
His face is addictive, and yours is poisonous.

155
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,400
You little...

156
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:22,410
Here. I was about to throw it away.

157
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,979
Throw it out to me if you don't want it. Seung Woo!

158
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,979
(Bulgogi burger)

159
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,290
Let's forget about the past.

160
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,829
I want to live the present moment with you.

161
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,660
I mean, right now.

162
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,770
Answer me.

163
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,370
Did you really...

164
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,699
push Se Ho from the rooftop?

165
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,380
Yes. I better focus on the kids.

166
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,910
I came up with a list of lecturers...

167
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,650
who specialize in areas my kids are interested in.

168
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,719
I don't think it'll be hard to book them,

169
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,750
but I wonder if we're leaning too much on specific careers.

170
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,929
Then we should start with a lecturer...

171
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,429
who can guide the kids to focus on studying.

172
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,459
How about we introduce the other lecturers later?

173
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,199
That sounds like a good idea.

174
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,670
Which field should we choose from?

175
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,939
I'll look into it.

176
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,939
Okay, I'll leave it to you then. Thank you.

177
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,910
I guess I just have to be good to your students to make you smile.

178
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,290
I think...

179
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
Bok Su said something he shouldn't.

180
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,829
What is it? Do you have something to say?

181
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,000
Nothing.

182
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,839
I'll get going, then.

Are you saying you won't go?

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,760
You don't have anything to do, and you have time on your hands.

187
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,990
That's why you must be always shielding Bok Su.

188
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,829
You teachers can discuss amongst yourselves...

189
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,400
and pick one person...

190
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,870
to go with Mr. Park.

191
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,130
Make sure to write up a report afterwards.

192
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,679
This is ridiculous.

193
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,109
Why is he making Mr. Park go on a site survey?

194
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:44,479
Mr. Park, what made you get on Mr. Kim's bad side?

195
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,790
He's known for his grudges.

196
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,089
I'm not on his bad side.

197
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,890
I should go for a visit if it's for the kids.

198
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,359
Who wants to go to Chungju with me?

199
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,069
Mr. Ma.

200
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,640
Come with me.

201
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,880
Me?

202
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,910
Me?

203
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,109
Yes! You should go with Mr. Park.

204
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,479
That works.

205
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,579
Okay...

206
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,890
I'll come along! I'll go to Chungju!

207
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,650
I really want to go!

208
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,160
Do you?

209
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,760
Do you two want to go by yourselves?

210
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,500
Shall we?

211
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,530
Mr. Park, I'm sorry.

212
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,939
I suddenly feel very sick.

213
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't think I can go to Chungju.

214
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,609
I'm sorry...

215
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,380
Let me help you.

216
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,579
Mr. Ma!

217
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,280
Where's Ms. Son?

218
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,280
Hello, Ms. Son.

219
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,679
Hey.

220
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,200
Good work on the volunteer hours.

221
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,980
Don't I get a prize for it?

222
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,960
I figured you wouldn't prepare anything, so I did.

223
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,069
What's this?

224
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,639
I know you like it.

225
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Do you still remember that?

226
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,440
Hey, what are friends for?

227
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
I'll be in charge of your Yakult from now on.

228
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,980
I'll get one for you every single day.

229
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,849
My gosh, will you just drink it?

230
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,230
What are you doing, Bok Su?

231
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,899
Don't smile like that. You're making my heart flutter.

232
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:30,139
I'm crazy. I'm totally crazy. I'm Bok Su's teacher.

233
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,180
I need to get to my senses.

234
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,250
I wasn't going to say this,

235
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,220
- Hey, what are you... - but don't get mistaken.

236
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:39,579
I'm your teacher.

237
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,889
You better call me Ms. Son from now on.

238
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,419
And we may have been friends nine years ago, but we're not anymore.

239
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:34,569
You must be happy that you're popular.

240
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:35,569
I mean,

241
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,909
she made these turtles for me with so much care and sincerity...

242
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,050
hoping that I'll stay healthy. You want me to throw it away?

243
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,379
Gosh, whatever. Then live until you're 100 years old.

244
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,919
Do you really think this is going to make me feel better?

245
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:53,930
No.

246
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,599
You also get to look at my face.

247
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,569
You smiled.

248
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,800
You just smiled, right? That means you're okay now.

249
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,240
He's dumb, so it's surprising that he remembers stuff like this.

250
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Hey, what are you doing?

251
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,149
I haven't had this in so long, and it's so delicious.

252
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,319
Why did you drink that?

253
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,619
What's wrong? Did it expire?

254
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:23,050
I'm healthy. Don't worry.

255
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,520
Can I have one more?

256
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,690
Do whatever you want.

257
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:39,970
I thought you resigned. Why are you back here?

258
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,069
Hey, boss.

259
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,540
I found a new client.

260
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:45,809
A client?

261
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,349
(Your Request)

262
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,069
(Your Request)

263
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,250
(Your Request)

264
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,659
Good job, Team Manager Yang.

265
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,059
"Team Manager Yang"?

266
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,859
I knew you'd score big one day.

267
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,200
You just got promoted as the team manager.

268
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,300
Hey, I know I'm competent.

269
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,530
But I can't get promoted faster than Bok Su.

270
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,940
I'll have to reject your offer to promote me as the team manager.

271
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,839
Okay, fine. You can be the team manager of the Sales Team.

272
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,339
Bok Su will be the team manager of the Business Team.

273
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,280
Okay, I'll take your offer if Bok Su will also become a team manager.

274
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,780
Team Manager Yang is going to drink some coffee.

275
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,020
Bok Su.

276
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,159
Why are you wearing...

277
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,919
Things just kind of ended up this way.

278
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,530
What am I going to do?

279
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,960
I quit working at the cafeteria yesterday...

280
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,829
because I thought you quit school.

281
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:12,899
My goodness.

282
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:15,030
They wouldn't have processed my resignation letter, right?

283
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,569
I'll be right back.

284
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,270
Don't come back. Just stay there forever.

285
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,940
You belong to the cafeteria!

286
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,409
My gosh.

287
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,819
My loving friend.

288
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,829
Have you finally gone mad?

289
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:43,129
Hey, Gyeong Hyeon. No, never mind.

290
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,530
Are you trying to upset me? Tell me.

291
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,540
I...

292
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,809
I talked with Soo Jeong.

293
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:55,139
That's incredible. What did she say?

294
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:59,040
It's turned out that I had hurt her a lot.

295
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,579
Apparently, I said she was pitiful.

296
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,180
And she hates it when people say that.

297
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,290
Is that why she never asked you what happened...

298
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,889
and just testified what she saw?

299
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,720
She should've just cursed at you.

300
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,430
Why did she have to make it worse by keeping her mouth shut?

301
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,230
Back then, we were all very young.

302
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,369
As much as she trusted me,

303
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,540
she would've felt really betrayed when she heard that.

304
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,240
If I think back, I think Soo Jeong would've been...

305
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,409
really lonely back then.

306
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,879
Wait a minute.

307
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,849
Soo Jeong thought you were the one who spread rumors about her family?

308
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,089
Didn't you tell her that it was Se Ho?

309
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:44,419
No, not yet.

310
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:48,089
If she finds out, I feel like she'll feel really distressed.

311
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:49,859
So I'm going to see how things go first.

312
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,300
But still, that jerk is dangerous.

313
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:55,869
I think it'd be better for you to tell her.

314
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,399
I'll always be by her side.

315
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,210
So I'll protect her.

316
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,319
Gosh, it's been so long.

317
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:17,990
Delivery.

318
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,260
Who's here?

319
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:28,430
Bok Su.

320
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,440
What? What are you doing right now?

321
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,740
You didn't eat dinner yet, did you? Dinner's on me tonight.

322
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,280
The tangsuyuk tastes delicious today.

323
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,409
Why would you treat me to dinner?

324
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:46,349
Because I'm so grateful for my teacher's kindness.

325
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:51,159
No, I need to think straight.

326
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,059
I'm a teacher. I can't fall for a bowl of tangsuyuk.

327
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,169
That's right. Like you just said, I'm your teacher.

328
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,270
Accepting this from a student would be violating the Kim Young Ran Act.

329
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,740
- Take it back. - That's why...

330
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,770
I only brought 30 dollars' worth of food.

331
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,010
I hope...

332
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,050
you enjoy your meal, Ms. Son.

333
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,470
The food did nothing wrong.

334
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:38,240
Soo Jeong, what's wrong with you?

335
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,669
Yes, the food did nothing wrong.

336
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,909
But it's still wrong for a teacher to be swayed by a student.

337
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,809
Whatever. Let's eat first.

338
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,460
Look at how happy she is.

339
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,389
(Episode 14 will air shortly.)

340
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,405
- Hello, Ms. Son. - Hi.

341
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,335
(Episode 14)

342
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,514
What's wrong with you, sir?

343
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:35,155
What were you looking at?

344
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:38,155
- What was it? - I wasn't looking at anything.

345
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:40,725
It was Soo Jeong, wasn't it?

346
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,265
You were looking at her, weren't you?

347
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,834
I wasn't looking at Soo Jeong.

348
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:48,034
Hey, you shouldn't call your teacher by name.

349
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,974
- Is that what I taught you? - Yes.

350
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,305
Hey.

351
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:05,885
Thanks, Bok Su.

352
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:06,985
Okay.

353
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:14,295
- Ms. Son. - Gosh!

354
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:15,925
What are you doing?

355
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:17,965
There's Bok Su.

356
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,765
Gosh. You're right.

357
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,705
I didn't notice.

358
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:26,804
Was that Bok Su's back I saw?

359
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:28,774
Ms. Son, what are you doing this weekend?

360
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,274
I don't have any plans. Why?

361
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:36,515
(Special lecture on career paths!)

362
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,315
Guys, you know what today is, right?

363
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:39,655
You have a special lecture on career paths.

364
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:45,724
You should be happy that I scheduled this during class.

365
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,394
For the first lecture,

366
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:50,534
I brought someone who will guide Wildflower Class' school life.

367
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,065
You'll do your best, right?

368
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,605
- No. - No.

369
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:55,965
I'll do my best, Ms. Son.

370
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:59,774
You're always so positive.

371
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:18,695
No way. It's the board chairman. No way.

372
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,864
Darn it.

373
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:28,135
What are you doing here?

374
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,005
I looked around,

375
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,545
and I couldn't find a better lecturer than me.

376
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,404
That's why I came.

377
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:37,214
It'll be okay, right?

378
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:44,054
Hello. I'm here to help you find your careers. I'm Oh Se Ho.

379
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,725
I graduated from Saintbury High School,

380
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,355
then I double majored...

381
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:50,755
in business and English at Stanleybury's University.

382
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:54,425
I'm currently the board chairman of Seolsong High School.

383
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:07,744
(Wildflower Class)

384
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:11,975
I have pride in my achievements.

385
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:13,744
However,

386
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:16,385
what I want to tell you...

387
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,485
is not to live like me.

388
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:24,355
I believed in the stereotype that a student...

389
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:27,165
must go to school and study.

390
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:31,334
However, even if you're not good at school,

391
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:34,864
if you can live doing something you're good at,

392
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:38,274
I think it'd be more worthwhile than wasting time at school.

393
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,505
It's better than being trapped in a class.

394
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:52,084
That's all.

395
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,765
Thank you for taking your time for this.

396
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:07,105
So your point is,

397
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:14,075
there's no need to go to school if your marks are bad.

398
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:15,844
Is that it?

399
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:18,575
That's it for today...

400
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,445
Please don't twist my words.

401
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,985
I'm not twisting anything. That's the main message.

402
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:26,884
The point of my message...

403
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:29,124
tells you to find what you're good at.

404
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:30,795
What if we can't find what we're good at?

405
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:32,254
Then you should find something you like to do.

406
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:33,824
What if we can't find anything we like?

407
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:36,494
Everyone has a dream.

408
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:37,694
Come on.

409
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:39,764
Gosh, Chairman.

410
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,035
In this world,

411
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:45,735
there are many kids who aren't talented at anything,

412
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:47,744
who don't know what they like,

413
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:48,775
and who don't have a dream.

414
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,415
Then they should hurry up and find one.

415
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:52,715
Before they have to face the cold reality.

416
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:56,184
Once we graduate, we'll have no choice but to face it.

417
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:58,785
Can't we live comfortably just for the while we're in school?

418
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,855
Don't you think you would become complacent?

419
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:01,855
Not at all.

420
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:05,525
To some students,

421
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:08,425
the school itself is a fence and a protective layer.

422
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:14,804
It sounded like you're telling us to leave safety...

423
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:17,235
as soon as possible to find our means of making a living.

424
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,184
That's enough, Bok Su. The lecture is over.

425
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:33,324
Thank you, Chairman.

426
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,475
I did a lecture today,

427
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,504
but let's focus on field training from now.

428
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:59,345
You really want to help them find careers, don't you?

429
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,184
I'll think about it.

430
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:03,855
What is it? Is something bothering you?

431
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:07,525
We were trying to show the kids other options as paths,

432
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:09,855
but I wonder if we're pressuring them...

433
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,595
to do something.

434
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:16,535
Okay. I'll respect your opinion.

435
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,735
We'll put a halt on it for now.

436
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,934
Let me know whenever you want to move forward.

437
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,004
Thank you.

438
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:24,134
I know it's not easy to pay so much attention.

439
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:26,574
- Then do you want to go out to eat? - What?

440
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:28,804
I still haven't tried pork belly yet.

441
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:38,715
I need you to redo the accounting documents.

442
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:39,754
Pardon?

443
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:41,824
What about the ones I already gave you?

444
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:44,494
Are you going to give me what we use externally?

445
00:32:45,454 --> 00:32:47,025
I'm the heir of this foundation.

446
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:50,535
Prepare an internal document before I come to work tomorrow.

447
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,504
Yes, sir. I understand.

448
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,405
Mr. Yoon.

449
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,405
Do you have any tips for having pork belly?

450
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,215
I heard pork belly should be cooked thoroughly,

451
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:11,814
but how do you know?

452
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,324
You can just sense it.

453
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:14,655
Sense it?

454
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,554
I'll barbecue it for you today, sir.

455
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:21,994
I'm good at most things,

456
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:23,895
but I'm always bad at everything whenever I'm with you.

457
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:24,934
What are you good at?

458
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:25,934
You know,

459
00:33:26,665 --> 00:33:28,965
horseback riding, fencing, kendo,

460
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,804
target shooting, tennis, and piano.

461
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:31,934
That's so many.

462
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:34,304
I'm trying to show off how cool I am.

463
00:33:44,954 --> 00:33:46,014
Oh Se Ho.

464
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:51,355
You know I used to live on food stamps, right?

465
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,465
You were mistaken.

466
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,895
Bok Su wasn't the one who told everyone.

467
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:00,564
Then, who said that?

468
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:02,004
That's what I'm curious about too.

469
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:06,535
Why did you tell me that Bok Su said it?

470
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:14,215
That's what I heard from others, but I'm sorry if I was wrong.

471
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:16,585
I was hugely mistaken because of what you said.

472
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:19,554
Just saying sorry won't cut it.

473
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:23,595
What about at the rooftop?

474
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,694
Bok Su said he never pushed you. Why did you say he pushed you?

475
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,965
You didn't even listen to my story. Are you taking Bok Su's word for it?

476
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:31,064
That's why I'm asking you right now...

477
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:32,165
so that I won't make the same mistake.

478
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:33,504
Bok Su...

479
00:34:37,004 --> 00:34:38,004
really pushed me.

480
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:52,915
You and Bok Su were friends.

481
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,525
You keep on saying we should forget about the past,

482
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,224
but until I find out the truth,

483
00:35:03,795 --> 00:35:05,265
I don't think I should forget about the past.

484
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:11,375
This was the third meal I promised you.

485
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,054
Who lives here?

486
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:36,224
Delivery!

487
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:41,165
- Please put the food on the table. - Okay!

488
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,734
I'm only telling you guys about this question,

489
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:45,405
so don't tell anyone.

490
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:46,804
Let's move on to the next question.

491
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:56,145
He's too young. He doesn't know what he's doing.

492
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,655
Why is he favoring the Wildflower Class?

493
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,255
What is he doing to support Ivy Class?

494
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:05,324
Shouldn't we meet with the previous chairman?

495
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:06,625
Why should all the money from the Education Office...

496
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,395
go to the kids with the lowest marks?

497
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:10,025
I really don't understand.

498
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:11,334
How much is it?

499
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:17,804
Are you the moms of Ivy Class students at Seolsong High School?

500
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:20,344
It's a nice surprise to meet you here.

501
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,045
My kid's in Ivy Class too.

502
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:25,714
Who?

503
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:28,344
In Ho. Kang In Ho in Ivy Class.

504
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,415
Kang In Ho?

505
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:35,684
In Ho!

506
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:37,724
In Ho!

507
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:39,354
What?

508
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:41,895
- What is it? - Why didn't you tell me...

509
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,295
that Wildflower Class is getting special lectures?

510
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:48,035
How did you find out?

511
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:50,834
All of them are hopeless.

512
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,505
What's the use of these lectures?

513
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:54,905
How frustrating.

514
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:56,745
Uncle Bok Su is in Wildflower Class.

515
00:36:57,145 --> 00:36:58,214
What?

516
00:36:58,545 --> 00:37:00,484
Who cares. You're my son...

517
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,844
and Bok Su is Mom's son.

518
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,285
I'm tired.

519
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:05,314
I'm going back in.

520
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,484
Okay, I'll give you your tonics later.

521
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:09,484
Okay.

522
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:16,224
Parents of Ivy Class students must cooperate at times like this.

523
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:20,934
Is this Chae Min's mom? Hello.

524
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,665
I'm In Ho's mom.

525
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:25,204
Okay, I'll see you there.

526
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:33,444
Chae Min, how good are In Ho's grades?

527
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,984
Did he get accepted to Ivy Class after the recent test?

528
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,155
In Ho?

529
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,255
Chae Min.

530
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:50,734
In Ho is in Wildflower Class.

531
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:58,934
Hey, we can't take tests on behalf of you.

532
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:03,074
I'm trying to tell you that there are things we can do...

533
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,775
and things we can't do.

534
00:38:05,844 --> 00:38:09,015
A student's job is to study. Where did you learn to be such a...

535
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:10,214
Hey...

536
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:13,415
These useless little minions.

537
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,125
I don't think it was a good idea to hand out flyers at school.

538
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,895
Be patient.

539
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:20,194
I'm sure one of them will be worth some money.

540
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,395
He's coming.

541
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:27,665
- What is it? - He's here.

542
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:31,604
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

543
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:35,974
Hey, what are you guys doing? Gosh, you punks.

544
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:37,515
Why are you here?

545
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:40,915
I'm here to ask you for something.

546
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:48,454
Goodness, sir.

547
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:50,425
Ms. Yang, hurry up and welcome our client.

548
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,865
Hello, sir. Please come this way.

549
00:38:56,765 --> 00:39:00,434
Why don't you get me a cup of coffee?

550
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:02,334
I'm already on it, sir.

551
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:05,135
What brings you here, sir?

552
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,844
Well, the thing is...

553
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,645
Mr. Park, are you really sick?

554
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:18,115
You were perfectly fine until yesterday.

555
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:21,155
You even paid money just so you could avoid going on a site survey.

556
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:23,655
Gosh, what are you talking about? I'm really sick.

557
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:26,125
I can't even swallow porridge right now.

558
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,295
Hey, you're lying.

559
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:30,834
I just heard you slurping jjajangmyeon.

560
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:33,395
No, I'm really sick.

561
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,064
Another teacher will be going with you.

562
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,574
So make sure you do a good job.

563
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,005
Bye now.

564
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:41,804
This punk.

565
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:43,814
Goodness, thank you.

566
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:47,515
Did something good happen?

567
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:51,684
Well, I'm trying to make something good happen.

568
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:52,915
I see.

569
00:39:53,954 --> 00:39:55,224
- Eat up. - Okay.

570
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,694
My gosh. Who's the other teacher?

571
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:10,875
(Chungju Bus Terminal)

572
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,005
Soo Jeong?

573
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:15,505
Bok Su, what are you doing here?

574
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,545
You're the guy that Mr. Park sent?

575
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:25,515
Gosh, I love this old man.

576
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,184
Mr. Park, you can't do this to me.

577
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,194
He won't pick up.

578
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:39,734
I mean, neither of us...

579
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:42,104
expected this one little bit.

580
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:45,074
But I still need to work since I got paid.

581
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:46,604
So let's get going, shall we?

582
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:52,074
Let's go, Ms. Son. We don't have much time.

583
00:40:58,314 --> 00:40:59,385
Ms. Son.

584
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:01,084
Ms. Son.

585
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:15,665
I made a list of the places we could go to,

586
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:17,434
and I'm going to take photos for the report.

587
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:23,775
I just impressed you a little, didn't I?

588
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:26,675
What are you talking about?

589
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:30,045
I was wondering if you knew what you were talking about.

590
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,255
Hey, I'm not the Bok Su that I used to be.

591
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:35,224
I've been working for years now.

592
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:36,925
I'm familiar with terms I frequently use.

593
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:40,665
How did you start working in this field?

594
00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:44,865
Did your girlfriend suggest you should join?

595
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:48,405
"Girlfriend"?

596
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:53,474
Are you talking about Min Ji?

597
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:55,775
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

598
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:59,115
I haven't had a girlfriend for nine years.

599
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,145
I coincidentally ended up helping someone,

600
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,454
but that person insisted on paying me.

601
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,054
Then Gyeong Hyeon told me this business has a bright prospect.

602
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,584
so we got started right away.

603
00:42:08,824 --> 00:42:10,125
It suits you.

604
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:14,094
I'll take perfect care of you, ma'am.

605
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,795
"Ms. Son".

606
00:42:19,594 --> 00:42:20,604
Hey.

607
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,535
I'm not here as your student.

608
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:28,304
Let's go, Soo Jeong.

609
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:32,314
What did you just call me? My gosh, you must be crazy.

610
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:35,584
Hey, don't cross the line. I'm your teacher.

611
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:48,125
Did Bok Su arrive or not?

612
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:51,594
Hey, report to me.

613
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:53,594
Bok Su.

614
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:56,365
Hey, do you see that? I'm here.

615
00:42:57,204 --> 00:42:58,234
Hey.

616
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:02,344
What?

617
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:06,375
Good luck.

618
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,115
Hey.

619
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:15,224
Where's the car key?

620
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:20,595
What's going on?

621
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,425
What?

622
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:29,034
- 1, 2, 3, 4... - National treasure number six.

623
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:33,534
It's the largest and tallest stone tower of the unified Silla period.

624
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:35,805
It's geographically located in the center of our country,

625
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:38,115
so it's sometimes called the Center Tower.

626
00:43:38,345 --> 00:43:39,744
There are more than seven stories.

627
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:42,315
Hey, it says "Seven-story Stone Pagoda".

628
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:45,355
I'll be off first.

629
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:48,724
Ms. Son. Ms. Son.

630
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:51,224
You're going to abandon your student? Hey, Ms. Son.

631
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:55,595
Gosh, I didn't know either.

632
00:43:55,595 --> 00:43:58,964
If I had known Mr. Park was drawing such a big picture,

633
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:00,194
I wouldn't have sent Bok Su there.

634
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:01,905
We were both there when Mr. Park came as our client.

635
00:44:04,204 --> 00:44:06,375
Plus, it's just work. Bok Su's there for work.

636
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,345
I'm going there for work as well.

637
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,274
Bok Su's the most important thing in my life.

638
00:44:12,744 --> 00:44:15,714
Ms. Yang, please draw a line between personal and private matters.

639
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:16,784
Hey.

640
00:44:17,484 --> 00:44:21,885
When has it ever been good when Soo Jeong got involved?

641
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:22,984
It was like this a long time ago.

642
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:25,625
And now that Bok Su's going to school, our sales got cut in half...

643
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,625
because our ace is no longer working.

644
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:36,204
Get out of the way. I'll drive.

645

646
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:18,145
It'll be a field trip, so shouldn't we give it a try as well?

647
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,484
Gosh, you're very good.

648
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:58,214
I wonder who taught you. He must've been a great teacher.

649
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,895
- You don't know how to ride a bike? - No.

650
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:08,095
Gosh, I can't believe you don't know how to do something.

651
00:46:08,095 --> 00:46:10,125
Riding a bike doesn't get me good grades.

652
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,565
If I have time to ride a bike,

653
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:13,165
I'd use that time to memorize another English vocabulary.

654
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,934
Okay, then we should start from the very basics.

655
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:18,875
That's right.

656
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,655
Hey, Soo Jeong.

657
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:38,555
Why didn't you ever learn how to ride a bike?

658
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:41,494
Because no one ever taught me.

659
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:42,764
What?

660
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:44,089
Never mind.

661
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:46,994
But I have to say, it's not that hard.

662
00:46:48,365 --> 00:46:50,875
Soo Jeong, that's because your sweetheart...

663
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:53,175
is making sure the bike stays in balance.

664
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:56,004
That's why you're able to ride it so comfortably.

665
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:59,214
Next time, I'll teach you so that you'll be able to ride alone.

666
00:47:00,214 --> 00:47:03,345
Hurry up and ride faster. You're going way too slow.

667
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:04,385
Hey.

668
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,055
Do you really want me to make you sweat?

669
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:07,315
Here we go.

670
00:47:26,675 --> 00:47:29,204
I haven't ridden a bike in so long.

671
00:47:29,905 --> 00:47:30,974
This is nice.

672
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:06,944
It's a very educational experience.

673
00:48:09,944 --> 00:48:11,014
Let's go.

674
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,934
Boundaries are there to be crossed.

675
00:48:27,635 --> 00:48:28,665
Son Soo Jeong.

676
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:35,774
Bok Su!

677
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:40,075
Kang Bok Su!

678
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,415
Bok Su!

679
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:47,214
- Faster. - Stop it.

680
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:49,684
Bok Su.

681
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,365
Long time no see, Soo Jeong.

682
00:48:56,724 --> 00:48:57,794
You're still pretty.

683
00:48:57,794 --> 00:48:58,994
Pretty?

684
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:00,694
She's gotten so old.

685
00:49:00,835 --> 00:49:02,934
What? She looks just the same.

686
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:05,635
Hey, that's all makeup. Can't you tell?

687
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:06,774
Not at all.

688
00:49:06,774 --> 00:49:07,905
Hey, Gyeong Hyeon.

689
00:49:08,105 --> 00:49:10,405
Well, I...

690
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:13,845
run a small business.

691
00:49:14,944 --> 00:49:15,944
I'm the CEO.

692
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:17,514
I'm the team manager of the Sales Team.

693
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,385
Bok Su is the team manager of the Business Team.

694
00:49:19,514 --> 00:49:21,125
Team manager? Me?

695
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,085
Yes, you got a promotion a few days ago.

696
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:26,224
I gave you a big promotion.

697
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,964
It's just the three of us. Team manager doesn't mean anything.

698
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,024
What kind of company gives a promotion...

699
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:30,794
without letting the employee know?

700
00:49:30,794 --> 00:49:33,034
Hey, never mind then. I've changed my mind.

701
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:34,635
You are demoted.

702
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:35,805
Mr. CEO, please.

703
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:37,135
I'll die for your company.

704
00:49:37,135 --> 00:49:39,135
I'll die with Bok Su for your company.

705
00:49:39,135 --> 00:49:41,405
Of course

706
00:49:41,405 --> 00:49:44,004
We have such good teamwork.

708
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:52,555
Why did you follow me all the way here?

709
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:54,184
I have a tight schedule today.

710
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:55,254
Is this it?

711
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:56,585
Let's go.

(Astronomical Science Museum)

713
00:50:17,675 --> 00:50:20,744
Hey, can you see the stars during the day?

714
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:23,244
You observe the sun during the day.

715
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:30,125
What's with you? You never gave me something to drink.

716
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,294
Never mind then.

717
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,065
Soo Jeong.

718
00:50:37,464 --> 00:50:40,895
I won't ask you twice. So think carefully before you answer.

719
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,135
Do you...

720
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,944
still like Bok Su?

721
00:50:56,145 --> 00:50:57,284
You know what?

722
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,514
Not answering a question...

723
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,184
can be considered lying.

724
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:05,294
You might not think that's lying.

725
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:08,024
But nine years ago, you led the kids...

726
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,825
to believe that you were from a rich family.

727
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:14,234
What I'm saying is that, if you sit on the fence...

728
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:16,264
and let Bok Su fall for you,

729
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:17,734
it's your fault.

730
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:21,405
So if you don't like him,

731
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:23,345
make yourself clear.

732
00:51:34,254 --> 00:51:36,655
Gyeong Hyeon, should we have a team dinner?

733
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:38,395
That's a good idea.

734
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,355
Should we get chicken soup?

735
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:55,675
How about chicken soup?

736
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:57,175
Should we ask Bok Su?

737
00:51:57,175 --> 00:51:58,815
No. Well...

738
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,444
- Bok Su... - What?

739
00:52:00,444 --> 00:52:01,585
What are you doing?

740
00:52:09,385 --> 00:52:11,425
Let's go, Soo Jeong.

741
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:12,425
What?

742
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:39,454
Well... You can let go now.

743
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:44,355
Okay.

744
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:51,964
By the way, this wasn't on the schedule.

745
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:55,635
I really wanted to visit this place.

746
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:03,444
Isn't it pretty?

747
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:06,044
Don't you feel like you're surrounded by stars?

748
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:10,085
Yes. It's really pretty.

749
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:13,815
Do you remember that place?

750
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:16,784
The place where we saw the nightscape.

751
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,694
The world...

752
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,825
seen from that place twinkled like this.

753
00:53:31,905 --> 00:53:33,534
Yes, I remember.

754
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,575
Since then, I've never been there.

755
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,044
I thought so.

756
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:41,784
Because I never saw you.

757
00:53:44,855 --> 00:53:47,984
I went there often for the past nine years.

758
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:51,625
Every time I felt frustrated.

759
00:53:54,925 --> 00:53:56,524
Every time I missed you.

760
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,974
Don't you hate me?

761
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:13,214
Because of you, I had a dream.

762
00:54:13,774 --> 00:54:15,115
And it has come true.

763
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:19,784
If what happened didn't happen then,

764
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:23,284
you might be living a different life.

765
00:54:23,284 --> 00:54:24,284
You can...

766
00:54:26,655 --> 00:54:28,595
make my dream come true now.

767
00:54:29,964 --> 00:54:31,165
How?

768
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,595
Did you forget my dream?

769
00:54:36,504 --> 00:54:39,474
Son Soo Jeong's boyfriend.

770
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:52,885
I thought you hated me.

771
00:54:55,055 --> 00:54:58,055
Back then, the only thing that mattered was my pain.

772
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:01,294
- I knew you'd never... - You just...

773
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:07,694
You just said what you saw.

774
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:09,234
Yes.

775
00:55:09,534 --> 00:55:11,704
That's what I told myself for nine years.

776
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:15,504
"I didn't lie. So it's not my fault."

777
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,315
But someone told me that...

778
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:23,014
not telling what should say is...

779
00:55:24,014 --> 00:55:25,214
also lying.

780
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:28,454
She was right.

781
00:55:29,254 --> 00:55:31,724
"I don't have to be sorry for him."

782
00:55:33,224 --> 00:55:35,194
I kept telling myself that.

783
00:55:35,494 --> 00:55:36,595
But actually...

784
00:55:38,865 --> 00:55:41,264
I felt sorry every day.

785
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,905
Bok Su.

786
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:51,375
I'm really sorry.

787
00:55:53,244 --> 00:55:55,315
I'm sorry I didn't believe you back then.

788
00:55:56,014 --> 00:55:57,385
I...

789
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:21,905
I'm really okay now.

790
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:27,645
Because you're with me.

791
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:31,514
For nine years...

792
00:56:33,415 --> 00:56:35,155
I've been trying to forget you.

793
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:42,294
It's a good thing I didn't.

794
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:50,434
You're still a fool, Bok Su.

795
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:53,075
You haven't changed at all.

796
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:08,145
(My Strange Hero)

797
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:10,474
Are we a couple starting today?

798
00:59:10,474 --> 00:59:11,544
Let's go on a date.

799
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:12,744
I want to make you happy.

800
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:15,385
I'm not the one who can make you feel not lonely.

801
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,915
Ms. Son, you got a boyfriend, right?

802
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:20,254
A teacher is dating her student in school?

803
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:21,454
Se Ho, what are you trying to do?

804
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:23,284
I've kept it for a long time.

805
00:59:23,284 --> 00:59:25,694
I will never lose your heart.

806
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:27,655
Will you make my dream come true?
