00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,349
Kang...

2
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,222
Bok Su?

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,911
That's great.

4
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,758
I saved her, so...

5
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,939
Ms. Son!

6
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,308
give me 500 dollars...

7
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:05,848
- Gosh. - Open your eyes.

8
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,000
- Plus... - Goodness. What do I do?

9
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,219
Ms. Son, don't die. Please open your eyes.

10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,018
Gosh. Get out.

11
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,758
- Get out. - Mister. Save my teacher.

12
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,173
Ms. Son

13
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,113
Please save her.

14
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,482
- The ambulance is here. - Step aside.

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,359
Excuse me.

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,875
Check if she breathes first and...

17
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,280
She's breathing.

18
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:57,812
1, 2, 3.

19
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,686
Excuse me. Make way.

20
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,077
(Episode 3)

21
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,750
Is she up?

22
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:40,379
By the way, do you know my teacher? Why are you still here?

23
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,190
Is Son Soo Jeong...

24
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,461
a teacher?

25
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,601
- Yes. - Why did she try to die?

26
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,340
I wasn't really trying to die,

27
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,279
but things got out of hand after I posted something online...

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,370
I'm not talking about you.

29
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,070
What?

30
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,359
Ms. Son? I don't know.

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,551
She told me we should just die together.

32
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:06,691
Anyway, thank you for saving her.

33
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,234
Ms. Son Soo Jeong's guardian? She woke up.

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,508
Saying thanks isn't enough.

35
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:18,102
Take this and thank me properly next time.

36
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,979
(Your Request)

37
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,465
"Your Request"?

38
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,100
Oh Young Min.

39
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,382
Oh Young Min, is he the one who saved you?

40
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,759
Yes.

41
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,859
He's the one who saved him!

42
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,329
You put your life on the line and saved someone.

43
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,229
You're a local hero. Please say a few words.

44
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,341
I was just...

45
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,192
He's so handsome.

46
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,900
You can't do this here. Please leave.

47
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,849
- I was leaving... - Please say something.

48
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,092
Oh Young Min!

49
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,511
Kang...

50
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,682
Bok Su?

51
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,268
Ms. Son. Ms. Son, can you hear me?

52
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,693
Ms. Son.

53
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,410
It's you, Young Min. It was you.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,888
I'm glad. I'm so glad.

55
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,888
We almost died, Ms. Son.

56
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,930
Thank you.

57
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,888
I would've died without getting to see my grandma.

58
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,586
Actually, it wasn't me...

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,510
Young Min.

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,414
- Young Min! - Mom!

61
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,856
My son. Gosh.

62
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,522
Everything's all right now.

63
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,991
Thank you, Ms. Son. Thank you so much.

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,229
Thank you.

65
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,219
I know you're a machine, but don't be like this.

66
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,179
I almost died because of you.

67
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,748
I still have 15 more months left to pay for you.

68
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,729
It worked. It worked.

69
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,092
Kim Myung Ho.

70
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,523
Pick it up. Please pick up.

71
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,151
Honey.

72
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,706
If you want, press number one.

73
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,309
What are you doing? Don't you want...

74
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:42,290
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

75
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:44,540
You little...

76
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,269
gun!

77
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,568
Do you know what kind of money that was?

78
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:52,368
It was the insurance money we got for my dad's accident.

79
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,169
My grandma was so sick,

80
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,539
but she never went to the hospital.

81
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,138
It was the price she got for her son's life,

82
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,059
so she couldn't touch it.

83
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,064
She had it hidden deeply,

84
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,649
and I was stupid enough to hand it to you for a full-time job.

85
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,518
Yes. It's my fault. It was my fault,

86
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:12,649
but the amount is too big.

87
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,114
I just almost killed myself in Han River.

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,188
Now that I'm out, the world looks different.

89
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,399
It's funny. I'm not scared of anything.

90
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,599
You! I'll find you no matter what...

91
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,128
and teach you how I'm feeling right now.

92
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,238
Kim Myung Ho, you better hide well.

93
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:30,542
Once I find you, I'll rip off every strand of hair!

94
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:34,947
Kim Myung Ho, you're as good as dead.

95
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,680
Excuse me.

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,790
I almost died today.

97
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,202
Could you spare me a drumstick to congratulate me?

98
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,731
Please bless my new life.

99
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,802
Thank you.

100
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,428
"S" high school's student, Oh, came back to us...

101
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,599
after making many citizens worry.

102
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,068
Today around 2pm, Oh tried...

103
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,529
to commit suicide at Han River.

104
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,938
Thanks to his teacher and a brave man...

105
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,010
Hey, hey.

106
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,251
That woman is me.

107
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,938
I'm not a criminal. Why did they blur me?

108
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,839
He jumped into the water and saved her.

109
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,506
His bravery received huge applause.

110
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,649
Many community groups showed up...

111
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,204
in front of "S" high school which caused this incident...

112
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:57,870
Bok Su?

113
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,301
It really was Bok Su.

114
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,839
Do you know what kind of money that was?

115
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,808
It was the insurance money we got for my dad's accident.

116
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:21,019
My grandma was so sick, but she never went to the hospital.

117
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,448

118
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,408
so she couldn't touch it.

119
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,641
Just ignore it.

120
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,340
It's none of your business.

121
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,811
Kang, a citizen...

122
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,299
Wake up, Son Soo Jeong.

123
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,290
This is no time to reminisce about the past.

124
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,683
I have to find that money.

125
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,558
A source at the hospital said that Oh returned safely...

126
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,058
into the arms of his family.

127
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,857
The female teacher also didn't get any major external injuries...

128
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,299
and is now recovering...

129
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,572
Kang Bok Su?

130
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,828
Gosh.

131
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,399
She is showing signs of a minor cold.

132
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,289
Bok Su is still so nosy.

133
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,169
(Sulsong High School)

134
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,251
Ms. Son, you're so cool!

135
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:55,879
You jumped into the river to save Young Min.

136
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,478
You're so awesome. You're the best.

137
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,578
Go, Soo Jeong.

138
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,919
- Go, Soo Jeong. - Go, Soo Jeong.

139
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,149
- Go, Soo Jeong. - Go, Soo Jeong.

140
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,159
We were all worried about him, but Young Min is back.

141
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,301
Let's applaud for him.

142
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:16,915
Go to your seat.

143
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,855
Get ready for class.

144
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,004
If the monk doesn't like the temple, he should leave.

145
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,939
I came here because I like the discriminatory system.

146
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:35,553
If they change their teaching system because of you,

147
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:36,900
I'll make you pay for that.

148
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:38,909
You're such a loser.

149
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,588
Many community groups showed up in front of "S" high school...

150
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:49,228
which caused this incident and they are demanding a closure.

151
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:52,401
"S" high school has yet to take any action...

152
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,968
They must have nothing better to do.

153
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:59,999
That's what I mean. I guess they have nothing to do.

154
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,598
It's no time for you to be talking about others.

155
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,348
The situation is getting serious.

156
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,149
A petition has been handed in to the Blue House.

157
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,816
Also, the number of people in the demonstration is growing.

158
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,041
Public opinion is scarier than the law.

159
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,428
What is this about the Administration Office?

160
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,529
It's nothing much.

161
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,428
Why was an anonymous letter sent to the Education Office...

162
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:22,428
if it's nothing?

163
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,247
Who was it? Who?

164
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:28,794
Do you really want this school to close down?

165
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,239
You should think before you act.

166
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,400
Here's another person who doesn't think.

167
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,749
Ms. Son, why didn't you report about Young Min...

168
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,989
when he called you?

169
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,010
How dare a contract worker decide on something like that?

170
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,300
Pardon?

171
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,669
I guess he found this contract worker...

172
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,841
the most trustworthy.

173
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,170
Ms. Son, did you hurt your head yesterday?

174
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,078
What's with your attitude?

175
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,423
Mr. Kim.

176
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,649
If it hadn't been for Ms. Son,

177
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,276
- Young Min would have died. - Forget it.

178
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,843
In any case, the order's all wrong.

179
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,139
Everyone, watch your mouth.

180
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,217
I'll make sure to find out who wrote that anonymous letter!

181
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,831
There's not a peaceful day at this darn school.

183
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,577
Gosh, the day's starting off with such a heavy atmosphere.

184
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,078
Who sent the anonymous letter?

185
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,928
Why is that even important?

186
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,078
What's important is the truth.

187
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,649
Plus, there are rumors among the students...

188
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,821
saying our school receives money to hire full-time teachers.

189
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,580
What kind of nonsense is that?

190
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,000
Ms. Son.

191
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:01,927
I'm sorry that the school has such a heavy atmosphere.

192
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,068
No, it's okay.

193
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:07,438
Don't take what the vice principal said to heart.

194
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,739
"Thank you."

195
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,169
"Thanks to you, our school didn't end up..."

196
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,190
"becoming a school that kills its students."

197
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,708
That's what he should've said.

198
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,791
I agree.

199
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,930
The least he could do was offer her a full-time position.

200
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,023
Are you okay?

201
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,270
Yes, I'm really okay.

202
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,218
I'm sorry for worrying you.

203
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,789
Gosh, that's a relief.

204
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,619
I was so worried that you might not come back.

205
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,828
Then I guess you can prepare the test questions for today.

206
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,828
Oh, right. You can also prepare the contest questions as well.

207
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,259
You're free during the weekend, right?

208
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,269
You even need to supervise the exam.

209
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,869
But I'm pretty sure Ms. Son isn't feeling too well.

210
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,968
Then who's going to do it? Do you want to do it, Mr. Ma?

211
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,369
What? Me?

212
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,739
Well... I...

213
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,437
Ms. Hong, you're so mean. She almost died.

214
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,318
Ms. Son, I know this may sound a little too much,

215
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,119
but with your sense of vocation and responsibility,

216
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,755
you're still going to be in charge of the after-school club, right?

217
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:04,588
Of course.

218
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:06,588
You're going to take the paid supplementary classes,

219
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,245
and I'll have to take the unpaid ones, right?

220
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,428
Ms. Son, what's wrong with you?

221
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,581
We're all just trying to teach you as your seniors here.

222
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,669
Mr. Kim, all you ever make me do is bring you tea.

223
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,639
So what exactly are you teaching me?

224
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,002
Are you trying to teach me how to practice a tea ceremony?

225
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,063
Well, I've had enough.

226
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,470
You can teach the other seniors here.

227
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,366
After all, you're also their senior.

228
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,131
Ms. Son.

229
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,857
When... When did I...

230
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,845
When did I make you do that?

231
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,123
I need to make questions for the test.

232
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,860
I hope you all have a great day today.

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,262
My goodness, I guess she did hurt her head.

234
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,121
It must be serious.

235
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,640
My gosh, I'm doomed.

236
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,738
I was going to live quietly.

237
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,338
What if I get fired before I find Kim Myung Ho?

238
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,687
I might as well just stitch my mouth up.

"and you set a good example for others."

244
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,626
"Therefore, I give you the Brave Citizen Award."

245
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,279
- Thank you. - We're very impressed.

(The Brave Citizen Award)

247
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,104
Can the two of you at both ends step outside of the photo?

248
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,430
Oh, okay.

249
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:47,222
Can the two of you step outside of the photo?

250
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,122
Can you step further away?

251
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,612
Okay, I'll take the photo.

252
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,153
One, two.

253
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,141
This guy who saved Oh Young Min and the contract teacher...

254
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:05,622
Why does he look familiar?

255
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:08,402
Well, he was involved...

256
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,044
in the past incident regarding Se Ho.

257
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,518
Are you saying he's Kang Bok Su?

258
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:20,088
How did you handle things with Kang Bok Su back then?

259
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,098
After that incident, the school induced him...

260
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,715
to drop out of school.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,499
He wasn't able to graduate high school?

262
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,999
I'm worried that Se Ho might...

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,697
get hurt due to this incident.

264
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,830
Do you think my son is that weak?

265
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,566
You can bring Bok Su back to school.

266
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,531
Se Ho.

267
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:43,561
Bring him back to school?

"A senior that saved a student that goes to the school he used to."

269
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,627

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,354

"offers him a second chance."

273
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,308
People will quiet down once Bok Su returns to school.

274
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:12,771
After all, people love heroic stories.

275
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:15,918
You're more like my son now.

276
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,131
And Mom, you should announce

277
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,217
that you'll take full responsibility and step down from your position.

278
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,617
Isn't that why you wanted me to come here?

279
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,285
Shouldn't you show everyone

280
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:32,287
that the school is willing to reform?

281
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,781
You're right.

282
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,513
That's why I asked you to come.

283
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,265
What are you doing? Proceed with the process immediately.

284
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,749
Hey, everyone. Look at this.

285
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,780
This is the Brave Citizen Award.

286

- My goodness. - Congratulations.

287
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,598
Is there anyone here who has a son like Bok Su?

288
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,216
- No way. - I do.

289
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,525
- My gosh, let's give him a hand. - Congratulations.

290
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,511
Bok Su.

291
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,250
Here we go.

292
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:15,450
Here we go.

293
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,842
Okay, everyone. Kang Bok Su!

294
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,341
- Kang Bok Su. - Kang Bok Su.

295
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,508
Kang Bok Su!

296
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:28,192
- Kang Bok Su. - Kang Bok Su.

297
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,449
- Why are you here? - Why do you think?

298
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,797
This is all because I taught you well.

299
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,398
My gosh, I didn't even learn much from you.

300
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:41,450
You punk.

301
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,521
Did you meet...

302
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:51,859
Soo Jeong?

303
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,571
Why would I meet her?

304
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,489
I think there's a reason...

305
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,823
why you guys ended up crossing paths like this.

306
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,719
- You should meet her... - And do what?

307
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,758
It's all useless now.

308
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,251
Bok Su.

309
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,130
You think of yourself as an adult, don't you?

310
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:26,949
But to me, you're still an 18-year-old kid.

311
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,253
You're a kid that's running away from his past because he's scared.

312
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,275
What do you know?

313
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,139
I feel like...

314
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,068
you guys were forced to grow up...

315
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:45,989
with bruises in your hearts.

316
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:48,059
So you guys should meet up.

317
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:49,958
- Meet her and... - That's enough.

318
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:51,819
You should go now.

319
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,936
You need to overcome your past in order to move forward.

320
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,648
Your scars may fade away so that you can barely endure them.

321
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:59,366
They never disappear.

322
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,570
Bok Su.

323
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,270
Stand up.

324
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,839
You too, Soo Jeong.

325
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,018
Everyone, give them a round of applause.

326
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,338
This group's grades for Korean...

327
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,461
increased the most in our class.

328
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,653
Bok Su's Korean grades rose by 50 points.

329
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,648
But I was shocked to find out that he still has...

330
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,508
a long way to go.

331
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,929
You punk.

332
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,516
But you still did a great job, Bok Su.

333
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,876
Soo Jeong, you worked really hard.

334
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,799
Okay, that's enough.

335
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,299
Erase what's on the chalkboard, and get ready for class.

336
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,562
No, wait. Mr. Park.

337
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,350

339
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,623
I'm all done.

340
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,363
I must be crazy.

341
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,791
Hey, Soo Jeong.

342
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:43,848
Our classmates might get the wrong idea.

343
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,739
Why do you keep calling me here?

344
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,061
Halt.

345
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:49,429
Attention.

346
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:50,700
What?

347
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,272
"You Can Do It Award."

348
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:56,128
"Kang Bok Su is a man that achieved a miracle..."

00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:58,128
"by getting four times his original score."

350
00:21:58,129 --> 00:21:59,898
"Although he only got 65 points,"

351
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,338
"he still has potential for a lot more development."

352
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:03,799
"Therefore, this award goes to him."

355
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,230
an additional prize?

356
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:20,881
Are you serious? Give that back if you don't like it.

357
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,677
Give it back. Give it back.

358
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,300
From now on,

359
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,781
call me "The Man of Miracle".

00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:30,410
Okay?

361
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,960
Where's the additional prize? Is there no prize?

362
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:37,720
No.

363
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:43,997
- What? - Hey, Soo Jeong.

364
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,373
Why do you conserve love?

365
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,870
I'm...

366
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,727
really, super angry.

367
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:05,299
My patience has reached its limits. How can there be...

368
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,428
no additional prize? Why does everyone just talk...

369
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,409
Well... Why so suddenly...

370
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:58,971
If you tell the kids, I'll kill you.

371
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,003
And it was at that age...

372
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,480
Poetry has come into my life.

373
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,011
I don’t know,

374
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,480
I don’t know where it came from,

375
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,526
from winter or a river.

376
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,262
I don’t know how or when.

377
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,780
No,

378
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:55,608
they were not voices,

379
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:57,326
they were not words,

380
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,801
nor silence.

381
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,204
I did not know what to say,

382
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:08,654
my mouth couldn't speak names,

383
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,705
my eyes were blind,

384
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,964
and something started in my soul.

385
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,628
My heart broke loose...

386
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:22,116
on the wind.

387
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,858
(You Can Do It Award)

388
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,590
Yes.

389
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,621
I need to find someone.

390
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:53,945
(Kim Myung Ho)

391
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,128
(Writ of Execution)

392
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,769
What did he do with the money? Why does he live in this hole?

393
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,810
Gambling.

394
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,958
That jerk gambled...

395
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,457
Does he gamble?

396
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,509
Yes.

397
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,832
Did my dad scam you?

398
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,449
No, I want to thank your dad,

399
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,088
so I need to see him. Where could he be?

400
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:25,453
He doesn't come home for a while after he scams people.

401
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,858
Then where's your mom?

402
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:29,011
I don't have a mom.

403
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,598
Did he leave you here alone then?

404
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,014
Do you want this?

405
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:41,609
(Episode 4 will air shortly.)

406
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,566
Kids should eat proper food, not ramyeon.

407
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:49,993
(Episode 4)

408
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,618
- What? - Why are you so naive?

409
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,548
What are you saying?

410
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,159
I'm not naive.

411
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,583
Dad leaves me here alone on purpose.

412
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:03,203
So I'd look pitiful.

413
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,748
I can cook well.

414
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,456
Here. Take this.

415
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,764
Gosh. I can't believe this.

416
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,913
Kim Myung Ho. I'm going to catch you at all cost.

417
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,329
This guy is really crazy.

418
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,400
Where's he now?

419
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,759
Why are you looking for him? Who is he?

420
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,547
He's a part-time administrator at Sulsong High School.

421
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:45,654
The teacher I saved was...

422
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,359
- Son Soo Jeong. - What?

423
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:51,661
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

424
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,339
I knew she looked familiar.

425
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,925
By the way, why did you save her?

426
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,292
This guy scammed her.

427
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:02,349
She told the student who tried to kill himself to die together.

428
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,718
You should've let her die.

429
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,173
Don't you remember what she did to you?

430
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,339
Don't look for him. Hey.

431
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:11,429
What? Did Soo Jeong ask you to find him?

432
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,713
Did you get a request?

433
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,168
So what if you find him? What will you do?

434
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,168
Soo Jeong must've seen the footage.

435
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:20,138
If she did, she should at least come here

436
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:21,211
and say thank you...

437
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:24,438
If saying thank you is hard, she should pay you.

438
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,792
She's terrible.

439
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:26,949
Are you done?

440
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,559
Yes.

441
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,149
Life is all about real-life experience.

442
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,038
A smart girl like her can get scammed too.

443
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,789
Hey, he's coming.

444
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,608
- 5, 4, - What?

445
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,213
3, 2, 1.

446
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,641
- Gosh. - Hey.

447
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,802
Look at you. You did something bad, didn't you?

448
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,081
You hid something, right?

449
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,594
Something bad? This isn't a school.

450
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,578
Why are you here again?

451
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:01,570
I'm not here to see you. I'm here to see Bok Su.

452
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,665
What? Why?

453
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,660
Come back to school, Bok Su.

454
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:23,868
That's the funniest thing I've heard this year.

455
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,424
Sir, are you drunk?

456
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,838
He's 27. Why would he go back to school?

457
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,921
That's right.

458
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,752
Why would I go back there?

459
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,402
Why would Bok Su go there?

460
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,264
- Hello. - Mom.

461
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,749
Well, Bok Su saved a student.

462
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,819
The school wants to let Bok Su return to school.

463
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,193
They want to give him a second chance to learn...

464
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:51,572
A second chance?

465
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,659
I don't want to hear it. Just leave.

466
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,168
Well... Ma'am.

467
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,523
I understand how you feel.

468
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,568
But Bok Su can't live like this...

469
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,084
What's wrong with living like this?

470
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,335
What's wrong with living in place of someone else?

471
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,648
I, too, want to live Bok Su's life for him.

472
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:15,689
I think about that hundreds of times a day.

473
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,921
Don't try to shake up these kids. Just leave.

474
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,588
- Ma'am... - Leave!

475
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,013
Wait. Please listen...

476
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,887
Mom, why did you come all the way here?

477
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,451
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

478
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,409
Don't be in touch with him.

479
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,237
He's not your teacher anymore.

480
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,460
I'll get going.

481
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:45,279
Mom, wait...

482
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,896
I'm leaving. Don't see me out.

483
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,567
How brazen of him.

484
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,584
Don't they know what my son has gone through because of themselves?

485
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,917
Mom! Mom! Hold on, hold on.

486
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:59,829
I told you to eat. Why did you follow me out?

487
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,528
Gosh. The one with the blue lid is yours.

488
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,869
Why? Are they different?

489
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,324
I put two fried eggs in that one.

490
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,692
Darn that teacher.

491
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:10,109
Why did you bother packing food?

492
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,958
I can just buy food here.

493
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,236
I came so I could see my son one more time.

494
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,293
Well, do you...

495
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,970
want to go back to that school?

496
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,100
Gosh, no.

497
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,059
Exactly.

498
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,228
Back in the days, we thought we'd be in trouble without school,

499
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:36,669
but the world changed.

500
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,398
The fourth industrial revolution is just around the corner.

501
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,368
Wow, Mom. You're smart.

502
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,208
Watch it.

503
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:46,338
You must be so happy you're more stupid than your mom.

504
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,723
Just go in and eat.

505
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:50,323
Thank you for the food, Mom.

506
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,960
Take care.

507
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,929
Ms. Son, I'm going home early because my kid's sick.

508
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,828
Can you take over the extra classes?

509
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:12,527
I know you're busy, but please check on the weapon club.

510
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:14,659
Good luck with coming up with exam questions.

511
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,578
Yes, yes. I'll do them all...

512
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:23,125
since I'm on contract.

513
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,501
Mr. Park, how did it go?

514
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,104
He doesn't want to come back.

515
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,507
So you just said okay and came back?

516
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:36,448
I told you to make him come back.

517
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,548
The board chairman will get mad.

518
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,739
Why doesn't he want to come?

519
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,289
I guess no one would want to at that age.

520
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:45,228
Anyway, you must bring Kang Bok Su back here...

521
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:46,552
at all cost.

522
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,020
Kang Bok Su?

523
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,969
Why are they talking about him all of a sudden?

524
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,442
Ms. Son, can we talk?

525
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:02,812
Mr. Park. I'm a little...

526
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:05,068
sick right now.

527
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:08,592
I have to make up test questions, and go check on the club...

528
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:11,239
Okay.

529
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,771
We'll talk later.

530
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:22,549
Go ahead.

531
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:27,179
So? If Kang Bok Su doesn't return,

532
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,907
are there other ways to cover up the current issue we're faced with?

533
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,301
Make sure you make him return.

534
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,227
That'll make things look good. Make it happen. Okay?

535
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,512
They can't do a single thing right.

536
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,402
Does Bok Su not want to come back?

537
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,848
I figured it'd be hard.

538
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,351
I'll go and get him.

539
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:54,784
- You? - Yes.

540
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,520
We're friends, after all.

541
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,451
I thought you were going to run instead of me.

542
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:14,509
Hey, you're talking nonsense.

543
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,328
My client is your wife.

544
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,658
I'm making you run instead of her.

545
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:19,710
Do you get it now?

546
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:20,911
Okay, come on.

547
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,511
Let's go.

548
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,036
Hey. Are you satisfied with me eating instead of you?

549
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:45,706
Watching you eat makes me full.

550
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,466
This is like an eating television show just for myself.

551
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:50,903
Saving.

552
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:54,595
Can you make more sounds when you chew?

553
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,647
- Please smack your lips. - Okay.

554
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,650
My gosh.

555
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,220
More.

556
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,451
Gosh.

557
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:11,125
My gosh.

558
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:27,769
Yes.

559
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,029
Are you sure the request was for us to deliver...

560
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,699
just one jjajangmyeon in their place?

561
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,791
Yes. They wanted it from your mother's restaurant.

562
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,968
There are so many crazy people.

563
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,192
Also, I think we'll be able to locate Kim Myung Ho soon.

564
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,800
Okay. Bye.

565
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,079
We love all of your requests.

566
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,753
It's been a while, Bok Su.

567
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,290
Were you surprised?

568
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,339
Has it been nine years?

569
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:26,870
You're still the same.

570
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,847
I thought meeting like this would be more dramatic,

571
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:38,239
so I prepared for it.

572
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:52,666
Enjoy your food, sir.

573
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,134
I have one more request to ask you.

574
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,570
Come back to school.

575
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:08,748
- What? - It's my request for you to come.

576
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,299
- It's simple. - Are you crazy?

577
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,339
Just imagine you're doing this for another student...

578
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,218
until the public quiets down.

579
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,931
I'll give you as much money as you want.

580
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,179
I'm not crazy. Why would I go back?

581
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,574
Wasn't it upsetting to quit school?

582
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,520
Jerk.

583
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,831
It's your fault!

584
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,564
So you should come back.

585
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:34,702
I'll soon become...

586
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:36,643
the chairman of the board at Sulsong High School.

587
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,331
You were living well after making a fuss about dying.

588
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,842
I pitied you and tried to forgive you, but I was an idiot.

589
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,269
Shouldn't I be the one to forgive?

590
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,061
Obviously...

591
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,729
I'm the victim.

592
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,472
Think about it.

593
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,320
Darn.

594
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,581
Darn, Mom's going to yell at me.

595
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,218
- Yes, what is it? - Hey, Bok Su.

596
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,789
I think Kim Myung Ho's almost done.

597
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,416
He's leaving, he's leaving.

598
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,699
He got money from loan sharks too.

599
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,567
It's a matter of time before he goes back home.

600
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,960
Okay.

601
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,469
Kim Myung Ho.

602
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,900
Who are you?

603
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,070
Do you know me?

604
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,723
Yes, you swindler.

605
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,144
Stop chasing me.

606
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:01,368
I'm tired, Kim Myung Ho.

607
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:02,722
So let's go down now.

608
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,650
Darn.

609
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,191
Seriously...

610
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:14,466
Hey. Come down.

611
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,200
Come down now.

612
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,889
Please, just leave!

613
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,072
It's dangerous...

614
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,340
Hey.

615
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:42,771
She's my girlfriend, you jerk!

616
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,059
Mr. Park, I really didn't do it. I didn't push him.

617
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,029
Why would I push him?

618
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,529
Mr. Park, I held onto him until the end so that I could save him.

619
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,069
I really didn't push him off.

620
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,666
Thankfully, Se Ho woke up.

621
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:13,337
But he said...

622
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:15,489
you pushed him.

623
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:21,031
That crazy jerk.

624
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:27,623
Mr. Park, why would I push him?

625
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,559
Mr. Park, are you sure he didn't hurt his head...

626
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,358
after he fell?

627
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,228
There's no reason I'd do that to him!

628
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:36,311
Bok Su.

629
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:41,801
Soo Jeong already testified.

630
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,468
Bok Su, I know you didn't do it.

631
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:52,832
My gosh.

632
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,237
Bok Su really didn't do it.

633
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,361
- My gosh. - I'm serious.

634
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:00,803
This is driving me crazy.

635
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,920
Bok Su.

636
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,520
Soo Jeong.

637
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,390
Hey.

638
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,267
You know I didn't do it.

639
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,359
Let me go!

640
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,643
Soo Jeong, you know I didn't do it.

641
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,875
Why did you lie?

644
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,183
My gosh, stay still.

645
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,112
Sir, please.

646
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,520
Welcome.

647
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,520
You're late.

648
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:01,950
Yes.

649
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,149
Shim Ran, I'm so tired.

650
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,877
You look tired. Your face looks rotten.

(Hiring part-timer for convenience store)

652
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:15,018
Hey, how long do I need to work at a convenience store...

653
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,018
to save up 50,000 dollars?

654
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:17,039
50,000 dollars?

655
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:21,458
The minimum wage is 7.53 dollars per hour.

656
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:22,914
And let's say you work 10 hours a day.

657
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,685
Should I include the holiday pay?

658
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:30,038
Let's leave that out for now.

659
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:32,736
Then you'll earn 2,259 dollars a month.

660
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:33,789
And in one year,

661
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:37,248
you'll earn 27,180 dollars.

662
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:40,381
That means you'll have to work two years straight.

663
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,090
Two years?

664
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,889
Kim Myung Ho, that little...

665
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,089
You can bring one more.

666
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,908
Why? Are you pitying me right now?

667
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,916
No, we're holding a 1 plus 1 event for this product.

668
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,487
I finished making questions for the exam.

669
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,538
Starting from tomorrow, I'll be on a stakeout at Kim Myung Ho's house.

670
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:01,651
I can do this.

671
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:02,809
My goodness.

672
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,821
Kim Myung Ho?

673
00:46:14,549 --> 00:46:15,791
Long time no see.

674
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:19,361
Come here, you jerk.

675
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,859
Give me back my money. Give it back to me.

676
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,488
Give it back!

677
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,539
My gosh.

678
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,551
I didn't know things would turn out this way.

679
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,364
I don't have your money.

680
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,839
I swear I passed it on.

681
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,355
I didn't spend a single penny.

682
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:40,809
To whom? Who did you give it to?

683
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,750
Well...

684
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,395
You know the food chain, right?

685
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:48,960
What?

686
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,402
There's the sun.

687
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:56,689
The grass uses sunlight to photosynthesize.

688
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,749
And the grasshopper eats that grass.

689
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,656
Then the frog eats that grasshopper.

690
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:03,629
Has this guy gone nuts?

691
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,298
The frog gets eaten by the bird, and the bird gets eaten by the fox.

692
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:08,966
And the tiger, that's at the end of that food chain, eats that fox.

693
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,458
They all eat and get eaten.

694
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,907
Ms. Son, just think of me as the grass.

695
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,748
My money...

696
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:19,396
Where's my money?

697
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,649
Get over here. I'm going to put you in jail.

698
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,760
If you report me to the cops,

699
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:25,849
people will find out...

700
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,213
that you bribed me to get a full-time job.

701
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,348
Then you won't even be able to stay as a contract teacher.

702
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:33,474
You can't let that happen to you.

703
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,703
This is why people shouldn't try to cheat their way through life.

704
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:41,166
Even if anything bad happens, there's no one you can complain to.

705
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,556
What kind of absurd situation is this?

706
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,190
But wait.

707
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,192
Why did you come here?

708
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:52,467
Did you come here to confess what you did?

709
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,495
This good-looking jerk...

710
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,160
I mean...

711
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:58,161
That man...

712
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,530
No... No...

713
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,201
That's not it.

714
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,941
Anyway,

715
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,245
I'm very sorry.

716
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,988
I'll live the rest of my life atoning for what I did.

717
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:12,689
Well, then. Ms. Son,

718
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,857
I sincerely hope you become a full-time teacher.

719
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,304
Oh, my goodness.

720
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:40,069
You startled me.

721
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:43,279
Hey.

722
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,568
I didn't tell her a thing about you.

723
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:47,418
Don't even think about running away.

724
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,227
I'm good at finding people.

725
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:06,414
Get out here. Step out right now.

726
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,238
I know you're there, Bok Su.

727
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,580
Get out here. I know it's you.

728
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:15,154
Did you think I'd thank you if you did this for me?

729
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:34,789
You haven't changed at all.

730
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:36,529
You're still hot-tempered.

731
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:40,900
What's your deal?

732
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,244
Who are you to get involved?

733
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:47,224
I just wondered why a smart girl like you...

734
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:51,504
was in despair and tried to commit suicide.

735
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,038
And it turns out it was because you got scammed...

736
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:56,626
while trying to buy yourself a full-time position.

737
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,325
I never asked you to save me.

738
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:10,248
What's gotten into you?

739
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:12,449
If you're a decent human being, the least you can do is thank me.

740
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,712
People change, and that's the only way to survive.

741
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,958
I told you to just memorize it if you don't get it.

742
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:19,798
Is that why you're trying to bribe your way to becoming a teacher?

743
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:20,840
Just so you can survive?

744
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,498
People like you don't deserve to be a teacher.

745
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:25,944
And I don't need to memorize that to know.

746
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,815
Come to your senses, Bok Su.

747
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,609
Now that people recognize you and constantly ask you...

748
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,179
to come back to school,

749
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,705
does it make you feel like you've become some kind of big shot?

750
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,895
- What? - People...

751
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,718
are only interested in hot issues.

752
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:42,972
And you just got lucky and became the hot issue for now.

753
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:46,958
Sulsong High School is just trying to use you to cover up the incident.

754
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,058
Don't be cocky. Nothing changes.

755
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:50,389
You're still a dropout.

756
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,440
I'm going to go now.

757
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,000
Don't come back to school.

758
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,246
I don't even urinate facing the school.

759
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:22,731
(Board Chairman's Office)

760
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,950
Excuse me.

761
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,308
I know I'm just a contract teacher.

762
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,308
You might think I don't know my place.

763
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,663
But there's something I must say...

764
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:52,788
Kim Myung Ho from the administration office...

765
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:53,799
Son Soo Jeong.

766
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,515
Oh Se Ho?

767
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,833
What were you going to say earlier?

768
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,024
It's nothing.

769
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,106
Thank you for saving the student.

770
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,560
I did what I had to.

771
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:27,513
I didn't know you were the board chairman's son.

772
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,465
There are a lot of things you don't know about me.

773
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,033
You don't even know whom I've been watching.

774
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,076
Back then, you looked at only one thing.

775
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,669
You aren't here to talk about the past, right?

776
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,208
How dare you date my precious daughter?

777
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:45,268
Break up with him!

778
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:47,538
Mom, please quiet down.

779
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,708
Do you know what it feels like to be embarrassed?

780
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:50,379
Then, how can you date a guy like this?

781
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,025
This place is too noisy.

782
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:53,261
Should we go somewhere else?

783
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,639
- It's okay. - How much do you want?

784
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,919
How much do you want for breaking up with her?

785
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,960
50,000 dollars.

786
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,469
I'm sorry.

787
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:08,092
I think you can break up with someone for 50,000 dollars.

788
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,341
You're still funny.

789
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,380
Well,

790
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,887
I have a favor to ask you.

791
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,889
Help me make Bok Su come back to school.

792
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,377
You know Bok Su is the hot potato.

793
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,048
If you ask him to come back...

794
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:33,131
I need to go.

795
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,210
I heard you were close to Kim Myung Ho.

796
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,512
If you bring Kang Bok Su,

797
00:53:41,229 --> 00:53:42,674
I'll hire you as a permanent teacher.

798
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,511
You've helped me before.

799
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,420
What?

800
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,258
Please help me again this time.

801
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:15,421
- When did I... - Don't think too much about it.

802
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,447
This is good for both of us.

803
00:54:18,729 --> 00:54:21,769
I'll take it as a yes. Bye.

804
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:46,899
Don't you talk back to me.

805
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,647
What are you doing, Mom? Are you crazy?

806
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,798
I guess you were expecting this. This is what you deserve.

807
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,114
You stupid girl.

808
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:58,008
I'm sorry.

809
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:00,029
Getting drenched in water wasn't in the contract.

810
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,649
If my real boyfriend was here...

811
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,718
Why do women act like that?

812
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:12,982
How can they use their ex-boyfriend?

813
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,100
Excuse me.

814
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,193
Sir, Kang Bok Su is on the move.

815
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:24,426
You don't need to follow him anymore.

816
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,649
- Thanks. - Yes, sir.

817
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:41,631
I mean...

818
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,048
Why is she doing this to me?

819
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:46,589
She already ruined my life.

820
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,288
Still, I've been living quietly without grudges.

821
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:50,299
But...

822
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,329
Come back to school.

823
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,099
Isn't it upsetting to quit school?

824
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,929
Don't be cocky. Nothing changes.

825
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,228
You're still a dropout.

826
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,239
If you bring Kang Bok Su,

827
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,854
I'll hire you as a permanent teacher.

828
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,292
You've helped me before.

829
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:06,087
Shouldn't I be the one to forgive?

830
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,751
Obviously...

831
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,690
I'm the victim.

832
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,705
And now you're trying to do whatever you like with my life.

833
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,028
The new board chairman is...

834
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:27,291
an Ivy League graduate Oh Se Ho.

835
00:56:28,529 --> 00:56:29,829
If you bring Kang Bok Su,

836
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,314
I'll hire you as a permanent teacher.

837
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,193
He will do away with the old system...

838
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,935
and bring in an innovative new system.

839
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,988
If you're going to play with my life like this,

840
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,341
I will...

841
00:57:03,529 --> 00:57:05,348
play with you for good.

847
00:58:21,979 --> 00:58:23,050
Kang Bok Su?

848
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,443
Kang Bok Su.

849
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,430
Bok Su is back.

- I request to return to the school. - Your request has been accepted.

852
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,529
I, Kang Bok Su, will work hard.

853
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,128
Ms. Son, you'll be in charge of that class.

854
00:59:18,129 --> 00:59:19,499
- One is missing? - Who?

855
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,739
Bok Su, please be out of my life.

856
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,769
What was between me and you?

857
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:26,809
I thought there were a lot between us, but I guess I was wrong.

858
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,878
Is that everything you have to say to me?

859
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:30,378
What's left to say between us?

860
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:32,732
You don't have nothing to say? Then I'll help you remember.
