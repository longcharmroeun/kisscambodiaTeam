[reporter 1] We have an update
on the case that's captivated the nation.

322
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Today, the Juvenile Court

323
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,680
has delivered the verdict
on the Minnie and The Four Corpses case.

324
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,880
Both parties are charged
with involuntary manslaughter.

325
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,000
The school vehicle was parked
in a hazardous spot

326
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,120
which could have
potentially caused an accident.

327
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,720
Minnie has been sentenced to pay
ten grand in restitution

328
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,960
to each of the victims' families.

[reporter 1] In today's news,
key evidence has just been found.

487
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,040
We believe it will lead the police
to reopen the investigation

488
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,760
of the case of Minnie Four Corpses.

489
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,600
An anonymous source
has sent these pictures

490
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,160
to our station this morning.
Let's take a look at them together.

MINNIE FOUR CORPSES CASE TO REOPEN
AFTER KEY EVIDENCE IS FOUND

[reporter 1]
Besides the pictures that you're seeing,

493
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,120
there's also an audio clip.

494
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,240
The voice in the clip allegedly belongs
to Mr. Songkiat,

495
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,600
who is Minnie's father.

496
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,000
It appears that he was threatening
this anonymous person

497
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,080
not to leak the photos
that we are currently showing you.

498
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,520
[Songkiat] I'm only paying you once.

499
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,800
If these pictures ever show up again,

500
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,280
I won't be able to guarantee your safety.

501
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,280
[Yuri] From now on,

502
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
Mr. Songkiat…

503
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
won't be able to help out
his precious daughter.

504
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,920
There's only one way to end this hell.

505
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,200
It's this.
