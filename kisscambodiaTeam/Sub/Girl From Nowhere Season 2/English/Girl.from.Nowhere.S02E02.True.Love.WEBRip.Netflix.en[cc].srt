Teenage love is forever frowned upon.

We can't merge with the boys' school.
Just tell me what this is all about.

We have no other choice, Miss Naruemol.
Our school is running at a loss.

Our esteemed school…

is acclaimed for producing
highly virtuous ladies.

If you suddenly let those boys
swarm in here like pestering flies,

they will tarnish
our school's fine reputation.

We can keep our reputation,

These male students are like termites,
you know that.

Once they start eating away our home,
they'll never ever stop.

And that fine reputation
that we've established?

that I don't need your permission
to do anything.

43

I called you here

44
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,120
because as chief administrative officer
of the school,

45
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,600
you'll come up with our policies

46

I must say that I'm quite disappointed
by this decision of his.

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,560
I mean, our principal
practically opened the gate

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,920
for the enemy to take over our land.
Don't you think?

I actually don't think
it will do much harm at all.

56
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,160
Our students will have to meet boys
eventually one way or another, you know.

But this isn't the time in their life

They're at a very vulnerable age.

They're easily distracted.

The boys are also
at quite a precarious age.

and responsibility.

We must preserve our students' virtue

I'm well aware of the fine reputation
that our school has achieved.

So, I'd like to volunteer as the leader
to help us get through this moral crisis.

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,480
We'll implement the practice
of social distancing.

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,160
Boys and girls must keep distance
from each other.

160
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,040
[Naruemol]
Starting with the morning assembly,

161
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,400
girl and boy students will be kept
in separate lines at all times.

162
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,680
The girls will form a line
on the left side.

163
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,960
The boys will form a line
on the right side.

164
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,680
You may proceed.

165
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
[ominous music]

166
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,600
[Naruemol] From now on,

167
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,640
-you will be put in separate classes.
-[students reading out loud in unison]

168
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
This isn't only to preserve
the purity of the girls.

169
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,440
We'll also raise boys to be gentlemen.

170
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,160
[students reading out loud
in unison continues]

171
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,080
Run. Run faster. Run faster.

172
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,040
Run faster. Come on.

173
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,680
This is good for you.
Exercise is good for you.

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
It will make you sweat.

175
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,320
You must distract your obscene mind.

176
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,360
Thank you so much.

177
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,120
Chocolate has hereby been banned.

178
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,960

Well, kind of, yeah.

184
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,640
[Ploy] I feel so bad for the boys.
Look at them.

185
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,600
Their hands shake so much,
they can barely eat.

186
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,200
[Mind and Namnueng] Mm-hmm.

Pob says he's really tired.

192
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
Hang on. Do you have his phone number?

193
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
It's normal for friends
to exchange numbers.

194
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,800
[Namnueng] Ah.

195

Would you like me to add you
to the group chat?

What is this?

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,160
"Take you, take you, take you."

213

"Take you"?

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,400
I think you should look at the messages
more carefully.

He asked for your milk?

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,840
He asked to have my box of milk.
What do you think he meant by that?

222
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,280
Can I have your milk, then?

It's so cold.

what department you will apply for?

But I thought your account

-A new app now?
-Mm-hmm. The app True Love.

It lets you talk to people at school
anonymously,

269
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,640
so teachers can't tell
who we're talking to

or see what you're saying to each other.

You never know, maybe, you might find
a friend or even find a boyfriend.

Hmm.

That's right. You can download it

ARE YOU MY JUNIOR OR SENIOR?

[Naruemol] This is way out of line.

282
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Did you introduce your friends
to this obscene platform?

283
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,040
Obscene?

284

What does that mean?

285
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,200
This is a… a blind-dating app.

286
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,240
It's a disgusting platform

287
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,800
where you share private things
with strangers.

288
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,960
A disgusting platform?
It's just a chat room.

289
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,640
I think this app
lets us see people's inner beauty

290
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,040
and it may help us to find a true friend.

And who knows?

292
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,240
We might even find true love on this app.

[Nanno] What about you?

Did you ever fall in love with someone
when you were in school?

Watch it. Don't get nosy about my life.

296
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,680
Kids your age
should focus on your studies.

297
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,360
You should not be focusing
on finding love.

298

Just take it from me.

299
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,920
Love will bring you big trouble
and don't forget that.

Some girls might lose their virginity.

301
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,960
Some of you…

302
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,080
might even get pregnant.

303

304
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,880
I know that.

305

If things get out of hand…

306
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,880
students may do obscene things,
won't they?

307
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,800
[Naruemol] If you understand…

308
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,480
you must delete that app this instant.

309
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,480
Delete it?

310
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,920
But I think this app
might be useful for the teachers.

311
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,600
You can use it
to monitor the students here.

Don't you think it's always better…

315

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,360
I think you want as many students
as possible using this app.

317
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,800
This app keeps users anonymous.

318
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,000
But then again, you know,

319
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,840
you have names, birth dates
and passwords of every student.

320
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,080
You could use this app
to monitor everyone's conversations

321
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,280
before they stray too far.

322
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,680
No one will know.

323
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
But it's up to you.

324
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Hmm…

325
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,800
It's all up to you.

326
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,560
Maybe you don't feel like
it's worth the risk.

327
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,960
Maybe you're afraid
you'll get carried away.

328
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,320
But don't worry,
you'll just be chatting over text.

329
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,160
No one will get pregnant.

unfortunately, we've discovered
that some of you

are acting in defiance
of our school's rules.

I have no choice but to impose
even stricter rules upon us.

I'm doing this for your own well-being.

From now on, female students
attend classes in this building.

And male students will take their classes
over there.

[Nanno] Hello there.

00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,040
I was worried that you might be tired
so I brought you something to drink.

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,040
Why are you following me?

378
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,400
How's it going? Did your plan to spy
on the students work?

379

When I read what students text each other,
I can feel myself start to blush.

I don't know.
Do you feel the same way too?

There's nothing interesting about it.
It's all nonsense.

I don't just look up to you.

474
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,160
I think I'm actually in love with you.

475
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,960
Love me?

476
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
I have feelings for you.

477
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,160
-[grunts]
-That's obscene.

478
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,440
[Naruemol] We're both women.

479
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,520
Love is the warm feeling
that fills up your heart.

480
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,000
You feel joy
when you're near the person you love.

481
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,760
Do you know that my heart feels warm
every time I'm near you?

482
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,960
What about you?
Do you feel the same way about me?

483
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,680
You're my very best friend.

484
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,080
I would do anything for you.

485
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,400
Naruemol, please open your heart to love.

486
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,239
Love is never wrong.
It's people who make it so.

487
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,000
[dramatic music]

488
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,880
No matter what form love takes,
isn't it still love, Naruemol?

489
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,840
I know you feel disheartened
that no one sees how hard you work.

490
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,239
But I see it. I do.

491
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,600
It's like I'm fighting alone…

492
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,120
with no one by my side.

493
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,560
Please know that…

494
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,760
you have me right here with you.

495
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,760
[students exclaim]

496
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,160
[students cheering, clapping]

497
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,480
[students mumbling]

498
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,200
[students chattering]

499
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
[phone beeps]

500
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,160
[tinkles]

501
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,880
[whooshes, chimes]

502
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,600
