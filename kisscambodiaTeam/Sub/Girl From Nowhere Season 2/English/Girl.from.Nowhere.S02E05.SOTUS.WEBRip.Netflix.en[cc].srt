You do it without even knowing

As you all know,
our school's initiation ceremony

is an old and noble tradition

of the person in front of you.

That's not how you should speak
to a senior.

[cheering, clapping]

Someone once told me
that men and women are equal, therefore…

340
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,520
we will have each of you cross-dress
as the opposite gender.

[senior 1] Let's see. Come on.

[senior 1] You little punk.

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,200
K! K!

You bastard.

356
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,640
-[senior 3] Shit.
-[senior 1] This punk tricked us.

-What are you looking at? Let's go.
-Come on.

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
[senior 1] Wow.

-[senior 2] Come out.

Let's go.

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,880
[senior 1] Move it.

367
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,000
Come on.

368
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,040
-Get a move on, sweetheart.
-[laughing]

369
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,480
Keep walking.

370
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,400
-Don't be such a wimp.
-Get over here. Sit down.

371
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,880
Come on, get down.

372
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,280
[Nanno] You actually look kind of cute
in this outfit, K.

373
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,240
[sighs]

374
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,360
You see?

375
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,040
You ran off and kept your friends waiting.

376
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,640
Do you all know what unity means?

377
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,200
Unity means…

378
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,640
You must take responsibility together.

379
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,360
So, if your friend does something wrong…

380
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,480
…you'll all take responsibility for it,
right?

381
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,240
[Nanno] For example, if your friend
runs away during the initiation ritual,

382
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,680
you'll all have to be punished for it.

383
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,800
Since K tripped and sprained his ankle,

384
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
I'll have to give his punishment
to everyone,

385
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,120
to do for him instead of K today.

-Right. You dress the part.
-Keep moving.

Pick up your pace. Move faster.

-Let's go. Let's go.

Move it.

Are you all tired or what?

It's the seniors you should be scared of.

That's a dog.

He may be a dog,
but Mr. Lucky has seniority over you.

He's been here longer than even me.

[Nanno] Do you want the seniority system
that we all revere

to get undermined just because of you?

I won't.

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
I told you to bow.

Bow down on the ground right now.
What's so hard about that?

He's nowhere to be found.

482
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Please, don't punish us for this.

483
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Right now,
we have a more important thing to do.

484
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,960
We need to find a new dog to be class pet.

485
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,640
What if we get someone
to replace Lucky for the time being?

486
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,960
What do you all think about that?

487
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,040
-Grab him.
-Hit him.

488
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,080
-Go, go.
-[K grunting]

489
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
-[overlapping yelling]
-Get him down! Get him down!

490
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,680
I said sit down!

491
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,040
[indistinct yelling]

492
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
-Grab him.
-Hold him down.

493
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,720
Right, right now, you're a dog.

494
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
-[laughter]
-You must sit like a dog

495
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,440
and follow your master's orders.
You understand?

496
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,800
Sit!

497
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,120
Push his legs down.

498
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,560
-Get down.
-Grab his legs.

499
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,440
-Stay still. Don't move.
-Stop moving.

500
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,920
Why are you so stubborn?

501
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,360
-Hey, hey, stop it! Do you have a problem?
-Do you wanna try me, asshole?

502
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,640
[Nanno] Don't bully K, guys.

503
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,560
[senior 2] Pull him up.

504
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,960
-[senior 2] Get him to sit up.
-[senior 3] Sit.

505
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
[senior 3] Sit up. Come on.

506
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
[Nanno] You're so adorable.

507
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,640
Come play fetch with me.

508
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,640
[squeaks]

509
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,560
Can you please let K off the leash?

510
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,320
Fetch this for me. One, two…

511
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,680
three.

512
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
[senior 1] Go on.

513
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,520
[Nanno] Go fetch your toy.

514
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,720
[senior 2] Go!

515
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
[K groans]

516
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,400
[senior 1] He likes to be kicked.

517
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Move it!

518
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,760
[senior 2] Hurry, K.

519
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,040
Pick it up!

520
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,120
[Nanno] One, two, three.

521

-[K panting]

522

-[senior 3] Attaboy.
-[senior 1] He runs fast.

523
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,480
-[senior 1] Good job!
-[senior 3] Come on.

-[senior 2] Come here.
-[senior 3] Come here!

[laughter]

527
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,760
[Nanno] Give me your paw.

528
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,640
Your other paw.

529
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,720
[sobs]

530
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,200
What do you do after giving me your paw?

531
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
What do you do next?

532
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,280
[mimics barking]

533
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,560

[grunts]

539
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
[Nanno] Have some yummy food.

540
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,600
Yum, yum.

541
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,360
[breathes heavily]

542
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,239
See? It's much better to be a dog

543
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,560
than a centipede.

544
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
If you're angry,

545
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,920
you can take it out
on the freshmen next year.

546
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,320

[K] I'm sorry.

550
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,520
I forgive you, my little puppy.

551
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,120
Please let me go.

552
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,440
What was that? I didn't hear you.

553
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,360
Please let me go.

555
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,840
I won't do it ever again.

556
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,960
[Nanno] What was that?

557
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,680
Please let me go.

558
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,120

Please…

There, there.

561
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,680
[Nanno] In case you get hungry.

562
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,760
[K] Don't go. Please don't go.
Don't leave me.

Do you want to get out of here?

00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,680
[Yuri] Your way takes forever.

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,360
I'm impatient.

Both of you go that way.
You two go this way.

[crickets chirping]

588
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,360
[senior 1] I got so many bites last night.

589
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,480
The mosquito repellent is fucking useless.

590
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,720
[tense music]

591
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,280
[senior 2] The woods are full
of mosquitoes. Can we go home?

592
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,240
[senior 1] Do you want to go home with me?

593
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,680
[senior 2] I got mud in my mouth.

594
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,880
[senior 1]
Was it when you were crying to Pae?

595
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,200
-Wait, who else was there?
-What was his name? Was it Yong?

596
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
-[senior 1] It was the guy with buckteeth.
-[senior 2] That's right.

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,840
[seniors laughing]

598
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,040
[senior 1] Remember when you sang
the faculty's chant?

599
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,560
[seniors] Damn.

600
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
[tense music]

601
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,840
-[senior 1] I don't know.
-[senior 2] Screw him.

602
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,240
[senior 1] He's probably dead.
He was a horrible senior.

603
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,120
[senior 2] He acted like he ran the place.

604
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,000
-Don't compare ourselves to him.
-I'll whoop his ass if I saw him now.

605
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,160
You can't find anyone nicer than us.
We go easy on these freshmen.

606
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,200
-[senior 2] These freshmen have no idea.
-[senior 1] That's true.

[panting]

608
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,000
[senior 2] No!

Hey! K!

610
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,840
Go after him!

-Stop right there.
-Come back, asshole.

615
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,000
-Get back here.
-K, get over here.

616
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,640
Get up here. Be a man and get back here.

617
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
You're such a coward.

618
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,600
-[indistinct yelling]
-[Yuri] Everyone!

619
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,080
We found Lucky's body.

620
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,080
-[senior] You scum. How could you do this?
-[students clamoring]

621
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,720
[K] I didn't kill Lucky.

622
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,920
I didn't set him loose!
And I didn't grab Nanno's butt!

623
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,800
She started all of this!
This is all her fault!

624
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,120
She's the reason I'm stuck here
with you assholes!

625
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,040
-[overlapping yelling]
-We don't believe you!

626
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,720
Why won't anyone believe me?

627
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
So, this is your way of helping?

628
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,840
That's right. Isn't it fun?

629
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,520
It's so much faster than your way.

630
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,680
You even killed Mr. Lucky.
Was that really necessary, Yuri?

631
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,560
[chuckles]

632
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,520
Everyone!

633
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
Since K killed Lucky,
he needs to pay for it.

634
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,680
Whoever hits K in the head the most times

635
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,640
gets to be the head of the freshmen class

636
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,080
and can skip the initiation ritual.

637
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,840
[students clamoring, shouting]

638
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,040
Mr. Lucky would be honored to die
for such a good cause.

639
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,080
Do you think that if we let K live,

640
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,840
he'll just stop bullying
the next class of freshmen?

641
