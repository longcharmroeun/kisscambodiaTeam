00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,560
[Nanno] Everyone says
that friendship is a valuable thing.

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,880
And it's even more precious when people
from different classes form friendships.

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,960
However, how high can the price
of friendship really be?

[Nana] Here, Yuri.

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,720
Just throw your bag away.
You see how old and crappy it is?

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,480
Really? I can't accept that.
You already bought me ice cream yesterday.

[Tubtim] Come on. It's no big deal.
Your bag is so shitty.

19
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,600
Just take this one.

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
Hm?

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,600
You need it if you're gonna hang out
with us.

Hmm.

and Tubtim hang out with the rich kids?

25
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
And getting a free bag from them…

you let us know.

Looks like there's one seat left.

43
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,000
We sit here just the three of us.
We need all the space.

Really? What do you mean?

Nana and Tubtim need space for their bags.

Mm… Too bad.

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Then, where will a new kid like me sit?
There aren't any seats left.

Sure, there are.

But no.

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,960
There aren't any seats for me

51
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,280
because no one wants to let a new kid
into their group.

52
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080
[Nanno] But you three aren't like that.
You aren't like the rest of them.

53
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,400
Your friendship isn't about class
or even about money,

54
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,600
and you probably wouldn't mind a new face.

I'm the new kid. Nice to meet you.

[Nana] You should know

63
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,840
that we don't usually let
random people join our clique.

64

But I see that you're new here,

so I'll give you a chance, okay?

Yeah?

67
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,040
[Tubtim] If you want to join our clique,

68
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,240
you have to give us proof
that you can be a true friend.

a true friend should treat her friends.

Listen to me, don't do that again.

Our clique doesn't do stuff like that.

81
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,520
But I thought that friends are supposed
to help each other with everything.

82
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,400
But you almost got us in trouble.

she created a fake Instagram account

I wouldn't know what to do without you.
You're so naughty.

123
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,240
[Tubtim] That's right. I never would've
passed without your notes.

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,560
So, your idea of being a true friend
is to act like a servant?

151
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,000
What do you mean? Who's a servant?

152

They're my friends.

153
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,280
Are you a friend

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,760
who does everything for them

155
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
and gives them notes for the exams?

156
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,840
[Nanno] A friend who created an account
to bash their enemies.

A friend who help them cheat on a test.

158
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,520
All of that in exchange for money.

159

I know your game. You were acting quiet.

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,720
What about it? What's wrong with that?

167
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm just doing my job, you get it?
I play my part and they push me around.

168
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,200
It's not easy to find a job,
and this one pays well.

169
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
Yuri, you're quite an interesting girl.

170
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm not that interesting.

171
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,480
Tell me something,
is money really that important to you?

172
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Yes, it is.

Hi, mom. I'm home.

I'm Nanno, Yuri's friend. Hi.

179
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,599
[Yuri's mom] Hello.

180
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,599
I hope I'm not a bother.

181
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,000
Have you girls eaten?
I made stir-fried pork and basil.

182
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,240
[Yuri] I'll eat it later.

183
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
I bought you a new phone.

184
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,680
Isn't this too expensive?
Where did you get the money?

185
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,080
Hmm. My friends paid me
to help tutor them.

186
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,640
[Yuri's mom gasps]

187
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
Mom, come on.
Let me show you how to use it.

188
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Here.

189
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
-Uh, isn't it nice?
-Mm-hmm.

190
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,240
This is the newest model
they have in the store.

191
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,440
You don't have to watch your shows
on the TV.

192
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,400
Now, you can watch things on this.

193
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,640
You won't get lonely when I'm not here.

194
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,560
[Yuri's mom] You've got such nice friends.

195
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
Hey, let's finally take
our first picture together.

196
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,720
-Come on. Cheese.
-[clicks]

197
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,480
How do I do that?

198
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,640
-So, when you take the picture…
-Uh-huh.

199
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,240
…and you can send it to me like this.

200
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,600
[Yuri] I do wanna have some real friends.

201
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,440
But this is where I live.

202
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,440
My family is poor.

203
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,240
If I didn't do what they want,

204
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
how else can I have a better life?

205
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,360
They just treat me the way rich people
always treat poor people.

206
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,680
They treat poor people
like we're a charity case.

207
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
They throw scraps our way…

208
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,920
but it's just to make themselves
feel generous.

209
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,080
But they never really accept us,
poor people, as being like them.

210
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,080
[sighs]

211
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,080
Nana and Tubtim are like most rich people.

212
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,280
When I first started hanging out
with the two of them,

213
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
I thought I had friends I could depend on.

214
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,800
I imagined what it would be like
if I became rich one day.

215
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,960
If I were richer than them…

216
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,240
I'd treat them the way they treat me.

217
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,920
"Here, Nana, I just wired you money.

218
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,520
Pick up my dog's shit."

219
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,080
"Here, Tubtim, here's a new bag.

220
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
Your bag is so frumpy, I just
couldn't stand to look at it anymore."

221
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,960
Or maybe, I'll do the same thing
they do to me.

222
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,120
"Here, I just wired you money.

223
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,560
Thank you for your wonderful friendship."

224
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,600
Wonderful friendship, fuck them.
[scoffs]

225
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,400
[Nanno] You can actually do all of that.

226
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,000
Do what?

227
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,840
You can do all the things you just said.
Why wouldn't you do them?

228
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,600
How could I do that? I don't have money.

229
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,560
I have nothing.

230
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
Of course, you can.

231
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,160

that rich people are scared of.

Their secrets.

235

Yuri, don't you know…

236
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,440
that Nana and Tubtim,
they have secrets that only they know.

237
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,360
Come on. Let's take a picture. Yuri.

Does it look okay?

242
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,800
Yuri, go set the barbecue.

Nanno, get some water.

Those two keep something on a laptop.

246
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,360
That laptop is in Nana's house,
in her room.

247
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,960
But she's never let me see what's on it.

248
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,600
It really shouldn't be too hard.

249
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Just do one thing. You just have to keep
those two distracted while I find it.

to everybody that comes down here.

you were helping her, didn't you?

[moaning continues]

She said shut the fuck up!

329
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,880
Yuri! Do something! Stop her!

330
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,520
-What do you want?
-Shut her up!

331
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
I'll pay you. How much? 20,000 enough?

332
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,520
-I'll give you 20K too.
-40,000!

333
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,040
Just do it now! Don't just stand there!

334
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,360
Make her shut up! Hurry up!

335
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,760
-Go on!
-[groans]

336
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,480

[moaning]

338
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
Fuck you, I can't do it!

339
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,320
Move!

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,720
Yuri. Take care
of her dead body, will you?

347
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,520
Put her in a tub.
And make it look like suicide.

348
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,280
What are you waiting for?

349
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,480
[Yuri] You two have to get rid
of her body yourselves…

350
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,360
now that I have proof
that you killed someone.

[beeps]

352
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,800
Yuri, are you trying to blackmail us?

353
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,880
[Tubtim] Don't cross the line.

[dramatic music]

355
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,080
Since the moment we became friends…

356
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,480
you treated me like some kind of victim.
So I let you.

357
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
You like throwing money at me…

358
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,520
so I let you.

359
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,440
You had me play some innocent girl
to lure people here, and I did it.

360
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,800
You wanted me to be your loyal lapdog,
and I did it.

361
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,560
Is there a line I didn't cross?

362
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,360
[scoffs]

363
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,760
Nanno told me that I should find a way
to take you down,

364
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,480
but that was always my plan.

365
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,600
We're ready.

366
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Bitch.

367
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,760
Before we start to have some fun,
why don't you take care of her body?

368
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,160
[Yuri] Put her in a tub
and make it look like a suicide.

369
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,920
Do it.

370
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,720
Do it, Nana, Tubtim.

Yuri, I'm begging you.

374
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,760
You're used to barking orders.

375
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,520
Now, it's your turn to take them.

376
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,360
Please, don't hurt us. I'm begging you.

377
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,080
I said get rid of her!

378
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,960
Do it.

How much do you want?

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,800
What do you think?

382
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,240
A hundred thousand.

383
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
Is that really enough for your freedom?

384
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
A million?

385
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
You think freedom is that cheap?

386
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,120
Ten million.

387
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,840
[chuckles]

388
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,719
How much do you want?

389
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,040
What you did to other people…

390
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
it can't be paid back with money.

391
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,199
It has to be paid for with pain.

392
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,040
[Yuri] How many videos have you made?

393
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,600
How many people have you hurt?

394
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,760
One, two, three, four… whoa.

395
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,280
There are too many to count.

396
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,960
You can have fun with them all you want.

397
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,679
I just want a short video.

398
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,080
You can't do that!

That sound familiar?

402
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,360
It's what I said to you in this room
the day you filmed me.

[sobbing, screaming]

404
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,280
What did you say to me that day?

00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,360
"This is your fault. Don't be so stupid."

Hmm.

Thank you, Nanno.
Thanks for trying to help me.

But I'm sorry…

420

I didn't really need your help.

421

[Yuri] I just needed victims.

422

Well, did you think I was stupid?

423
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,000

I put up with all the pain and torture,

everything they did to me,

425
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,000
because I was waiting to get my revenge.

[man panting]

I didn't trick you to get me the laptop

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
because I wanted to know what was on it.

429
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,720
I just wanted
all their clients' information

430
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
so I can blackmail them myself.

431

[chuckles]

432
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,080
Get it?

433
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,360
Their whole business is mine now.

434
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,760
I'll wire you the money.

it could've been much more interesting.

[Nanno] Friendship comes with a price.

445

Sometimes, it costs more than you think.

446
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,800
The price can be so high

447
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,800
that you may end up paying for it
with your life.
