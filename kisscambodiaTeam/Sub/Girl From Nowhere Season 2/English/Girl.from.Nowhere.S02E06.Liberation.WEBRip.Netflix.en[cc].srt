THE RULES OF PANTANA WITTAYA SCHOOL

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,800
[Nanno] It is said

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,040
-that there's a rule for everything.
-GENERAL REGULATIONS

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,880
And every rule is there for a reason.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,360
A CHAPTER ON DISCIPLINE

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,480
But the rule makers always bend the rules.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,720
HEADMASTER,
HEAD OF STUDENT WELFARE,

8

HOMEROOM AND CLASS TEACHERS,
DEPARTMENT STAFF

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,880
So the rules become oppressive

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,520
to all of us.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,960
CHAPTER THREE
AUTHORITY OVER PUNISHMENT

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
And they keep us all tied down.

[shouting]

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,320
DETENTION, CONFINEMENT, IMPRISONMENT

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,440
It's time for that to change.

Hello. My name is Nanno.

20
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
It's nice to meet you.

21
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
[Teacher B] Go sit over there, Nanno.

22
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,880
Hi, I'm Nanno. What's your name?

23
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,920
[Teacher B clears throat]

24
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,560
Pay attention, Nanno.

25
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,880
You're already behind
the rest of the class.

26
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,160
[Teacher B]
Okay, turn to chapter four, page 128.

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,320
Hi, Nanno. My name is Mie.

What's going on?

32
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,680
Nothing, ma'am. I dropped my pen.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,680
You need to be careful, Mie. You don't
want to be distracting your classmates.

34
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
Here, Nanno.

36
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,400

[suspenseful music]

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,760
We are here to do a random bag search.

39
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,800
[students] Yes, ma'am.

40

[grunting]

42
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,760
This outdated protocol of yours
is a violation of our student's privacy.

43
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,160
This is the best method.

44
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,760
And you don't have
any choice in the matter, understood?

45
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,200
According to the school rules

46
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,080
every single student must always do
as their teacher say.

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,120
[Teacher A] I'll be the one to decide

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
if it is unfair.

49

[grunts]

50
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,080
Now, have I made myself clear to you?

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,280
Yeah.

52
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,080
[eerie music]

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
Thank you, Teacher B.

54
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
You're most welcome.

[Teacher B]
The French Revolution took place

57
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
in the 1700s.

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,520
-The era was considered…
-Nanno.

59
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,880
…a time of change. The financial crisis

60
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,560
-left the royal treasury empty.
-Nanno!

61

[smacks lips]

62
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,920
Hello, my dear students,

63
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,440
our highly prestigious
Pantana Wittaya School

64
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,400
has managed to become

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,720
a pillar of society,

66
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,480
due to our ethics,

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,720
morals and guidance, so please

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
if you stay disciplined,

69
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,520
you will absolutely achieve everything

70
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,520
you have ever hoped for.

71
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,320
Why do teachers think

72
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,640
they can do whatever they want.

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Hm… the teachers here are worse
than you can imagine.

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,320
Seriously, Nanno,
you should really be careful.

75
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,760
The teachers at this school despise
people like you.

76
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
People like me?

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,920
[Mie] Yeah. You're the type who asks
a lot of questions. They really hate that.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,440
[snickers, laughs]

79
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not funny, Nanno.

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,400
You saw that there are two
empty desks in class?

81
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
Wanna know why?

82
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Are they sick?

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
[Mie] They belong to New and Jelly.

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,760
The other day, Jelly called out
Teacher B for something.

85
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,920
And Teacher B got so upset,
she threw an eraser at her head.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,640
-[thud]
-[Jelly screams]

87
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Sorry, it must've slipped.

88
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Don't just sit there.
Someone take her to the nurse's office.

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,400
[Mie] New took a video of what happened
with his phone.

90
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,520
But, Teacher B caught him.

91
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Do you know what happened to them?

92
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,760
The student welfare officer

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,320
locked both of them up
in the Repentance Room.

94
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
And they haven't come out
of that room since.

95
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
No one's heard from them.

96
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
Hmm.

97
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,880
Sounds kind of fun.

98
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,720
Let's go find it. Wanna come with me?

99
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,200
[Mie] Your crazy, Nanno.
That room is so scary.

100
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Rebellious students come out of there
completely tamed.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,280
No one wants to get put in that room.

102

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
Yeah.

109

Are you aware that we have

110
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,280
very strict rules here?

111
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
[Nanno] I'm aware.

112
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,480
That's good to hear.

113
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,720
Since you're new here,
I'll let you off easy once.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You must memorize all 427 rules by heart.

You'll do it elsewhere.

Do you think this is against the rules?

There's no rule written in the book

Thank you for this chance, Teacher A.

168
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
[Teacher A] And you, New?

169
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,440
Have you learned anything?

170
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm fine here.

171
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,680
[New] I didn't do anything wrong.

172
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,480
But you filmed the teacher,
which is not good, New.

173
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
It's Teacher B who didn't admit
her mistake.

174
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,160
And she hurt Jelly.

175
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,200
New, can you please just tell her
what she wants to hear?

176
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,240
-But this is not right.
-[gasps]

177
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
This has to stop.

178
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,880
We can't keep living like this.

179
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,520
If that's what you think,
then stay in there.

180
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
Then, I'm quitting the school.

181
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,160
[Teacher A] You'll quit?

182
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,320
Do you really think quitting
will solve everything?

183
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
You know, there is an easy way to deal
with a student like you.

184
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,080
[Teacher A] We'll put your name on a list

185
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,440
of undesirable people.

186
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,120
That will ruin any chance you had
of getting

187
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
into any university whatsoever.

188
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,760
But, you have no right to do that.

189
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,680
[Teacher A] I do.

190
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
And I have done it before.

191
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,000
[Teacher A] The world runs on nepotism.

192
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
What about you?

193
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Are you prepared to face
the consequences of your choices?

194
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,960
[grunts]
Just apologize to her…

195
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,800
so we can get out of here.

196
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,080
[Teacher A] Tell me one more time.

197
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
Do you still want to quit this school?

198
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,360
No, I'm sorry.

199
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Say that again.

200
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
[New] I'm sorry. I was wrong.
You were right.

201
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
I swear I won't hurt
the school's reputation ever again.

Thank you.

205
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,720
When New first arrived here,
he looked like you do right now.

206
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,680
[Teacher A] You may use this time
to repent for your choices.

207
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,720
You must memorize
all the school rules by heart.

208
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,360
[female voice over PA] The rules
for students of Pantana Wittaya School…

-[snorts]

[yawns]

211
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,400
Rule number one,

212
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,640
all students shall respect
and strictly follow

213
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
the school rules.

214
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,720
Rule number two,

215
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,240
all students shall respect
and treat their teachers

216
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,440
like their own family members

217
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,120
and always be grateful
for their teachers' kindness.

218
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,640
[both] Teacher, there's a problem.

219
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,560
Nanno, didn't you get in trouble
for yesterday?

220
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
They just made me listen to all 427 rules

221
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,800
over and over again in a dark room.

222

Were you scared at all?

223
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,080
Yah, Jelly's like a different person now.

224
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,200
It's true.

225
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,280
New's still too sick to come back.

226
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,720
I didn't let her out of the room.
Why is she here now?

227
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,800
To be completely honest,
I find this whole thing…

228
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
pretty…

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,960

It really wasn't scary at all.

233
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,680
If all of us break the rules,

234
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,160
we can have a pretty big party
in there together.

Looks like I'll be partying
all by myself again.

240
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,840
I've memorized all 427 rules.

241
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,040
Rule one,

242
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,360
all students should strictly follow
the school rules as written.

243

Rule two,

244
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,720
students should respect

245

[Nanno] Rule three…

I'm going to ask you once,

I want you to tell your students
that you were wrong,

admit that you were the one who planted

Admit the school is backwards,

271
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,600
and then, I'll be satisfied.

272

Hello, Yuri.

Why do you keep dancing around
the issue, Nanno?

337
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,360
Why are you still a two-faced bitch?

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,560
I warn you, stay out of my way.

What kind of trouble are you up to now?

[Nanno] I want everyone in this school…

to see what hypocrites you teachers are.

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,040
Then, what do you want from me?

357
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,480
I want those documents.

These papers show the total amount
of donations

Huh? Why does the school
look like trash then?

364
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,040
It's never clean
and the lunch here is disgusting.

365
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,920
We don't have computers either.

366
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,200
So, where did the money go?

Do not let Nanno's lies fool you.

What shall we do now?

397
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,000
Well… should we torture them?

398
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,440
Should we make them write down
their confessions in statement?

399
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,200
Make them admit to all the horrible things
that they did to us.

Have you forgotten?

495
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,640
It was Nanno who started all this.

496
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,680
You're lying. Nanno fell to her death.

497
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,280
How can you blame her for all this?

Hello, my dear teachers
and fellow students.

507
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,720
I sure hope you did.

Listen, stop.

511
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,640
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
Let's go, come on.

512
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,240
It looks like
you're outnumbered, Headmaster.

[shushing]

514
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,600
Nanno.

515
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,680
Have you forgotten that I have a gun here?

516
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,640
I would like to know…

517
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,520
if your gun has enough bullets
to kill each one of me.

[tense music]

519
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
We also have weapons, Headmaster.

[student panting]

521
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,480
Right now, we are live-streaming
from the Pantana Wittaya School gym

522
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,240
and this is our headmaster.

Oh, yes, it's me, the principal.

00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,560
Come on, put your phones away now.

528

Listen, put your phones away.

[yells]
Put your phones away.

530

[principal] Put them all away.

531
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,040
Stop filming!

532
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,680
Yes?

533
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,880
Just shoot me.

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,200

Come on, say something to the camera.

00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,880
Nanno, do you think you've won?

540
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,000
I've won? This is hardly a victory.

541
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,760
This is just the start.

Don't you see that your way doesn't work?

545
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,200
Are you really going to keep me in here?

546
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,160
I went to a lot of trouble
to get you that evidence.

547
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,160
Yuri, you're just too impatient.

You might have trouble breathing in here.

00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,080
That's right. I got locked in here alone
for the longest time.

552
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
There's no phone reception.

553

No food either.

554
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Wait, what? Who said that?

555
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,680
There are so many of us here.

556
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,080
Let's be cannibals.

557
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,800
You're right. Who should we eat first?

558
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,320
Should it be the black sheep?
What do you say? Wanna be eaten?

See you later, Yuri.

564
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,560
I'm sure you'll find a way
out of this place.

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,840
Hang in there.

Okay, what should we do next, Nanno?

00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,520
It's up to you to decide what to do next.

569
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,840
Do you think we can fight
all those people out there.

If things are black, white, or colored.

Who is right? Who is wrong?
And who is better than their friend?

Are we really the ones to judge…

in this greyscale world?
