Are you starting to doubt
what you're doing here?

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,760
[female student] Junko, come decorate
with us. You can help us cut some paper?

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,600
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

Hi, I'm Nanno. I'm a new student here.

Are you Junko?

Weren't you the one who won

It's nothing.

I can't go play outside

So, I read instead. It's not fun.

Why are you in that chair?
Is something wrong with your legs?

I've always had this condition.

[female student] Junko has hemophilia.

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,120
When she gets a wound,
it causes lots of bleeding.

41
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,640
It's dangerous.

42
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
And she needs to be careful.

43
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,960
It can be life threatening.

44
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,720
I feel bad for her.

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840

when you use scissors, remember?

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Because, it's more dangerous
if you get cut, okay?

I wanted to check on Junko.

64
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,240
I was there when she cut herself
and it was…

65
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,800
[Waan] Don't be afraid, dear.

66
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,320
Junko's always been very fragile.

67
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,440
That's why she gets injections everyday.

68

I love you so much,

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
and I'm not going to lose you.

Has Junko always been in that chair?

71
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Yes, since she was little.

72
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
How unfortunate.

73
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,799

I've heard people say

80
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,520
that they wanna have kids so the children
will look after them when they get old.

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,160
But, for you, that day will never come.

You will have to watch Junko
your whole life,

83
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,320
and she won't be able to do that for you.

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,800
But, that isn't how I see it.

Actually, I came here…

166
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,120
to return this to you.

167
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,080
You left it behind.

168
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,920
At first I thought
it was just Junko's desmopressin…

169
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,040
for treating her hemophilia.

170
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
Turns out, it's not.

it's all really so strange.

[Nanno] What have you been injecting
into Junko, huh?

[tense music]

188
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,120
And you killed anyone who knew about it.

189
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
Should I post about it all online?

190
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,760
Are you happy with your choices?

191
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,280
You're so disappointing.
If I were you, I would just kill her.

192
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,240
Isn't it Waan the person you saw
in your dream?

193
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
We're like two peas in a pod, Nanno.

You know that. Your blood is in my veins.

In a way, we're kind of like

I don't think so.

You want to kill people.
Is that all you think about?

No one is going to believe you.

205
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,840
All the evidence I need is inside Junko.

206
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,480
And you keep the bodies in your home.

Is it easy to make money
off of people's sympathy?

you can't live on a teacher's salary

211

so you make your daughter sick for money.

Is that what you mean?

213

Maybe, the time has come

214
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,720
for you to be punished
for what you've done.

Yeah, by poisoning Junko.

I didn't poison her. I'm protecting her.

to others.

[Waan] Junko hated everyone
at her school.

245
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,440
She asked to stay home
until her legs were healed.

246
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,280
She spent the whole day in her room
surrounded by the thing she loved most.

247
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,040
And that thing was…

At first, I didn't think it was so bad.

Then one day when she could walk again,

251
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,880
I discovered that…

252

Why did you take me here, Junko?

I'm just gonna leave.

is to cover Junko's crimes?

I told you that your mother
can't be trusted.

And who are you?

280
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm a friend of Junko's.

281
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,240
A friend?

282
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,800
[Yuri] I'm a close friend of hers.

283
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,920
I'm close enough to know

284
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,480
what you've been doing to her.

Things are going to change
from here on out.

I'm sorry, but I had to.
I didn't want you to kill any more people.

290
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,200
Those people all deserve what they got.

291
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
They were just bullying me all the time.

who said I was a burden to the school.

297
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,880
I wanted revenge.

298
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,440
Yuri said I'm entitled to that,
and I agree.

299
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,600
How could you hurt me this way?

300
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,440
I never meant to hurt you, Junko.

301
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,000
I only did it to protect you.

302
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,160
Protect me?

303
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,440
We've been doing just fine
this whole time

304
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,320
until these people showed up
and disrupted our lives.

305
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,920
My life was so much better
when I was able to kill.

306
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,320
And you took that away from me.

307

I actually switched the medication

and replaced it with vitamins.

309
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,520
So, the weak and vulnerable Junko
that you saw was…

It was just an act.

Should we let the daughter
kill her own mother?

325

Or let her live?

330
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,400
Don't you want to punish people
like I taught you to do?

331
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,640
We just use different methods.

332

[panting]

333
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,600
[Waan] Junko.

334
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,880
Please don't make me do this to you.

335
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Junko is a victim just like I am.

336
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,920
[Yuri] All we wanted was to get revenge.

[snickers]

338
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,400
People like you and Junko…

339
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,840
can hardly call yourselves victims.

340
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,560
It's probably hard to judge
who's at fault here.

341
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,640
Is it Waan who crippled her own daughter
to stop her,

342
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,960
or is it Junko who got her revenge
for being bullied?

343
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
Can you really judge

344
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
who's the worst?

345
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,040
You should be thankful I let you live.

346
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,760
I protected you.

347
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,680
[sobbing]
You didn't have to suffer ever.

348
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,640
I'd go to jail for what you did.

349
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
You killed people, Junko.

350
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,760
Instead of showing me gratitude,

351
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,200
you try to kill me.

352
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,360

Please stop. I'm sorry.

00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,680
I love you, Junko, so much.

Don't you like to call me a monster?

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,400
[Junko] Huh?

367
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,920
Prove to me that you are my mother.

368
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,440
A mother about to be killed
by her own daughter.

369
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,120
My… I can't let you… live the rest
of your life if I'm not there.

[Yuri]
The wickedness of humans never ends.

Even love can be used
