1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,520
[Nanno] How do we measure our existence?

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,800
By fame or the number of your viewers?

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,800
[beeps]

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,560
We exist as long as people
are watching us.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,520
[phone chimes]

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,680
But what must we sacrifice
to get people's attention?

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
I want to die.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
[chuckles]

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,280
Hello, there. This is JennyX.

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
I was almost late
for our livestream tonight.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,960
I've been so crazy busy with school work.

15
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I also have exams coming up.

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
But, I didn't want
to keep you all waiting.

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
So, I thought I'd get all my homework done
while talking with you all.

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,360
[chuckles]

19
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
YOU KEEP ME FOCUSED IN SCHOOL.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,600
YOU'RE SO BANGABLE.

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,280
Mm.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
This one's hard.

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,800
I don't know if I'll be able to solve it.
Can anyone out there help me?

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
-I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. YOU GOT THIS.
-I'LL HELP YOU.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,960
I can't solve it right now.
Give me a second.

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,720
Hmm.

27
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
-IT'S REALLY HARD.
-WOW.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,400
[hums]
I got it. I think I got the answer.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
[sighs]
I almost didn't solve it.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,240
What about you?
Have you finished your homework?

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,680
If you haven't done it yet,
then we should do it together.

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,760
I want my channel to be the place
where we can all help each other out.

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,960
Or if anyone needs my help,
please tell me.

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,760
If there's ever any way I can help you,
I totally will.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
POLICE IS SAVING SOMEONE
WHO'S ATTEMPTING SUICIDE.

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
WHERE?

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
GO TO WWW.LIVENEWS.COM

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,880
Hey. Has everyone left
to do their homework?

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,360
[sighs]

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
N: I'M ALWAYS HERE WITH YOU.

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,680
TELL PEOPLE TO GO SUPPORT THE POLICE.

42
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,480
Oh, no. An emergency.
Has something happened?

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,280
I'm so worried.
I hope everyone is going to be okay.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
I've got an idea.

45
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,920
Let's all go give the police our support.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,320
I'll go give them my support too.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll do another livestream soon.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
I look forward to doing my homework
with you then.

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,480
I'll see you again soon. Bye bye.

50
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,160
N: I'LL BE WAITING
NO MATTER HOW LATE IT IS.

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
[beeps]

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,399
[sighs]
Why did you make me stop so soon?

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,640
We could've gotten more views.

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh, we couldn't get the views up
after that.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,400
That suicide is trending number one
on Twitter.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,440
[grunts]

57
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,040
Will we still get
the endorsement fee for the drink?

58
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,400
[Jane's mom] She didn't even mention
the product's name.

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,760
They only gave us half of the payment
upfront this time.

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
If we don't finish the job--

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,600
But I'm tired.
[clicks tongue]

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
How about I make you some coffee, huh?

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
All right? Be right back, okay?

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,640
Don't bother. Both of you leave.

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
What?

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
[sighs]

67
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,200
[sighs]

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
This is bullshit.

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
[grunts]

70
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,720

[indistinct chatter]

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
-[student 1] Look, Mon.
-[student 2] She's here.

74
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Hello, Mon!

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
Oh, my. Oh, my.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
[Jane] How are you doing?

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah, hi, Jane.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
[chuckles]

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,520
-[all giggle]
-[student 1] Wow.

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
What did you do?
Why did she say hello to you?

81
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,080
-Yeah, tell us.
-Well, I just left a compliment

82
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,520
on her live stream the other day.

83
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,960
[student 1] She's so cool and nice.

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
[Jane] Hello, Cake!

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,600
How's your sprained wrist?
Is it still hurting?

86
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh, it's already healed.
Thanks for asking.

87
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,520
[chuckles]

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,560
[Cake's friend] She remembered.

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,800
She remembers me.

90
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,640
[indistinct chatter]

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
Oh, Non!

92
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,840
How's your mom? Is she still sick?

93
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
If there's anything I can do,
please let me know.

94
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay, thank you so much.

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
[chuckles]

96
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,960
Damn, dude.
[chuckles]

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,520
Jane remembers things about you, Non.
I'm so jealous of you.

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
-[student] She's here.
-[Jane] Hello.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Excuse me. You're sitting in my seat.

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
Jane? JennyX, is that you?

101
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
Are you really in this class?
I'm so happy.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,040
I've been a big fan of yours
for a long time now.

103
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,320
I never thought, when I moved here,
we'd be classmates.

104
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Hmm… it's nice to meet you too.

105
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,000
I watch your livestreams
no matter how late they are.

106
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,320
Hey, do you go by N online?

107
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
You know who I am?

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm surprised someone like you remembers
a faceless fan like me.

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,560
Hm… I think every person is memorable.

110
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Oh…

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,080
your words are so touching.
You really are JennyX.

112
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,320
[chuckles]

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
Anyway, is this seat assigned to you.

114
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,480
Can I have it? I really love sitting here.

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
There's an empty seat back there.

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
Oh… fine.

118
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
[sighs]

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,280
You can be honest. You can tell me
if you're not okay with it.

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
[chuckles]

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,800
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

122
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
I've been your fan for a long time now,

123
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,280
and I check your Instagram post everyday
and watch all your livestreams.

124
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,680
You know, I see what's going on.
I can see that you're not happy.

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,520
No, really. I promise you I'm fine.

126
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,880
I don't mind sitting here.
Really, it's okay.

127
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Go back to your seat, Jane.

128
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,360
I can see that you don't really
wanna sit here.

129
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,400
Am I right?

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,080
When you're with me you can be honest
and say how you're really feeling.

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,159
I don't want you to be lonely anymore.

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,960
[teacher] That's how you calculate
half life from a half life graph.

133
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,880
The next problem is about
a velocity-time graph.

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,640
The slope of a velocity-time graph

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,640
represents the acceleration of the object.

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Jane, do you want to sit with us?

137
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Uh…

138
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,080
Will you live-stream yourself
doing homework today?

139
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't know yet.

140
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm so jealous. How does it feel
to have so many followers?

141
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,240
Well, I just did it for fun at first.

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,880
I never thought I'd get many followers.

143
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,840
[male student] Uh-huh.

144
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,960
How much do you get paid
to endorse a product?

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,440
I don't really know.
My parents take care of that for me.

146
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
-Oh…
-[Nanno] Jane.

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,360
Can you come over here?
I need your help with something.

148
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,640
Uh… bring your lunch too.

149
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Excuse me.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,520
Never mind. I got her picture.

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,920
-Gosh. Jane is so pretty.
-Wow.

152
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,400
So, what did you want me to help you with?

153
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
Nothing really.

154
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,480
You just seemed
so uncomfortable over there.

155
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
I would be uncomfortable too.

156
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,240
-Was that a chat or an interview?
-I couldn't tell.

157
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,520
[chuckles]

158
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
What kind of food is that?

159
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,040
Why does it look like shit?

160
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,880
Well, my mom just put me on a diet

161
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,080
to help me stay in shape.

162
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
[retches]

163
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,120
It doesn't look good at all.

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,640
That's what you're thinking, right?

165
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,520
Mm-hm.

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,360
[Nanno] Eat this instead. It's so good.

167
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
Should I?

168
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
Mm-hm.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
[Nanno] Come on.

170
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Mm…

171
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,960
I haven't eaten
this kind of food in so long.

172
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,280
[snickers]

173
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,600
I think that if you like it
you should have more. Here.

174
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,440
-Mm…
-[Nanno] Enjoy.

175
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,160
It's fine to eat like this
once in a while.

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,680
Everyone needs to do
what they want sometimes

177
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,320
without having to worry about anything.

178
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,520
You don't have to be perfect all the time.

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,480
[Nanno] I want you to remember,
you can be yourself with me.

180
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,880
When we're together, you don't have
to be Jennyx. I won't judge you.

181
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
You know, this snack that you reviewed,
it's not even good.

182
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
Do you think I liked it?

183
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,280
When I was eating it, I had to have
a trash can by me. It made me gag.

184
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,080
But, this is what I have to do.

185
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,320
Hello, everyone. This snack is so good.

186
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,400
[scoffs]

187
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
[chuckles]

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,280
Mm. And that one.

189
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
It made me break out so bad,

190
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
I covered it with make up for days.

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And your parents? Don't they screen
the products first before you review them?

192
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,640
My parents?

193
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,960
They have me review anything
as long as I get paid.

194
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
Jane, someone wants to hire you
to review some kitchenware.

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
[Jane's mom] You'll even get to cook.

196
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,280
[Jane] They have me do anything
that earns them money.

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,880
They don't care if it's late
or if I'm tired.

198
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
These face masks are really the best.

199
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
No one's paying me to say this.

200
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,800
I promise, I even use them myself.

201
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,320
I have to lie to everyone and tell them
that these are amazing products.

202
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,280
[Jane's dad] …four, five, six, seven.

203
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,320
-Wow.
-[Jane's mom sighs]

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,280
May God bless us.
We made so much money this month.

205
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,360
Honey, Jane's birthday's coming up.
What should we get her?

206
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,040
Hm.

207
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
How about cellphone?
She said she wanted one.

208
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,840
Hm.

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,200
How about we buy her more followers?
She will get more sponsors.

210
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,680
We might be able to negotiate
a higher fee for her.

211
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
[suspenseful music]

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Hm. Good idea.

213
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,400
[Jane's dad] Let's do that.
You can check how much it costs.

214
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
[Jane] Screw them.

215
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,280
[sighs]

216
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,480
I guess being famous,
it isn't as great as I thought.

217
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,880
And my followers, they want a role model.
They always want me to act happy.

218
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,160
As for my haters,

219
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,480
they think they can post
whatever they want about me,

220
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,040
because I have an image
of being a nice person.

221
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,080
I have to be kind and understanding
towards everyone.

222
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
[exhales]

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
It makes me wanna vomit.

224
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,440
So, what is it that
you actually want to do?

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,760
I want… to run away from everything.

226
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm sick of being happy all the time
or caring what they think.

227
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm sick of my parents treating me
like a product.

228
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Basically, I'm sick of being JennyX.

229
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,480
I'm done with it.
I want to disappear from this world.

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Ah, you want to disappear from this world.
Do you really mean that?

231
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
Mm-hm. I do.

232
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,240
But I don't think it's really possible.

233
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Well, if you want, there's a way
you can make that happen.

234
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,440
Are you saying that I should
run away from home?

235
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,720
[sighs]
I can't go out anywhere in public anymore

236
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,280
without being recognized.

237
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,480
Even if I could, my parents…

238
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,360
track me with this.

239
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,240
I wasn't saying you should run away
from home.

240
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,760
You should consider leaving this world
all together.

241
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,480
Is Jane home, honey?

242
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,320
[beeping]

243
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
Yes, she is.

244
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,920
Oh, that's good.

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,920
[chimes]

246
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,080
Hello, everyone! It's Jane.

247
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,560
Today, I have something important
to share with you.

248
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
Let me tell you about my feelings.

249
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,680
Oh. She's live early today.

250
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,360
-[Jane] …what I want to do with my life.
-Is everything okay, honey?

251
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
Yeah. She's just doing it for fun.

252
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,400
When you hear me say that
you think those are my dreams.

253
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,200
-YOU'RE SENTIMENTAL TODAY.
-I'M GOING TO CRY.

254
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
But you know what?

255
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
-THIS IS DIFFERENT.
-DON'T TEASE US.

256
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,840
Every time I try dreaming

257
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,400
I just feel completely empty.

258
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,040
That's because everyday…

259
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,280
I don't have any time
to think about myself.

260
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,720
I spend all of my time
reviewing all these crappy products.

261
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,520
[Jane] Do you think these products
are really good?

262
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,880
What the hell does she think she's doing?

263
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,360
Jane, what are you doing?

264
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
[door rattling]

265
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,640
[knocks]

266
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,520
Jane, open the door. Jane!

267
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
Honey, go get the key.

268
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
Jane, it's your dad. Open the door!

269
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,760
I have to lie to you all.

270
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Do you want to know why?

271
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,920
TELL US WHO HURT YOU.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,480
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS.

273
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
TELL US WHO HURT YOU.

274
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
-DON'T CRY, JANE.
-YOU POOR THING.

275
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,640
-TELL US, JANE.
-HANG IN THERE.

276
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
-DAMN.
-[sobs]

277
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,600
It's because my parents don't know
how to earn money themselves.

278
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,480
They use me to make money for them.

279
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,280
[knocking on door]
Jane!

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
-THEY'RE ABUSIVE PARENTS.
-CAPITALISM IS EVIL.

281
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,280
-THAT'S SO LOW.
-I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, JANE.

282
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,520
But I'm sick of lying to everyone, okay?

283
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,760
TOUGHEN UP OR GIVE UP.

284
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,040
-HEY!
-YOU LYING BITCH.

285
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm sick of doing things
I don't want to do.

286
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,440
I'm mad. Mad, mad, mad, mad.

287
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
-Jane!
-[Jane] Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad!

288
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Honey.

289
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,119
Jane!

290
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,599
[gasps]

291
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,200
[Jane] But when realized I don't want
to do any of this anymore,

292
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
one thought popped into my head.

293
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
And I knew immediately

294
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,200
that's what I'll do.

295
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,839
CALM DOWN, JANE.

296
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040
I want to die.

297
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Hello, Officer.

298
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,840
My daughter's live-streaming her own
suicide, but I don't know where she is.

299
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,960
I need you to track the location
of her phone for me.

300
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,920
[Jane's dad] It's JennyX.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
CALM DOWN, JANE.

302
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
YOU JUST SAY THAT TO GET ATTENTION.

303
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,880
-NO, JANE.
-SHE WOULDN'T DARE.

304
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,880
-[sniffles, sighs]
-YOU ATTENTION SEEKER.

305
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,200
If I do this, where do you think I should…

306
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
cut myself, everyone?

307
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
Should I cut my wrist, stab myself,

308
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
or slit my throat?

309
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,120
You have to help me decide.

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,840
I can't stand living like this anymore.

311
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,560
-Officer, please hurry up.
-[crying]

312
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
No, I have an idea.

313
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,080
-GO FOR THE THROAT.
-CUT YOUR THROAT IF YOU DARE.

314
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,880
Click "like" for the wrist.
"Wow" for the chest.

315
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
THINK THIS THROUGH, JANE.

316
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,760
For the throat, click on the "heart."

317
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,160
-DON'T DO THIS.
-HEART ALL THE WAY.

318
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,000
-ARE YOU SERIOUS?

Oh, the wrist. That's getting the votes.

your death.

Yes, she is.

Now, your parents will have no idea
that you weren't actually at home.

00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,440
By the time they realize it,
everything will be over.

Here are all the tools you can use
to kill yourself.

You don't even have to use
the name Jane anymore.

361
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,800
From now on, what would you like
to call yourself?

362

-What do you have to say?
-[grunts]

371
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,120
First of all, my wife and I would like
to say to anyone watching

372
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,280
that we're both devastated
by what happened to Jane.

373
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,200
We also have something to say.

374
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,040
We'd like to beg everyone to stop sharing
Jane's suicide clip

375
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,200
out of respect for her.

376
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,640
[reporter] Do you want people to stop
sharing the clip because of what she said

377
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,800
about product endorsement deals
and what the two of you made her do?

378
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,680
You can say anything you want about us,

379
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
but please you have to believe that

380
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,800
we both truly love and care about her.

381
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
[Jane's dad] Thank you.

to have seen the girl in this picture

383

anywhere on the Friday evening
before she live-streamed her suicide,

I know. I didn't expect that.

403
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,840
But it's okay.
We'll soon forget all about JennyX.

404
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,280
They will move on and someone new will
replace you. Everyone will forget you

405
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,320
faster than you expect.
And when that happens…

Hey, I bought you some soy milk.

Drink some and get some sleep.

Her suicide may have been faked.

Yuri.

This seems to be the place where JennyX
live-streamed her suicide.

420
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,280
Will the famous internet star's suicide
turn out to be nothing but a big fake?

Didn't we get rid
of everything in that room?

Maybe someone came in

00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,840
[Yuri] I couldn't believe Jane would do
something like this.

428
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,880
I'm actually very close to her.
We're best friends.

429
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,800
Jane was a very kind

430
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,520
-and gentle person.
-Who is this girl?

I've never even seen her before today.

Do you think Jane's suicide was faked?

433
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,120
I believe a kind and sweet girl like Jane

434
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,400
couldn't think of something
like this herself.

435
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,160
Someone else must be behind this.
I'm sure of it.

In order to uncover the truth,

I'm screwed.

What do we do now?

Why are you so upset?
As long as no one recognizes you…

446
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,160
it will be like Jane is actually gone.

[chuckles]

479
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,680
You'll have to teach me some tips.

480
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,760
Tell me what you want from me.

481
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,040
It's not too late
to change your mind, Jane.

482
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,120
I have a way to get you out of this.

483
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,720
Do you want to meet?

484
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,760
[sighs]

485
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,280
[line disconnected]

[sighs]

487
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,200
I thought you wouldn't show up, Jane.

488
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Who's Jane? I'm Rosie.

489
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,720
[chuckles]

490
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
That's right. Rosie.

491
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,240
First, you changed your name,
then, what did you do after that?

492
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,200
You got a haircut, a tattoo.
You pierced your nose.

493
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,760
-You bought new clothes--
-Stop.

494
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,120
[tense music]

495
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,560
I have all the pictures. I can prove it.

496
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,720
You went from being Jane
to being this Rosie. Is that right?

497
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,800
What do you want from me?

498
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,400
Money?

499
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,800
[mimics buzzer]

500
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,040
If you don't want money, what is it?

501
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm trying to help you here.

502
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,680
I know you're working with someone.

503
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,400
Someone that goes by the name
of Nanno, maybe.

504
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,920
She's the real danger.

505
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,720
How do you know Nanno?

506
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,920
[chuckles]
I know her better than you do, Rosie.

507
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,480
For example, these pictures…

508
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,320
Who could've taken them besides Nanno?

509
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,040
I just have these pictures from her cloud.

510
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,280
If you don't believe me, look through
her cellphone and see for yourself.

511
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But let me tell you one thing.

512
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,240
Your only way out…

513
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,040
is to get away from Nanno.

514
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,680
However,
just running away won't be enough,

515
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,920
because Nanno will still be able
to get you.

516
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,640
Then what should I do about her?

517
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,160
I know of one way to keep her quiet.

518
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,120
[clicks tongue]

519
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,000
[chimes]

520
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
Understand now?

521
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
I only want what's best for you.

522
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,040
[door closes]

523
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Where have you been?

524
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,400
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

525
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,560
Staying in this room is not
what I call freedom.

526
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,520
It's not as fun as I thought it'd be.

527
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,480
Do you want to go back to being JennyX?

528
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,400
Have you forgotten how you are now Rosie?

529
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
You should forget about JennyX.

530
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,680
Be patient a little longer
for things to die down.

531
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,160
Then, you can live your life
whichever way you want.

532
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,240
I guess you're right. As long as
no one finds proof of what we did.

533
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,200
[chuckles]

534
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,880
If Yuri really had any proof,

535
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,120
she would've leaked it by now.

536
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:33,640
So, do you think there's anyone else
who might have evidence?

537
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,280
I think that…

538
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,320
you're feeling confused right now.

539
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,160
I guess I'm just missing home.

540
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,720
[laughing]

541
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Home?

542
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,640
Do you mean the home where your mom
and dad exploited you for money?

543
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,640
If you do this, you will never go home
or see your parents ever again.

544
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,760
You sure you want that?

545
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,800
[scoffs]
I'll be fine. I don't need my parents.

546
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,080
Besides, they're the ones
leeching off of me.

547
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,240
With a family like that,
who needs them anyway.

548
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm so sorry…

549
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,320
but I don't think you'll be able
to go home ever again.

550
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
[tense music]

551
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,520
[whimpers]

552
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,639
[Yuri] I've recently discovered
that Jane had a new friend named, Nanno.

553
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,679
Maybe she's the missing link,
the reason behind all of this.

554
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
Do you want to know how close they are?

555
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,159
On top of that, I've also found another
set of footprints at the suicide scene.

556
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,040
Do you see there are two sets
of footprints?

557
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,480
I think that one of them belongs to Nanno.

558
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,159
More importantly,

559
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,000
someone has already informed the police

560
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,320
giving the clues
about where these two girls are hiding.

561
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,040
What are you doing?

562
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,560
[stuttering]

563
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Uh, I made a mistake.
I don't want to be Rosie anymore.

564
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,480
[sighs]

565
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,680
I already told you.

566
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,280
You should've thought this through
before you did all this, right?

567
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,080
But now, you don't have a home anymore.

568
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,240
Come to think of it.

569
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,400
There might be a way.

570
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,240
[whimpers]

571
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Nanno.

Just kill me. Do what Yuri told you to do.

[sniffles]

577
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,120
By now, your desperate parents
must be missing their darling daughter.

578
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,760
Their precious daughter
has been missing for so long.

579
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,680
Who knows whether she's dead or alive?

580
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,880
And their goody-goody daughter
isn't having fun.

581
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,520
She wants to go back to her own life.

If you choose to lie…

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,080
I killed Nanno.

591
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,000
[sobs]
Nanno is dead.

592
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,240
[Yuri] Shut up and listen, Jane.

593
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,960
You have to mess up the room

594
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,960
and cut yourself a few times
to make it look like you two had a fight.

595
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Then, put the knife
in Nanno's hand to frame her.

596
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,600
After all that,
I think you know what to do.

It's what you're good at.

[pants heavily]
It was so horrible, everyone.

She forced me to do all kinds of things.

610

This, I didn't want
to dye my hair this color.

It's not what I wanted at all.

612

And… and she also tried to force me
to have sex with her.

Stay away.

614

Get out.

I really didn't mean to do it.

But if I hadn't done that, I…

00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,760
You forced me to sell all those products

640
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,800
and you made me eat all that bland food.

641
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,920
Enough already!

642
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,560
Jane has never spoken
to us like that, ever.

643
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,800
God, the food was delicious.

644
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,880
We're strict about Jane's diet

645
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,240
because we know
what food she's allergic to.

646
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,880
We would never put our daughter at risk.

647
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,440
And we put a tracker on her

648
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
because we were afraid
she will meet someone like you.

649
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,280
[Jane's dad] We do all those things
because Jane wants us to.

650
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,080
That's what she's always wanted
ever since she was little.

651
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,600
Ta-da. Dad, Mom,

652
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,040
I want to be famous.

653
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,320
Can you two help me?

654
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,720
That's why we do everything we do.
We want to make her dreams come true,

655
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,880
so she can be the superstar
that she wants to be.

656
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,560
[sobbing]

657
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,720
You deceived our daughter.

658
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
Are you trying to deceive us too?

659
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,280
I'm not deceiving you.

660
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Do you two really not remember me?
I'm your daughter, Jane.

661
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,240
[Jane sobs]

662
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,760
But…

663
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,320
do you remember what you said to me?

664
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,880
"I'll be fine. I don't need my parents.

665
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,280
They're the ones leeching off of me.

666
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,160
A family like that…"

667
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,800
…who needs them anyway.

668
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,960
If you can't even remember
what you said and what you did,

669
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,560
how can anyone remember you?

670
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,640
Nanno, you…

671
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,480
You bitch.

672
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
[grunting]

673
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,840
-You ruined my life!
-[Jane's mom] No!

674
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,760
-I killed you! How come you're still here?
-[Jane's dad] Stop it.

675
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,080
Get out!

676
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,120
-[panting]
-[Nanno gasping, laughs]

677
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,680
I ruined it?

678
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,000
You're the one who ruined your life.

679
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,320
[Nanno] Don't you remember?

680
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,800
You're the one who killed JennyX.

681
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,720
[smacks lips]

682
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,240
Jane told us about all the horrible
things, everything that you did to her.

683
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,920
[sobbing]
That's right.

684
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,840
They forced me to do all these things
that I didn't want to do.

685
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,160
[Nanno]
Then they tried to pretend to be me.

686
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,480
I don't know what happened.

687
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,520
They were both working together.

688
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,040
[whimpering]

689
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,080
[Jane's dad] Right.

690
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,080
Please, dad.

691
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,760
Where did we set up the camera?

692
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,960
I want everyone
to see exactly what's happening.

693
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,760
It's over there.

694
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
[tense music]

695
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,920
-DON'T LET HER GET AWAY, JANE.
-WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS BITCH?

696
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,040
CALL THE POLICE, JANE.

697
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,720
SHE'S PROBABLY A WANNABE.

698
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,000
MAYBE SHE'S MENTALLY ILL.

699
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,800
Everyone, it's me, Jane.

700
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,200
Did you all see what happened?
What this imposter did to me?

701
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,920
[Nanno] You all must help me.

702
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,600
Please, show me your support
by sending me hearts.

703
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,520
You can send angry emojis
to this imposter.

704
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,880
-WHY DID SHE DO THIS TO YOU?
-POOR JANE.

705
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,480
[sobbing]
Dad. Mom.

706
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,400
Please, it's me, Jane. I'm Jane.

707
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,280
Don't you remember me?

708
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,840
Are you really going to keep lying?
You're shameless.

709
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,360
Dad.

710
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,680
Dad.

711
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,680
Did we call the police yet?

712
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,800
Yes, honey.

713
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,200

-[reporter 2] Can you give a statement?

Everyone, I am JennyX.

-[Nanno] Everyone.
-It's me, Jane.

I'm right here.

725
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,520
Was I really that wrong, Nanno?

726
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,960
Did I really deserve this at all?

Did I really deserve this at all?

You're so evil.

731
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,440
And you, Yuri, still have a lot to learn.

[Yuri] You're bleeding.

It didn't heal?

735
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,280
You can't answer Jane's question?

736
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,080
Are you starting to doubt
what you're doing here?
