00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:08,772
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:39,702
What was that?
Is something in there?

3
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,041
Haru, what's wrong?

4
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:45,672
Let's go.

5
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:47,842
Haru, what is it?

6
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,977
Let's go back there.
I heard something weird...

7
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:54,052
Don't go.

8
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,291
It's just something
that always happens in the shadow.

9
00:00:58,676 --> 00:00:59,761
It's nothing.

10
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,492
But still...

11
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:07,001
I want to be with you, that's why.

12
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:09,802
Come on.

13
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,111
Haru.

14
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:20,542
Yes, I'm right here, Dan Oh.

15
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:22,952
I'm here.

16
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:27,282
Yes, you're right here.

17
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:34,062
It finally feels like
we're back in our places.

18
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:37,116
You and I both lost
our self-awareness once,

19
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:39,187
but we did not succumb
to the writer.

20
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:40,857
We ended up finding each other.

21
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:43,426
We created our own fate
by meeting once again.

22
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:45,327
What do you think?
Aren't we amazing?

23
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:48,241
Yes, so I'm very happy right now.

24
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:49,967
No, we have a long way to go.

25
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,312
We're going to spend our days
together when we're 19 and 20.

26
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:55,111
There will be way more things
we could do after we graduate.

27
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:58,581
My heart is perfectly fine now,
so what should we do first?

28
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,107
(All notes)

29
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:02,506
Forget these.

30
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,416
I'll write up new wishes here.

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,652
What should I write?

32
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,017
"Dan Oh and Haru's list".
"Write a letter to each other."

33
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:10,487
"Get matching items."

34
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:12,292
Oh, right.

35
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:13,786
No, this is nothing.

36
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:16,032
It's... Well, this is...

37
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,026
Did you see everything?

38
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,101
Yes.

39
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,671
"Kiss 100 times."

40
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,697
Yes. No. No way. Not that.

41
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:27,667
These are...
These weren't written by me.

42
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,511
It was written by... You know...

43
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,312
It's not me.

44
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:33,921
I didn't write these.

45
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,522
Where is he?

46
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:44,892
Right here, probably.

47
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,582
Man, the writer.

48
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,466
The writer is way too lazy...

49
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,276
to draw the story
now that it's about to end.

50
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,712
The writer left
only the things they need to draw...

51
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:08,207
and began to erase
the things they don't need.

52
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:11,022
Gosh, what should I make
for tomorrow?

53
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:13,191
That doesn't suit you.

54
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,332
- What?
- You and school.

55
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:19,731
I'm a member of A4
of Seuli High School, actually.

56
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:21,426
You're number one from the bottom.

57
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,731
Well, that's...

58
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,932
Then which place suits me better?

59
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:27,802
Well.

60
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:30,272
You seem kind of ancient.

61
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:32,571
Ancient?

62
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,751
- I have to go.
- Don't go.

63
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:44,191
Go.

64
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,592
You might be late for class.

65
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,892
I'm going to come back.

66
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:51,291
I want to come back
now that I've seen that face.

67
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:11,851
(Eun Dan Oh, Baek Kyung, Kim Ae Il)

68
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:24,592
(Haru, Kim Yang Il,
Kim Il Jin, Lee Yang Sam)

69
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:29,301
The writer
began to erase this world.

70
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:23,721
What are you up to?

71
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:26,861
- I'm writing a letter.
- A letter?

72
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:30,192
(Hey, Dan Oh. From Haru.)

73
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:34,101
What? This is your letter?

74
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,632
You call this a letter, Haru?

75
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,671
It's too short. It's confusing.

76
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:42,171
- Confusing?
- Yes.

77
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:45,267
You can say that
when you say goodbye too.

78
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:47,367
I want you to put in
a lot more effort...

79
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:48,707
and write something much longer.

80
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:49,782
Okay?

81
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,476
You write things...

82
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,776
that you always wanted to say...

83
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,221
to the other person
but couldn't in a letter.

84
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:57,692
Write those down.

85
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:02,392
What are you doing? Write something.

86
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:05,892
I have too many things
I want to say to you.

87
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:08,557
Like what? That I'm lovely, pretty,

88
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:10,601
cute, and that you like me so much?

89
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:11,827
Yes.

90
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:14,942
I know. Let's not write down
the obvious in the letters.

91
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,796
No, I want you to write it down.

92
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:19,012
Make it longer
and more detailed next time.

93
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:27,851
Haru!

94
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,822
Should I come in again?

95
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,716
I'll pretend like I didn't know,
so do your best to hide it.

96
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:36,791
Okay?

97
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:45,371
Goodness, Haru.
I had no idea you were here.

98
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:46,997
But what are you hiding over there?

99
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:48,142
A matching item.

100
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:52,072
Wait, are you doing this
because of my list?

101
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:55,807
Oh, right.
The letter, a matching item, and...

102
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,111
"Kiss 100 times."

103
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:00,007
Hey, you can leave that out.

104
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,152
Do you really want me to do that?

105
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:03,791
No. Yes.

106
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,861
Show me the matching item.

107
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,291
I'll look forward to it.

108
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,442
What is this?

109
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:28,811
Our matching item.

110
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,252
- I see.
- Isn't it pretty?

111
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,551
His taste is on another level.

112
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:37,791
Does that mean you like it?

113
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,887
Come on, now.
How could I not like this...

114
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,731
when you're looking at me like that?

115
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,971
Why are you smiling?
Your eyes are open, aren't they?

116
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:03,752
Come on! Why are you here?

117
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,351
Don't you ever...

118
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:06,621
What?

119
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,082
Forget it.

120
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:12,791
Do it again.

121
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,012
Hey, Dan Oh.

122
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,512
Look at that necklace.

123
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,681
This isn't a birthday party
at Seuli Kindergarten.

124
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:41,647
If it was the real Dan Oh,
she would've been disgusted...

125
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,051
and thrown it into the trashcan.

126
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:52,132
Is he trying to help her remember?

127
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:01,701
Dan Oh! Dan Oh!

128
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,811
Do you still not remember this?

129
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:08,112
This. Don't you remember
this flapping?

130
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,051
What?

131
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,782
That gaze is from...

132
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:16,051
You're right. I'm the Dan Oh
you know.

133
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:17,852
Dan Oh!

134
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:25,461
I hate coming to school
if you're not here.

135
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,701
I'm either playing the violin...

136
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,427
or walking to some strange music,
you know?

137
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:34,071
Of course, I know.
It's the A3 triangle walk.

138
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,341
By the way, what are those?

139
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:39,411
- Our matching items.
- What?

140
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,112
Should I have not told him?

141
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:47,807
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

142
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,707
I'm going to be a great friend
to you both.

143
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,846
I'm saying this on the honor of A3.

144
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,321
Three Seuli Musketeers, cross!

145
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,431
- Cross!
- Cross!

146
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,282
I couldn't find it.

147
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,352
I wished I hadn't seen it.

148
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:28,091
Why are you looking at me
like that?

149
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:29,486
Kyung.

150
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:30,862
Make it quick.

151
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:32,461
Thanks.

152
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:36,002
- For what?
- For helping her regain her memory.

153
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,472
We're not that close
to thank each other.

154
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,266
Then can I ask for a favor?

155
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,012
Don't be ridiculous.

156
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,571
My fiancee likes you over me...

157
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:48,581
whether it be on stage
or the shadow.

158
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:51,782
She's always been that way.

159
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:54,681
Once she set her mind on something,
she'd see to it.

160
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,581
That's like her.

161
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:59,821
What do you know? You've never
seen her when she was little.

162
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:02,061
I know that you are unlikable...

163
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,561
whether it be on stage
or the shadow.

164
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,831
I used to think that her preference
for men was weird.

165
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,071
But she's finally where she belongs.

166
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,512
Both you...

167
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:21,581
And you.

168
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,382
And me.

169
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:39,532
Ignore me.

170
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,102
I just don't want to go to class.

171
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:45,972
No, thanks.

172
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,512
Gosh, you're such
a terrible student.

173
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,512
This is where we met.

174
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:59,282
We met inside the writer's world...

175
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,882
as a fiance and a fiancee.

176
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,091
But now, we're here.

177
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:24,897
What are you doing?

178
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,311
That's the real you.

179
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,581
It's a gift.

180
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,622
(Baek Kyung)

181
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:36,252
This is like you.

182
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:39,392
You put your heart
into the most useless gifts.

183
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:43,992
(Baek Kyung)

184
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,431
Gosh, I hate you.

185
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,171
Dan Oh.

186
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,272
I'm not used to saying thank you.

187
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,181
You can say that again.

188
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,252
(Baek Kyung)

189
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:08,382
Thanks.

190
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,392
I'll see you on the next stage.

191
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,742
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

192
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:35,841
What is this?

193
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,451
Open it.

194
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:52,862
How do I look?

195
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,701
I have a knack for finding
pretty things.

196
00:13:57,756 --> 00:13:59,372
When did you get this?

197
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,201
I'm not sure.

198
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:04,366
You're the only thing I think of.

199
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,142
I can't remember anything else.

200
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,181
Nam Ju.

201
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:14,722
Nam Ju.

202
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,951
Do you really not remember?

203
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,016
Remember what?

204
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,392
When and where did you get this?

205
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,161
I don't know.

206
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,585
Before being the heir of Serinne,

207
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:28,561
you're a high school student.

208
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:31,632
You don't have a good sense
of economy, do you?

209
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:34,472
What?

210
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:37,866
Here.

211
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,642
(Allowance Entry Book)

212
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:41,941
- What is this?
- It's an allowance entry book.

213
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:43,777
"Allowance entry book"?

214
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:46,336
Write in this, and I'll check.

215
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,522
Okay?

216
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,852
I'm going to turn you
into a great man.

217
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,762
All right. I'll try.

218
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,132
Okay. Let's go.

219
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,966
Nam Ju, go inside first.

220
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,341
Okay.

221
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:14,512
Stop right there.

222
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,551
Should I guess
what you were planning to do?

223
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,307
Why would you do that?

224
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:21,307
Since I was just with Nam Ju,

225
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:24,515
you can't lie and say that
he was looking for me.

226
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,591
You were probably going to make me
slip by pouring water on the floor.

227
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,661
Or ruin the flower I was growing.

228
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:33,091
Or perhaps, hide my PE uniform.

229
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,931
I have another uniform in my locker.

230
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,972
I'm sorry, but that's fake.

231
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,472
Next time, pour oil on the floor.

232
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,571
Then I can surely slip.

233
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:49,112
You don't improve, do you?

234
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:50,951
You're too obvious and boring.

235
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:52,852
Sae Mi.

236
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:57,077
If I were you,
I'd find another hobby...

237
00:15:57,077 --> 00:15:58,992
than bullying.

238
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:03,421
What are you guys doing?

239
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:08,602
And find a guy who's nearby.

240
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,626
- What?
- I think...

241
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,297
it's better for you...

242
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,872
to find someone who likes you more,
not the other way around.

243
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,612
Find someone who is always
by your side...

244
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:20,211
and thinks the world of you.

245
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:25,112
Hey, what do you know about me?

246
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,421
She's so nosy.

247
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:32,152
What's going on? Why are you
so upset from the early morning?

248
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:34,486
Guys, I'm going
to turn the camera off.

249
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,691
Just stay still.

250
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:38,831
Are you okay?

251
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,331
Why are you crying?

252
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:54,642
Do Hwa.

253
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,536
Hey, Ju Da.

254
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:58,681
Don't pretend
like you didn't see me.

255
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:00,451
I'm not.

256
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:04,622
What?

257
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,661
They're pretty and comfortable.
I can still wear them, right?

258
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:14,861
I couldn't fly freely
like this butterfly.

259
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,056
But you told me...

260
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,101
that a small flutter of a butterfly
can change one's fate.

261
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,472
Although that small flutter
didn't work out for us,

262
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,972
I'm sure it would've been meaningful
for someone else, right?

263
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,207
What a shame.
Can't the three of us go out?

264
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,877
I can date you
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

265
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,621
And I can date Nam Ju
on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

266
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:38,151
And I can spend some time alone
on Sunday.

267
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,462
My gosh, aren't you too greedy?

268
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:45,016
This is what the heroine
of a romance comic book does.

269
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,656
She weighs her love interests
in a love triangle.

270
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:48,732
Did you not know?

271
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:55,242
My man must be waiting for me.

272
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:57,966
I picked that up from Nam Ju.

273
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,371
I'll get going.

274
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:06,682
Ju Da.

275
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,821
Goodbye, forever now.

276
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:20,262
Gosh, they should be coming
in any minute now.

277
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,262
My goodness. You startled me.

278
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:24,357
Hey, you should've let me know
that you were here.

279
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,301
You almost gave me a heart attack.

280
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:31,566
Well, I'm not doing this
to make myself feel better.

281
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,172
It's a type of ritual.

282
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,841
- Ritual?
- Yes.

283
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,311
Great. He's here.

284
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,482
- Darn it.
- Hey, come on.

285
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,051
- Where are you going? Come inside.
- Let go of me.

286
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,091
Darn it. Stop overreacting.

287
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,791
Stop.

288
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,932
Sit down when I say nicely.

289
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,272
You too.

290
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:09,782
Eat a lot.

291
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:12,081
What's that?

292
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:14,575
You guys used to like them...

293
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:15,851
in "Trumpet Creeper".

294
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,321
Some things ought to be forgotten.

295
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:24,591
But having a memory
is a cruel thing.

296
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,156
That must be why we suffered a lot.

297
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:30,601
Stop beating around the bush.
Get to the point.

298
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,801
We have quite the history
in the previous story.

299
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:35,901
Well, it wasn't unintentional.

300
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,341
Let's call this a ritual.

301
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,641
There's no reason behind it.

302
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:44,752
We will leave this place
once we have to.

303
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,551
Let's not get mad...

304
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,722
or hate each other
from now on.

305
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:54,391
Goodness, I shouldn't have meddled
in the first place.

306
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,831
Why don't we put the past behind us?

307
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,066
The writer is too cruel.

308
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,006
You guys are only 18.

309
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:20,377
How old are you then?

310
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:21,522
It's a secret.

311
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:33,762
Haru.

312
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:41,541
That's odd.

313
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,571
You called me by my name.

314
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:49,881
It's been hard, right?

315
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,722
Goodbye.

316
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,162
I'll get going.

317
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:30,891
You always have the same look
on your face when you're alone.

318
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,391
How do I look?

319
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:35,692
You look sad...

320
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:37,321
and lonely.

321
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:38,831
Lonely?

322
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,202
I've always been alone
from the beginning.

323
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:44,502
Whether I feel lonelier...

324
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:47,601
or less lonely,
it doesn't change anything.

325
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,472
Dan Oh told me...

326
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,942
to find the real me.

327
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,182
I know the real you.

328
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,682
Should I tell you?

329
00:21:58,437 --> 00:21:59,937
You probably don't remember,

330
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:02,177
but you were affectionate
and friendly...

331
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:03,621
in "Trumpet Creeper".

332
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,492
You were adorable.

333
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,922
You're just making up stuff
because I can't remember it.

334
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:11,532
You were always lonely.

335
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:20,301
That's the look you always had.

336
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:41,821
You can't throw out trash here.

337
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:44,762
This will all disappear
on the next stage anyway.

338
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:48,432
Fine, then.

339
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:54,002
I remember everything about you
in this story.

340
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,172
I'm glad...

341
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:00,912
that the writer made me
your younger brother.

342
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:04,381
That's the funniest thing
you ever told me.

343
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,212
That means
that I'm always by your side.

344
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,482
I don't need you.

345
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:12,952
You can't be honest
just like back then and now.

346
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,357
Wait, there's something in my eye.

347
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:27,172
Really? Let me blow on your eye.

348
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,512
Lee Do Hwa!

349
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:35,641
Hey.

350
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,076
What are you doing? Hey.

351
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:40,107
What was that?

352
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,551
This is tasty though.

353
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:44,891
Are you serving stir-fried
dried squid today?

354
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:47,917
I have forgotten
that you are in A3 for a moment.

355
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:48,992
You.

356
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,591
Don't get close to Su Hyang.

357
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,087
What? Su Hyang?

358
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:57,056
When did you get so close?

359
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,301
I sometimes go and hang out
in the cafeteria.

360
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,541
- Why?
- To keep an eye on him?

361
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,847
What's up with your eyes, Su Hyang?

362
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:17,617
There are a few things
that people cannot conceal.

363
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,976
They are cough and love.

364
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,361
And your eyes just now looked...

365
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:12,742
You're getting punished...

366
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:15,311
because you changed
my brother's stage.

367
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:22,922
Your name got erased.

368
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:26,516
You're an extra
who interrupted the stage.

369
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,591
I know.

370
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,262
Aren't you scared?

371
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,391
I would be really scared
if I were you.

372
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:33,692
I am.

373
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:37,061
When I try to guess
how much time I have left,

374
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,801
it scares me.

375
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:40,732
And I'm frightened.

376
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:45,272
But when I think about Dan Oh,
I feel okay.

377
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,841
The time Dan Oh and I spent
will be eternal.

378
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:52,012
The love Dan Oh gave me...

379
00:25:52,437 --> 00:25:53,881
will not disappear...

380
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,381
after the story ends...

381
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:57,791
and when I disappear.

382
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,692
You don't regret your decision?

383
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:06,762
Not at all.

384
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:09,486
I have never regretted once.

385
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,172
Since the writer created this world,

386
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:15,672
I always thought
we never had a choice.

387
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:19,012
I thought behaving as I'm drawn
was my fate.

388
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,242
But you chose your own fate.

389
00:26:22,306 --> 00:26:23,712
That's why the story changed.

390
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,282
I'm envious of your bravery.

391
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:29,782
You made the scenes
in the shadow real.

392
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:33,551
Dan Oh probably got
her memories back...

393
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:36,246
because you tried to change the fate
the writer decided...

394
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:39,762
for us in "Trumpet Creeper"
and "Secret", right?

395
00:26:40,187 --> 00:26:41,732
I made my decision too.

396
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,532
I'm going to stay
next to my brother...

397
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,532
until the last scene
the writer draws.

398
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:52,242
I hope you will be...

399
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,811
with someone you love
in the last scene.

400
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:56,841
I truly hope that for you.

401
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,087
(Write a letter to each other, get
matching items, kiss 100 times,)

402
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,262
(give each other unforgettable
gifts: about to be fulfilled)

403
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:20,571
This is my gift of time to you,
Haru.

404
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,866
Dan Oh, you're such a romanticist.

405
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:26,041
What's that?

406
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:29,337
- Nothing.
- No way.

407
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,476
That was definitely
a men's watch. Is it for...

408
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:34,722
It's mine. Mine.
I'm going to use it.

409
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:39,952
What's going on, you two?

410
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:43,746
What happened, Sae Mi?

411
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,232
What? Darn it. Why did he go alone?

412
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:47,391
What's going on?

413
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:58,071
This is Haru's locker.

414
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:03,667
Dan Oh, what are you doing?
Hurry up and come.

415
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:04,811
Okay.

416
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:07,952
He'll be surprised, won't he?

417
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,495
(Final Episode will air shortly.)

418
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:29,421
Haru!

419
00:28:29,422 --> 00:28:30,796
(Final Episode)

420
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:34,197
- You're here.
- Yes.

421
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,301
Oh, it was...
It was fallen on the ground...

422
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:44,006
on my way here.

423
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:49,141
Hey, I gave this a thought.

424
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:52,071
You said the lines and situations
of the previous work are repeated,

425
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,447
but I don't think
everything went as the writer hoped.

426
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,411
We finally got to say the things...

427
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:58,981
we really wanted to say and hear...

428
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:01,157
in the scenes that the writer drew.

429
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:02,727
We remembered those lines...

430
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,757
because we wanted to say it
outside of the scenes.

431
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:07,996
We wanted to tell each other
how we really feel.

432
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,106
Haru.

433
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,676
- Yes?
- Don't look at me for a second.

434
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:24,816
Okay.

435
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:27,746
Do you like me?

436
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:29,787
Yes.

437
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,487
I don't.

438
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:33,856
What?

439
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:37,127
I love you.

440
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:41,427
Thank you for giving...

441
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:44,197
an extra like me
the present of first love.

442
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,106
I love you, Haru.

443
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,046
Me too.

444
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:08,597
One second.

445
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:25,576
Haru.

446
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:57,761
Everyone, Nam Ju has
something to say.

447
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:59,247
- What?
- What is it?

448
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:06,941
I had a lot of fun with you all
in the same class.

449
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:09,986
Above all, year 2, class 7 was
more special to me...

450
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:14,856
because I could make
precious memories with Ju Da.

451
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,581
- What was that?
- Come on.

452
00:31:17,582 --> 00:31:19,097
That's too much.

453
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,791
(Look...)

454
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,091
- "Look at the I..."
- "Look at the I..."

455
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,761
- "with my look?"
- "with my look?"

456
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,601
"At this time,"

457
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:32,947
- "love with..."
- "love with..."

458
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:35,601
- "someone else."
- "someone else."

459
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,977
"The letters seriously say..."

460
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,947
"that I like you so much at first."

461
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,757
Ju Da, read this.

462
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:49,881
"Look at the I with my look"?

463
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:52,796
"At this time,
love with someone else"?

464
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,766
She must be dating someone else.

465
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,161
She must only watch
the movies with him.

466
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,366
This is very serious.

467
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,007
"I love you so much."

468
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:08,717
What is she saying?

469
00:32:08,742 --> 00:32:11,717
Hey, read
just the first letters vertically.

470
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:13,742
"Look at..."

471
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:16,116
- "Look at the back letters."
- "Look at the back letters."

472
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,612
- "Look at the middle letters."
- "Look at the middle letters."

473
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:21,356
- "I love you so much."
- "I love you so much."

474
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:25,091
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

475
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:26,866
- Man, that's good.
- It was.

476
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,136
My 18th year of life was
filled with only you, Ju Da.

477
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:33,766
Nam Ju.

478
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:39,107
From now on, my only woman is...

479
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:42,317
- Yeo Ju Da!
- Yeo Ju Da!

480
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:46,172
Gosh, that was cool.

481
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,247
My goodness.

482
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:14,330
Haru, this is weird.
I continue to...

483
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,476
Dan Oh.

484
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:21,447
We have to go.

485
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,406
Dan Oh.

486
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:45,447
Your scar.

487
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:48,747
This is too precious.

488
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:50,776
You got hurt trying to save me.

489
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:54,187
No, it can't be gone.
You have to remember.

490
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:55,357
Dan Oh.

491
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,886
Back then, I couldn't protect you.

492
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,757
But this time,
I'm glad your fate changed.

493
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:07,526
I'm sorry...

494
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:11,167
I can't be with you
in the last scene.

495
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:26,646
Dan Oh.

496
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:28,516
Don't cry.

497
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:32,627
Today is the happiest day for me.

498
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:35,156
Because you were...

499
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:37,656
my beginning and the end.

500
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:52,846
Call my name.

501
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:56,776
Dan Oh.

502
00:34:58,342 --> 00:34:59,417
My name.

503
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:04,317
Haru.

504
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,427
Haru.

505
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:15,636
Dan Oh.

506
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,057
Haru.

507
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,286
Haru.

508
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:41,656
Haru.

509
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:44,297
Haru...

510
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,007
Haru...

511
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,177
Haru...

512
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:32,747
Haru...

513
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,047
Haru...

514
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:42,487
(1 year later)

515
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:09,917
(Seuli High School's
115th Graduation)

516
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,246
I'll draw on his nose.

517
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:17,017
If I think about the time
when I blew those balloons,

518
00:37:17,082 --> 00:37:18,712
I become too stressed
to sleep at night.

519
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:22,057
I know. Thanks to this punk,
I became a long-distance runner.

520
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:23,581
Draw more on that side.

521
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:25,051
I think we look more handsome
than him.

522
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:26,966
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

523
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,521
Nam Ju's here!

524
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,437
- What? Where?
- Where?

525
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:32,466
- It wasn't me.
- Me neither.

526
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:36,177
Hey, is Nam Ju a joke to you?

527
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:38,801
No, I've never thought that way.

528
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:39,832
Don't be ridiculous.

529
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,372
He's the number one boss
at our school.

530
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,517
Erase that.

531
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:44,702
- What?
- Erase that.

532
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,041
Who are you to order us around?

533
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,312
Me?

534
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:50,356
I'm that boss's girlfriend.

535
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,151
She's starting to feel
like the boss.

536
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,651
My gosh.

537
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,592
I'm so irritated at Nam Ju
and Ju Da!

538
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:01,691
Let's erase this.

539
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:03,736
- Nam Ju!
- Hurry up.

540
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:07,106
Once we graduate,
we'll never see him again.

541
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:09,037
That's why you should take photos.

542
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,076
What are you doing, Wifey?

543
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,242
What are you doing?

544
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:21,312
Nam Ju tortured you
all throughout this year.

545
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:23,917
I should do this
to relieve my stress.

546
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:26,157
Wifey.

547
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:28,826
I promise you that
I'd take care of you.

548
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:30,027
Seriously?

549
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:31,897
I don't expect that much.

550
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,521
Let's just take a photo.

551
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,797
- Us two?
- Yes.

552
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:37,037
That's not hard. Sure.

553
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:43,037
Ban Jang, make sure this looks nice.

554
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:47,472
I'm so proud of you.

555
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:49,242
You studied so hard
for the past three years.

556
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:51,417
And now, you've finally
brought honor to our school.

557
00:38:51,572 --> 00:38:55,011
Don't ignore me
when you become famous.

558
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:56,712
- Sure.
- You have...

559
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,881
the most followers.

560
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,411
But you're not following me back.

561
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:02,750
Being an influancer isn't
an easy job.

562
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:04,322
No. It's "influencer".

563
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:07,096
Ae Ri, you are an amazing friend.

564
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,322
You're great. Give her
a round of applause.

565
00:39:09,322 --> 00:39:10,822
Don't do that.

566
00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:12,937
By the way, have you registered
to get your name changed?

567
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:16,277
I gave it some thought.

568
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,407
"Ae Sam" is a cute name.

569
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,006
Have you seen Dan Oh?

570
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:23,671
- What?
- Dan Oh.

571
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:25,771
She was right here.

572
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:26,986
She went outside.

573
00:39:27,342 --> 00:39:31,312
Hey, I told you to use a filter.

574
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:33,527
I did. Look.

575
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:36,626
Come on.

576
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,761
(Dan Oh and Haru's list)

577
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:43,891
(Write a letter to each other, get
matching items, kiss 100 times,)

578
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:45,122
(give each other
unforgettable gifts,)

579
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:46,537
(meet in front of the 300-year-old
tree on October 10.)

580
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,476
You were here.

581
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:56,917
Your father is here.

582
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:58,716
I'll be there.

583
00:39:58,872 --> 00:40:00,246
Smile.

584
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,616
It's a good day.

585
00:40:05,281 --> 00:40:07,586
Of course, it is.

586
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:10,557
I'll go first.

587
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,267
Okay.

588
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:30,846
- You're finally here.
- He's so late.

589
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:34,746
Now that we're all here,
shall I begin?

590
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:35,986
Begin what?

591
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:43,482
"To A3, whom I love dearly."

592
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,366
"I remember the day
when we first met."

593
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:48,326
"We were in Forsythia Class
at Seuli Kindergarten."

594
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:52,267
"Nam Ju couldn't write yet."

595
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:56,277
"Kyung looked unhappy
back then as well."

596
00:40:57,531 --> 00:41:00,277
"And then there was me,
the cutest boy in the world."

597
00:41:00,732 --> 00:41:02,846
"From our first encounter,
I knew..."

598
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,746
"that we'd be good friends."

599
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:09,381
"Thanks to you, I had
a wonderful time."

600
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:10,442
"I will never forget you."

601
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:11,616
Do Hwa.

602
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:14,456
Why do you sound like
you're going somewhere far away?

603
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:17,751
We're graduating,
so I ought to do this.

604
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,197
Graduating isn't a big deal.

605
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:23,096
Even after graduation,
A3 will always be A3.

606
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,466
My boys.

607
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:29,177
He's right.

608
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:33,147
A3 shines the brightest
when we're all together.

609
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:36,441
Kyung, this isn't even the stage,
and you're saying such a thing?

610
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,547
"Stage"?

611
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:45,557
What I mean is, you always seem
like the star of the stage.

612
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:46,726
That's what I'm talking about.

613
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:49,826
- Thanks.
- When did you ever thank anyone?

614
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:55,297
You've all grown up!

615
00:41:56,122 --> 00:42:00,307
I'm saying this on A3's honor.
We'll always be together.

616
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:02,931
Gosh.

617
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:06,206
You're right, Nam Ju.

618
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:10,277
Come here.

619
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:13,746
I'm so happy to have you guys.

620
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,381
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

621
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:21,486
- Don't cry.
- Make a V.

622
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,226
- What was that?
- What?

623
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:25,952
- Look at that.
- Come on.

624
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:27,891
Who wants to take a photo?

625
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,466
I try not to let them grow on me,
but I fail every single time.

626
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,606
Why do you sound like a geezer?

627
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,137
You're standing here all alone
once again.

628
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,547
Do you want to take a photo?

629
00:42:40,702 --> 00:42:43,547
No, thanks. I don't want to have
anything to remember.

630
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:47,917
So what?
This is the last page anyway.

631
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:56,822
I thought I'd be happy
just looking at you,

632
00:42:56,822 --> 00:42:58,197
but I was wrong.

633
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,596
I was going to just watch you
from afar,

634
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:04,366
but that was hard.

635
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,067
Su Hyang.

636
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:12,177
It's been a long time...

637
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:15,506
since you've called my name.

638
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:22,147
Congratulations
on graduating from this world.

639
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:28,187
You've become more emotional.

640
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:31,856
I've missed you.

641
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:46,901
Everyone, gather here.

642
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:48,801
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

643
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:50,447
We're taking a photo!

644
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:55,242
Attention.

645
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,317
On such a wonderful day,
I ought to play the violin.

646
00:43:58,381 --> 00:43:59,911
- That'd be great!
- Yes!

647
00:43:59,911 --> 00:44:01,612
Don't be so cheesy.

648
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:04,726
Forget about the violin.
Let's take a photo instead.

649
00:44:04,982 --> 00:44:07,366
But I'm not in your class.

650
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,567
- So what?
- Do Hwa, come here.

651
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:15,307
Come on.

652
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:18,261
See? Ju Da is the boss.

653
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:19,447
Ju Da?

654
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:21,801
Let's take good care of her.

655
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:23,716
Yes. Look at the camera.

656
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:26,171
All right. Huddle a bit more.

657
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:27,612
- Okay.
- Huddle.

658
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:28,641
Look here. I'll set the timer...

659
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:30,482
- to five seconds.
- Okay.

660
00:44:30,482 --> 00:44:32,157
Su Chul, come here.

661
00:44:35,112 --> 00:44:37,551
- 5, 4,
- All right.

662
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:40,996
3, 2, 1.

663
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:42,267
Dan Oh.

664
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:55,076
(Haru)

665
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,937
I didn't congratulate you properly.

666
00:45:21,692 --> 00:45:24,506
Congratulations on your graduation,
Dan Oh.

667
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:28,546
You too, Kyung.

668
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,087
Dan Oh.

669
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:39,117
Thanks.

670
00:45:40,582 --> 00:45:43,397
Come on. Didn't you say
you don't usually thank people?

671
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:46,526
If I don't say it right now,

672
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,127
I don't know when I'd be able to.

673
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:54,437
Me too.

674
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:01,347
Thank you, Kyung.

675
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:05,677
Goodbye.

on your graduation.)

Ju Da.

684
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:06,167
Do you know
what the biggest secret I have?

685
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:07,651
- What is it?
- It's not that...

686
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:09,026
I'm not the real
son of Serinne Fashion's chairman...

687
00:49:09,592 --> 00:49:11,066
or that I get scared easily.

688
00:49:12,362 --> 00:49:13,736
Loving you...

689
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:15,736
was my biggest secret.

690
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,502
- He's such a romantic.
- That's so cool.

691
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:19,577
Nam Ju.

692
00:49:19,701 --> 00:49:22,602
- My goodness.
- He's so cool. Seriously.

693
00:49:22,602 --> 00:49:25,002
- I can't believe he said that.
- That's so cool.

694
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:26,847
- That was so romantic.
- How romantic.

696
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:55,306
"Dan Oh's Day"?

697
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:00,447
What is this? This is so silly.

698
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:54,466
(I hope this becomes
an unforgettable gift for Dan Oh.)

699
00:51:05,302 --> 00:51:08,516
(I hope this becomes
an unforgettable gift for Dan Oh.)

700
00:51:14,052 --> 00:51:15,756
Thank you, Haru.

701
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:19,397
For being my first love...

702
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:22,266
and my fate.

703
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,236
And...

704
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:01,066
Come on.

705
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:20,582
Heidegger claims...

706
00:52:20,582 --> 00:52:23,981
that our existence
is thrown into time.

707
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:26,292
When something or someone exists,

708
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:27,891
it's thrown into the world...

709
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:31,167
regardless of his or her will.

710
00:52:32,461 --> 00:52:33,536
Sir.

711
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:35,592
Then, does Heidegger think
that we, humans, exist...

712
00:52:35,592 --> 00:52:37,262
out of coincidences?

713
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:39,206
That's a great question.

714
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:42,731
The world has been created
regardless of one's will.

715
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:45,372
He's claiming that depending on
the relationship you make...

716
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:47,887
with the world,
you can create your own meanings.

717
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:50,381
We go on with our lives
in this current world.

718
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:52,756
As we love, suffer, and die,

719
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:55,627
we're living in a real world
according to Heidegger.

720
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:59,752
And all of us are individuals
that make up the world...

721
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:02,897
and exist in the world.
That's what he's saying here.

722
00:53:09,431 --> 00:53:14,546
(We are thrown into time.)

723
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:15,931
Good job today.

724
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:17,671
All right. Good job.

725
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,486
- Wait.
- What is this?

726
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:22,847
Hey, you.

727
00:53:23,582 --> 00:53:24,657
Yes?

728
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:33,097
Okay. Thank you.

729
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:39,122
Sae Mi, Su Chul is buying today.
Are you coming?

730
00:53:39,122 --> 00:53:41,006
I see. The one
who resumed his studies?

731
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:43,961
To be honest, I think
he's so handsome.

732
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:45,131
I heard he's the top of our class.

733
00:53:45,131 --> 00:53:46,201
And he gets good grades too.

734
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,631
She's falling for him hard.

735
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:49,772
But why is he buying meals
all the time?

736
00:53:49,772 --> 00:53:51,746
Because he's interested in me.

737
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:55,016
More than anything,
I think he's totally into me.

738
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:57,456
Hello.

739
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,082
Sae Mi, what do you want
to eat today?

740
00:54:02,082 --> 00:54:04,927
Why don't I treat you guys
to a delicious meal today?

741
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:08,151
Guo bao rou? Aglio e olio?

743
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:11,397
Yes, let's get that. The oil pasta.

00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:24,546
Who is he?

747
00:54:24,572 --> 00:54:26,372
He's that the WD
in early childhood education.

748
00:54:26,372 --> 00:54:27,372
"WD"?

749
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,087
The worst dresser.

750
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:32,082
Goodness. Look what he's wearing.

751
00:54:32,082 --> 00:54:33,526
His outfit is awful.

752
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:36,496
Su Chul, you should give him
a few tips.

753
00:54:36,822 --> 00:54:38,827
Are you indirectly flirting with me?

754
00:54:39,352 --> 00:54:41,827
You're right.
I'm pretty well-dressed.

755
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:43,837
Well, the rolled-up jeans
aren't a bad choice.

756
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,731
By the way,
he's kind of hot though.

757
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,072
My goodness. Not my style.

758
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:58,447
Gosh. How could you find him hot?
Have you gone mad?

759
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:48,897
Here.

00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:03,940
- That's gross.
- What?

762
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:05,572
- Get ready.
- Come on.

766
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:15,451
- Come on, Yang Il.
- Come on!

767
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:17,022
I'll... I'll get going.

768
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:19,122
- Come on.
- Gosh, you and your studies.

769
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:20,822
I have to turn in
my report tomorrow.

770
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:22,191
Then I'll get going too.

771
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:24,322
I have homework to do
and my mom is waiting for me.

772
00:56:24,322 --> 00:56:25,721
Hey, sit down.

773
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:28,907
I told you not to let someone
who can't have fun join us.

774
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:30,431
- Darn you.
- It's okay.

775
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:31,731
You're pretty cute.

776
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:33,677
Hey! Men and women are
supposed to be separated.

777
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:35,671
We should let Yang Sam go.

778
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:37,716
He studies so hard.

779
00:56:38,272 --> 00:56:40,312
- Thanks.
- Hey, guys.

780
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:41,941
Are you all dating? Is that so?

781
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:43,782
- Exactly.
- Darn it.

782
00:56:43,782 --> 00:56:45,687
- What?
- Strawberries?

783
00:56:46,342 --> 00:56:49,327
Hey, I really don't like
a guy like him.

784
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,657
Sae Mi, then who's your type?

785
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:55,327
It's a secret.

786
00:56:56,691 --> 00:56:57,996
That's a difficult one to solve.

791
00:58:16,302 --> 00:58:20,012
The leaves of the tree in the garden
turned so beautifully.

792
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:22,671
Hey, you know what? Today is
that tree's 300th birthday.

793
00:58:22,671 --> 00:58:24,711
That's amazing. It's so old.

794
00:58:24,711 --> 00:58:27,352
Don't call a tree old.

795
00:58:27,352 --> 00:58:29,026
It's like our janitor or something.

796
00:58:29,512 --> 00:58:31,857

- Goodness.
- You're embarrassing.

799
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:38,466
Hey, it's the same thing.
Think about it, girls.

800

or in the shadow,

If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

803
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:30,546
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

805
