1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,915
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:13,154
I will make my own answer.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,494
With you.

4
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,214
Haru?

5
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,925
Dan Oh.

6
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,235
Hey, Dan Oh.

7
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,505
Baek Kyung just left.

8
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,215
Baek Kyung?

9
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,014
You only remember me...

10
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,354
as Baek Kyung's fiancee
who has a heart condition.

11
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,794
Is that all?

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,965
Should I know more than that?

13
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,634
No.

14
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:46,875
You don't have to do that anymore.

15
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,219
He was usually quiet in class.

16
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,360
He's no joke.

17
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,430
He successfully does a smash
by 95.92 percent.

18
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,800
Wow, you can only see
Baek Kyung and Haru on the court.

19
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
You're right.

20
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,830
- My gosh.
- It was amazing.

21
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,204
Hey.

22
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,210
I don't think Baek Kyung ever gets tired.

23
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,114
- Tell me about it.
- Hey.

24
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,755
Quiet.

25
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:34,454
Dan Oh.

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,074
I thought it was about time
you got it taped again.

27
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,505
Give it to me.

28
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,715
Sure. I'll leave first.

29
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,715
Hey, let's go.

30
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,510
- Okay.
- I'll win next time.

31
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,585
Let's make a bet.

32
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,454
Seriously? Fine.

33
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,364
This is so awful.

34
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,789
Did you only pretend
as if you like Dan Oh...

35
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,260
just to use her?

36
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,435
Baek Kyung, you're human garbage!

37
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,174
Do Hwa, don't you know that
the stage and shadow are different?

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,229
If the writer drew that,
I can't help it.

39
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,845
I have to do it
even if I don't want to.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,140
That's true.

41
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,669
But it was just the worst,

42
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,744
so I couldn't help myself.

43
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,114
You need to step it up.

44
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,684
At least Dan Oh is self-aware.

45
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,950
If you keep changing the story,

46
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,684
what will happen to Nam Ju,
who has no idea?

47
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,095
Fine, I feel bad for him as is.
Happy now?

48
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,465
Have you ever
wanted to change the story?

49
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:54,104
Are you really okay playing
a character who betrays his fiancee?

50
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,775
Poor Dan Oh.

51
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,075
I never really thought about it.

52
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,614
("Secret")

53
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,244
But someone is making me
want to change it.

54
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,164
Have you ever
wanted to change the story?

55
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,604
Are you really okay playing
a character who betrays his fiancee?

56
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,684
Young man, it's not lunchtime yet.

57
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:46,484
I was wondering why Dan Oh was
in the cafeteria all the time.

58
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:48,184
What?

59
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,195
- What do you mean?
- Hey.

60
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,225
You aren't even surprised.

61
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:55,794
I guess you already knew
that I became aware of myself.

62
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,064
What should I call you?

63
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,775
Dried Squid Fairy? Right.

64
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,374
Or should I
just be casual with you...

65
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,515
just like Do Hwa?

66
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,984
That's not something I want to hear
coming from you.

67
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,725
Let's be nice to
other self-aware characters.

68
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,595
It's already frustrating enough to
be with idiots who never remember.

69
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,035
I mean, the thing with Haru too.
This comic book world is...

70
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,234
quite intriguing.

71
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,164
Are you worried about something?

72
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,060
No.

73
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,560
Come on, you are.

74
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,905
What is it?
Is it about that friend of yours?

75
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,159
The girl whose heart races
whenever she sees a boy?

76
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,760
Her heart began to stop.

77
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,799
No way, it didn't stop.

78
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,229
You're completely lovestruck.

79
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,244
All right, everyone.
Let me guess why she's lovestruck.

80
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,640
Don't be suspicious.

81
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,739
There is only one person
that you set your eyes on.

82
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:24,409
It's...

83
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,684
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

84
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,595
- Bye.
- Hey, wait.

85
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,089
I'll take the questionnaire
to other people.

86
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,234
I have to go.

87
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,500
Do we have to use this?

88
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,885
We have to add triethylamine.

89
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,984
You can look at this.

90
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,010
- You can get it anywhere.
- What are you doing?

91
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,849
You should just kiss him.

92
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,479
- No way.
- Look.

93
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,719
- What is it?
- Haru, this is the weight...

94
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,719
- of my love for you.
- Hey, wait. Haru.

95
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,119
Haru, look.

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,820
Haru, you look great
in the white gown.

97
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,864
- Haru, can you help me?
- No.

98
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,029
- Hey.
- Stop.

99
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,260
Haru doesn't like someone like you.

100
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,229
- Whatever.
- Move.

101
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,400
- Stop it.
- He doesn't like a girl like you.

102
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,575
Okay, fine. I know.

103
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,710
Everyone, come and get
the experiment equipment.

104
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,785
- Okay.
- Okay.

105
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,609
- Oh, right.
- My gosh.

106
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,039
Look at this.

107
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,655
Stop it, you're so annoying.

108
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,264
I can do it too.

109
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,669
You make me concerned.

110
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,870
I know you don't remember,
but don't do that.

111
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,600
What do I not remember?

112
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,845
Don't make me think you're like
the old Haru, not even for a second.

113
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,585
Don't make me think that way.

114
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,884
Please. Please don't do that to me.

115
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,795
Are you in my group?

116
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,490
No.

117
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,904
Then what are you doing here?

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,075
Just because.

119
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,274
"Just because"?

120
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,469
Is that part of your character?

121
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,744
Part of my character?

122
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,784
Then take better care of her.

123
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,188
- Haru!
- Haru.

124
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:54,059
Who are you eating with?
Do you want to eat together?

125
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,730
Just looking at his face
makes me full.

126
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,900
- He's so popular.
- Let's go to a cafe together.

127
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,445
- He is?
- Yes.

128
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,299
He's not as handsome as Nam Ju,

129
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,644
but he is handsome, indeed.
He stands out.

130
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,185
He and Baek Kyung got close
through the tennis team.

131
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,845
He's the only one
who's as competent as Baek Kyung.

132
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,114
There are rumors
that he may be a part of A3.

133
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,254
Without my knowing?

134
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:16,994
What?

135
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,095
Why do you look broken-hearted?

136
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,825
- Me?
- Yes, you look broken-hearted.

137
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,665
What's wrong?

138
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,335
Isn't he good-looking?
I know he is.

139
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,374
I should go first.

140
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,604
Dan Oh.

141
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,415
Let me go.

142
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,949
He said, "Ae Sam".

143
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,179
I thought you hated your name,
saying it was tacky.

144
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,520
Weren't you going to change it
after your graduation?

145
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,165
Hold on. Don't talk to me.

146
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,590
I want to cherish
this moment forever.

147
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,835
What?

148
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,429
I've made up my mind.

149
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,404
I'm no longer going
to have a crush on Baek Kyung.

150
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,798
I know you struggled because of me.

151
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,429
From now on, he is yours.

152
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:11,140
You only started liking him
not too long ago.

153
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,340
Haru is like a green grape.

154
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,679
From today on, I'm going
to like Haru.

155
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,980
What? Haru?

156
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,679
My gosh! What's wrong with you?

157
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,520
No. Haru is... He is...

158
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,795
What?

159
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,789
Just take care of Baek Kyung.

160
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,665
I'll take care of Haru.

161
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,034
Let's go see him.

162
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,965
My gosh!

163
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,699
I'm filming right now.

164
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,629
Everyone thinks you're a ghost.

165
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,029
Hey, why are there so many comments?

166
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,600
Hey, guys!

167
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,270
It's been a long time.

168
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,140
Thank you for the gifts.

169
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,784
No!

170
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,409
No, we're ready to accept gifts.

171
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,880
Hey, they left.

172
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,549
Dan Oh!

173
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,394
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

174
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,419
Sae Mi, what should I do?

175
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,665
(Hong Rui Zhen)

176
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,260
Is it tasty?
You can only feel better...

177
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,904
once you have something good.

178
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,815
It's because of Baek Kyung, isn't it?

179
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,345
When it comes to love,
things don't work out at times.

180
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,614
Nam Ju and I are
in a similar situation.

181
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,150
But all these struggles...

182
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,195
are needed in order
to reap true love.

183
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,350
So don't worry.
Baek Kyung will come back to you.

184
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,325
You've been at it for a decade.

185
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,034
I don't even know
how much time I have left.

186
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,364
A decade is nothing.

187
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,900
A decade is half our lifetime.

188
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,545
How is that nothing?

189
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,845
Look at them.

190
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,685
Haru lets the girls do
whatever they want.

191
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,415
It's the same person,

192
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,085
but he has completely forgotten
about me.

193
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,394
My gosh, look at her smiling.

194
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,565
We need to do that too. Dan Oh.

195
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,250
How do I look?

196
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,335
I gave him that name.

197
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,935
Hey, being depressed
doesn't suit you.

198
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,805
Should I hit Baek Kyung for you?

199
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,100
Should I show him what I've got?

200
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,845
I'm going to ignore him from now on.

201
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,350
You've turned from just
an ordinary extra...

202
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,725
to an extra who is controlled
by the writer.

203
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:42,994
It must be worse.

204
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,134
Get the evidence.

205
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,675
Get a photo of Nam Ju
and her together.

206
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,744
I apologize.

207
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:00,215
Thank you so much.

208
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,154
You're always working so hard.

209
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,384
Good luck.

210
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,534
It is worse to be an extra...

211
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,764
who is controlled by the writer.

212
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,675
Hello.

213
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,945
Aren't you Yeo Ju Da?

214
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,445
I should send you a pair.

215
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,815
It's okay.

216
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,854
You've received enough already.
One more item won't hurt.

217
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,784
Don't worry about it.

218
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,264
Right, I heard you're close
with Dan Oh.

219
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,520
Baek Kyung is so smart.

220
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,634
He found himself
a great future wife.

221
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,435
It'd be wonderful
if Nam Ju had a girlfriend as well.

222
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,904
Do you have anyone
you could introduce to him?

223
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,845
Perhaps, someone who is...

224
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,815
similar in status to him.

225
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,415
Mother!

226
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,614
Hey, Sae Mi.

227
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,654
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

228
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,354
Goodness, you're looking
more lovely from head to toe.

229
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,079
They say girls get prettier
when they're in a relationship.

230
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,065
Do you have a boyfriend?

231
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,864
I'm still looking for one.

232
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,329
There's no need to look far.

233
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,789
You should come over sometime soon.

234
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:30,959
I'd love that.

235
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,075
All right.

236
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,500
Oh, my. Time flew.

237
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,600
I'll see you at home soon.

238
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,075
- Yes, ma'am.
- Bye.

239
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,384
Ju Da.

240
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,854
Yes?

241
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,415
About your shoes...

242
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,124
I'll send you a pair today.

243
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,225
Come on, now. You're a student
at Seuli High School.

244
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,435
Mother, let me walk with you.

245
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,254
Nam Ju, when are you coming here?
Should I go there?

246
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,079
Your mother said
I must visit your house.

247
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,225
So I...

248
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,494
Hello? Hello?

249
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,175
Ju Da, do you know what this means?

250
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,270
How would she know that...

251
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,699
when she's not even taking
special classes?

252
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,370
What's the point of studying
another language...

253
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,585
if she will never go abroad?

254
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,439
What does that mean?

255
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,784
It's something nice.

256
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:57,380
Ju Da, isn't that your flower?
It's withering.

257
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,624
Oh, no. Poor thing.

258
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,965
- It's withering.
- There's something on your back.

259
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,095
- Is she stupid or what?
- What does it say?

260
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,264
She has no clue.

261
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,065
Look.

262
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,975
"May I have some money?"

263
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,344
It's not funny.

264
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,544
"Beggar"? How childish.

265
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,855
"Worn out shoes".

266
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,655
You guys are like her shoes.

267
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,824
Who is it? Who stuck this on her?

268
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,294
Sae Mi?

269
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,935
Is it you again?
I'm very disappointed.

270
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,195
"Disappointed"?

271
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,929
You're disappointed in me?

272
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,034
Let's go.

273
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,605
Nam Ju.

274
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,514
That little...

275
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,195
Thanks for helping me.

276
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,879
Don't make me look so miserable.

277
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,390
- What?
- I know...

278
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,834
that we're
from two different worlds.

279
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,390
So stop pitying me.

280
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,830
- When did I pity...
- I don't want to have hope...

281
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,375
and get hurt.

282
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,744
I don't know where you got
that idea from,

283
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:29,284
but I've never pitied you.

284
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,780
- But...
- Let me prove to you...

285
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,355
how sincere I am...

286
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,425
right now.

287
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,695
Is Haru still someone else?

288
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,705
Come here.

289
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,130
How about doing
what you did before...

290
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,900
when he was still called Number 13?

291
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,929
No.

292
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,729
There was a butterfly effect.

293
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,344
Make small changes, okay?

294
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,145
Will you let the story
go this way?

295
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,009
- And you?
- Me?

296
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,615
Nam Ju made a fuss before leaving.

297
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,385
It was for Ju Da's stage.

298
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,749
Did Shin Sae Mi pick on her again?
Because of the scholarship?

299
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,425
That writer is unbelievable.

300
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,764
If you're not creative,
at least be nice.

301
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,925
Forget it. I'm going
to stay out of this now.

302
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,764
I don't want to make it
harder for Ju Da.

303
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,659
I can't stand seeing
my close friend...

304
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,734
and the girl I like
having a hard time.

305
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,675
In the end, both of us...

306
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,999
Let me make a formal announcement.

307
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,215
Hey, isn't this Nam Ju speaking?

308
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,409
I guess he's going
to make a big announcement.

309
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:36,140
Does it have to do with
what happened with Ju Da earlier?

310
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,584
Hey, can't you tell?

311
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,380
He's making the announcement for me.

312
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,150
Nam Ju is going to publicly
apologize to me.

313
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,824
From now on,

314
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,125
Ju Da is the only woman for me.

315
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,489
- What?
- What did he just say?

316
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,489
No way!

317
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,790
- I told you so!
- Gosh, I have a headache.

318
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,959
Hey, are you all right?

319
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,064
- Let's film this.
- Hey, film her.

320
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,105
In the end, both of us
caved into the writer.

321
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:04,998
The story will happen as planned
no matter what.

322
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,385
- Goodness.
- Unbelievable.

323
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,484
- Hey, film Sae Mi.
- What happened?

324
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,259
You heard the announcement, right?

325
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,605
The stage between Nam Ju and Ju Da.

326
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,959
How could he say
the exact same line?

327
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,044
That's no fun.

328
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,175
The story is going as planned.

329
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,544
Let me make a formal announcement.

330
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,484
Let me make a formal announcement.

331
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,969
From now on...

332
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:45,509
From now on,
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

333
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:48,685
From now on,
Ju Da is the only woman for me.

334
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,050
But if you still want
to change the story,

335
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,225
I'll help you.

336
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,635
Only Haru can change it?

337
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:02,865
That's too bad.

338
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,675
He remembers nothing.

339
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,274
Tell me...

340
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,544
how we can change the story.

341
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,885
Haru is the only one
who can move freely on the stage.

342
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:18,915
You can't help me change my fate.

343
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,225
The story will happen however
the writer intended no matter what.

344
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,390
- Isn't this good?
- Should we do that?

345
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,605
I want to go all-in with this.

346
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,074
Aren't they Dan Oh and Baek Kyung?

347
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,699
My gosh, you have such good eyes.

348
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:44,074
I'm the class president
of Class Seven.

349
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,509
I can spot our classmates
even 1km away.

350
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,870
Good going.

351
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,209
A prestigious private school,
Seuli High School,

352
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,610
with the highest acceptance rate
into the Ivy League schools...

353
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,415
is becoming a place for dating.

354
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,179
But don't they make a nice couple?

355
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,594
- Focus on your studies.
- Focus on your studies.

356
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,524
Let's study hard.

357
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,024
Wait up for me.

358
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,665
Hurry up.

359
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,135
Okay.

360
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,145
("Trumpet Creeper")

361
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
My goodness, I'm sorry about that.

362
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,645
This is why people
shouldn't be greedy.

363
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,425
"Trumpet Creeper"?

364
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,695
What are you doing?

365
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,324
- You dropped it.
- Is that all?

366
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:37,024
Pardon?

367
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,234
Nothing.

368
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,784
Why are you sitting here
out of all seats?

369
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,024
Forget it. I'll leave.

370
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,955
No, stay in your seat. I'll go.

371
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,564
She's on my mind.

372
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:02,504
Am I tired?

373
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,244
Dan Oh, I'm thinking of adding
a few more medications.

374
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,885
I already have a lot.

375
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,880
No, I don't want to.
I'm not sick at all these days.

376
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,054
Dan Oh.

377
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,594
Why are you getting mad at me
all of a sudden?

378
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,865
He's just worried about you.

379
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,635
You'll take the medication, right?

380
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,635
I'll get going then.

381
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:17,304
I wonder...

382
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,145
how much time I have left.

383
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,584
(Hani Hospital)

384
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,965
Dad.

385
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,764
I'm sorry for throwing
a tantrum earlier.

386
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,764
No, I'm sorry...

387
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,975
for not being able
to do anything for you.

388
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,375
All right. I'll comply.

389
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,639
Dad, I'll take
all of my medications.

390
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,715
Can you make my wish come true
in return?

391
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:55,969
Tell me anything.

392
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,640
I'll do anything you ask of me.

393
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,484
Shall I go and get a star
from the sky for you?

394
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,155
It's nothing like that.

395
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,855
I want to...

396
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,225
get married.

397
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:12,135
No, I won't.

398
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,060
I won't get married.

399
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,034
I did not mean
what I just said at all. Not at all.

400
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,774
I'm going to live
a long life with you.

401
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,105
All right.

402
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,675
You and I should live
a long life together.

403
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:28,544
I know how you feel.

404
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:31,840
Because of my small heart,
you've been worried about me...

405
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,554
every single day
ever since I was young.

406
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,554
I love you, Dad.

407
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,550
If I get to have another life,

408
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,125
I'm going to be your daughter
in my next life again.

409
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,234
I'll be your dad
in my next life too.

410
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,630
Dan Oh, you're not ready yet?

411
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,069
I'm coming.

412
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,110
Make sure you look pretty.

413
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,185
What?

414
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,445
Why?

415
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,514
I said, I'm coming.

416
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,024
Why are you so surprised?

417
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,625
I can come by if I want to.

418
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,195
Wait...

419
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,159
This isn't even a stage.

420
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,534
(Baek Kyung)

421
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,975
You didn't throw it away.

422
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,234
Give it to me.

423
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,300
Stop laughing.

424
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,744
It was embarrassing to carry it
around all day on Sports Day.

425
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,715
Hurry up.
Let's go to school together.

426
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,879
Right, wait.
I have to take my medicine.

427
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,754
I promised my dad
that I won't forget to take them.

428
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,695
"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?

429
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,324
Do you still remember that?

430
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:55,935
You're still the same...

431
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,034
if that spell still works for you.

432
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,175
Is it that tough
to take your medicine?

433
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,885
Hey, try taking them
every single day. Gosh.

434
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,880
You gave a tough time
to doctors and nurses...

435
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,155
because you never wanted to
take your medicine as a kid.

436
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,880
You remember that?

437
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,425
I'm the one who cast that spell
when you took the medicine.

438
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,725
"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo".

439
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:26,159
When the fairy gave the carriage
and dress to Cinderella,

440
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,004
you said you just wanted
a healthy heart above all things.

441
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,534
My gosh.

442
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:33,800
You were really scary.

443
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,205
I can't believe you remember that.

444
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:38,344
You said you might become healthy...

445
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,140
if I cast that spell.

446
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,744
It's all just set up anyway.
A set-up.

447
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:51,754
I remember everything.

448
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,524
I remember you within the story...

449
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,234
and out of it.

450
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,774
I'm relieved to hear that.

451
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,844
You're the only one who remembers...

452
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,685
what I'm like outside of the story.

453
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,715
And...

454
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,215
Haru?

455
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,955
Thank you.

456
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:29,494
It would've been really painful
if it hadn't been for you.

457
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,734
I'm going to try
to accept this world as it is.

458
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,234
I'll try to forget Haru...

459
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:44,145
and how I tried to change the story.

460
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,014
I'll forget about
how rude you were in the past.

461
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,054
We might be late. Let's go.

462
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,400
Hey, Haru!
Don't turn your back on...

463
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,945
That hurts! Let me go.

464
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,814
We were really close.
You're making me sad.

465
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,685
We were close?

466
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,949
Same face, different guy.

467
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,824
Forget it. I give up too.

468
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,865
I'll pick you up tomorrow too.

469
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,435
No.

470
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,475
You have to practice with me
tomorrow morning.

471
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,145
You can practice with another guy.

472
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,830
You can obtain the answer by
a method that Gauss came up with...

473
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,804
when he was in third grade.

474
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,040
He found out
if you add all the numbers...

475
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,215
between 1 to 100, it's always 101.

476
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:33,915
Don't you think Gauss is a genius?

477
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,054
- You're right.
- Yes, you're right.

478
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,094
Let's take a look.

479
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,534
All right, come and take one.

480
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,635
Yes, take a look around.

481
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,435
You can take a look around.

482
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,344
I haven't seen you in a while.
Take a look around.

483
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,889
What's this flower?

484
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,590
It's a flower
called trumpet creeper.

485
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,605
It may be expensive,
but women love that sparkly thing.

486
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,999
That flower means,
"Even if the world falls apart..."

487
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:31,269
"and the earth splits up,
I will only wait for you."

488
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,614
I'll take this.

489
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,565
- Did you fall asleep?
- What?

490
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,065
Get up. Let's go practice.

491
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,565
Okay.

492
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,714
What's this?

493
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,114
Dan Oh gave it to me.

494
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:09,884
Dan Oh?

495
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,755
What's this flower called?

496
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,625
No, forget it.

497
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,134
Why do you want to know?

498
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:30,665
Why do you want to know
what it's called?

499
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,074
It looked like the one
I saw in my dream.

500
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,275
In your dream?

501
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,415
It's nothing. Let's go.

502
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,376
(Episode 16 will air shortly.)

503
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,884
(Episode 16)

504
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:14,724
Ju Da.

505
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,095
Why aren't you going
to the music room?

506
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:21,164
Nam Ju.

507
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,565
There's something
I want to do with you.

508
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:25,560
- Something you want to do?
- Whoever wins a game of...

509
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,429
- rock-paper-scissors gets a wish.
- A wish?

510
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:28,835
Rock-paper-scissors.

511
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:30,774
I won.

512
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,574
Tell me. What's your wish?

513
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:37,715
I want you to be...

514
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:40,314
more like yourself.

515
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:44,484
And because you're the coolest
when you are yourself,

516
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,924
A3 shines the brightest
when it's A3.

517
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,564
There's no meaning anymore
if one of you is gone.

518
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,034
I hope...

519
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:58,804
you can be good friends
with Do Hwa again.

520
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,204
What if I won just now?

521
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,174
I bet you'd still do me a favor.

522
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,844
I know what your wish
would have been.

523
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,545
"Granting Ju Da's wish".

524
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,094
Darn it.

525
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,495
Hey, don't blame the game
for your lack of skills.

526
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,605
Do Hwa.

527
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,940
Am I not allowed to come here
on top of the rooftop?

528
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,084
Fine, I'm leaving.

529
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,754
Here I go again.

530
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,988
Your absence is quite big.

531
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:00,019
Someone said that...

532
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,420
A3 shines the brightest
when it's the 3 of us.

533
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,590
- Who said that?
- My woman did.

534
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,465
"My woman"?
I just can't get used to that.

535
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,899
- I got it for now.
- "For now"?

536
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:13,429
Both Ju Da and A3 are dear to me.

537
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:15,368
Let's compete in good faith.

538
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,245
You're no match for me
once I play the violin.

539
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,055
You're right. A3 shouldn't disband
that easily.

540
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,125
A3 shines the brightest
when it's the 3 of us.

541
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,194
He's repeating the same thing.

542
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,224
Gosh, that wasn't necessary.

543
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,489
- I can feel your sincerity.
- What?

544
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:39,028
At times, since you always repeat
what you say,

545
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:41,130
you sound like a broken stereo.

546
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,429
But I can feel your sincerity
this time.

547
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:44,300
Are you that touched...

548
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,969
that I let you back into A3?

549
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:47,339
I had forgotten.

550
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,070
You're a very precious friend
of mine,

551
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,414
whether you're self-conscious
or not.

552
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:54,185
Baek Kyung, you too.

553
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,808
We share many childhood memories.

554
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:01,354
I get it, but don't get all touchy.

555
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,694
Take care of Ju Da.
She's a nice girl.

556
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,119
My feelings for her won't subside
in a day.

557
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,134
But I truly hope that
you two will be happy.

558
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,814
Why did you call me?

559
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,145
Take this.

560
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,125
What is this?

561
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:33,754
Just this and that.

562
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,064
I thought you'd like it.

563
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,619
And this.

564
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,935
What? Aren't these...

565
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,275
I was reminded of them
while talking with you this morning.

566
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,675
I gave you that every time
you took your pills.

567
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,604
It's been a long time.

568
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,074
You said eating them
made you happy.

569
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,745
You're right. I did.

570
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,314
And...

571
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,715
There's one more.

572
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:03,314
"One more"?

573
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,085
There he comes.

574
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,869
- Thanks.
- Why is he here?

575
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:29,814
I told him to buy me some flowers.

576
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,615
It seems like...

577
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:34,415
we're close.

578
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,384
Thanks.

579
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,795
Do you have something to say?

580
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:46,520
No.

581
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,564
Then why do you look like you do?

582
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,365
Leave.

583
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,334
Don't bother.
He won't remember this anyway.

584
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,175
So this must've been
how you and Haru felt...

585
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:03,045
towards me.

586
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:06,285
The two of you were aware
of yourselves...

587
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,514
while I wasn't.

588
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,595
He's not Haru.

589
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:32,245
Right.

590
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:34,814
Not anymore.

591
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,214
Go.

592
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,884
Dan Oh.

593
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:44,584
Haru?

594
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,185
This one's good.

595
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,154
This is the stage.

596
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,118
Baek Kyung has many rackets.

597
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,365
(List of Baek Kyung's Gift)

598
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,095
He only uses this model.

599
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,834
It seems like we're close.

600
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,928
So this is how he's used on stage
since he doesn't remember anything.

601
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,329
I think this one's good.

602
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:09,074
The writer is so cruel.

603
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,615
Both to me and Haru.

604
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,309
They all look the same to me.

605
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:15,415
(Easy Grip Tennis Racket)

606
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,110
It'll feel different
if you give it to him.

607
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,185
Really?

608
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,225
(Easy Grip Tennis Racket)

609
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,619
Excuse me.
Please wrap this up nicely.

610
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,795
Okay.

611
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,665
I'm sure Nam Ju would've refused.

612
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,834
And I couldn't trust Do Hwa's taste.

613
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:37,404
Thanks, Haru. I'm glad
I asked for your help.

614
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:48,714
You must really like Baek Kyung.

615
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:50,954
I have to.

616
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,985
Why?

617
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,894
It's my set-up.

618
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,519
I must do it
whether I like it or not.

619
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,925
If you don't want to like him,

620
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,165
then you can stop, can't you?

621
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,964
If you don't like
what's already determined,

622
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,074
then you can change it.

623
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,175
I won't ever do that again.

624
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,514
I don't want to lose him again.

625
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:17,214
Lose whom?

626
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,454
Haru.

627
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:25,050
"Haru"? Me?

628
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,824
Yes. You.

629
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,225
But...

630
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,795
It's not you.

631
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,264
You're not Haru.

632
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:42,375
That is my name.

633
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,745
Since when? Tell me.

634
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:50,975
See?

635
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:55,185
Why do you keep saying
that I'm not Haru?

636
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,084
Why do you keep saying
that I can't remember?

637
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,074
If you don't want to like him,

638
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,045
then you can stop, can't you?

639
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,285
If you don't like
what's already determined,

640
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:27,115
then you can change it.

641
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:38,965
Thanks to you,

642
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:42,218
I think my day can change.

643
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:45,804
Can I call you Haru?

644
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,514
He has no idea what happened to him
because of me.

645
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,575
(Oh Nam Ju)

646
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,615
Nam Ju?

647
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,514
Hey, where are you?

648
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:35,410
I'm doing something.

649
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,684
I wanted to see
my girlfriend's face.

650
00:45:37,979 --> 00:45:40,179
Your girlfriend? Who is that?

651
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:41,679
It's you.

652
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,894
You never asked me out.

653
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,790
What more do you need...

654
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,995
when I have announced it
to the entire school?

655
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:53,630
Then let's do that thing
that you like.

656
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,774
The winner makes a wish.

657
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:58,429
First, let me hear it.

658
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:01,315
Don't be so harsh. You already know
what my wish is.

659
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,000
So what's your wish?

660
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,375
It's of course...

661
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,115
I'll tell you once I'm ready.

662
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,679
Once you're ready?

663
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:12,985
My wish needs to be prepared.

664
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:28,075
(Certificate of Scholarship)

665
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,245
Don't forget that...

666
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,485
Serinne Foundation is also paying...

667
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,754
for your grandmother's hospital fee.

668
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,804
This is hard.

669
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,429
(Friends)

670
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:11,445
(Lee Do Hwa)

671
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:13,544
"Yeo Ju Da,"

672
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,439
"goodbye now."

673
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:17,815
(Yeo Ju Da, goodbye now.)

674
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:27,020
Do you want to play
Rice Barley Game?

675
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,095
Let's go.

676
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,335
- Barley.
- Barley.

677
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,459
- Barley.
- Barley.

678
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:32,534
- Rice.
- Barley... Darn it.

679
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,999
- What was that?
- Let me go next.

680
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,359
Hello, Do Hwa.

681
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:37,559
- Rice.
- Rice. Hey.

682
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,845
- Give me your hand.
- Come on.

683
00:47:39,569 --> 00:47:41,174
- Don't hit me hard.
- Okay.

684
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:43,345
- Stop it. It didn't hurt that bad.
- It didn't hurt that bad.

685
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:47,284
Do Hwa.

686
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:49,640
What? I'm really sad right now.

687
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,855
Where's the comic book?

688
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,280
I'm going to stop reading it.

689
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,280
If I do,
it will only break my heart.

690
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,695
I need to read it.

691
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:57,519
Why?

692
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,825
So you don't have it, do you?

693
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:47,575
("Trumpet Creeper")

694
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,569
(I prepared them.
I heard that you like flowers.)

695
00:48:53,569 --> 00:48:57,254
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

696
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,355
Dan Oh?

697
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,250
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

698
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,020
How is this nothing?
She looks just like Dan Oh.

699
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,294
How much of it did you read?

700
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,065
You didn't finish reading it.

701
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:33,309
- Look at the couple of our school.
- Give it back.

702
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:35,079
- Find bad photos of Baek Kyung.
- Show me other photos.

703
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,479
He picks a fight with me
whenever he sees me.

704
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:38,020
Give it back now!

705
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,020
"Give it back."

706
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,625
- "Give it back."
- "Give it back."

707
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,735
Where is that?

708
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,764
- You'd better give it back.
- I'd better give it back?

709
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:45,890
You are indeed Baek Kyung's fiancee.

710
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,835
Look how rude you are.

711
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,500
- I don't want to.
- No.

712
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,370
- Give it back now.
- No, no.

713
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,575
- No.
- No.

714
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:57,144
- That's enough.
- Who are you to butt in?

715
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,044
Are you a villain?

716
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,284
You're looking out for her
because Baek Kyung is your friend?

717
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,125
- How annoying.
- My gosh, hey. Let's just go.

718
00:50:08,479 --> 00:50:09,554
We're leaving?

719
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,794
We're leaving?

720
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:16,264
Dan Oh.

721
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,205
I told you to stop.

722
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,304
Stop pretending to be
the old Haru when you're not.

723
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,174
Hey.

724
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,644
Dan Oh!

725
00:50:33,939 --> 00:50:35,115
Dan Oh!

726
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:40,625
My name is Haru.

727
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,050
- I know.
- But why do you keep saying...

728
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,349
that I'm not Haru?

729
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:45,849
Why do you keep popping up
in front of me?

730
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,164
Why do you keep making me
worry about you?

731
00:50:48,689 --> 00:50:50,095
Who on earth are you?

732
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,195
See?

733
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,764
You're not Haru.

734
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,004
- What?
- You remember everything.

735
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:02,599
You remember that I said
you are not Haru...

736
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,884
and what happened in the shadow.

737
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,715
You're aware of yourself again.

738
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,284
What?

739
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,825
Except for your memories with me.

740
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,284
You asked me who I was.

741
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,050
I am a nobody.

742
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,664
I'm an extra
who's waiting for the day I die.

743
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,125
Actually, this turned out well.

744
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:24,034
Don't remember me.

745
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,034
I'm not going to change anything
from now on.

746
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,825
By the way,
Baek Kyung still hasn't called you yet?

747
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:49,020
- This punk.
- He's almost here.

748
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,524
He'll be here soon.

749
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:58,705
You're late.

750
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,660
Well, I was going
to be summoned anyway.

751
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,404
It was a hassle to come here
on my own.

752
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,829
You're late. You ought to apologize.

753
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,370
Don't make a joke
as soon as you join us.

754
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,445
Joke?

755
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,815
I'm sure Dan Oh understands
it's not a joke.

756
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:13,985
Sit down.

757
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:16,910
I'm sorry.

758
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,355
You won't even remember it
even if I apologize.

759
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,750
Have you gone mad?

760
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,695
Darn it. I'm so sick of this.

761
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,625
Is that all you want to say
in the shadow?

762
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:32,630
I heard that you ran into
Chairman Oh of Serinne Fashion.

763
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,335
Yes, I ran into him a while ago.

764
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,134
I prepared this for Dan Oh.

765
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,985
I love you
the most in this world, Baek Kyung.

766
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,270
I'm right here, Dan Oh.

767
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,479
Right. Your father
might be disappointed.

768
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:50,809
That's not possible.

769
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:52,650
You always say this to me.

770
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,855
"Your happiness is my happiness."

771
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,625
And this is my happiness?

772
00:52:58,189 --> 00:52:59,819
I can't ever win, can I?

773
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,620
I must address you
as my in-law pretty soon.

774
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,735
Thanks to you,

775
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,235
I have a good, reliable son.

776
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,704
Thank you so much.
I didn't prepare a present for you.

777
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,375
You gave it to me a long time ago.

778
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:17,144
I thought you threw it out.

779
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,115
You still had this?

780
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,255
Of course.

781
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,924
My 10-year crush is finally over.

782
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,179
It is true that little strokes
fell great oaks, right?

783
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,625
As if having a small heart
isn't enough,

784
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:36,335
I'll end up marrying a man
I don't even love.

785
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:41,089
It looks like you're about
to walk down the aisle.

786
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:43,505
I can even marry him tomorrow.

787
00:54:11,419 --> 00:54:14,434
(Eun Dan Oh)

788
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,875
(Eun Dan Oh)

789
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,015
(Haru)

790
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,855
"Haru".

791
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:39,394
(Haru)

792
00:54:50,629 --> 00:54:51,704
("Trumpet Creeper")

793
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:00,884
Dan Oh?

794
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,684
("Trumpet Creeper")

795
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,825
"Trumpet Creeper"?

796
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,894
("Trumpet Creeper")

797
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,505
I should have burnt it
a long time ago.

798
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:49,025
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

799
00:56:49,149 --> 00:56:51,325
I can even marry him tomorrow.

800
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,404
What's with your face?

801
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,234
You look completely different
from the stage.

802
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:06,875
I'm just tired.

803
00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:09,845
Do you know trumpet creeper?

804
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,785
Trumpet creeper?

805
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:14,069
This flower is called
trumpet creeper.

806
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:15,315
Oh, that?

807
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,654
You already know that
the writer chose that, not me.

808
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:21,855
Then...

809
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,720
what about how you said
you can marry me tomorrow?

810
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,994
That wasn't something...

811
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,194
I wanted to say either.

812
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,904
I hate this.

813
00:57:38,669 --> 00:57:40,045
Why do you hate it?

814
00:57:42,569 --> 00:57:43,815
You like me.

815
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:45,984
Like I said,

816
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:49,355
I was just set up to like you.

817
00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:54,355
So you don't have to put on an act
in the shadow.

818
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:58,964
Where will I be on the next stage?

819
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:02,595
At a hospital? Or at a wedding hall?

820
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:07,805
I don't care what it is,
but the real Dan Oh isn't there.

821
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,545
You never showed your real self...

822
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:15,815
in every single moment
you were with me?

823
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:18,545
Then...

824
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:21,644
what about when you were a kid
in that hospital?

825
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,654
Are my memories of you...

826
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:29,724
real or fake?

827
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,664
I have no idea.

828
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:37,434
But I do know this for sure.

829
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,530
Everything that Dan Oh does
on stage from now on is...

830
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,674
all just what the writer wants.
Nothing more, nothing less.

831
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:35,055
If all these people are fake,

832
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,894
where are they all headed?

833
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:43,359
They all have their stories...

834
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,234
and the things that are
precious to them,

835
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,204
but they have no choice
but to do whatever the writer wants.

836
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,954
If I remained as Eun Dan Oh,
just an oblivious extra...

837
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,025
inside a romance comic...

838
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,134
Then I would've been
just a nameless Number 13.

839
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,565
This time, I'll change your story.

840
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,555
Dan Oh.

841
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,734
I'm sorry.

842
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,865
I came a bit too late.

843
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:42,444
Dan Oh.

844
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,875
Look at me.

845
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,025
I'm right here.

846
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:11,805
I won't go anywhere.

847
01:03:55,809 --> 01:04:00,875
(Extra-ordinary You)
