1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,385
This time, I won't...

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,284
let him go.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,754
Hey.

4
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,434
Hi.

5
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,784
It was so hard for me to find him.

6
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,684
Why did it have to be now?

7
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,424
(Episode 5)

8
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,665
Hey, that's Dan Oh.

9
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,064
Are you ill again?

10
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,635
I guess so.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,870
"I guess so"?

12
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,404
It's as if you're
talking about someone else.

13
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,939
I have no power.

14
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,799
I can only do
what the writer tells me to do.

15
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,939
Wait, am I listening to Korean
right now?

16
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,014
Maybe.

17
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,855
Was that English? Hey.

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,260
Should I call Baek Kyung?

19
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
I had to go to the hospital
from school...

20
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,904
in that important moment
just to talk about Baek Kyung?

21
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,505
He probably won't come.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,169
Of course, he won't.

23
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,475
That jerk.

24
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,044
Are you all right?

25
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,514
Yes, I'm all right.

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,609
Gosh, the wind. Get it away.

27
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,954
I don't care if he comes or not.

28
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,264
I can't think of more lines.

29
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,364
Lines?

30
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,264
I guess that's all we had to do.

31
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,565
Bye.

32
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,799
Hey, you've been really odd lately.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,930
She speaks like
she's someone else recently.

34
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,400
What's all this talk
about a writer and lines?

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
She needs to make some sense.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,744
Dan Oh, I think
you're in the wrong character.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,210
Baek Kyung likes someone
who's naive and pure,

38
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,984
not a girl who's eccentric.

39
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,385
Bye.

40
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,780
You took this way too far.

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,255
And you put your back
next to all the guys you meet too.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,319
That's not cute at all.

43
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,419
Even if you learned to date
through books,

44
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,565
that's a bit too much.

45
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,964
What?

46
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:12,464
It's a bit too much.

47
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,860
What?

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,189
What is it?

49
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,159
What? What now? It's too much.

50
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,704
What did you just say?

51
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:20,800
Your back touch.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,969
It's not that great.

53
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,514
Of course, you might start to like
someone who has a great back...

54
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,984
like me.

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,554
Goodness.

56
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,550
But do you remember me
bumping my back to you?

57
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,580
You said you'll find the guy...

58
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,794
who'll change your life
with his back.

59
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,695
Dan Oh, you're kind of dirty.

60
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,560
Why? What are you doing?

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,729
Shut up and follow me.

62
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:48,505
Who knows
when the scene will change?

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,774
Hey. Hold on.
What's wrong with you?

64
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,439
Why... Why are you so strong?

65
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,599
Are you really sick?

66
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,610
You lied because you didn't want
to go to school, right?

67
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,685
Do Hwa.

68
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,584
What... What is it?

69
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,280
My heart belongs to someone else.

70
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,625
You know who she is.

71
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,424
How should I explain this?

72
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,959
Are you insane?

73
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,404
You're suffering from memory loss
these days, right?

74
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,899
One blink of an eye,
and a day or a week has gone by.

75
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,670
You teleport to school and home.

76
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,199
Time and place are a mess.

77
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,014
How... How did you know?

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,055
It's because you've become aware
of yourself.

79
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,414
Aware of myself?

80
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,325
Hey, everyone is aware
of themselves.

81
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,995
We're characters from a comic book.

82
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,594
Maybe you're sick up here
and not your heart.

83
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,290
Watch. Once the story resumes,

84
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,635
everything will fall back
into place.

85
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,875
Bye.

86
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,939
The story will start soon.

87
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,945
Everything will fall back
into place.

88
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,014
My gosh. Hey, Dan Oh!

89
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:20,425
Hey, Do Hwa.

90
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,334
- Bye.
- Am I your deliveryman?

91
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,290
Buy your own clothes.

92
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,259
You've grown into a nagger,
haven't you?

93
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,329
I thought you only grew in height.

94
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,175
Mom is worried. She wants to know
when you'll come home.

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,274
Here. By the way, is Dan Oh...

96
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,600
How is this bag here?

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,040
Watch. Once the story resumes,

98
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
everything will fall back
into place.

99
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,914
Oh, right.

100
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:47,925
I have a question.

101
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,825
How's Dan Oh at school these days?

102
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,224
I thought she was improving,
but her condition isn't that great.

103
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,865
Her heart is having problems again.

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,034
She needs to go through
several checkups.

105
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,904
I'm worried about her.

106
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,334
Can you keep an eye on her?

107
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,675
Could you do that for me?

108
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,115
"Hi, do you remember me?"

109
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,685
No, there's a high chance
that he won't.

110
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,310
"Hi."

111
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,354
"Hi. Hello."

112
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:25,720
What if I run into him? Hold on.

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,350
I'm not a main character.

114
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,264
I'm just an extra,
so it won't matter.

115
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,464
Hey, you.

116
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,704
Were you my classmate?

117
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,104
Do you remember me?

118
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,089
You helped me when I fell
down the stairs...

119
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,594
and blocked the ball
when we were playing dodgeball.

120
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,575
You don't remember me, do you?

121
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,505
What? You don't even have a name.

122
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,614
Dan Oh.

123
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,015
I heard you were hospitalized.

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,955
Yes.

125
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,025
I'm over here.

126
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,849
Right. Yes.

127
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,825
You're so out of it. No wonder
you fell down the stairs.

128
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,320
You can't act recklessly
when you've just been discharged.

129
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,904
I'm sure you played a part
in making your heart ill.

130
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,835
Thanks for being worried about me.

131
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,170
- What is it?
- I know you like me,

132
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,430
but I'm surprised that you
interpreted...

133
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,700
what I just said like that.

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,969
I know you're not worried about me,
you punk.

135
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,409
It's just a darn line of mine.

136
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,044
I wasn't worried.

137
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,380
Our families
will be having dinner soon.

138
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,724
I don't want your heart condition
to ruin the dinner.

139
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,385
Take care of your health.

140
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,554
I will.

141
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,664
- Baek Kyung, wait up!
- Me too!

142
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,094
Where are you going?

143
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,964
What do I lack so much that
I have to continue liking him? Gosh.

144
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,275
He's not here.

145
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,085
(Seuli High School Student Photos)

146
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,625
What? There he is.

147
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,695
Is everything just a coincidence
like what Dried Squid said?

148
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,190
At this rate, I should be
helping him,

149
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,664
not receiving any help myself.

150
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,775
- Let's go!
- Nam Ju!

151
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:44,969
Nam Ju!

152
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,079
- Let's go!
- Oh Nam Ju!

153
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,485
Oh Nam Ju! Oh Nam Ju!

154
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,355
Baek Kyung!

155
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,690
Nam Ju, you're so amazing!

156
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,625
- Let's go!
- Baek Kyung!

157
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,824
Perfect!

158
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,334
Here!

159
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:06,975
- Yes!
- Oh, yes!

160
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,875
Go, Nam Ju!

161
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,400
Nam Ju!

162
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,070
My gosh! Did you see that?

163
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,475
- Did you?
- Yes.

164
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:18,814
Darn it.

165
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,640
Nam Ju!

166
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,550
Milky-white-skinned, Oh Nam Ju!

167
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,595
I love you, Oh Nam Ju!

168
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,259
Did you see Nam Ju put that ball in?

169
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:35,334
Yes.

170
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,235
How amazing.

171
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,400
I hate that only the main character
receives the spotlight.

172
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,729
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

173
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,469
He is the star, so it's natural
that he receives the spotlight.

174
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,700
Nam Ju looked so dazzling just now.

175
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Right.

176
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,070
Let's go!

177
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,969
- Sae Mi.
- What?

178
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,314
Do you see him?

179
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,680
Oh, my. Who is he?

180
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,084
Do you not know number 13?

181
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,454
I didn't know such a tall
and handsome guy was in our class.

182
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,125
Do you know his name?

183
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,765
Him? I know. He's...

184
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,865
What was his name again?

185
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,375
You probably don't know
since he's just an extra.

186
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,904
He's even more trivial than I am.

187
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,349
Let's go!

188
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,794
Nam Ju, let's go!

189
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,194
Nam Ju!

190
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,735
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

191
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,654
I need to hurry and look for Dan Oh.

192
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,784
But why do I want to play
the violin so badly?

193
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,095
What? What's wrong with me?

194
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,875
Do Hwa.

195
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,204
Is something wrong?

196
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,109
This might be out of line,

197
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,584
but if you're struggling
with anything,

198
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:32,944
you can always tell me.

199
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,084
I know I don't look like it,

200
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,454
but I'm a great listener.

201
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,095
What?

202
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,965
This is odd. This is very odd.

203
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,794
This is extremely odd.

204
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,834
Wait. I can finally speak again.

205
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,105
Hey, are you okay?

206
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,574
- There are flowers behind you.
- Flowers?

207
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,975
No, that's not important right now.

208
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,314
Ju Da, have you seen Dan Oh?

209
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,515
You seem pretty relaxed these days.

210
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,684
Did you find the guy?

211
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,180
I did, but he is a very trivial one.

212
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,954
The writer didn't even
draw him properly.

213
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,520
Look at this. He doesn't have
any facial features.

214
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,664
Oh, dear.

215
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,704
Could an even more trivial extra
be able to change your fate?

216
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,900
I told you that it was
just a pipe dream.

217
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,904
The storyboard didn't change.

218
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,129
Just give up and accept...

219
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,715
this world and your position.

220
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,645
Giving up is not an option.

221
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,310
I'll consider this taking a break.

222
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,540
My heart needs to rest as well.

223
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,715
I found you.

224
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,879
This sounds familiar.

225
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,054
Dan Oh!

226
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,595
Since when was it so difficult
to find our cafeteria?

227
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,749
Every time I got near,
it teleported to another place.

228
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:53,834
And when I located it again,
it disappeared.

229
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,959
This is much quicker...

230
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,265
than I expected.

231
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,404
And two characters, at that?

232
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,635
Is he also aware of himself?

233
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,969
Yes, I knew something was off.

234
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,200
I should've gone to the hospital
for my memory loss.

235
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,985
But I was on the rooftop,
playing the violin.

236
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,140
One moment, I'm doing fine
and chatting with my friends.

237
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,310
Then suddenly, I'm playing
the violin while crying.

238
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,684
Poor you.

239
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,810
Your character is old-style as well.

240
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,619
You seem like a cheerful person
in front of others,

241
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,619
but you are hurting deep inside.

242
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,595
How is it possible that
this is the world of comics?

243
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,765
- Everyone reacts that way at first.
- Everyone reacts that way at first.

244
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,329
Explain this to me.

245
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:34,635
Tell me in a way
that I may understand this.

246
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,375
What is that?

247
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,070
Don't be so startled.

248
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,054
This is the world of comics.

249
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,654
Fine, let's say that it is.

250
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,225
But my character is
totally lame then.

251
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,164
I'm not a crybaby. No main
character would cry like that.

252
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,735
Everyone has
the same misunderstanding.

253
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,434
There's no doubt that they think of
themselves as the main character.

254
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,174
Wait, are you and I supposed
to get together?

255
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,145
No. I thought you liked Baek Kyung.

256
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,739
They cannot think for a second
that their life might exist...

257
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,174
for other people.

258
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,784
It was all a ruse.
You were faking it.

259
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,814
It's me whom you like.

260
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,849
Is that why you wanted
to see my back that day?

261
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:25,954
("Secret")

262
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,650
- Read this.
- What is it?

263
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,365
Reading that once is much better
than hearing about this 10 times.

264
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,404
It's Ju Da.

265
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,074
Ju Da...

266
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,944
Wait. No, hold on.

267
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,715
No, no.

268
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,855
We're not the main characters.

269
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,564
Nam Ju and Ju Da
are the main characters.

270
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,534
I knew it. Their names were unusual.

271
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,334
"Oh Nam Ju" and "Yeo Ju Da".
How did I miss that?

272
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:16,859
Right. I found it the weirdest
that Ju Da was...

273
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:18,670
in every moment of my life.

274
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,739
Before I realized it,
I started to like her.

275
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:23,444
How should I put it? It's the fate
of a supporting character.

276
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:26,845
I'm dreaming, right?
This has to be a dream.

277
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,855
Darn it.

278
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,025
What's that?

279
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,194
It will depend on
whose perspective you see this.

280
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,664
Do Hwa, look at the world
from your perspective,

281
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,235
then you'll be the main character.

282
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,074
I will change my predetermined fate
no matter what.

283
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,215
I don't want to stay
as an extra until the end.

284
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,595
Dan Oh.

285
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,194
How's your heart pain lately?

286
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,759
What's wrong with me?

287
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,859
What's wrong? Are you all right?

288
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:19,904
Nurse Kim, please escort Dan Oh out.

289
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,834
Dan Oh, it's all right.
Go to the treatment room.

290
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,074
Okay.

291
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,145
Sir, please sit down.

292
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,184
Actually, the numbers from
her last test don't look too good.

293
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,079
We're monitoring
what's called, BMP numbers.

294
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,965
When her heart is overworking,
the numbers go up.

295
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:49,465
It means that there's
a lot of damage to her heart.

296
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,534
I think you need
to prepare yourself.

297
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,525
Dan Oh takes after you a lot.

298
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,634
Her looks and personality too.

299
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,165
You two like
and hate the same things.

300
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,765
Remember how long
you chased me because you liked me?

301
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,034
Goodness.

302
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,945
I have never seen a woman
proposing to a guy with flowers.

303
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,614
Dan Oh takes after
that part of you too.

304
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:39,715
She's been chasing after Baek Kyung too.

305
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,755
Honey.

306
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,195
What am I going to do about Dan Oh?
My heart breaks for her.

307
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,175
Can you help her live, honey?

308
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,185
Dan Oh doesn't have much time left.

309
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,655
There's not much the doctor
at the hospital can do for her.

310
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,304
Fine. That's been my set-up.

311
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,215
I've had a weak heart
and been in pain the whole time.

312
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,744
I'm okay. I'll be okay.

313
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,024
Nothing changes in this world.

314
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,054
Never.

315
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,764
If I change the stage,

316
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,935
everything will change too.
It's okay. I can do it.

317
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,965
I can do it.

318
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,044
Even if I wanted to change it,
I can't ever meet him.

319
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,185
What good is it
if I know how he looks?

320
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,479
I can't believe
no one crossed paths with him.

321
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,479
Where will we have our camp
this year?

322
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,155
Two years ago, we went to Egypt.
And last year, Switzerland.

323
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,949
I want it to be Manhattan, New York.

324
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,259
How should I put it?
That city suits...

325
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,560
It perfectly suits
the honorable side of me.

326
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,630
Why are you laughing?
Women go crazy for that.

327
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,800
I think you're way too chatty.
That's your problem.

328
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,100
Get your hands off me.

329
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
- That's your problem.
- Hey.

330
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,645
- That's Number 13.
- Several women like me, you know.

331
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,445
There are several, yes.

332
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,945
Right? So you're falling
for my charms too.

333
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,640
You probably don't have several
women. You have none!

334
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,814
You have zero women. Clear.

335
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,225
Is that a new technique?

336
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,925
Not being aware of yourself
could make us happier.

337
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,804
Why is she working so hard at it?

338
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,274
What?

339
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,824
I didn't know
she could look like that.

340
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:18,695
Why is he going all gooey
after her right next to me now?

341
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,195
She's cute.

342
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:23,594
Are you serious with that line?
I hate it.

343
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,564
Wait, I can move.

344
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,729
Come on, I can't see anything.

345
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,605
Go away.

346
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,645
What are you doing?

347
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,769
You're the other guy
in the love triangle,

348
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,540
but you look completely free.

349
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,915
Because I'm the other guy.

350
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,715
My role is to follow
after the main character.

351
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:48,254
You adjusted pretty fast.

352
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,484
Is that so?

353
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,719
- That's him, right?
- What?

354
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,925
The back you're looking for.

355
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,165
What's his name?

356
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,189
- He doesn't have one.
- What?

357
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:05,060
He's not on the character list.
And he's not drawn in full either.

358
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,905
I can't even look for him
in the comic book.

359
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,975
Look how handsome he is. It makes
no sense that he's an extra.

360
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,385
She's driving me crazy. Why...

361
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,645
Why is she so cute?

362
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,284
She's so cute.

363
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,084
- Don't mind him.
- I feel nauseous.

364
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,890
Hey, what is it? Why are we hiding?

365
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,550
You're right. It's not like
I did anything wrong.

366
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,689
Gosh, you go crazy
when it comes to handsome men.

367
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:32,759
That's not true.

368
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,264
It was because I was hoping that
he might be able to change my fate.

369
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,800
You said he was an extra
without a name.

370
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,145
He can change your fate?

371
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:51,615
Hey, Ju Da. Let me help you.

372
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,880
Pick it up.

373
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,754
No, you pick it up yourself.

374
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,269
Right. This is weird!

375
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,070
Why do I see Number 13
on the storyboard?

376
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,715
He's a nameless extra.

377
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,554
I must check one more time...

378
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,425
if Number 13 holds the key
in changing my fate or not.

379
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,984
I knew it.

380
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,425
There's no way the writer
would give me the answer key.

381
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,465
However, I'm good at games
even without the answer keys.

382
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,365
Follow me.

383
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:22,744
Number 13.

384
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:26,499
You might not remember this later,
but listen up.

385
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:27,669
I have a heart that might stop
at any time...

386
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:29,169
and had my crush for 10 years.

387
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,014
Don't you get sick of me already
just by listening to this?

388
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,584
But that's my set-up.

389
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,324
But I think I might be able
to change my fate if you help me.

390
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,519
Later, Ju Da and I will be moving
these boxes to the science lab.

391
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,135
The story is that I will knock
over the boxes because of Nam Ju.

392
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,229
Am I their love bridge or something?

393
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,034
Everything I do is
used for the main characters.

394
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,905
I don't want to do that anymore.

395
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,870
So stay between the crowd
and wait for the right moment.

396
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,040
Then hold onto the boxes
so that they don't fall over.

397
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,169
If I keep changing the story,

398
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,254
I'll be able to make a future
that I want to live.

399
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,409
If this plan succeeds,

400
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,580
I'll take responsibility
and make you more than an extra.

401
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,955
Do you get it? Okay?

402
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,695
Why would you never answer me?

403
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:18,489
"Okay, I'll help you."

404
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,834
"Let's change our fate together."

405
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,605
Can't you say that to me? Please?

406
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,274
I have no idea what's on your mind.

407
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:31,400
I mean, open your mouth like this
and say, "Yes, okay."

408
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,715
Is that so difficult?

409
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,314
Like this. Open your lips.

410
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:50,834
Hey.

411
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:54,834
Dan Oh, focus. This is important.
It's an important moment.

412
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,905
- When is Do Hwa coming?
- Baek Kyung is here.

413
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,574
He's here.

414
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,810
Ju Da. Let me help you.

415
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,294
I can manage.

416
00:25:20,949 --> 00:25:22,165
Thank you, Dan Oh.

417
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:27,064
Add dry ice in there.

418
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:28,834
Is this enough?

419
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:34,530
Okay, nice position.

420
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,044
Great job, Number 13.

421
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:37,744
What is this?

422
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,544
- What is it?
- Hey, Dan Oh.

423
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,455
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,455
- Pick it up.
- Okay.

425
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,380
No, you pick it up yourself.

426
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,395
No way.

427
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,620
What did you just say?

428
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,234
Do people at our school
always have to do as you say?

429
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:02,064
Dan Oh was trying to help me.

430
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,205
Really? But didn't I tell you
that you're pretty arrogant?

431
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,475
The one who's arrogant is...

432
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,615
you.

433
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,209
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

434
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,054
- What did she say?
- Seriously?

435
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,615
It was a success.

436
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:21,855
What?

437
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,064
If you were trying to
get my attention, you succeeded.

438
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,334
Good, at this rate...

439
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,840
- Did it get on her skin?
- My gosh.

440
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,014
Hey... Hey, are you okay?

441
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,909
- What happened?
- What was that?

442
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,484
Look away!

443
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,534
I didn't exactly drop these,

444
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:15,304
but can I say the story changed,

445
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,274
or did it not change?

446
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:51,845
(Episode 6 will air shortly.)

447
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,510
What should I wear for this camp?

448
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,180
- Anything.
- Which type will Nam Ju like?

449
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,440
- Exactly.
- Maybe a chiffon dress?

450
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,654
- A sexy off-shoulder...
- No.

451
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,379
- Dan Oh, let's go in there.
- Wait...

452
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:17,450
- Come here.
- I...

453
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,054
These are so pretty.

454
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,590
This color is perfect
for my cool-toned skin.

455
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,165
Dan Oh, this is mine.

456
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:26,204
Dan Oh.

457
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:28,235
Doesn't this remind you of Nam Ju?

458
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,559
Right.

459
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,969
Recently, Nam Ju got
a new keyring on his bag.

460
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:35,005
I'll make a surprise gift for him.

461
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,244
Goodness.

462
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,040
Is that for Baek Kyung?

463
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,010
Baek Kyung is such a lucky guy.

464
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,709
There's no woman who is
as faithful as Dan Oh.

465
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:44,884
Right?

466
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,954
Faithful?

467
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:53,964
Gosh, I hope Nam Ju loves it.

468
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,725
Sure.

469
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:59,064
This scene is awfully long.

470
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,134
Do I still have to do something?

471
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,875
Isn't that Yeo Ju Da?

472
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:10,344
What are you doing? Come on.

473
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:14,710
My gosh, no way.

474
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,154
Is she working a part-time job?

475
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:19,749
My role in this scene was...

476
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,154
to see Ju Da working
her part-time job.

477
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,950
Just bring it, will you?

478
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,389
Stop making excuses.

479
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,919
Sir, that sandwich is
rather popular,

480
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,519
so we don't have any in stock today.

481
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,930
If you come back tomorrow...

482
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,264
If you don't have any,

483
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,828
make some, and bring them to me.

484
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:39,404
The customer is the king.
Don't you know that?

485
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,574
Forget it.

486
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,900
Where's the owner?

487
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,269
Tell the owner to come out.

488
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:46,409
Oh, then how about
some cheese sandwich?

489
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,740
That's pretty popular too.

490
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,255
Cheese sandwich?

491
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,955
How dare you?
Don't look at me like that...

492
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,980
- That's enough.
- What is this?

493
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,895
Are you the owner here?

494
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,695
Are you okay?

495
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:03,835
Thank you, Do Hwa.

496
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,260
If it hadn't been for you...

497
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,604
Why do you always
let people do that to you?

498
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,705
Think about what happened today.

499
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,400
Why didn't you report him...

500
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,299
or run out and scream for help?

501
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:16,075
And why did you carry
the tools for our experiment?

502
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,314
That's why you hurt your hand.

503
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,214
Thanks for your concern,

504
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,985
but I'm fine.

505
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:26,425
You're the only one for me.

506
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,325
My guardian angel is you,

507
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,425
Lee Do Hwa.

508
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,564
Gosh, is this what Dan Oh said
about those lines?

509
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:36,365
It's so cheesy.

510
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,164
You look the most gorgeous
when you smile.

511
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,260
I'm not sure if that was planned...

512
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,275
or if I really meant that.

513
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,639
Thanks for your help today.
I'll go inside.

514
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,714
Ju Da.

515
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,115
Hey, Nam Ju.

516
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,284
Is your hand all right?

517
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,980
Do Hwa, why are you here?

518
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,855
I had to do something to help Ju Da
with my handsome face...

519
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,795
and slender body.

520
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,395
You owe me one.

521
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,335
Bye.

522
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:29,239
Dan Oh, do you want to
go with me today?

523
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:31,385
Sure, I'm all for it.

524
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,555
Dan Oh.

525
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,154
Do you want to quit school
and travel the world with me?

526
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,750
Dad, do you know
what I wanted to do the most...

527
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,994
when I was in the hospital?

528
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,664
Going to school.

529
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:49,160
Going to school, going to class,

530
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,075
and making friends
just like everyone else.

531
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,404
While we're on the subject,

532
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:58,070
I really want to go
to this summer camp.

533
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,414
I've never even been
on a field trip before. Please?

534
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:02,184
- Summer camp?
- Yes.

535
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,085
May I please go this once?

536
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,209
Okay, you may.

537
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:08,624
Really? All right!

538
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,790
But even if
you give me your permission,

539
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,489
it's no use if the writer
doesn't decide to draw me.

540
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:16,735
- What?
- What?

541
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,389
No, nothing. Thank you, Dad.

542
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:21,835
You're the best.

543
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,700
- Come on.
- Why?

544
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,370
I thought it was going to be Paris.

545
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,440
What? We're going somewhere
domestic for the summer camp?

546
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,709
Man, I just renewed my passport.

547
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,310
I'm sure Nam Ju had a good reason.

548
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,380
Oh Nam Ju?

549
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,940
Nam Ju insisted that
we have to go somewhere in Korea...

550
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,250
for this year's summer camp
to the principal.

551
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,349
He said he'll pay for all the cost.

552
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:44,479
Isn't he so generous?

553
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,420
Really? Nam Ju said that?
He's so amazing.

554
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,920
I still wanted to travel abroad.

555
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,190
Nam Ju is the best.

556
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,395
"Nam Ju is the best. He's the best."

557
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,789
Are you mimicking me again?

558
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,459
Are you making fun of me again?

559
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:57,899
My dear Dan Oh,
you're working hard as an extra.

560
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,269
You're completely in your character.

561
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,205
I thought you were going to
try to change your destiny.

562
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,474
I did.

563
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,474
You chanted it all the time.

564
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,984
But nothing's going my way.

565
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:10,755
I don't know when my heart
will stop beating either.

566
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,380
If you can see the future,
why can't you control it?

567
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,484
I can see it, but I can't change it.

568
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,895
If I had such power,
I could've been less humiliated.

569
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,325
What? Did something happen
between you and Ju Da yesterday?

570
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,659
I set the situation...

571
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,560
and left the scene
at the right time...

572
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,734
just like an extra would.

573
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,130
And that's the result of my deed.

574
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,300
(This year's summer camp
will be free.)

575
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,370
The entire school needs
to help the main characters...

576
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,674
with their love story, right?

577
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,085
Sure thing. They are the bosses.

578
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:47,810
I thought you were always
in the cafeteria.

579
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,455
Don't you know that
I pretty much live in the library?

580
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:52,625
You talk as if
you're a student here.

581
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:55,349
You see, this book keeps returning
to its original place.

582
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:57,495
Right, how's Do Hwa doing?

583
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:58,889
He seems to be doing all right.

584
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,864
He adapted fairly quickly.

585
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,205
I'm the one who's struggling.

586
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:06,844
But haven't you been
extremely confident lately?

587
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,515
I was before I overheard
the chat at the hospital.

588
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:19,724
(Nurse Kim, please escort
Dan Oh out.)

589
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,185
(I think you need
to prepare yourself.)

590
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:26,594
I guess you know as well that
I don't have much time left.

591
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:33,565
Don't give me that look.
I'm going to change my fate.

592
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:42,630
He was never around
when I looked for him.

593
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,815
Who are you talking about?

594
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,445
It's the guy I mentioned last time.

595
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,509
The key to changing my fate.

596
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,515
So? Did it change?

597
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,079
I guess not.

598
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,409
Who knows?

599
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,924
It's not that easy, you know?

600
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,864
Anyway, I'll be going now.

601
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,435
I should at least try.

602
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,914
Number 13!

603
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,214
Hey!

604
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,550
Once the page flips,
I'll be good as new.

605
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,635
Number 13!

606
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,205
Number 13!

607
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,800
Are you injured? I know my way
around the nurse's office.

608
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,145
I'll find it for you.

609
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:37,224
I'm relieved that it's not serious.

610
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,520
But then again, we're mere extras,

611
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,625
so we'll be all healed up
by the next scene.

612
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,109
It would be wonderful
if you could change my fate...

613
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,794
with that handsome face of yours.

614
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,025
Number 13.

615
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:19,334
You better remember me next time.

616
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,865
My name is Eun Dan Oh.

617
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,735
Eun Dan Oh.

618
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,310
- He's going.
- He is.

619
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,650
- We're going too.
- Darn it.

620
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,509
(List of Summer Camp Attendees)

621
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,520
(Yeo Ju Da, Oh Nam Ju,
Shin Sae Mi, Eun Dan Oh, Baek Kyung)

622
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,954
(Kim Ae Il, Kim Yang Il,
Ahn Su Chul, Park Yang Yi)

623
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,794
Are those who are not up there
forbidden to attend?

624
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:55,690
Su Chul is going as well.

625
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,804
Hey.

626
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,200
My gosh.

627
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,505
Hey.

628
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,969
Just like his wound,

629
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:05,914
I'm sure he's forgotten everything.

630
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,755
It hurts to know
that I'm forgotten every time.

631
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,824
Hi, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

632
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,495
Number 13 lacks in many ways.

633
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:24,465
He doesn't even have a name
to begin with.

634
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,605
This is great.

635
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:33,804
Wait! Number 13.

636
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,804
Hi, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

637
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,440
Can you help me take these books
to the library?

638
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,084
I'll carry this one.

639
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,715
It's over there.

640
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,410
I'm Eun Dan Oh, number 7.
I'm a junior in Class 7.

641
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,349
- Stop it. I'm sweating.
- Darn it.

642
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:48,609
- Endure it.
- Let's speed up.

643
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:50,694
I don't want to.

644
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:52,454
Gosh.

645
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,135
Hi, do you remember me?

646
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:03,375
My name is Eun Dan Oh.

647
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,770
"When I called out his name,"

648
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,215
"he came to me as a flower."

649
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,900
What happened afterwards?

650
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,784
Let's look into that.

651
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,954
She called out his name.

652
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,084
That means that she was wishful.

653
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,020
In that sense, becoming a flower...

654
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,765
means that their relationship
was fulfilled.

655
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,190
Do you get it?

656
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,564
- Yes.
- Yes.

657
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:36,304
Nothing's changed,

658
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,635
and he doesn't seem
to remember me either.

659
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,070
So would it be weird of me
to feel like...

660
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,615
something is gradually changing?

661
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,465
Chairman Eun suddenly postponed
the investment.

662
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,404
Darn it!

663
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,544
Haven't I told you numerous times
to take care of Dan Oh?

664
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,009
I am.

665
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:23,355
If you are, then why haven't you
visited her at the hospital?

666
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,554
She must've told her father
about how disappointed she was.

667
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,485
Don't you know how much
he cherishes her?

668
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,550
It would not be an exaggeration
to say...

669
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,265
that the fate of my business lies
in her hands.

670
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,235
How many times do I need
to repeat myself?

671
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,664
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sick of your apologies!

672
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:55,084
You're useless.

673
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,015
Let's go.

674
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,235
No way. I'm really here.

675
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,204
Dan Oh!

676
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,605
What should I do?
I left my red dress at home.

677
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,400
I wish we were strangers.

678
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,339
Are you emigrating?
What is all this?

679
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,040
Are you not doing
a live broadcast today?

680
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,209
You should upload videos of me.

681
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:29,515
I prepared these for our class.

682
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,479
What's up with that Polaroid camera?

683
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:32,940
Show me some interest, will you?

684
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,849
I'll be the photographer in charge.

685
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,420
Is that so? Forget about that.

686
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,150
These are more expensive
than your camera,

687
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,719
so do take good care of them.

688
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,965
Let's go.

689
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,390
Why should I?

690
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,759
It feels like a dream
to be traveling with you.

691
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,434
Me too. I'm loving it.

692
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,530
I was never allowed to attend these
due to my heart condition.

693
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,605
I'm sure I'll be busy
acting as the love bridge.

694
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,404
But I still love it.

695
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:58,300
- You must be loving this!
- I do!

696
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,784
What do you love? What is it?

697
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,855
Everyone gets one!
Let's eat a sandwich!

698
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,625
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

699
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:15,525
Let's go.

700
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,865
We're here!

701
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,934
- We're here!
- We're here!

702
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,064
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

703
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,839
Nam Ju said hi, didn't he?

704
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:34,985
- He's the only one I love.
- Sae Mi.

705
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,570
I'm not Sae Mi.

706
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,109
Come here. Try this.
Everyone, come have some.

707
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,848
Goodness.

708
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,879
Forget it, I don't eat
these kinds of foods.

709
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:45,419
Don't act all posh.
Just have one bite.

710
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,749
No, thanks.

711
00:42:46,749 --> 00:42:50,694
I only eat the organic dishes
that my chef...

712
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:52,164
makes.

713
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,229
See? Isn't it good?

714
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:57,729
I'm only eating it
because he wants me to.

715
00:42:57,729 --> 00:42:59,629
I knew you'd like it. Dig in, guys.

716
00:42:59,629 --> 00:43:00,944
This is good.

717
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:02,645
Dig in.

718
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:05,670
- Pay me just 13 dollars.
- This is so good.

719
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,410
- Isn't it good?
- Who's the chef?

720
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,485
The lady over there.

721
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:10,154
- It's good.
- I know.

722
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,459
Dan Oh, stop. Stop.

723
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:25,595
You'd better stop.

724
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,475
What are you doing?

725
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,459
I see. This is it.

726
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,204
This is why I came to the camp.

727
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,814
Gosh, just take it and get lost.

728
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:39,775
It's a gift.

729
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,225
Do you expect me
to carry something like this?

730
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,355
Well...

731
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,895
Don't buy me garbage like this.

732
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,034
- Baek Kyung.
- Baek Kyung.

733
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,570
- Don't cry.
- Don't cry.

734
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,729
Hey, Dan Oh. Don't cry.

735
00:44:09,729 --> 00:44:11,099
There are other fish in the sea.

736
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,615
- There are other guys out there.
- Don't cry.

737
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,215
What's wrong with you?

738
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,440
- My goodness.
- Don't let this shock you.

739
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,150
- I'm okay.
- Look at her.

740
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,820
Don't mind me. Just have fun.

741
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,550
I guess she lost her mind
or something.

742
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,290
- Good luck.
- Okay.

743
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,924
- Good luck to me!
- Good luck.

744
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:35,629
What do they sell at the snack bar?

745
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:36,629
Hey.

746
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:38,334
- Give that to me.
- Hey.

747
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,345
- Come on.
- What do I do?

748
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:43,700
Oh, no.

749
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,515
Your eyes are red.

750
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,914
Are you all right?

751
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:49,410
I can't believe this writer.

752
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,839
You're using me to show
how kind Ju Da is?

753
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,050
My grandma often gets sick,

754
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,025
so I'm pretty good at folk remedies.

755
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,849
If you have a weak heart,

756
00:44:57,849 --> 00:44:59,595
you need to have
good blood circulation.

757
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:00,694
Give me your hand.

758
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,404
Hey, Ju Da.

759
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,235
Here.

760
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,235
What's this?

761
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:16,144
That's... What was that called?

762
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:18,239
It's something with sausages.

763
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,544
It's sausage with rice cake.

764
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:21,739
Why are you giving this to me?

765
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:23,580
It's good, so I want you to have it.

766
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,039
No, if you won't eat it,
I'll throw it out. Give me.

767
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,114
Gosh.

768
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:29,755
Give it to me. Give me that.

769
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,150
- I got this because I want this.
- Wait.

770
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,049
I'll share this with Ju Da.

771
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:35,425
Don't worry.

772
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:37,294
Thank you, Dan Oh.

773
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:41,789
If I didn't have scenes like this,

774
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:44,034
I wouldn't have been able to come
to the camp like Number 13.

775
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,299
My life exists
for the main characters.

776
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:48,069
Checking the microphone.

777
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:50,544
1, 2, 3. Let's get started.

778
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:54,644
Ladies and gentlemen.

779
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:56,709
I welcome you...

780
00:45:56,709 --> 00:45:58,614
to our camp.

781
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,894
Dan Oh, come on out.

782
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:17,275
I really like school trips,
but I really hate that.

783
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,624
You're pretty good.

784
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,084
Let's keep dancing.

785
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,459
- Look.
- It's the ocean.

786
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:46,134
- Hi.
- Hi.

787
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,405
He's really not here.

788
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,630
Darn it.

789
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,759
Dan Oh, you're scaring me.

790
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:53,945
Hey.

791
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,370
- Are you all right?
- What?

792
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,374
I'm talking about
the incident with you and Baek Kyung.

793
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,114
I don't care. I was on the stage.

794
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,655
Even so, I would've gotten hurt.

795
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:06,910
My friend, if you get hurt
by every tiny thing,

796
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,549
you won't be able to survive
in this cruel world of comics.

797
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:11,850
Enough about that.
Have you seen Number 13?

798
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,019
- Your back?
- Yes.

799
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:15,324
Of course, he didn't make it here.

800
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:16,620
He wasn't on the list.

801
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,559
Gosh, that's so cruel.

802
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:20,059
So a nameless extra isn't...

803
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:21,529
even allowed to come
to this summer camp?

804
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:22,989
That piece of...

805
00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:25,900
Why not? No one but us
will remember what I said.

806
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,205
- This is so unfair.
- I know that. I know that well.

807
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,969
Gosh, you're like
a completely different person.

808
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:30,999
This is scary.

809
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:33,170
I'm so happy for you
that you're not.

810
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,245
Well,

811
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:37,809
- it's not always a good thing.
- Piece of trash. I should...

812
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:40,140
- Hey, everyone is watching.
- skin you and eat your eyeballs.

813
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,049
You little... Come on,
let me curse out the writer.

814
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:43,249
Be quiet.

815
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:44,380
I could just...

816
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,725
Where is he?

817
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,549
He's really not here.

818
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:49,165
The weather is great.

819
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:51,935
What's that?

820
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,435
Gosh, you didn't buy this?

821
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:55,534
No.

822
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:57,100
They come in different sizes
and shapes,

823
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,235
but it all has the same effect.

824
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:02,205
Please do us the honor.

825
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,499
She's leaving. Ae Ri.

826
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:05,239
- Ae Ri.
- Split it with me.

827
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,584
If two people face each other
and break the stone,

828
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,844
you're left with a piece that shows
how much you like each other.

829
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,784
Isn't that so romantic?

830
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,410
So it's just a stone.

831
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,809
That's not all.

832
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:18,979
If you make a wish to the stone
and make a tower with them,

833
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,465
that wish comes true.

834
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,465
Here.

835
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,104
I will root for you
and your love for Baek Kyung.

836
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,034
- I don't need this.
- Who knows?

837
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,634
Your wish might come true.

838
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:41,644
Happy?

839
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,685
That's Dan Oh.

840
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,025
Number 13...

841
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:57,894
is here.

842
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,094
What's wrong?

843
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,405
Hey, Do Hwa.

844
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,759
Have you seen Baek Kyung?

845
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:03,834
Baek Kyung?

846
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,799
Is that a line?

847
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,144
Tell Baek Kyung that I'm looking for him
if you see him.

848
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:12,614
I think this time, I'll really be
able to change my fate.

849
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,670
- Sae Mi.
- What?

850
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,745
Give me that.

851
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,685
Hey, you said you didn't want it.

852
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,709
- It's Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju!

853
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,420
- Nam Ju!
- Goodness.

854
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,190
- Nam Ju.
- Do you want it?

855
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,759
- Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju, I'll buy it for you.

856
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:34,489
- Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

857
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:35,564
- Ring this up, please.
- Ring this up, please.

858
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,005
Do Hwa?

859
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:42,675
Why are you buying this?

860
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,814
What about you?

861
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,475
Must I report to you
about everything?

862
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,215
You don't need to,

863
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:50,755
and I don't need to either.

864
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:53,854
Here.

865
00:49:58,049 --> 00:49:59,950
- Do Hwa.
- Hey, you're here.

866
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,025
What is it?

867
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,134
It's nothing big.

868
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,630
Do you know what this is?

869
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,034
- That's...
- Relationship Stone.

870
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:10,574
Give me your hand.

871
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,475
Break this with me.

872
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:29,784
Hey, Number 13!

873
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,765
When did you get here? How? Why?

874
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:36,819
No, that's not important.

875
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:39,059
Heart disease and 10-year-crush
are my set-ups.

876
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:40,319
If we change the story,

877
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,289
we can be more than extras.

878
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,400
Later, I'm going to be
in the water over there.

879
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,130
Whether you grab my arm or trip me,

880
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,930
you should stop me
by any means necessary.

881
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,245
Okay? Yes?

882
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:57,479
"Okay. I got it.
Let's change our fate together."

883
00:50:57,479 --> 00:50:59,680
Yes, yes. I feel exactly
the same way with you.

884
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,084
Let's do this together.

885
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:08,765
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

886
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,794
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

887
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,465
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

888
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,905
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

889
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,745
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

890
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:23,675
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

891
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,245
Why are you here, Baek Kyung?

892
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,445
Dan Oh was looking for you.

893
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,554
I don't care.

894
00:51:31,779 --> 00:51:33,015
I'll step out for a bit.

895
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:34,324
Okay.

896
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,225
- Do Hwa.
- Yes?

897
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,894
I've been meaning to ask you this.

898
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,265
Do you like Ju Da?

899
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:48,665
What are you talking about?

900
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,729
She's just a friend.

901
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:53,559
I'm spitting out words
that I don't even mean.

902
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:55,874
But why is she smiling like that
in front of you?

903
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,415
I wonder if there are girls...

904
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,915
who would not smile
in front of me.

905
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:05,215
These are the lines
Dan Oh told me about.

906
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,124
Do Hwa.

907
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:10,894
You know me, don't you?

908
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,749
I move according to how the story
is fixed in the comic book.

909
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:16,425
I can't stand it
when other people touch my things.

910
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,294
That's my fate.

911
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,165
No exception
even if you're my friend.

912
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:22,665
Stay away from her.

913
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:01,100
If you're sick,
you should just stay at home.

914
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,074
Why did you come to the camp?
It's annoying me.

915
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,044
Figures. This is your hobby.
Tormenting me.

916
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:18,624
Happy?

917
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:20,354
I'm...

918
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,594
really happy.

919
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:28,564
This stone is supposed to break
as much as you like the other one.

920
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,205
See? You have the bigger piece.

921
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,614
What are you doing?

922
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,084
I don't have any wishes,
and your wish is too obvious.

923
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:46,155
Stop wasting your time.

924
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,044
Okay, am I going to drown now?

925
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:10,344
Where's Number 13?

926
00:54:14,509 --> 00:54:16,370
It's now. Yes, right now.

927
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:17,779
- Isn't that Dan Oh?
- You have to hold me back now.

928
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:20,084
- That's Dan Oh.
- What is she going to do?

929
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,794
What? What is this?
It's just like the storyboard.

930
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:37,334
Why is he just standing there?
Hey, Number 13!

931
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:41,170
Hey, wait. I'm going in now. I'm in.

932
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,400
- What's with her?
- What is she doing?

933
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,445
- Go get her.
- What is she going to do?

934
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,084
Stop her! Dan Oh!

935
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,814
The water is up to my knees now.

936
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,114
I don't want to live my life
as it was planned.

937
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,084
Please save me.

938
00:54:56,279 --> 00:54:59,294
Save me. Save me, Number 13.

939
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:36,864
It didn't change. I can't do it.

940
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,995
I can't.

941
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,064
After all,

942
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,634
I can't change anything.

943
00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:53,344
What was that? What's with her?

944
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:55,844
Come on out.

945
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,255
I thought it could change.

946
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:23,644
Hey.

947
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,374
Man, mine is much bigger.

948
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,284
This is kind of awful.

949
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:33,185
Give it back to me. Give it back.

950
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,564
I'll think about it
if you follow my lead.

951
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,564
(Please make Baek Kyung like me.)

952
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,364
I'm going to make it happen.

953
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,874
We did it. Look.

954
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:31,044
We did it.

955
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:34,114
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

956
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:39,384
What did you wish for?

957
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,195
It's a secret.

958
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,104
(Please make Baek Kyung like me.)

959
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,685
I think you need...

960
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:14,854
to prepare yourself.

961
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,995
Can you help her live, honey?

962
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,824
Dan Oh doesn't have much time left.

963
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:10,044
Nothing changes in this world.

964
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:11,844
Never.

965
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,235
Stop it.

966
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,665
It'll fall down anyway.

967
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,175
A tower like this...

968
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,945
can't make my wish come true.

969
01:00:29,979 --> 01:00:31,455
I thought it was you.

970
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:37,394
I thought you could
help me change this.

971
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:44,334
I was wrong.

972
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:30,584
(I want to live.)

973
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,064
("Secret")

974
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:55,505
Eun Dan Oh.
