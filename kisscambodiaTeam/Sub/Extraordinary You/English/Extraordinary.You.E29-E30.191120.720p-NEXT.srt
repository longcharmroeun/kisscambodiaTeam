1
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:18,373
Dan Oh.

2
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,973
(Episode 29)

3
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:22,073
Dan Oh.

4
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:24,342
Can we...

5
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:27,053
Can we talk for a second?

6
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:30,783
She's coming.

7
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:36,292
- Hey, Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh.

8
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,618
Did you just see, Sae Mi?

9
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,262
- Doing what?
- Like this.

10
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:49,098
I really think
this was the power of love.

11
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:50,797
- The power of love?
- Yes.

12
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:53,573
If it's not that,
how can we explain this miracle?

13
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,277
It's pretty.

14
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:02,982
Of course, it is.
This means so much to us.

15
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,192
Gosh, the ring is so pretty.

16
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:08,647
I guess your mother's ring was
exactly the same as me.

17
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,062
It fits me perfectly.

18
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,357
Kyung, what's wrong?

19
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:19,532
It's weird.

20
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:21,633
- What is?
- Did you just...

21
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,998
- call me Kyung?
- Oh, I get it.

22
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:26,767
It's because
the ring looks so good on me.

23
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,838
Gosh, the ring is so pretty.

24
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,038
I guess your mother's ring was
exactly the same as me.

25
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:33,353
It fits me perfectly.

26
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:34,782
Dan Oh.

27
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:36,853
Dan Oh.

28
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,823
Can we talk for a second?

29
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,217
Gosh, you surprised me.

30
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:43,863
Hey, it's you, Haru.

31
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:45,817
Kyung, it's Haru.

32
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:48,562
Are you two practicing tennis today?
Are you?

33
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:55,202
What's going on?

34
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:57,872
Tell me.

35
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,473
What's going on?

36
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,743
I should be asking you.

37
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:05,113
You were the one who was with her.

38
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,282
It's all for the better.

39
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:12,452
- What?
- Everything is back in its place,

40
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:14,193
just as I hoped.

41
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,723
It's probably better for Dan Oh too.

42
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,792
At least she won't suffer between
the gap of the stage and the shadow.

43
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:24,563
It's all for the better.

44
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,163
Everything is back in its place,

45
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:29,563
just as I hoped.

46
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,103
Are you the only one
who works in the cafeteria?

47
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,238
Do you need a hand?

48
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,742
No, I can manage by myself.

49
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,343
You don't have any friends, do you?

50
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,552
I can totally tell.

51
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,623
Why do you keep doing this to me?

52
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:52,892
Because I keep on noticing you.

53
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,623
If you don't have any friends,
I can be your friend.

54
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:01,193
I don't need any.

55
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,663
Oh, why does it sound like
you need some?

56
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,883
Dan Oh...

57
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:27,193
Dan Oh lost her memories.

58
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:29,592
You remind me...

59
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,233
of what I was like in the past.

60
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,162
That's exactly the face I made...

61
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,102
when I lost her.

62
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,842
If you die in a place
that is not in this book,

63
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:51,067
you still exist,

64
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,813
but your memories disappear.

65
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:56,883
I couldn't stop my beloved
from dying before my eyes.

66
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,923
My story will end soon.

67
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,618
But I hope
you can change your story.

68
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:05,092
("Trumpet Creeper")

69
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:14,073
Back then, I hoped
your story could change,

70
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,873
but I didn't realize
the stages you changed...

71
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:20,012
will lead us to a tragedy.

72
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,873
Our self-awareness disappears...

73
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:24,883
once we die in the shadow.

74
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,852
Then if the story ends like this,

75
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,993
what happens to us?

76
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:39,392
We fall into a deep sleep...

77
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:42,133
until the writer draws us again.

78
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:44,332
What if the writer
never draws us again?

79
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,003
Then this world may be...

80
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:50,073
the last one for Dan Oh and me.

81
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,837
If you make a big impression
on the writer...

82
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,842
or if it's easy
for the writer to draw you,

83
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,943
then there will be a higher chance
that you'll be drawn again.

84
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:02,313
I guess
that's what Su Hyang is like.

85
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:04,582
The story is about to be over,

86
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:06,793
but the writer
added her in the last minute.

87
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,293
I'm not sure if it's easy
for the writer to draw her...

88
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,493
or if she made a big impression.

89
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:14,493
Or I may have looked so pathetic...

90
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:17,063
that the writer added her in
out of pity.

91
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,573
When someone is drawn,

92
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,902
others tend to get erased.

93
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,772
When the story is about to be over,

94
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:28,598
it's a piece of cake
to erase us from the scenes.

95
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:31,113
That means
we can't be freed until the end.

96
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,137
It's time for you to refrain from
getting noticed by the writer.

97
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,212
Especially so...

98
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,352
for an extra like you
who doesn't play a huge role.

99
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,323
I don't want you...

100
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,262
to suddenly disappear
in the middle of the story.

101
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,733
We only have a few scenes left.

102
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,972
The writer is about to
wrap up this world.

103
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,173
Why?

104
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:47,423
My lady.

105
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:50,563
My lady.

106
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,193
My lady.

107
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:53,993
My lady.

108
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:57,832
Dan Oh.

109
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,173
Dan Oh!

110
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,017
No matter what I do,

111
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,587
I cannot control my feelings.

112
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,162
You know that as well.

113
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:35,933
I will wait for you...

114
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,773
just like this flower.

115
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,073
I will protect you.

116
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,252
I will wait...

117
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:56,722
until we meet again.

118
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,092
I will remember you...

119
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:04,962
forever.

120
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:14,242
No matter what happens,

121
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,082
I will...

122
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,212
Hey.

123
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:56,722
You knew everything, didn't you?

124
00:09:58,277 --> 00:09:59,653
You knew it wasn't me.

125
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:03,622
You were the one who did it.

126
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,393
So what?

127
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,563
But that won't happen this time.

128
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,988
Dan Oh's set-up has changed.

129
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,627
The writer intends for her
to stay by my side.

130
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,842
And that will torture her.

131
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:20,013
It tortured her then,
and it will this time as well.

132
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,212
I'm going to find the real Dan Oh.

133
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,183
So that...

134
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,112
she can truly be herself.

135
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,033
Dan Oh.

136
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:46,872
Hi.

137
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:48,933
Hi.

138
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,573
Dan Oh.

139
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,592
We're in the same class.

140
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,423
I see.

141
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:29,212
Where's Kyung?

142
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,053
Do you remember this?

143
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,147
"Heart disease
and one-sided love for 10 years."

144
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:39,452
"That's my set-up."

145
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:41,547
"If we change the story,"

146
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:44,122
"both you and I will no longer
be extras."

147
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,023
"Let's..."

148
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,832
"change our fate."

149
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:02,813
I like that this is a romance comic.

150
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,137
At least, nobody dies.

151
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:08,413
What are you doing here?
What are you reading?

152
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:13,417
Look at you.
You're an ardent fan, aren't you?

153
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,218
You read this illogical
and ridiculous story...

154
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:16,516
again and again.

155
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:19,858
You're here again.
Could you please stop...

156
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,933
Come on. I know you're happy
to see me.

157
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:27,372
I give the writer props
for curing Dan Oh.

158
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,498
If it was this easy to cure her,
why did she have to be in pain...

159
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:31,573
for the past decade?

160
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,342
Hey, Dan Oh.

161
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,472
Hi, Do Hwa.

162
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,013
What is this?

163
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,882
It feels like back when Haru
wasn't his true self.

164
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,193
Dan Oh.

165
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,362
- Hi, Do Hwa.
- What?

166
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,972
This is a cliche!

167
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:04,568
Fine. Dan Oh has finally
fully recovered.

168
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,027
And I'm glad that
Kyung has become nice,

169
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:07,438
and that this will be
a happy ending.

170
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,573
But...

171
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,267
What's the use of Dan Oh only
being happy on stage...

172
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,053
when she no longer exists
in the shadow?

173
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:19,153
I remember when you lost
your memory.

174
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:21,653
Dan Oh was in so much pain.

175
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:26,092
I think I'm being punished.

176
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,218
Don't be ridiculous.

177
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:30,763
It's all because of our illogical
and obnoxious writer.

178
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:34,073
You're right.

179
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:37,943
I'll try to follow my heart.

180
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,173
I'm going to do so...

181
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:42,842
no matter the consequences.

182
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,708
Just trust me and follow me.

183
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,783
Okay?

184
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,382
That darn writer.

185
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,252
So...

186
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,153
I'm going to follow my heart.

187
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:57,862
I'm going to do so...

188
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,732
no matter the consequences.

189
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:11,472
Dan Oh.

190
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:14,167
Hi, my name is Haru.

191
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,913
Yes, I know.

192
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:20,283
Let me.

193
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,208
It's okay. I can manage.

194
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,523
They're not heavy at all.

195
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,323
I want to walk...

196
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:28,252
with you.

197
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,063
"When I called out her name,"

198
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,632
"she turned into a flower."

199
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,427
What did he do
before she turned into a flower?

200
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:45,127
What had to be done beforehand?

201
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:46,202
It was her name.

202
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,013
He called out her name.

203
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,907
This means that there is...

204
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:55,653
determination, effort, and hope.

205
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,882
That is how she became a flower.

206
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:02,153
The two of them could finally
have a relationship.

207
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,893
Do you understand?

208
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,023
- Yes.
- Yes.

209
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,043
Hi.

210
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:23,112
Dan Oh.

211
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:25,683
You gave me my name...

212
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,783
because you hoped
that I could change...

213
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,482
your day.

214
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,423
I did that?

215
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:34,653
Yes.

216
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,992
Please remember...

217
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,063
the name you've given me.

218
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,063
"Haru".

219
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,903
Dan Oh, you can take your time
if it's too difficult.

220
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,342
I'll go to you.

221
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,338
("S Group's Second Son, Mr. Oh,
Born out of Wedlock!")

222
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:04,653
- Hey, this is about Nam Ju.
- No way!

223
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,578
- It's the second son!
- Isn't that Nam Ju?

224
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:08,718
Look at this.

225
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,417
- Oh, no!
- "Oh" is his surname.

226
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,962
"Cha Ji Hyun".

227
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:13,757
This is a lie.

228
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,057
Nam Ju is too perfect for this.

229
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,728
And we thought he'd inherit
Serinne Fashion?

230
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,897
- Darn it! I had no idea!
- After everything we did...

231
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,627
We blew so many balloons
because of him.

232
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:28,166
Does this mean Y3 will take over?

233
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,212
You have no courage, do you?

234
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,568
What?

235
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:32,938
I'll be taking over Nam Ju's spot.

236
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:34,352
My goodness.

237
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,183
This is official.

238
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:38,553
From now on, I will take over...

239
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:39,852
- nothing.
- Hey, Nam Ju.

240
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:42,017
- Poor Nam Ju.
- Does he think he's still...

241
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,377
a part of A3?

242
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,748
Will this be the end of him?

243
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:47,033
I never thought he'd be a liar.

244
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:50,163
If you have something to say,
say it to my face.

245
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,573
Nam Ju, this isn't true, is it?

246
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:59,228
Hey! Don't say such things to him!

247
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,943
It's all true.

248
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,313
It's true?

249
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,482
So what?

250
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,882
Does that mean
I'm no longer Oh Nam Ju?

251
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:23,432
Are you okay? I'm going to lose
my subscribers!

252
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,672
Are you okay?

253
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,273
You also liked me...

254
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:35,172
because I was the heir
to Serinne, right?

255
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,313
- I...
- Ju Da.

256
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,082
Close your eyes.

257
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,182
Close your eyes.

258
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,657
He's crying.

259
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:01,698
- Look at him. He's a crybaby.
- Don't cry now.

260
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,498
Hey, look at him crying.

261
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,628
These jerks...

262
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,342
- Hey.
- What?

263
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,097
Do you have anything to say
to a Y3 member?

264
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,837
- You're nothing but a peasant.
- What did you say?

265
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:11,382
High-class school, my foot.

266
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,468
You divide people into classes
based on money and reputation.

267
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,908
And you praise or condemn them.

268
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:16,638
You guys are such peasants.

269
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,523
You... You...

270
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:19,922
Let's go, Nam Ju.

271
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:22,753
Hey.

272
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:44,483
Drink it.

273
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,442
Okay.

274
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,622
This is nice.

275
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,932
To tell you the truth,
I've been having a hard time.

276
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,332
- Why?
- Just because.

277
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,563
It was inevitable.

278
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,932
I'm Oh Nam Ju.

279
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:10,132
I'm the leader of A3
at Seuli High School.

280
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,973
And I had to protect the woman...

281
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:15,342
I like.

282
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:19,483
I exist...

283
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:21,682
for you.

284
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,963
Go abroad.

285
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,063
No, I won't.

286
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,757
You'd better take this
before anyone sees it.

287
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:43,527
You still care about how other
people will think of us even now?

288
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,168
I took down all the articles.

289
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:46,567
I, Oh Nam Ju...

290
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,473
- Hold on.
- What is he doing?

291
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,267
Come home. Let's talk at home.

292
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,337
I'm not the biological son...

293
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,912
of Serinne Fashion's chairman,
Oh Jae Beol.

294
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,607
What are you doing right now?

295
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:00,823
- This feels better.
- What?

296
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,823
I don't want to be a coward anymore.

297
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:05,047
I will live my life
as the real Oh Nam Ju now.

298
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,763
Can you throw away
everything you have...

299
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:10,432
and privileges
that are given to you?

300
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,132
Nam Ju.

301
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:14,597
This is all for you.

302
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:15,733
No.

303
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:24,783
The best thing you can do
for him is...

304
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:27,253
letting him accept who he really is.

305
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:29,382
Nam Ju.

306
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:32,323
I don't care if you're
the heir to Serinne Fashion...

307
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,422
or just a regular guy.

308
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:36,592
To me,

309
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,162
you were always mine.

310
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,092
I'll help you.

311
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,662
- My goodness. No way.
- I can't believe it.

312
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:49,073
I love you.

313
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,953
Nam Ju, it must've been
hard for you too.

314
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:03,112
I'm sure the main character
came with...

315
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:05,553
a lot of burdens.

316
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,317
- Ma'am.
- "Ma'am"?

317
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,293
You can't use your own son
like you use a tool.

318
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:15,432
Nam Ju, tell them
what's on your mind.

319
00:21:16,017 --> 00:21:17,092
You...

320
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,398
I, Oh Nam Ju, will put down
the crown of Seuli High School...

321
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:22,832
and live my life as it is...

322
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,703
with the love of my life, Ju Da.

323
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:35,813
- Oh Nam Ju!
- Oh Nam Ju!

324
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:39,323
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

325
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,753
Is there anything you want to do?

326
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,523
Anything you want to eat...

327
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:44,963
or anything you want to have.

328
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:47,293
There are tons.

329
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:48,688
I want to go to the movies with you,

330
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:51,402
eat delicious food, and...

331
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:53,332
And...

332
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:54,998
Gosh, there are tons.

333
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:57,342
But I can't remember them
now that we're talking about them.

334
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:03,043
Why didn't I ask you that sooner?

335
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,842
You want to do so many things
with me.

336
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:08,882
If you don't remember it,

337
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,682
I'll just do whatever I want to do.

338
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:13,852
You told me...

339
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:15,793
that your affection for me
was all fake.

340
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,963
But I'll believe that your affection
for me is genuine.

341
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:25,602
You can run away...

342
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:27,573
if you remember it now.

343
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:32,142
Why would I run away from you?
I like you so much.

344
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:35,912
- Why?
- You and I are meant to be.

345
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:37,708
- We're meant to be?
- Yes.

346
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,367
I only like you, no one else.

347
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,412
If that doesn't mean we're meant
to be, what else would that mean?

348
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:10,273
Hey, Dan Oh.

349
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,107
Don't you know
that Sae Mi has sensitive eyes?

350
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,612
I'm sorry.

351
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:16,208
Hey, stop looking out for me.

352
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,478
Why are you complaining about that?

353
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:18,678
Gosh. Go away.

354
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:19,878
Go away. Go.

355
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:21,117
I was going to leave anyway.
I need to film there too.

356
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:22,892
Goodness.

357
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:24,448
My mom was right.

358
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,692
Letting someone in your heart
little by little is the scariest.

359
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:30,188
What? What's wrong with him?

360
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:31,628
Hey, Su Chul. Come over here.

361
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:32,763
Goodness.

362
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,362
What's wrong with me?

363
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:35,958
Must you ask?

364
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,218
You're shining a light at your eyes.

365
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:39,428
Of course, it would make you cry.

366
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,432
Goodness, you're so cheeky.

367
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:45,602
Haru.

368
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:47,973
What? "Haru"?

369
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,112
- "Haru"?
- I mean,

370
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:52,082
that's what you just said.

371
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:03,692
Hey.

372
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:05,392
Wait up for me.

373
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:06,862
Stop right there.

374
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:11,563
Dan Oh.

375
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:15,073
I decided to let Nam Ju go.

376
00:25:15,757 --> 00:25:16,832
Really?

377
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:19,672
I've never seen him smile like that.

378
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,313
Goodbye, Nam Ju.

379
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:28,983
I sort of feel like...

380
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:32,122
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

381
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,418
You'll be right next to me
when you're 19...

382
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:36,953
and 20.

383
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:39,862
I heard that
this tree is 300 years old.

384
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:44,662
This tree must have seen thousands
of students over that long time.

385
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,003
I'm Do Hwa's friend.

386
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,033
I transferred to this school
a while ago.

387
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:52,827
I don't think we've met before.

388
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:53,902
Really?

389
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:56,898
I thought you were close
with Do Hwa.

390
00:25:56,898 --> 00:25:59,607
We're not that close. We've known
each other since we were kids.

391
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,607
Then, this tree must have seen
you guys too.

392
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:02,912
Probably not.

393
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:05,007
When I was young,
I mostly stayed at the hospital.

394
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:06,547
If you look at the top of the tree,

395
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,352
you can probably see everything.

396
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:11,888
That's kind of creepy.

397
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,748
Just make sure the tree
doesn't find out.

398
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:15,688
You can hide among other students.

399
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:18,733
Living the same life people live,
hiding among other students...

400
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,563
isn't fun.

401
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:22,803
Is that so?

402
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:24,968
I must find my own meaning
for my life.

403
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,198
This is my life.

404
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:27,813
What a great line.

405
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:29,973
"My own meaning".

406
00:26:31,037 --> 00:26:34,682
I think it might differ depending on
whom I live my life with.

407
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:37,607
Does the meaning of your life
have to do with Kyung?

408
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:38,753
Of course...

409
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:41,448
Probably.

410
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:42,617
Either you know it or you don't.

411
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:43,953
You can't say, "probably".

412
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,662
It's about the writer who made us.

413
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:52,057
What do you think
the writer is thinking...

414
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:53,533
while looking at us from above?

415
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:57,233
- "Writer"?
- At first, I was scared too.

416
00:26:58,198 --> 00:27:00,973
No matter how hard
I tried to escape, I couldn't.

417
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:05,342
I just wanted to be happy
with the love of my life.

418
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,238
We tried to change it,

419
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,412
but some things never change.

420
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:13,622
And things you didn't want to change
can change.

421
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,553
It's up to the writer.

422
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:20,023
Sometimes, it follows storyboards.
And sometimes, it doesn't.

423
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:21,793
What do you mean?

424
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:28,832
Just like you don't know
which leaf will fall next,

425
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:31,203
there are no rules
in this world as well.

426
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:33,973
As long as your affection
for one another is strong,

427
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:36,043
you can overcome it.

428
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:43,178
- Dan Oh, let's go eat some bread.
- Sure.

429
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,607
Sure. Let me carry your backpack.

430
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:48,523
Hey. I told you to stop
taking care of me. Give me that.

431
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:50,547
- I'll carry it for you.
- Let go of that.

432
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:51,622
Dan Oh.

433
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,932
- Get home safe.
- Okay.

434
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,303
Poor Haru.
This is breaking my heart.

435
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:04,342
Dan Oh.

436
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,998
Dan Oh. Where are you going?

437
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,043
Hey. Nam Ju already left.

438
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:11,638
Dan Oh.
A small flutter of a butterfly...

439
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:16,478
can change your destiny.
It changes. Changes. Changes.

440
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:17,723
Hey, Kyung.

441
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,152
Let's go.

442
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,223
I'm going to go eat something
with Sae Mi.

443
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:28,932
It didn't change.

444
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:40,602
Dan Oh, you rascal. You can't
remember any of our memories.

445
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,408
Did I keep you waiting?

446
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:49,112
No, I just got here too.

447
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:59,286
You must really love strawberries.

448
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,723
I don't like strawberries.

449
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:04,862
I just have it because Nam Ju says
that I like strawberries.

450
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:08,832
The guy who went crazy saying
"my woman" and "strawberry".

451
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,243
Nam Ju really likes you.

452
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:12,872
I know.

453
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,243
Ju Da.

454
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:19,983
What do you think will happen to us?

455
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:22,882
I like you.

456
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:28,192
Don't be surprised.
But I like Nam Ju too.

457
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:32,648
All he does is
giving me expensive gifts...

458
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:35,362
and declaring to everyone
that he likes me.

459
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,602
But I know that he truly likes me
because he always has...

460
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,402
his eyes on me.

461
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:43,672
Did you...

462
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:45,842
just turn me down?

463
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:49,813
I can't be courageous
because we're in a comic book.

464
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,638
I need the courage...

465
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:53,713
to change the story
in order to like you.

466
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:56,152
But I've been through so much
until now.

467
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,852
If I don't get to enjoy...

468
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,378
this happy ending,
it'll be just too unfair.

469
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:05,122
If you became
aware of yourself a bit earlier,

470
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:08,192
- would it have changed?
- No.

471
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:13,063
You can be happy without me.
But Nam Ju...

472
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:17,327
can't be happy without me.

473
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:22,112
Gosh, am I still number two
next to Nam Ju in the shadow too?

474
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:23,968
I won't lead you on...

475
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:26,382
and ask you to be a friend
while I'm turning you down.

476
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:29,053
If I may make a suggestion
as the guy who got dumped,

477
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,753
I hope we can at least be friends.

478
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:33,553
Do Hwa.

479
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:35,392
Thank you.

480
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,463
You really were my guardian angel.

481
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:42,832
Ju Da.

482
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:48,733
I really liked you a lot...

483
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:51,402
in the stage and in the shadow.

484
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,178
What should we do next?
Kyung, what do you want to do?

485
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:10,592
Whatever you want to do.

486
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:13,563
Gosh, I'm so happy.

487
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:16,993
- What?
- Are you okay?

488
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:19,432
- Should we go home?
- No.

489
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:21,797
I'm saying this as someone
who had a heart condition for long,

490
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,602
and my heart is just racing
out of excitement.

491
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:27,372
It only rings
in front of someone I like,

492
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:31,483
telling you that I like you,
and that I want you to know.

493
00:31:34,537 --> 00:31:36,053
- Should we go eat?
- Yes.

494
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,283
What do you want?

495
00:31:38,878 --> 00:31:40,082
Something really delicious.

496
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:41,422
Tteokbokki?

497
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:47,023
Kyung, put this on.

498
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:52,332
You're so cute.

499
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:16,953
Dan Oh.

500
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:20,162
I'm not in pain.

501
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:40,543
Dan Oh.

502
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:42,912
I'm so glad.

503
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:44,337
For what?

504
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,053
That we reached each other.

505
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:48,553
Thank you.

506
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,592
Everything got better thanks to you,

507
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:54,463
and it'll continue to get better.

508
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,033
I want to thank you too.

509
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,228
You turned me into someone
who's healthy and in love,

510
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:07,003
not a girl who had a crush on you
for 10 years with a heart condition.

511
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:10,372
Thank you so much, Haru.

512
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,513
Haru?

513
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:15,753
What?

514
00:33:18,408 --> 00:33:19,448
Haru.

515
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:22,017
Oh, do you have to go
and practice tennis with him?

516
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:23,122
Right now?

517
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:25,763
It's pretty late.

518
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,763
You don't even remember,
but you still...

519
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:30,263
What?

520
00:33:38,465 --> 00:33:41,340
(Episode 30 will air shortly.)

521
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:43,950
(Episode 30)

522
00:33:57,895 --> 00:33:58,970
Bo Tong!

523
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:03,196
- Who? Bo Tong?
- Yes.

524
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:04,966
He was here until this morning.

525
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:06,036
Maybe he didn't come.

526
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:07,710
- He did.
- Mo Beom.

527
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:08,976
Have you seen Bo Tong?

528
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:11,210
- Call him.
- Fine.

529
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,876
That's odd. Who knows his number?

530
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:15,946
- Me.
- Me.

531
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:17,051
I'll call him.

532
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:18,490
What?

533
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:21,161
- I don't have his number.
- You don't?

534
00:34:21,245 --> 00:34:22,855
I know that I had his number.

535
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:24,455
I stored it in my head.

536
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:25,586
- Write it down.
- Okay.

537
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:27,156
- It's 010...
- 010...

538
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,495
Wait, 018?

539
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:30,595
- 018?
- 018?

540
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:31,841
I don't remember.

541
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,701
- I'm sure he'll come.
- He will.

542
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:36,696
- Should we go to the snack bar?
- Oh, he must be there.

543
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:38,836
- Yes, he is. What do you want?
- Let's go.

544
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:40,366
- Me?
- Strawberry milk.

545
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,581
it's a piece of cake...

546
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,680
to erase us from the scenes.

547
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:46,251
Especially so...

548
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:49,590
for an extra like you
who doesn't play a huge role.

549
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:22,575
Dan Oh. Dan Oh? Wake up.

550
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:23,650
Dan Oh.

551
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,061
Give me one second.

552
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:29,890
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

553
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,721
By the next scene,
you'll be all healed up.

554
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:38,901
Nevertheless, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

555
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:42,200
Back then, you said this to me here.

556
00:36:43,956 --> 00:36:45,871
You wished I could change
your fate.

557
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:48,570
I said that?

558
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:49,871
Yes.

559
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:52,381
Dan Oh.

560
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,580
Please remember me next time.

561
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,920
You gave me my name.

562
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:02,320
It's Haru.

563
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:06,520
- Are you...
- Go.

564
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:09,730
I think my heart is hurting
because of you.

565
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:13,031
Because of you, my heart is starting
to hurt again.

566
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:17,230
I'm sorry, but could you leave?

567
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,270
What was that?

568
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:11,491
(It's exactly the same with Ju Da.)

569
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:31,935
- Are you...
- Go.

570
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,580
I think my heart is hurting
because of you.

571
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:37,780
Because of you, my heart is starting
to hurt again.

572
00:38:55,526 --> 00:38:58,030
The writer is about to
wrap up this world.

573
00:38:58,495 --> 00:39:00,564
He'll get rid of the memories
that haunted you...

574
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:03,871
and the place where you could
see them. Everything.

575
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:56,390
Dan Oh.

576
00:40:00,085 --> 00:40:01,871
- That's not your seat.
- I know.

577
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:04,931
But this is the best spot
to look outside the window.

578
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,900
I'm sure Haru will understand.

579
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:08,710
He's a close friend of yours.

580
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:11,565
Kyung.

581
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:14,710
Apart from being sick
and a student here,

582
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:16,950
what kind of person
do you think I'll become?

583
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,621
I can't wait to find out...

584
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:25,890
the person I'll become
now that I'm all better.

585
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,030
"All better"?

586
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,330
Yes. My heart is no longer hurting.

587
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:37,431
It's a wonderful thing.

588
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:40,900
But at times, I feel...

589
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,311
How do you feel?

590
00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:07,700
(Haru)

591
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:09,700
"Haru".

592
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:11,631
Dan Oh.

593
00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:14,226
Oh, Kyung already left.

594
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,140
I didn't introduce myself properly.

595
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:18,981
My name is Haru.

596
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:24,210
Someone very dear to me
gave me that name.

597
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:28,590
Go home safely.

598
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:33,320
Goodbye, Dan Oh.

599
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:31,604
Oh, my.

600
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:33,575
- Hi, Kyung.
- What were you doing?

601
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:34,780
Nothing.

602
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,751
What do you want to do today?

603
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:38,516
Let's see.

604
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:39,660
Haru.

605
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,131
You've lost weight lately.

606
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:45,185
You're right. I think he's lost
about 3kg.

607
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:46,800
Did Bo Tong not come
to school today either?

608
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:49,270
I'm sure he'll be here.

609
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:51,231
Let's go.

610
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:03,650
That's odd. The doctor said
I was almost completely healed.

611
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:14,690
It has never beeped
this much before.

612
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,160
My heart has never hurt
this much before.

613
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:29,711
What?

614
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:33,981
By the way, do you know
why he's like that?

615
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:41,180
- What do you mean?
- He's always there at night.

616
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:43,591
It's obvious.

617
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,491
He's waiting.

618
00:43:45,685 --> 00:43:46,920
"Waiting"?

619
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:50,260
If you lost your self-awareness,

620
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:53,201
you shouldn't have looked for him.

621
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:56,530
I'm all alone once again.

622
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:04,910
What? It's here.

623
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:07,081
Come here.

624
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:11,550
Look at this. This is still here.

625
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:15,280
(Dan Oh, Kyung)

626
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:16,876
I'm taller.

627
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:19,160
No, I'm taller.

628
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:23,091
See? Come here.

629
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:33,701
I'm this much taller.

630
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:36,796
I'm going to eat more
and become taller than you.

631
00:44:36,796 --> 00:44:39,036
- When?
- When I become 10.

632
00:44:39,036 --> 00:44:40,410
No way.

633
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,215
(Dan Oh)

634
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:51,351
What will you do
if I'm still taller?

635
00:44:52,386 --> 00:44:53,746
I'll grant you a wish.

636
00:44:53,746 --> 00:44:55,760
- Promise?
- Promise.

637
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:02,701
(Dan Oh, Kyung)

638
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:06,065
I didn't grow much.

639
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:08,225
What have you been eating?

640
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:09,410
This is unfair.

641
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:13,280
Oh, but I do have something
that's bigger than yours.

642
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,410
And what is that?

643
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,510
My love for you.

644
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:20,351
Do you love me that much?

645
00:45:20,776 --> 00:45:21,844
Yes.

646
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:24,790
Then let's meet at school
tomorrow night.

647
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:27,491
Tomorrow is our 10-year anniversary.

648
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,060
- What do you mean?
- Don't you remember?

649
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:32,331
We were going to measure
our height after 10 years.

650
00:45:32,556 --> 00:45:33,660
Did we?

651
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:36,270
It's obvious that you're much taller
than me.

652
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:40,400
Dan Oh.

653
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,241
Thank you for always being
by my side...

654
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:46,310
back then and now as well.

655
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:18,770
What's wrong?

656
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:20,581
Both the memories...

657
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:24,650
and you haven't changed.

658
00:46:26,546 --> 00:46:29,290
I desperately wanted everything
to go back to its places.

659
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:32,961
I hoped that
the stage was the reality.

660
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:34,821
"Stage"?

661
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:36,991
But it wasn't the real you on stage.

662
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:42,430
And wishing to keep you by my side
knowing that you weren't yourself...

663
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:47,071
makes me a monster.

664
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:01,321
What's wrong?

665
00:47:01,605 --> 00:47:02,951
Something is wrong with my body.

666
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,646
- What is it?
- I think I'm helping Nam Ju...

667
00:47:05,646 --> 00:47:07,361
and Ju Da get closer.

668
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:08,516
Look what happened earlier.

669
00:47:08,516 --> 00:47:10,556
Why did I push Ju Da
when she did nothing?

670
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:12,056
I'm not that mean, you know.

671
00:47:12,056 --> 00:47:14,626
Thanks to you,
Ju Da felt into Nam Ju's arms.

672
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:15,900
Hey.

673
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:17,355
I thought you gave up.

674
00:47:17,355 --> 00:47:19,225
You said that you were going to bid
him a beautiful farewell.

675
00:47:19,225 --> 00:47:20,501
- Come on.
- Okay.

676
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:23,365
Don't even bring up his name
in front of me.

677
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:25,780
Gosh, my life belongs to me.

678
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:27,365
Come to think of it,

679
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:29,406
I was playing Cupid
between Nam Ju and Ju Da...

680
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:30,981
on multiple occasions.

681
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:34,520
It feels as if someone has
control over my actions.

682
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:38,646
Gosh. I hate living a life
that I have no control over.

683
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:39,985
I've done my share of time for that.

684
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:42,991
When I was young, I was always
at the hospital because I was sick.

685
00:47:44,016 --> 00:47:48,001
I will help you get
your memories back,

686
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:51,900
so you have complete control
over your life.

687
00:47:53,426 --> 00:47:55,266
I'm serious.

688
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:56,335
It wasn't fun at all.

689
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,140
No, it was so much fun.

690
00:47:58,565 --> 00:47:59,940
I'm serious.

691
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:02,851
What's wrong, Dan Oh?

692
00:48:03,235 --> 00:48:05,550
I thought your heart is all better
now. Why did that beep?

693
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:08,546
- Right.
- It must be broken.

694
00:48:08,546 --> 00:48:10,916
Ask Kyung to buy you
an expensive watch...

695
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,091
for the wedding gift.

696
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:14,290
Since we're on the subject,
ask him to buy that tonight.

697
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:15,484
Tonight?

698
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:17,715
What if tonight becomes
a historical moment for them?

699
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,286
Goodness, look at you.

700
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,030
So on a day like this...

701
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:23,756
No, it's nothing like that.

702
00:48:23,756 --> 00:48:26,225
Dan Oh, I'm the expert on dressing
people up for their dates.

703
00:48:26,225 --> 00:48:29,136
What time are you meeting him?
I'll go style you from head to toe.

704
00:48:29,136 --> 00:48:31,865
Hey, you're not going to make her
look like a zombie, right?

705
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:33,310
You know that thing you often do.

706
00:48:35,136 --> 00:48:36,650
- Come over here now.
- No.

707
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:39,680
- You come here.
- Okay.

708
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:10,211
Why is this happening?

709
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:22,386
(I'm almost there. I'm glad
the weather is great today.)

710
00:49:22,386 --> 00:49:25,231
(I'm glad the weather...)

711
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:32,940
(I'm glad the weather is great too.)

712
00:49:47,646 --> 00:49:48,780
I'm on my way.

713
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:07,701
That's odd.

714
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:09,471
Why is this beeping again?

715
00:50:15,565 --> 00:50:17,050
I'm not sick.

716
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:19,420
Why is my heart beating so fast?

717
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,760
I told you, didn't I?

718
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,461
I said I would be taller
10 years later.

719
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:36,731
But let's still measure our height.

720
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:41,796
This feels a bit unfair,

721
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:44,010
but I always keep my promises.

722
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:45,670
I'll grant you a wish.

723
00:51:45,595 --> 00:51:46,670
Dan Oh.

724
00:51:49,436 --> 00:51:51,871
I came here because I wanted
to see you one last time.

725
00:51:54,436 --> 00:51:56,351
It's okay if I get erased
in the comic.

726
00:51:58,276 --> 00:52:00,051
As long as you're happy,

727
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:03,521
even if you don't remember
this moment,

728
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:05,345
- I'll be...
- I'm...

729
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:06,621
a terminally-ill high school girl.

730
00:52:08,216 --> 00:52:10,791
And you were a nameless extra.
Number 13.

731
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,631
Thanks to you, my fate has changed.

732
00:52:15,026 --> 00:52:17,331
And every day of my life
has become special.

733
00:52:24,236 --> 00:52:26,581
You said you would never leave me.

734
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:30,950
You promised me
that you wouldn't leave me alone.

735
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:47,761
Dan Oh.

736
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:50,571
Every moment of my life
is meant for you.

737
00:52:53,665 --> 00:52:55,740
And even in my last scene,

738
00:52:57,936 --> 00:52:59,410
I'll remember you.

739
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,561
("Secret")

740
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,571
(I brought her here from Paris.)

741
00:53:32,095 --> 00:53:33,940
Get out, Do Hwa.

742
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:37,180
"Do Hwa"? That guy in my class?

743
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:40,250
Hello, Dried Squid Fairy.

744
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:43,220
I'm glad.

745
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:45,021
I missed you.

746
00:53:52,885 --> 00:53:54,601
Ta-da.

747
00:53:55,726 --> 00:53:58,470
You want me to eat everything here?

748
00:53:58,895 --> 00:53:59,970
Yes.

749
00:54:00,526 --> 00:54:01,640
Dig in.

750
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:04,041
Right. Here. Try this.

751
00:54:04,196 --> 00:54:05,796
Try this.

752
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:07,736
Here.
Try the stir-fried dried squid too.

753
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:09,281
You said you liked
stir-fried dried squid.

754
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:12,111
Aren't you being too nice to me?

755
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:16,950
I like students who like
stir-fried dried squid.

756
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,500
Since we don't have much time left,

757
00:54:27,286 --> 00:54:29,970
I'll be allowed to spend
a bit of time with you, right?

758
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,670
It's impossible to pretend not to...

759
00:54:36,395 --> 00:54:37,541
know you.

760
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:44,236
- I can get rid of this.
- Get lost.

761
00:54:44,236 --> 00:54:46,145
And the second one is
on how to take selfies.

762
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:48,046
- You need to take the photo first.
- Let me see.

763
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:49,105
I'm on my way.

764
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:51,645
- Hey. stop that.
- This won't work.

765
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:53,686
- I'm serious. Look.
- Look at this.

766
00:54:53,686 --> 00:54:55,345
- Hey, this is it.
- This is fun.

767
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:56,654
Yes!

768
00:54:56,655 --> 00:54:57,915
- This is what I'm talking about.
- It's good.

769
00:54:57,915 --> 00:54:59,825
Look at the light.
Why don't you strike a pose?

770
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:00,900
Great.

771
00:55:00,956 --> 00:55:02,930
- Change it.
- You look pretty.

772
00:55:09,936 --> 00:55:12,511
The stage between Dan Oh and me
will start shortly.

773
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,541
You can go in place of me.

774
00:55:19,946 --> 00:55:21,206
Don't get the wrong idea.

775
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:22,990
I don't want to help you.

776
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:25,551
But Dan Oh probably
would want to see you.

777
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:27,321
No.

778
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,930
I'm doing this
because I hate that darn writer.

779
00:55:31,056 --> 00:55:32,556
I thought you were the only one...

780
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:34,200
who could change the stage.

781
00:55:35,286 --> 00:55:36,670
Try it if you can.

782
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,500
Don't look at me like that.

783
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:43,611
What? You can't do it?

784
00:56:05,855 --> 00:56:07,061
Kyung.

785
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:20,680
Go.

786
00:56:25,776 --> 00:56:26,920
Go.

787
00:56:35,645 --> 00:56:37,061
Back then and even now,

788
00:56:39,016 --> 00:56:40,631
I'm like a monster to you.

789
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:54,281
At least for Eun Dan Oh of "Secret",

790
00:56:55,506 --> 00:56:57,051
you weren't like that.

791
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:01,675
Two any old characters
in a romance comic...

792
00:57:01,675 --> 00:57:04,021
who exist only for
the main characters.

793
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:06,246
You're Baek Kyung of A3,
the wounded and mean guy.

794
00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:09,291
And I'm a terminally ill girl
who had a crush on you.

795
00:57:10,516 --> 00:57:12,216
There are cliches,

796
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:16,271
but we're the only ones who know
how cruel and sad this is.

797
00:57:17,456 --> 00:57:19,801
We're just these characters
that the writer created,

798
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:23,240
but we're just Dan Oh and Kyung
before our characters.

799
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:26,311
Kyung.

800
00:57:27,536 --> 00:57:28,710
That's why...

801
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,881
Dan Oh of "Secret"
wants to thank you.

802
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:39,960
Dan Oh of "Trumpet Creeper"
forgives you.

803
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:44,791
Those are just your characters
created by the writer.

804
00:57:46,355 --> 00:57:47,500
Thank you.

805
00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:52,170
I hope you can become the real you,

806
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:56,240
just like how I could find
the real me.

807
00:58:19,986 --> 00:58:22,031
Did you read the romance comics
in the library?

808
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:24,395
My friend, you're way too slow.

809
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:26,640
If you keep reading those...

810
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,500
Hey, Ju Da.

811
00:58:32,196 --> 00:58:34,240
- Hi.
- Hi, Do Hwa.

812
00:58:34,706 --> 00:58:36,811
- Have a great class.
- You too.

813
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:56,996
What did I tell you?
I told you we have to hurry.

814
00:58:56,996 --> 00:58:59,026
Not everyone can get the new bread.

815
00:58:59,026 --> 00:59:01,841
I told you that it's all about
our speed, didn't I?

816
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:04,940
I'm sorry.

817
00:59:06,905 --> 00:59:08,440
Do you know what to do next time?

818
00:59:08,605 --> 00:59:10,410
Yes, I'll be faster.

819
00:59:12,436 --> 00:59:15,051
I got angry just now,
so give me something to drink.

820
00:59:21,216 --> 00:59:22,286
I don't want you...

821
00:59:22,286 --> 00:59:25,160
to suddenly disappear
in the middle of the story.

822
00:59:25,385 --> 00:59:27,061
We only have a few scenes left.

823
00:59:27,726 --> 00:59:30,230
The writer is about to
wrap up this world.

824
00:59:33,726 --> 00:59:36,271
Goodness. You're so clumsy.

825
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:40,440
You're unbelievably clumsy.
Give me your hand.

826
00:59:41,806 --> 00:59:43,611
Gosh, why did you spill it?

827
00:59:45,036 --> 00:59:46,551
Your jacket is wet too.

828
00:59:48,575 --> 00:59:50,950
What are you doing?
What if someone sees us?

829
00:59:51,815 --> 00:59:53,091
I don't care.

830
00:59:55,115 --> 00:59:56,331
Dan Oh.

831
00:59:58,415 --> 00:59:59,761
I don't mind...

832
01:00:01,825 --> 01:00:02,960
no matter what the price is.

833
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:26,960
I like the art room the most
in our school.

834
01:00:27,046 --> 01:00:28,160
Why?

835
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:30,361
It's where you made
my wish come true.

836
01:00:30,415 --> 01:00:32,361
You showed me stars,
and we were on a date too.

837
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:35,500
Dan Oh.

838
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:38,400
Thank you.

839
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,125
For what?

840
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:42,440
For staying with me
in every single one of my scenes.

841
01:00:45,736 --> 01:00:47,404
Then I want to thank you too.

842
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:51,051
Haru, thank you for helping me
change my character.

843
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:53,206
I was born with a weak heart,

844
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:54,905
had a crush on a guy for 10 years,
and was just an extra.

845
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,776
This absurd character
that the writer created...

846
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:58,775
only for the main characters
changed completely.

847
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:01,490
I'm so glad that it was you
who changed it for me.

848
01:01:01,516 --> 01:01:03,885
If my fate was to live out
the writer's character,

849
01:01:03,885 --> 01:01:06,660
then I decided to have you
be the fate I made.

850
01:01:10,655 --> 01:01:14,240
Haru. Please be with me
on my final page.

851
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:25,250
Ta-da.

852
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:26,881
Ta-da.

853
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:33,920
What was that sound?

854
01:02:36,516 --> 01:02:40,381
(Extra-ordinary You)
