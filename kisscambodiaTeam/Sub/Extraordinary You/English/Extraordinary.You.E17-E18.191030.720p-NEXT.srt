00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,684
(Episode 17)

2
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,025
Can I call you Haru?

3
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,695
Haru.

4
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,495
Haru.

5
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,554
Dan Oh.

6
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,505
If I remained as Eun Dan Oh,

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,774
just an oblivious extra...

8
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,744
inside a romance comic...

9
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,885
Then I would've been
just a nameless Number 13.

10
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,075
This time, I'll change your story.

11
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,225
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,625
I came a bit too late.

13
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,794
Dan Oh.

14
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,165
Look at me.

15
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,774
I'm right here.

16
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,984
I won't go anywhere.

17
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,834
I still don't understand...

18
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,834
why you disappeared
and why you lost your memory.

19
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,245
I'm not really sure either.

20
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,644
But I came back.

21
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,144
Whatever.

22
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,414
You don't even know
how much time has passed.

23
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,250
No one knew who you were.

24
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,550
Someone else was
sitting in your seat.

25
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,425
Your name was gone from the roster.

26
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,235
And although you came back,
you seemed like someone else.

27
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,834
You didn't remember anything
that happened between us.

28
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,505
I'm not going to change my fate.

29
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,615
I thought I would
never see you again, Haru.

30
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,485
It's all my fault.

31
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,854
If you hadn't saved me
out of the swimming pool...

32
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,764
Dan Oh.

33
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,464
Even if I went back to that time,

34
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,375
I would have saved you again
thousands and hundreds of times.

35
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,714
So don't say you're sorry.

36
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,350
Let's go. I'll walk you back.

37
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,825
No, I don't want to go.

38
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,495
What if you don't remember me again?

39
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,104
What if you disappear again?

40
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:03,974
Let's stay together, please.

41
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,344
Let's stay together
until the next stage.

42
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,495
Dan Oh.

43
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,175
Look at me.

44
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,344
I won't let you go.

45
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,524
Never.

46
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,425
I'll never let you go.

47
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,354
It's beautiful here.

48
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,479
("Secret")

49
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,255
- You're really Haru, aren't you?
- Hey.

50
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,990
This is the 10th time you asked him.

51
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,365
And what's my name?

52
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,034
Lee Do Hwa.

53
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,329
Yes, this is it.

54
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,404
You say my name the same way,
but that's how the real Haru sounds.

55
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,704
Where have you been, my friend?

56
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,375
Hey, take this. Have it all.

57
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,670
- What?
- Think about it.

58
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,639
You suddenly took on
a different role from an extra,

59
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,009
then you had to remember
everything again.

60
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,810
It must've been such a toll, my man.

61
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,910
Hey, man. I'll open these for you.

62
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,310
- No way, I will.
- No, I will.

63
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,709
- No way.
- No, I'm doing it.

64
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,825
- No, I want to do it.
- I'll open it for him.

65
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,495
Gosh, you're eating so much.

66
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,195
Drink this.

67
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,724
Have some of this. Have more.

68
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,259
He looks so scrawny.

69
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,365
What?

70
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,565
Haru...

71
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,160
- I'm fine.
- Don't lie.

72
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,675
I know you're not fine.

73
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,569
Thanks to the writer's fickleness,

74
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,644
I could've lost a close friend.

75
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,545
I really can't get used to this.

76
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,810
I think he lost his memory...

77
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,279
because he got a new role.

78
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,154
And he regained his memory...

79
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,110
I'm sure of it.
It was his subconscious.

80
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,649
Deep in your subconscious,

81
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,820
you desperately wanted
to remember her.

82
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,994
Really?

83
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,089
Do you like her?

84
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,634
You should've told me sooner.

85
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,590
Guys! Haru is back! He's back!

86
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,929
Dan Oh, join me.

87
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:48,960
Haru is back!

88
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,204
Guys! Haru is back!

89
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,905
Hurry!

90
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,744
He's back!

91
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,425
Dan Oh, what are you doing?

92
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,690
Is there anything you want to do?

93
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,019
Just say it.
I'll do anything for you.

94
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,634
Do you crave any food?

95
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,159
I want tteok-bokki! Many YouTubers
are eating tteok-bokki these days.

96
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,230
You know that you should order...

97
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,559
extra cheese
and Chinese glass noodles, right?

98
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,075
Of course, I do.

99
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,915
- Is that tasty for you?
- What?

100
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,669
You have no idea.

101
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,815
Tell me the truth.
You've never had tteok-bokki, right?

102
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,309
It's only because I chose not to.

103
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,750
My mom banned me from eating
anything too salty.

104
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,649
You're a good daughter
during times like this.

105
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,019
Say it, and I'll buy it for you.

106
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,250
Hurry, this is your chance.

107
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,789
Tteok-bokki with extra cheese
and Chinese glass noodles.

108
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,665
Shall we all go have tteok-bokki?

109
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,834
What?

110
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,259
- Why?
- It didn't sound like you just now.

111
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,830
What do you mean?
It totally sounded like him.

112
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,299
Let's go before he changes his mind.
Let's go!

113
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,744
All right, let's go.

114
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,275
Writer, not here.

115
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,584
Dan Oh, why are you here?

116
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,779
I have no idea.

117
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,315
Baek Kyung wanted to meet me here.

118
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,285
Baek Kyung? I knew it.

119
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,549
- Hey, Ju Da.
- Hello.

120
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,049
You can leave
after cleaning the place.

121
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:21,450
I just came, though.

122
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,220
We sold all our sandwiches.

123
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,994
- What?
- Someone bought them all.

124
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,330
They bought all of them?

125
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,405
They also paid to use the store.

126
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,440
Why is the writer taking so long?

127
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,754
Excuse me, but we are closed
for the day.

128
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,224
I believe you should open up now.

129
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,994
You see, I bought
all of your sandwiches.

130
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,724
This is it. It's time for some
cheesy, romance storyline.

131
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,659
It's good.

132
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:01,834
- Right?
- Yes.

133
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,535
You can have it.

134
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,675
Attention, everyone.

135
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,169
I've prepared
a belated, welcome-back party...

136
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,139
for Do Hwa's return to A3.

137
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,785
Do Hwa, my woman congratulates you.

138
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,785
- Your woman?
- Yes, my woman.

139
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,149
What's wrong? Have you forgotten?

140
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,120
A3 shines the brightest
when you're all together.

141
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,220
My gosh, this is too childish
for me.

142
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,464
Enjoy.

143
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,334
If you enjoy the food, you won't
gain weight. So enjoy.

144
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,065
Give me a minute.

145
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Ta-da.

146
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,139
This is my special sandwich
just for you.

147
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,110
It's your welcome-back gift.

148
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,214
Thanks.

149
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,850
I believe this is for me.

150
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,649
Why would my woman make this
for you?

151
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,549
You keep saying, "my woman".

152
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,419
Are you two officially a couple?

153
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,419
- Didn't you hear the announcement?
- That's why I'm asking.

154
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,195
Did you forget about our fair
and square competition?

155
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,334
Did Ju Da accept your feelings?

156
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,659
Don't tell me you're doing this
without her consent.

157
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:11,775
That is...

158
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,070
I'll cut it in half.

159
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,675
Friends shouldn't fight, okay?

160
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,494
You humiliated me.

161
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,165
Gosh, you're so childish.

162
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,305
Where are you going?

163
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,559
When did you prepare all this?

164
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,799
Ju Da and I will soon...

165
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,700
I know. You will date soon enough.

166
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,874
The Nam Ju I know will
make her happy for sure.

167
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,185
You know well.

168
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:57,254
That's why I gave her up.

169
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,149
I'm so sick of the stage.

170
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,724
It's so cheesy for me.

171
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,535
Give that to me.

172
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,570
I keep changing
the background photo,

173
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,668
but it keeps coming back.

174
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,974
I like it.

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,285
- What?
- I like the photo.

176
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,484
You always whined
about how you hated it.

177
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,950
Hey, what are you doing?

178
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,925
You begged me to take this photo
for your background photo.

179
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,295
That happened on the stage.

180
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,360
You said you didn't know
whether the Dan Oh in my memory...

181
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,704
was real or fake.

182
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,634
But I wish she was real.

183
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,175
What?

184
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,374
There must be a reason why...

185
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,575
everything's going back
to how it was before.

186
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,614
("Trumpet Creeper")

187
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,954
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

188
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:46,354
Dan Oh?

189
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,765
"Trumpet Creeper".

190
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,185
("Illustrated Wild Flower Book 365")

191
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,395
(Trumpet creeper)

192
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,395
"Trumpet creeper".

193
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,834
(Trumpet creeper)

194
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,325
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

195
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,950
I'm looking for something.

196
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,124
Don't be ridiculous.
You can't remember a thing.

197
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,795
There must be a reason why
this happened to you.

198
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,504
Don't provoke the writer
and live a quiet life as an extra.

199
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,575
No, thanks.

200
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,815
There's someone I want to protect.

201
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,145
Then you should regain
your memory first.

202
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,614
I am.

203
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,945
I see.

204
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,655
Good luck with that.

205
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,730
It was his subconscious.

206
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,900
Deep in your subconscious,

207
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,914
you desperately wanted
to remember her.

208
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,725
Dan Oh, snap out of it, will you?

209
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,735
I wonder what you're thinking of.

210
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,235
What?

211
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,205
Tell me.

212
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,000
About what?

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,140
Don't if you don't want to.

214
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,315
Sae Mi.

215
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,710
What does it mean
when you keep thinking...

216
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,778
of someone in your subconscious?

217
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,384
That means you like them.

218
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,584
Is that so? I like him?

219
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,825
Should I tell you how to tell
if you really like someone or not?

220
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,465
Yes.

221
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,265
Imagine kissing him.

222
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,934
- What?
- Just trust me and do it.

223
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,624
- Gosh. Do you have a death wish?
- Really? That bad?

224
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,755
Come on.

225
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,025
If you can imagine kissing him,
it means you like him.

226
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,465
If you don't even want
to imagine it,

227
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,694
it means you're friends with him.

228
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,990
I see. Yes, I understand.

229
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,400
So did your subconscious
tell you to kiss Baek Kyung?

230
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,529
My goodness, no!

231
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,799
- Come on.
- Come on.

232
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,230
A strong denial means...

233
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,869
A strong affirmation.

234
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,900
That's not true. It really is not!

235
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,985
Move.

236
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,285
"That's not true. It really is not!"

237
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,584
Oh, my.

238
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,225
"Trumpet creeper"?

239
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,295
Where have you been?

240
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,035
I was on the stage just now.

241
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,759
You were?

242
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,500
I think Nam Ju is going
to confess his feelings to Ju Da.

243
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,745
He's ordering the students
to set up an event.

244
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:28,569
Although I know everything,
I pretended to be clueless.

245
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,769
I said a few lines
just how the writer wanted.

246
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,015
Like a guy in a romance comic book.

247
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:35,644
Hey,

248
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,609
you said you read all of romance
comic books in our library, right?

249
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:39,815
Almost.

250
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,924
Then,

251
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,249
have you ever read a book
that seemed similar to ours?

252
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,279
Similar?

253
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,019
Like the characters
and the drawing techniques.

254
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,694
Of course.

255
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,864
Did you...

256
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:52,364
read the book too?

257
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,005
Even the lines are exactly the same.

258
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,799
You know how romance books are.
They are about the same.

259
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,369
There are the heroine, male
protagonist, and deuteragonist.

260
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,545
I'm not talking about Nam Ju here.

261
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,684
Darn it. I thought you actually did.

262
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,854
Shouldn't you get going?
The bell just rang.

263
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:12,755
I'll get going.

264
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,634
Hey, this is going to be fun.

265
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,630
I must have blown so many balloons.

266
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,104
I can't even breathe.

267
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,430
Balloons, seriously?

268
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,245
It's not a birthday party
for an elementary school kid.

269
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,599
I should just finish off Nam Ju!

270
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,674
Do what to me?

271
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,654
We're making sure that
the preparation is going smoothly.

272
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,614
Thank you
for entrusting this to us.

273
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,055
Just trust us.

274
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,094
Hey.

275
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,894
Should we tip Sae Mi off?

276
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,450
Hey, what should we do?
Should we tell her?

277
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,559
No. Let's save it.

278
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,089
It's our last card to play
when time is crucial. Hang in there.

279
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,900
Hey, are we playing a game here?
Hey, Sae Mi!

280
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,235
Hey, stop.

281
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,104
Stop what?

282
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,069
If you do,
you'll end up getting sick.

283
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,269
Gosh. Did you guys cause
trouble again?

284
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,200
No, it's not us. It's Nam Ju.

285
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,285
What did he do?

286
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,114
Nam Ju looks handsome as always.

287
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,349
All right, everyone. Take your seat.
Let's begin our class.

288
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,424
- Okay.
- Okay.

289
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,505
This piece was...

290
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,400
composed by Beethoven.

291
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,970
This variation is in F major,
and the opus number is 34.

292
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,874
Let me tell you how variations work.

293
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,444
They add their own style to
the songs of the past generation...

294
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,114
and come up
with various musical expressions.

295
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,285
They do not limit themselves
to the conventional styles of music.

296
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,825
And by doing so, they are
looking for the joy of music.

297
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,825
This doesn't sound fun, right?

298
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,025
No.

299
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,849
Do you want to play hooky?

300
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:02,924
Play hooky?

301
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,430
- Sir!
- Yes. Do you have a question?

302
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,205
I need to go to the nurse's office.

303
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,475
Dan Oh, are you not well?

304
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,730
- Baek Kyung, where are you?
- He's not here yet.

305
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,400
- Sir.
- Yes.

306
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,515
I can take her to the nurse.

307
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:21,844
You?

308
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,150
My gosh. No way.

309
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,480
- He grabbed her hand.
- Goodness.

310
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,980
Dan Oh is holding his hand.

311
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,279
Where are you going, Dan Oh?

312
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,089
Me? To play hooky!

313
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,495
- What?
- Play hooky?

314
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,119
- Where are they going?
- They are playing hooky!

315
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,390
- Where are you going?
- Wait.

316
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,859
- Where did they go?
- They're playing hooky.

317
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:44,434
- Come back.
- Sit down.

318
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,029
Sae Mi's eyes were about to pop out.

319
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,000
Right. Did you see their faces?

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,715
Sae Mi's eyes went wide when
she heard we were playing hooky.

321
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:59,684
This is nice.

322
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,225
Yes.

323
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,094
I can't believe
I'm playing hooky with you.

324
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,455
This is fun.

325
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,594
Same here.

326
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,565
You really got it back.

327
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,490
Doesn't it hurt?

328
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,475
No, not at all.

329
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,429
I feel relieved
now that I saw your scar.

330
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,114
It feels like you're back
to the Haru that I know.

331
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:31,354
Haru.

332
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,485
Haru.

333
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,225
What?

334
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,725
Just because. I like it.

335
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:41,465
I didn't know that every day
of my life was so precious.

336
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,394
I'm not going
to change anything now.

337
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,705
This is the last time
I will pull a stunt like this.

338
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,735
I will not...

339
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,805
try to have you
during my stage again.

340
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,170
If this is the last time,

341
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,575
should we go farther?

342
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:02,414
Farther? To where?

343
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,380
My gosh, the weather is great.

344
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Right.

345
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,579
There are so many antiques here.

346
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:12,725
Right.

347
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:19,065
Let's go inside here.

348
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:21,164
Sure.

349
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,434
- Let's go.
- Okay.

350
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,614
This store is connected too.

351
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,715
Isn't this your diary?

352
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,715
What?

353
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,025
This is Su Chul's Polaroid.

354
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,018
These tennis balls...

355
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,154
They are Baek Kyung's.

356
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:54,364
Hey, haven't we seen this before?

357
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,334
Yes. At the camp.

358
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,114
It was under the bench.
Why is this here?

359
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,250
I thought this was a new place.

360
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,819
Everything is in the writer's world.

361
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,594
But even the writer...

362
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,795
wouldn't know we're here right now.

363
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,990
When I think about that,

364
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,604
this moment feels very special.

365
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,104
A scene of our own
that the writer would never know.

366
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,715
- This feels like playing hooky.
- Yes.

367
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,745
A special moment.

368
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,354
Hey, you are awful at this game.

369
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,079
- Gosh.
- You're dead again?

370
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,154
Gosh.

371
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,025
I let you win.

372
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,019
Sure. Let's go with that.

373
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,664
Let's play one more round.

374
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:01,589
This is really good.

375
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,164
It's my favorite.

376
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,245
Haru, you should eat this.

377
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,114
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Time is up.

378
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,045
Stick out your tongue.

379
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,624
I'll take a photo and brag about it
to my friends.

380
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,549
Haru, you hold this.

381
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:26,924
Let's take a photo together.

382
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,250
I don't want to.

383
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,849
Come on, don't be shy.

384
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:31,920
This is all part of making memories.

385
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I won't take it.

386
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,864
No, look at the camera.
Right there.

387
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,104
Come on, look at the camera.
This is all about our memories.

388
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,045
In 1, 2, 3.

389
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,045
It's done.

390
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:48,844
(Menu)

391
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,245
(Set as Wallpaper)

392
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,309
I hope the photo
doesn't change this time.

393
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:56,880
Change? What changes?

394
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,255
It keeps changing back
to the photo I took with Baek Kyung.

395
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,124
There isn't a day
when he doesn't show up on my stage.

396
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,565
Now, he's on your stage too.

397
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:10,634
I'm really happy that you have
a role in our comic book.

398
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,874
But you're bound to listen to Baek Kyung
because of your set-up.

399
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,575
I don't care what my set-up is
when it comes to protecting you.

400
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,215
What nonsense are you talking about?
I think I need to protect you now.

401
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,740
Tell me if Baek Kyung bothers you.

402
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,839
I won't let that slide.

403
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,515
What will you do then?

404
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,680
I'll teach him a lesson. You know?

405
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,154
I'll use my fist to do that.
Just like this.

406
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,619
- Like this?
- Yes.

407
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,519
I should give him the clout.
A hard one at that.

408
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,960
Dan Oh, your fist looks so scary.

409
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,490
It really hurts.

410
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,705
- Really?
- Yes, do you want to get one?

411
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,674
Aren't I strong?

412
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,275
Yes, you are.

413
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:54,944
What is it?

414
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,015
My gosh, what a relief.
It's really there.

415
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,910
I keep wanting to check...

416
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,079
if you still have your scar or not,

417
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,154
if you're really Haru or not.

418
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,525
You have to keep your promise.

419
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,565
- My promise?
- Don't ever disappear by yourself.

420
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,745
But how did this scar come back?

421
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,614
There was something weird
in the library.

422
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,450
Wait, is it something
that looks like a black hole?

423
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,955
I've seen that too.

424
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,150
It's okay. I'm sure it's nothing.

425
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,618
It's probably one of those
weird things you see in the shadow,

426
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,194
like how chairs fly
and clocks run backward.

427
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,465
But I'm so glad
that you got this scar back.

428
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,900
I really love this.

429
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,805
It's proof that
you're the real Haru.

430
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,144
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,805
I'm sorry. It just happened.

432
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,985
Let's go.

433
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:49,962
(Episode 18 will air shortly.)

434
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:52,309
(Episode 18)

435
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:29,040
Haru.

436
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:32,909
Haru...

437
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:37,019
Fine, I'll stop fooling around.

438
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,820
Did you think I would really stop?

439
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:42,919
You're completely wet!

440
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:58,670
I'm... I'm sorry.

441
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,179
I'm sorry.
I was just fooling around.

442
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:13,789
I've never felt like this before.

443
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:17,629
I feel like I was born again
thanks to you, Haru.

444
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:26,330
I've never felt like this before.

445
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,670
I feel like I was born again
thanks to you,

446
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,509
Haru.

447
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:08,980
I'll cut my class again next time.

448
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:23,830
There will be a next time, right?

449
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:31,354
- Haru!
- Wait for us.

450
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:33,625
- Let's walk together.
- Hey.

451
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,070
Are you troubled, my friend?

452
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:38,294
It's just...
Have you ever felt like...

453
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:40,805
something new that you've seen is
already familiar?

454
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,104
It's called deja vu.

455
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:44,704
Although something happens
to you for the first time,

456
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:46,475
you have an odd feeling
or see an illusion...

457
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,574
that makes you think you've
already seen it or experienced it.

458
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:50,975
It's French, and it means
"Already seen it."

459
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:53,245
- In English, "Already seen"...
- My gosh.

460
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:55,544
He's saying that it's nothing.
It happens to me too.

461
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:57,555
- No way, it's deja vu.
- No, it's not.

462
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:58,989
My gosh. It is.

463
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:00,730
Hey, Haru.

464
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:06,529
Take my bag to the court.

465
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:09,540
That's your character.
You do to whatever I say.

466
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,894
We'll take it there.

467
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:14,565
Yes, it's on our way,

468
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:15,664
and it's only 500m away.

469
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:17,604
Yes, we're all friends in
the same class. We can do...

470
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:18,749
Is this fun to you?

471
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,290
Take your own bag.

472
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:29,559
Your character always bullies
and hurts people.

473
00:33:31,014 --> 00:33:32,630
Is there a reason behind that?

474
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:36,360
- What?
- You need to fix that.

475
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,670
What's with him?

476
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,179
What's with those arrogant eyes?

477
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:57,420
I knew it was weird.

478
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,489
You said you weren't self-aware,
but you kept getting in my way.

479
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:03,420
You returned to that cheeky jerk.

480
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:09,059
Or did you pretend like you weren't
self-aware to make a fool of me?

481
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:11,970
You must be quite anxious.

482
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:15,069
What?

483
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:21,579
Why?

484
00:34:22,905 --> 00:34:24,280
Are you scared that
I returned to my old self?

485
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,749
That jerk.

486
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:41,929
Hi, Dan Oh.

487
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:44,424
Dan Oh, your fiance is here.

488
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:45,929
My fiance?

489
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:52,910
- You surprised me.
- I hate her.

490
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:55,379
Dan Oh, I hate Ju Da so much.

491
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:57,679
I liked him first.

492
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:00,135
I was always by Nam Ju's side.

493
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:02,445
- Right.
- Why does she lead him on?

494
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:04,414
She already knows
that Nam Ju likes her,

495
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,290
but she just keeps leading him on.

496
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:08,984
I would just give up
if they started dating.

497
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:10,059
What?

498
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:11,684
Aren't they dating?

499
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:14,455
It's driving me insane because
it's just Nam Ju who's doing that.

500
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:16,184
Ju Da didn't give him an answer,

501
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:17,494
but Nam Ju was
made to look like a fool...

502
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:18,624
because he announced her
as his official girlfriend.

503
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:21,095
It's not like
we require an answer for that.

504
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:23,470
Fine, I did bully Ju Da.

505
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:26,369
But Nam Ju ran at me
before I did anything.

506
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:28,480
Does he have a tracker on her?

507
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:30,874
I always end up looking like a jerk.

508
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:33,350
You can't help it, Sae Mi.
You're the villain.

509
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:36,179
Hey.

510
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:37,845
- The villain?
- Yes.

511
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,989
Me?

512
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:42,189
Is there a villain
who gets their spot taken?

513
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:46,429
- Sae Mi.
- I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

514
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:49,360
Sae Mi, wait up!
Why did she leave this behind?

515
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,595
That wasn't necessary.

516
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:54,664
No, you need to tell them
what their role is...

517
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:56,040
for them to understand.

518
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,239
Haru.

519
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:02,679
He seems to remember everything now.

520
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,280
I'm relieved. I was worried.

521
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:07,550
Are you the real Dan Oh right now?

522
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:10,179
Are you happy that he's back?

523
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:12,590
I can't tell the difference.

524
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:15,484
You keep switching back and forth
between the real and the fake you.

525
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:16,785
Of course, I'm real.

526
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:18,914
He disappeared because of me,
but now, he's back.

527
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,129
Is that it?

528
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:22,860
- What?
- Is there nothing more?

529
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:25,970
Dan Oh, is the seat
next to you vacant?

530
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:27,230
Yes.

531
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:35,905
Why are you sitting here?

532
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,265
What's wrong with you?

533
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:40,035
I told you. They need to know
when they're crossing the line.

534
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:41,075
How am I crossing the line?

535
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,145
You're sitting right in front of me.

536
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,150
Think about your role.

537
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:48,189
I don't care...

538
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:50,590
about such things.

539
00:36:51,114 --> 00:36:52,230
You.

540
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:57,030
I'll watch and see
if you say the same thing...

541
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:59,300
during the next stage.

542
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:10,205
I thought he was becoming nicer,

543
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:12,050
but he's back to being rude.

544
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,579
Don't mind him. Let's eat.

545
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:15,720
Okay.

546
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:18,989
Eat up.

547
00:37:19,374 --> 00:37:20,819
- You too.
- Okay.

548
00:37:26,114 --> 00:37:27,230
Are you okay?

549
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:29,960
About what Baek Kyung said earlier...

550
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:33,970
I really do wish this scene
would end so you'd forget.

551
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:35,465
"Scene"?

552
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:38,395
He's rude to me as well,
so do understand.

553
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,494
Look at you,
siding with your fiance.

554
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:43,379
It's not like that. I'm concerned
about you.

555
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:45,079
I know.

556
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,275
No matter how rude he is to me,

557
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,705
my love for Nam Ju
will never falter.

558
00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:50,949
I'm relieved.

559
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:52,790
Lucky you.

560
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:54,614
Why?

561
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:57,420
Your 10-year unrequited love
has finally come true.

562
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,054
I have to learn from you.

563
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:02,285
Compared to your unwavering love,
I'm just a teeny...

564
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:03,360
He's not it.

565
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:05,124
What? What do you mean?

566
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:08,293
The guy I like isn't Baek Kyung.

567
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:09,470
Then?

568
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:11,410
Ha...

569
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:15,879
"Ha"? "Ha"?

570
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:17,550
Haru?

571
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:20,579
Our classmate, Haru?

572
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:22,679
Haru from the tennis team?

573
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:24,750
- Baek Kyung's sidekick?
- Yes.

574
00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:26,890
Dan Oh...

575
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:29,984
I know you won't remember this,
but I thought you should know.

576
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,654
You're my best friend, after all.

577
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:32,890
Dan Oh...

578
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,754
Don't be so touched.

579
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:37,055
This is too ridiculous.

580
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:38,670
How could you like
your fiance's sidekick?

581
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:41,225
- Wait.
- My friend is a cheater.

582
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:43,469
- No, I'm not.
- Dan Oh is a cheater.

583
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:45,640
Sae Mi. Sae Mi.

584
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:47,809
Sae Mi, breathe.

585
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:54,979
Nam Ju and Ju Da?

586
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:57,589
"Seuli High School's
Official Couple"?

587
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:02,915
Oh, my gosh. What is all this?

588
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,554
"Seuli High School's
Official Couple"?

589
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:06,555
"1-day Anniversary?"
That's so cheesy.

590
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,725
So what? Nam Ju is so romantic.

591
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,354
- Hey!
- Why?

592
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm feeling dizzy.

593
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:15,825
Sae Mi, should I teach Ju Da
a lesson?

594
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:17,024
- Grab my hand.
- Okay.

595
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,935
Lucky Ju Da.

596
00:39:18,935 --> 00:39:20,465
Will she become the daughter-in-law
of Serinne?

597
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:23,335
What? "Daughter-in-law"? Come here.

598
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:25,034
- Hey!
- We shouldn't let that happen.

599
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:27,545
There are four candidates
for Serinne's daughter-in-law.

600
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,374
- What?
- Exactly.

601
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:31,215
And she was the last one to show up.

602
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,790
But doesn't she look pretty there?

603
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:38,490
Ju Da, I will destroy you!

604
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,400
I will destroy you!

605
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:46,329
I will!

606
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:56,079
Hey, stop them!

607
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:59,805
Guys, who said Sae Mi
should know about this?

608
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,445
- It wasn't me.
- From what I remember,

609
00:40:01,445 --> 00:40:02,650
it was him.

610
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:04,104
It wasn't me.

611
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:06,545
Whoever it may be,
if Nam Ju finds out,

612
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:08,760
- we're dead meat.
- We're dead meat.

613
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:10,520
Ju Da.

614
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:12,384
Nam Ju was looking for you.

615
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:13,915
He wants you to come
to the science room right away.

616
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,099
He does?

617
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:17,085
Thanks for letting me know.

618
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:18,199
- Go on, now.
- Okay.

619
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,034
It took me days to prepare this.

620
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:30,805
- What should we do?
- Be quiet.

621
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:31,979
Nam Ju!

622
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:36,445
We will put in our best effort
to prepare it all over again.

623
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:39,144
Right. Something this trivial will
only take a few all-nighters.

624
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:40,744
- Right?
- Yes, we can do it.

625
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:41,890
Hey.

626
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:43,959
"Something this trivial"?

627
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:46,815
Wait, that's not what I meant.

628
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:49,284
- I want it done by tomorrow.
- "Tomorrow"?

629
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:51,530
If it isn't done by then,
you better be prepared.

630
00:40:53,195 --> 00:40:54,439
Especially you.

631
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:09,479
Nam Ju?

632
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:15,744
How stupid are you
to be this gullible?

633
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:18,354
Would you go anywhere
if Nam Ju told you to come?

634
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:20,929
Ju Da, do you even have any pride?

635
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:26,024
Sae Mi, you told me earlier
that Nam Ju was looking for me.

636
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:27,530
And why exactly would he?

637
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:28,939
What?

638
00:41:30,425 --> 00:41:33,595
Look at that face. You look naive...

639
00:41:33,595 --> 00:41:35,439
and feign innocence.

640
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:39,280
You purposely kissed him,
didn't you?

641
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:41,319
You're frightening.

642
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:42,874
That's not it.

643
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:45,215
You obviously know
that Nam Ju likes you,

644
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:47,244
yet you play the field with Do Hwa.
It gives me the creeps.

645
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,244
It's admirable how you have
both guys under your thumb,

646
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:50,790
claiming to be just friends.

647
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:54,030
I mean, it's creepy.

648
00:41:54,484 --> 00:41:56,359
Don't you pity Do Hwa?

649
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:58,254
He was almost banished from A3.

650
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,654
We won't stand still.

651
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:01,599
- Guys...
- How dare you?

652
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,069
Ju Da.

653
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:11,209
Does the world seem so rosy
since Nam Ju is good to you?

654
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:14,475
Do you feel like
a Seuli High School student...

655
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:16,179
since you're wearing our uniform?

656
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:19,750
That uniform doesn't suit you.

657
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:25,089
See these shoes you're wearing?

658
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:29,383
These shoes suit you the best.

659
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:30,900
Know your place.

660
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:34,000
Let's go.

661
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:41,939
Ju Da.

662
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:45,809
Take some time in this dark room
and realize where you stand.

663
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:55,189
Open up.

664
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:58,055
Open up. Open this!

665
00:42:58,055 --> 00:42:59,354
Take some time to self-reflect.

666
00:42:59,354 --> 00:43:01,130
We'll see you later.

667
00:43:01,185 --> 00:43:02,329
Let's go.

668
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,030
Didn't you hear something?

669
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,170
I'm not sure.

670
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:46,870
Do Hwa. I have something to say.

671
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:49,179
Don't beat around the bush
and just say it.

672
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:52,004
Like you predicted,
Ju Da didn't give me an answer.

673
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,410
Come to think of it,
I was too selfish.

674
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:57,349
But then again, I wasn't going
to force her to go out with me.

675
00:43:58,045 --> 00:44:00,390
I was going to make a confession.

676
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,984
Then why are you confessing it
to me?

677
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:04,359
I just wanted you to know.

678
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:06,154
I already did.

679
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:08,124
I was going to confess today,

680
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:09,984
- but I postponed it to tomorrow.
- Why?

681
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:12,800
I don't know who did it,
but the auditorium is a mess.

682
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:15,494
I told the boys
to restore everything by tomorrow.

683
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:18,465
Hey! Where's Ju Da right now?
Can you reach her?

684
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:20,565
Not yet. She's not checking my text.

685
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:22,234
She could be in danger.

686
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:23,609
Go on and look for her.

687
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,209
Never mind. Let me.

688
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:28,774
Even if I went, you'd be the one
finding her on stage.

689
00:44:28,774 --> 00:44:30,604
What do you mean
by Ju Da is in danger?

690
00:44:30,604 --> 00:44:32,774
- Explain it to me.
- Romance comics are the same.

691
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:35,715
Who do you think caused that mess
and bullied her?

692
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,244
- What?
- I'm sure they locked her up...

693
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:38,654
in a classroom or something.

694
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:40,555
I have no idea
what you're babbling about.

695
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:42,524
Hurry up and go.
The stage will begin anyway,

696
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:43,825
but make it happen quicker.

697
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:44,969
Darn it.

698
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:51,609
Nam Ju?

699
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,234
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

700
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,234
Do Hwa...

701
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,479
Why couldn't the writer speed up
the scene?

702
00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:03,150
Soon, Nam Ju will be here.

703
00:45:03,975 --> 00:45:05,274
Let's stay together until then.

704
00:45:05,274 --> 00:45:07,349
Let's leave right now. I'm scared.

705
00:45:08,845 --> 00:45:10,790
Even if we leave right now,

706
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:12,429
the next scene will be...

707
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:16,984
I can't believe them.

708
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:19,599
They just won't stop bullying you
over your shoes.

709
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:33,410
I hope you won't remember
what happened.

710
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:35,374
"Remember"?

711
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:38,290
I wish you could only remember
the good things.

712
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:41,420
Nam Ju?

713
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:43,589
Where were you?
I was about to go insane.

714
00:45:46,154 --> 00:45:48,559
- Nam Ju.
- Okay. No one...

715
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,059
No one can bully you ever again.

716
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:53,800
You are...

717
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:56,599
my girlfriend.

718
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:05,449
Are you going home?

719
00:46:09,504 --> 00:46:10,780
Give it back.

720
00:46:10,845 --> 00:46:13,319
You said you only set a photo
you took with me as the wallpaper.

721
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:15,089
What are you doing?

722
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:17,390
Why do you keep trying
to pick a fight with me?

723
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:18,660
Pick a fight?

724
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:22,484
You don't need to do that
in the shadow.

725
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:24,124
I get that we have our parts
to play on our stage,

726
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:25,870
but you bully Sae Mi and Haru.

727
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:29,439
Stop hurting my friends.

728
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:31,709
You said the same thing
that jerk said.

729
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:33,309
What?

730
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:34,910
Bye.

731
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:42,679
Where do you want
to have our wedding?

732
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:46,114
Dan Oh, you're only 18.

733
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:47,890
Stop talking about the wedding.

734
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:49,490
We should follow
what the elders decide.

735
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,559
I want to have an outdoor wedding
on a sunny day.

736
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:54,114
I want to invite my friends.

737
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:56,430
And I have to do it before I die.

738
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:58,099
Hey.

739
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:02,000
Don't say something like that.

740
00:47:02,264 --> 00:47:03,465
It's annoying.

741
00:47:03,465 --> 00:47:05,909
Do you find marrying me
that annoying?

742
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:07,165
You accepted, so I thought...

743
00:47:07,165 --> 00:47:08,740
No, that's not what I meant.

744
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:12,950
Dan Oh, are you all right?

745
00:47:14,574 --> 00:47:15,649
Get on my back.

746
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:23,020
Hospital again?

747
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:29,784
I'm sorry.

748
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:32,369
Why don't you explain to him
what happened in detail?

749
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:34,700
We were going home together...

750
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:38,195
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

751
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:39,270
No.

752
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:43,710
It's not your fault, Baek Kyung.

753
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:52,819
Dan Oh's days are numbered?

754
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,359
According to Ju Hwa,
she might not last a year.

755
00:47:55,685 --> 00:47:57,615
That is why she wanted to rush
marrying Baek Kyung.

756
00:47:57,615 --> 00:47:59,915
I gave it some thought,
and I don't think it's fair to you.

757
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:01,859
And it will be painful
for Baek Kyung too.

758
00:48:03,824 --> 00:48:06,700
Chairman Eun, why don't we
make Dan Oh's wish come true?

759
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,970
Baek Kyung knows that Dan Oh is sick...

760
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:11,935
and that she doesn't have much time.

761
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,639
Baek Kyung already knew?

762
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,809
Yes. Well,

763
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:19,909
I don't think Dan Oh could
have hidden it even if she tried.

764
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:23,079
This marriage isn't just for Dan Oh.

765
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:25,389
Baek Kyung wants it desperately too.

766
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:27,889
It doesn't matter
how much time she has left.

767
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:29,889
Baek Kyung also...

768
00:48:30,814 --> 00:48:33,190
wants to give the best memories...

769
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,000
to Dan Oh.

770
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:51,534
- Why are you here?
- Well...

771
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:53,280
Your dad called us.

772
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:55,619
We heard Dan Oh is very sick.

773
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:58,074
What's so funny?

774
00:48:58,074 --> 00:49:00,649
I just thought
you were so consistent.

775
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:04,490
You're a nasty woman who only
thinks about money on and off stage.

776
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:06,584
Are you worried...

777
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:07,615
that Dad might...

778
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,930
hand me over all of his shares
after I marry Dan Oh?

779
00:49:10,385 --> 00:49:12,300
How dare you come here?

780
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:15,139
My mother died
in this very hospital.

781
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:18,865
If you took my mom's spot,
behave yourself. Don't be greedy.

782
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:22,034
You punk. How dare you run
your mouth like that here?

783
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:24,010
What if Chairman Eun sees you?

784
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:31,250
Are you all right?

785
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:42,030
The three of you...

786
00:49:45,554 --> 00:49:47,530
look happy
given that you're a fake family.

787
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:49,169
You look like a real family.

788
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:51,635
But how come you were
never kind to me and my mom?

789
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:53,294
I told you to watch your mouth.

790
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,680
You're a hypocrite
to take advantage of a dying girl.

791
00:49:56,465 --> 00:49:57,780
- You brat.
- Dad.

792
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:00,480
Jun Hyun.

793
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:04,119
Nothing about this family...

794
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:07,389
seems right.

795
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:11,319
Come back here.

796
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:13,589
Come back here!

797
00:50:13,814 --> 00:50:16,125
Baek Kyung! Baek Kyung!

798
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,784
Baek Kyung.

799
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:20,369
Don't follow me!
You're making me crazy.

800
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:22,099
Baek Kyung, can't...

801
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,794
- Can't we just live like this?
- What?

802
00:50:25,794 --> 00:50:28,280
He's not always violent like that.

803
00:50:29,165 --> 00:50:30,734
Once you marry Dan Oh...

804
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:32,680
What do you know, punk?

805
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:35,520
All you can do is follow your role.

806
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:42,960
Your character always bullies
and hurts people.

807
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:45,314
Is there a reason behind that?

808
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:47,484
I get that we have our parts
to play on our stage,

809
00:50:47,484 --> 00:50:49,200
but you bully Sae Mi and Haru.

810
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:52,869
Stop hurting my friends.

811
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,839
This feels awful.

812
00:50:57,865 --> 00:50:58,940
Baek Kyung.

813
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:02,809
Please don't change anything.

814
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:18,089
Hospital and medicine.

815
00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:21,800
I was better off when I was
the bridge between Nam Ju and Ju Da.

816
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:34,510
Are you all right?

817
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:38,609
Thank you.

818
00:51:38,905 --> 00:51:40,480
My family told me yesterday...

819
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:43,079
that our wedding will be moved up.

820
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:46,419
Do you really want to marry me?

821
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:48,859
- Yes.
- Don't.

822
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:51,690
I'm giving you an out for your sake.

823
00:51:52,514 --> 00:51:54,659
I don't care
if I get married or not.

824
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:56,700
But you'll get hurt.

825
00:51:57,084 --> 00:51:58,425
I'm fine.

826
00:51:58,425 --> 00:51:59,754
You're Baek Kyung.

827
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:01,599
The love of my life.

828
00:52:06,635 --> 00:52:08,304
It looked like you waited
for your stage to be over.

829
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:10,064
There's nothing I can do
of my own accord.

830
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:12,609
I can't talk or move
the way I want to.

831
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:14,680
I know that you hate the stage too.

832
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:16,780
It's Haru.

833
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:21,050
What were you doing?

834
00:52:21,274 --> 00:52:23,359
Nothing.
I was just taking my medication.

835
00:52:29,824 --> 00:52:32,700
Haru has returned.

836
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:36,264
What's happening? Why?

837
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:37,500
How?

838
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:41,409
Did he...

839
00:52:42,064 --> 00:52:44,579
remember everything
including the past?

840
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:49,875
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

841
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,020
Dan Oh?

842
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:56,314
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

843
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:59,159
How is this nothing?
She looks just like Dan Oh.

844
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:01,190
No way.

845
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:03,230
Even Baek Kyung?

846
00:53:06,054 --> 00:53:07,300
Where's that book?

847
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:09,270
- What book?
- "Trumpet Creeper".

848
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:12,040
The book you took from me
the other day.

849
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:14,309
I can't seem to find it
no matter how hard I look.

850
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,980
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

851
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:20,309
This is odd.

852
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:25,050
I keep getting a feeling
that there's something in that book.

853
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:28,589
Once I find that book,

854
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:31,760
you will have to talk to me.

855
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:59,050
("Trumpet Creeper")

856
00:54:15,225 --> 00:54:18,540
At this rate, it will turn out
exactly like the previous book.

857
00:54:21,034 --> 00:54:23,540
What on earth
is the writer thinking?

858
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:33,389
If I wished that you would not
get your memories back,

859
00:54:34,844 --> 00:54:36,115
does it make me a horrible man?

860
00:54:36,115 --> 00:54:38,790
It sounds like there's something
I shouldn't remember.

861
00:54:40,314 --> 00:54:43,700
This flower is in my memories.

862
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,800
I thought it was a dream,

863
00:54:47,425 --> 00:54:48,669
but it wasn't.

864
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:52,540
Will it happen in the future?

865
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,210
Or did it already happen?

866
00:54:57,365 --> 00:55:00,050
That's why I couldn't give you
an answer about your beginning.

867
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:02,220
The secret about your beginning...

868
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:05,250
doesn't exist here.

869
00:55:06,445 --> 00:55:09,990
Is that why I could remember Dan Oh?

870
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:16,829
You said that the trumpet creeper
symbolizes waiting.

871
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:20,500
I think I know
why I kept seeing this flower.

872
00:55:21,594 --> 00:55:23,399
It was telling me
to remember Dan Oh...

873
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:26,909
and to wait until Dan Oh...

874
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:29,780
finds me.

875
00:55:40,615 --> 00:55:43,290
Will it happen in the future?

876
00:55:43,814 --> 00:55:45,290
Or did it already happen?

877
00:55:46,584 --> 00:55:48,290
It happened before,

878
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:50,559
and it'll happen in the future.

879
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:56,099
(Baek Baek Kyung)

880
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,734
(Eun Dan Oh, Haru)

881
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:02,780
You used the same characters
over and over again,

882
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:05,510
and the lines are the same too.

883
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:09,849
It'll be weirder
if they didn't become self-aware.

884
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:14,149
I burnt the book,

885
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:17,419
but there is something
that I just can't stop.

886
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:34,669
If they find out the entire story,

887
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:38,909
we might have to see
that tragedy once again.

888
00:56:42,544 --> 00:56:45,490
I don't mind you bringing me
into many different works,

889
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,520
but you're very cruel.

890
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,790
If you're going to do this,
just make me oblivious again.

891
00:56:56,524 --> 00:56:58,099
(Haru, Baek Baek Kyung)

892
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:04,925
(Haru, Baek Baek Kyung)

893
00:57:04,925 --> 00:57:06,869
Baek Kyung is all fired up today.

894
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,804
He'll only stop
once someone collapses.

895
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:11,764
He always goes crazy
once something ticks him off.

896
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:15,379
- No one can stop him.
- Bo Tong might end up dying.

897
00:57:16,744 --> 00:57:18,790
- Why?
- It's Baek Kyung.

898
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,220
How dare you...

899
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:24,314
open my locker
without my permission,

900
00:57:24,314 --> 00:57:26,829
go around with Dan Oh,
and befriend Do Hwa?

901
00:57:27,254 --> 00:57:28,829
Some might think that you're me.

902
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:31,329
Why is that?

903
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,554
If the writer created this world,

904
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:35,500
why are you the only one
who gets special treatment?

905
00:57:36,024 --> 00:57:37,300
I want to know that too.

906
00:57:38,294 --> 00:57:40,569
Why does the writer
keep putting me with you?

907
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,809
I'll find the answer.

908
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,784
- Go, Baek Kyung!
- Go, Baek Kyung!

909
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:00,685
- You can do it, Haru!
- You can do it, Haru!

910
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,659
Stop it, that's enough.

911
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:22,774
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

912
00:58:22,774 --> 00:58:26,175
Oh, gosh. Did Baek Kyung get hurt?
Oh, no.

913
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,750
He made Baek Kyung fall over.

914
00:58:30,615 --> 00:58:33,990
Haru, I knew it!
You were so awesome.

915
00:58:38,254 --> 00:58:40,855
He lost after making me
look like this?

916
00:58:40,855 --> 00:58:43,625
There was a 99.854 percent chance
that Baek Kyung would win.

917
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,365
It doesn't matter who wins
if two friends are playing.

918
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:46,935
They both showed great manners.

919
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:48,935
- That was great. Give them a hand.
- Yes.

920
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:50,040
One more time.

921
00:58:51,004 --> 00:58:52,205
The game is over.

922
00:58:52,205 --> 00:58:53,950
Don't you dare move another inch.

923
00:58:57,605 --> 00:58:58,889
You can't win against me.

924
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:01,619
- Why not?
- Because you can't!

925
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:03,319
Because that's my character?

926
00:59:05,014 --> 00:59:06,559
Let's play again until I win.

927
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:10,230
Let's go again.

928
00:59:11,024 --> 00:59:12,524
Let's play again! Again!

929
00:59:12,524 --> 00:59:13,829
- My gosh!
- Goodness!

930
00:59:14,794 --> 00:59:17,639
Something bad might happen
at this rate. Someone stop him.

931
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:20,240
- My gosh.
- What are you looking at? What?

932
00:59:25,504 --> 00:59:27,750
Do you think you're something
just because Dan Oh is nice to you?

933
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:32,020
Do I have to remind you again she's
just an extra who has a crush on me?

934
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:36,215
I don't care
what you say or do to me.

935
00:59:36,215 --> 00:59:37,359
But...

936
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:40,930
don't ever hurt Dan Oh in any way
no matter where you are.

937
00:59:42,185 --> 00:59:45,129
I can't stand to see her get hurt,

938
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:47,294
be concerned about you,

939
00:59:47,294 --> 00:59:49,240
or have a tough time because of you.

940
00:59:49,994 --> 00:59:51,794
You're just an extra
who never gets a scene without me.

941
00:59:51,794 --> 00:59:53,240
What can you do?

942
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:55,909
I'll change the story...

943
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:58,309
if I must.

944
00:59:58,405 --> 00:59:59,480
You'll change it?

945
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:01,774
You'll change the story
which has been drawn already?

946
01:00:01,774 --> 01:00:03,250
It hasn't been drawn yet.

947
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:05,919
It's still getting drawn.

948
01:00:06,814 --> 01:00:09,520
The pages that the writer
didn't fill in are still empty.

949
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:13,190
How can you be sure?

950
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,324
How can you be sure if
the writer is still drawing this...

951
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:18,159
or if the writer finished it
already?

952
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:22,524
Stop talking nonsense
and saying you'll change the story.

953
01:00:22,524 --> 01:00:24,665
Just stay out of
Dan Oh and my story.

954
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:25,740
Do you like...

955
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:28,940
Dan Oh?

956
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:33,379
- What?
- Forget about your character.

957
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:35,720
Do you like Dan Oh?

958
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:38,145
Who are you to ask me that?

959
01:00:38,145 --> 01:00:39,389
Because I do.

960
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:42,919
I like Dan Oh.

961
01:01:12,274 --> 01:01:13,389
Hey!

962
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:19,960
Say that again?

963
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:21,715
Please let me go.

964
01:01:21,715 --> 01:01:24,524
You don't know where you came from.
Why are you trying to leave me?

965
01:01:24,524 --> 01:01:25,700
You're right.

966
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,639
I'm a bloke who doesn't even know
where I came from.

967
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:32,440
However,

968
01:01:34,135 --> 01:01:36,109
if there is no answer
to my beginning,

969
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:39,480
then I will create my own answer.

970
01:01:40,675 --> 01:01:42,480
Don't you dare take another step.

971
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:48,020
You cannot leave me
because you aren't supposed to.

972
01:01:48,984 --> 01:01:50,319
That's your fate.

973
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:53,490
That's the reason why you were born
and existed to this day.

974
01:01:57,824 --> 01:01:59,099
I will leave.

975
01:01:59,254 --> 01:02:00,530
Say that again.

976
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:03,569
Say it again! Again!

977
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:11,710
You're in love
with Eun Mu Young's daughter.

978
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:17,950
Eun Dan Oh.

979
01:03:03,554 --> 01:03:05,300
(Extra-ordinary You)

980
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,425
What's the end of this story
that's getting drawn right now?

981
01:03:08,425 --> 01:03:10,665
Dan Oh said exactly
what was in that book.

982
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,264
It doesn't matter
what the former work says.

983
01:03:12,264 --> 01:03:13,435
What do you want?

984
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:14,865
To get back what was taken from me.

985
01:03:14,865 --> 01:03:16,804
For everything
to go back to its place.

986
01:03:16,804 --> 01:03:19,334
You're Baek Kyung's friend,
and I'm his fiancee.

987
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:21,034
I want to change your character.

988
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:23,405
If the stage can be changed,
can the characters change too?

989
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:24,975
I heard Haru can change the stage.

990
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:27,145
Not everyone can do that.

991
01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:28,875
What the writer wants to do is...

992
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,243
bound to happen
in one way or another.

993
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:32,684
Why am I in so much pain?

994
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:34,685
If you don't have
a lot of time left,

995
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,230
what's something
you want to do the most?

996
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:39,225
I wasn't the one who can
change your fate. It was Baek Kyung.

997
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:41,725
You can't do anything
for Dan Oh on the stage.

998
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:44,300
You can't win against me.
You're just an extra.
