1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,034
Haru.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,930
I don't care
what happened in the past.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,774
That story is already over.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,029
Who cares what happened
in the previous work?

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,044
We're here changing our fate
which the writer already decided.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,645
I'm sure of this.

7
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,885
I knew it ever since I met you.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,085
That you'll be able
to change my fate.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,834
Dan Oh...

10
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,544
I'm...

11
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:55,315
going to die?

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,084
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

13
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,354
One second.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,195
I want to stay like this
for a second.

15
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,795
(Episode 25)

16
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,635
I do not want to marry Prince Kyung.

17
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,885
What is it?

18
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,054
You were always a few steps
before me.

19
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,955
But today, you made a weak move.

20
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,364
On the battlefield,

21
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,904
you only have one chance.

22
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,274
In order to kill your opponent,

23
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,105
you only have one opportunity.

24
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,415
You must always stay alert.

25
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,814
Always.

26
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,684
Yes, my lord.

27
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,635
The king's warrior must not have
many wounds on his hands.

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,075
I will hurry my marriage
with Eun Dan Oh.

29
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,244
I will become the king...

30
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,524
through Eun Dan Oh's blood.

31
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,285
You must run away. He will...

32
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,855
put you in danger.

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,395
My lady.

34
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:34,434
If I must change my fate,
then I will.

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,434
I will wait for you
as long as I need to.

36
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,704
I will find my own answers.

37
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,814
Haru.

38
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,145
I want to do it with you.

39
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,114
If there is no answer
to my beginning,

40
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,525
then I will create my own answer.

41
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,525
I dare you to take one more step.

42
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,764
You cannot leave me. You should not.

43
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,165
That is your fate.

44
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:12,165
That is the reason
for your existence!

45
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,735
I will leave.

46
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,105
Say it again.

47
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,105
Say it again!

48
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,514
You are in love
with Eun Mu Young's daughter.

49
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,754
Eun Dan Oh.

50
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,905
My lady.

51
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,025
Will it happen in the future?

52
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,295
Or has it already happened before?

53
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,425
That is why I couldn't give you
an answer regarding your beginning.

54
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,835
Because your beginning...

55
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,465
didn't start here.

56
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,675
"Trumpet Creeper".

57
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,045
Don't tell me...

58
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,285
that the story is repeating itself.

59
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,215
Say no.

60
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,525
No.

61
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,295
My memory...

62
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,760
Everything that I've witnessed
in that world...

63
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,035
They're repeating themselves,
aren't they?

64
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,064
Perhaps, you are desperate...

65
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,835
because you've witnessed
her death already.

66
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,905
You won't be able to save her...

67
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,645
just like how you couldn't
back then.

68
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,614
Just...

69
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,679
let time pass.

70
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,014
How could I?

71
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,064
Haru.

72
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,564
I know a man like you.

73
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,064
He also tried...

74
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,374
to change his role and the story.

75
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,975
Who are you?

76
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,954
Su Hyang.

77
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,925
Su Hyang. No...

78
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,475
No!

79
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,775
When the story changes,

80
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,484
you'll see things
that you don't want to see.

81
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,515
And you'll find yourself
surrendering to the writer.

82
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,584
If you change Dan Oh's stage,

83
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,995
it will change more
than just her fate.

84
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,064
It will also change the fates
of those related.

85
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,064
It will only bring...

86
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,635
misfortunes.

87
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,704
You were never able...

88
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,505
to protect Dan Oh.

89
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,109
It's just a surgery.

90
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,125
You've gone under the knife
many times.

91
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,155
What should I do?

92
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,165
I'm terrified.

93
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,665
Come on, this is only
a part of the story.

94
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,304
It's okay. It's okay, Dan Oh.
It's okay...

95
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,155
Am I already dying? That can't be.

96
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,720
Thank goodness. I thought
I was in the operating room.

97
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,425
Dan Oh, how does
mid-November sound?

98
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,234
What?

99
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,934
I'm talking about your surgery date.

100
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,334
My surgery date?

101
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,329
We'll have to see
what your results say,

102
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,700
but if we need to do it,
let's do it around that time.

103
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,869
No, this can't be. I can't.

104
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,070
Let me talk to your father first.

105
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,580
Until then, don't forget to take
your medication, eat well,

106
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,314
and stay healthy, okay?

107
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,234
I can't believe he talked
about scheduling my surgery.

108
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:46,834
Will my heart stop sooner
than I expected?

109
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,444
But still, my heart kept me alive
for the past 18 years.

110
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,854
Well done.

111
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,554
I'll have to receive surgery, right?

112
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,320
Don't be so weak.

113
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,824
Why isn't this stage ending?

114
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,604
I knew it.

115
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,005
Kyung.

116
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,440
While in the midst of deciding
whether or not to receive surgery,

117
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,868
I'll also have to put up
with his hurtful comments.

118
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,645
The writer is so wicked.

119
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,354
By the way,

120
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,125
I'm sorry...

121
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,554
for making you visit the hospital
once again.

122
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,995
Don't get mad.

123
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,265
When I broke off the engagement,
I wasn't throwing a tantrum.

124
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,204
I...

125
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,334
need to get surgery.

126
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,045
You don't want to hear about this,
right? I'm sorry.

127
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,675
But...

128
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,314
this surgery must be different
from the other surgeries.

129
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,054
Do you know
why I wanted to marry you?

130
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,194
Because I wanted to live.

131
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,495
When I was young,

132
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,064
there were only two things
in my life.

133
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,060
The square-shaped ceiling I saw...

134
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,265
when I lay down on the hospital bed.

135
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,474
And you, Kyung.

136
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,375
That must have been why...

137
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,100
I thought you were my only escape...

138
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,999
and my sick heart would...

139
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,070
all get better if we got married.

140
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,984
That must be
why I kept liking you...

141
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,785
without caring about
how you felt about me.

142
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,125
And I knew that you were having
a hard time with your family too.

143
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,655
- Hey, that's...
- People might think...

144
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,350
that you hurt my feelings.

145
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,594
But in fact...

146
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,665
I'm sorry...

147
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,505
for hurting you.

148
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,474
So we should...

149
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,885
break off...

150
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,824
our engagement.

151
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,265
Take care, Kyung.

152
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,385
Gosh. Why is this so sad?

153
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,580
This weak version of Dan Oh
isn't the real Dan Oh.

154
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,714
Right?

155
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,950
Why do I feel so...

156
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,184
Dan Oh.

157
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,749
Gosh. In all of my scenes so far,

158
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:01,395
I think I had the most lines, right?

159
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,964
Are you really...

160
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:05,734
getting surgery?

161
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,104
Yes.

162
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,300
- When is it?
- I don't know yet.

163
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,474
The writer will decide on it
and let us know soon.

164
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,785
Gosh.

165
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,015
Why do you look so serious?
It doesn't suit you.

166
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,425
It was hard dealing with me, right?

167
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,724
You despise coming to the hospitals.

168
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,395
But...

169
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,194
But just hang in there a bit longer.

170
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,775
I don't think you'll ever have
to come back to the hospital.

171
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,314
I can feel that
I really don't have much time left.

172
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:00,554
You can't help it...

173
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,194
on the stage
since that's your character.

174
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,464
But during my remaining time,

175
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,464
let's try to get along
in the shadow.

176
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,464
You're my friend.

177
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:17,045
The guy Dan Oh from the world
of comics liked for a long time.

178
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,795
You won't even shake my hands?
Goodness.

179
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:46,834
You're so mean! You're the meanest.

180
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,375
Anyway, I'll get going.

181
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,194
Despite my heart problem,

182
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,594
I only had happy memories.

183
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,365
There was a long list of what
I wanted to do once I got healthy.

184
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,029
(Dan Oh's Bucket List)

185
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:58,974
(Going on a trip with Dad,
cooking for Dad, eating sausages...)

186
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,814
(Going to a concert
with Sae Mi and Su Chul)

187
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,895
What does he like, by the way?

188
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,065
We spent such a long time together.

189
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,335
But all I know about him
is his set-up.

190
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,454
My life as an extra...

191
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,125
was just starting to get better.

192
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,399
Whether we're on stage
or in the shadow,

193
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:09,204
let's meet there on October 10.

194
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,974
If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

195
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,714
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

196
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,635
It's no fun, isn't it?

197
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,774
Well, I have a favor to ask you.

198
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,744
Can you hide that for me?

199
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,540
Hide it when it could go back
to its place any minute?

200
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,770
I don't want Haru...

201
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,540
to worry about me
because of my surgery.

202
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,224
Oh, right. Please keep this
a secret from Haru.

203
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:02,425
I want to spend my remaining time
with him and have fun.

204
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,895
Why him...

205
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,524
out of all people?

206
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,734
Because I like him.

207
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,260
Don't you think
an 18-year-old high school girl...

208
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,474
in a romance comic book
ought to have her first love?

209
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,115
My real first love...

210
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,115
that my set-up doesn't hold
sway over.

211
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,454
Haru, hello.

212
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,555
Hi.

213
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,389
Hey. Move out of my way, everyone.

214
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:13,020
Here comes my future wife!

215
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,294
- Here comes his future wife.
- Here comes his future wife.

216
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,560
- "Future wife"?
- You guys look great.

217
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,234
Gosh, what's wrong
with men in our school?

218
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,800
What do you mean?
Kyung started all this.

219
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,175
Goodness!

220
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,629
But how long have they been crazy
in love like that?

221
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:29,244
He proposed to her with a ring
the other day.

222
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,609
"I will declare it
on the honor of Y3."

223
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:31,609
"Y3"?

224
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:33,815
Who would like them?
They are like A3 copycats.

225
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,510
Well, Y3 isn't that bad.

226
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,954
Come on.

227
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,325
The stage between Kyung and me...

228
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,464
became the stage
between Yang Il and Il Jin.

229
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,149
We don't know...

230
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:48,365
what else will change
when one thing changes.

231
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:50,534
But I'm still glad...

232
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,434
that things are going
the way you wanted.

233
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,974
The way I wanted?

234
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,615
All right, return to your seats.
The class will begin soon.

235
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,240
- Okay.
- Have a great class.

236
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,369
She's starting class!

237
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:06,540
- You too, Dan Oh.
- Okay.

238
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,855
She'll start now.

239
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,555
Dan Oh.

240
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,919
Did you take your medication?

241
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,494
I can manage on my own...

242
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:23,734
Can you please keep this
as a secret from Haru?

243
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,105
What?

244
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,875
I think I started to have feelings
for Dan Oh.

245
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,984
Of course, you do.
She's your fiancee.

246
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:43,810
I was always annoyed
whenever I saw her.

247
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,454
I couldn't take how my father,

248
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:47,820
who would do anything for money,

249
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,024
uses a girl who might die at
any moment to get investments.

250
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,395
But I think
I liked her from the start.

251
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,635
I just got rebellious
and was mean to that sick girl.

252
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,929
What am I saying to you?

253
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,004
Hey.

254
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,575
We're friends.
That's why you can tell me that.

255
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,425
I'm sorry that things are like this
even after you changed the stage.

256
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,994
Do you get it now?

257
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:26,294
Dan Oh and I share many stories
that you have no idea about.

258
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,335
Even now, there's a side of her
that you don't know.

259
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,805
But I know everything.

260
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,075
I'm always a part of Dan Oh's story.

261
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,724
Haru, why do you look so serious?

262
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:01,964
If you become ill
or something happens to you...

263
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:04,034
in a scene that I'm not in...

264
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,335
I think my heart is more in pain
because of that long face you make.

265
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,605
Okay, repeat after me. Smile.

266
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You have to smile at me like this
whenever you see me,

267
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,184
okay?

268
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,155
Try it again.
Let me check if you can do it well.

269
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,925
Smile.

270
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:27,595
See? It's great to see you smile.

271
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:30,794
Your turn.

272
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,234
I'm good at it. Smile.

273
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,034
You're cute.

274
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,605
Smile.

275
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,875
That's a huge smile.

276
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,744
In English, a big smile.

277
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,694
Found it.

278
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,060
Gosh, it's like a treasure hunt.

279
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,590
Let me see it too.
You can't be the only one.

280
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,659
One second. Do Hwa. Hey, Do Hwa.
I really can't show you this.

281
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:13,389
Hey. Hey, I'll get in trouble.

282
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:16,075
Come on, let me read it.
If you can do it, why can't...

283
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,905
I knew it.

284
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,840
I told you to hide it for good,

285
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,939
but if Do Hwa can find it,

286
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,240
that means just about anyone
can find that if they want.

287
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,810
Dan Oh, I hid it the best I could,

288
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,480
but Do Hwa is just too good.

289
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,139
It's as if he smelled it to find it.

290
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:32,754
My childhood dream was to become
Do Hwa the great detective.

291
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,194
- How can you hide it up there?
- I mean...

292
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,889
- Dan Oh, you're...
- Yes.

293
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,159
I don't know
if I'll get the surgery,

294
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,835
- and I don't have a date yet.
- Right.

295
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,330
That's why you hid it.

296
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,530
Forget it.

297
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,399
If any of you bring up
the surgery to Haru, I'll kill you.

298
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,629
Oh, you're worried that
he'll be worried. Okay.

299
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:54,645
Don't tell Haru, all right?

300
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,964
Smile.

301
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,204
Smile. Smile?

302
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:22,859
Smile.

303
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,500
- Is he Snow White?
- Looking handsome.

304
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,704
- You shine brightly.
- Seriously.

305
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:28,774
Isn't that Sae Mi's mirror?

306
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,115
- What is he doing?
- He's good looking.

307
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,934
It's as if our backs have
magnets on them.

308
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:29,129
Exactly.

309
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:30,575
What were you up to?

310
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:34,800
- Thinking about you.
- What's with that line?

311
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,175
You sound like Nam Ju.

312
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,540
What were you up to?

313
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,014
Thinking about you too.

314
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,810
What's with that line?
You sound like Ju Da.

315
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,925
In this world, Nam Ju and Ju Da are
the main characters,

316
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,895
and we're just extras.

317
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:51,524
But in Eun Dan Oh's world,
you're the male lead.

318
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:58,805
Before, it was hard to see you
unless I go around looking for you.

319
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:01,835
But I'm so happy that
I can meet you without doing that.

320
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,305
I like you a lot.

321
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:08,474
Me too.

322
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,714
What has gotten into him?

323
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,024
What's going on with this story?

324
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,794
Why is your hand so cold?

325
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,719
You don't have to mind me.

326
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,595
I promised Chairman Eun...

327
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,165
that I'll protect you.

328
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,895
Why are you doing this to me?

329
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,464
I'm going to admit it.

330
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,905
Admit what?

331
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:35,204
My feelings.

332
00:28:36,629 --> 00:28:38,744
It's true that I stayed by your side
because of President Baek.

333
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,575
But not now.

334
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:42,774
I want to stay by your side.

335
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,784
I admit that...

336
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,585
I like you.

337
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,555
Let go. The stage is over.

338
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,494
Why are you so shocked?

339
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,590
You're the one
who held my hand at the restaurant.

340
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,159
Hey, that was on the stage.

341
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,034
I'm your fiance, even in the shadow.

342
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,544
This can...

343
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,645
never change.

344
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:18,744
And I now admit that I like you.

345
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,425
This isn't the stage right now.

346
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,625
Hey!

347
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,919
- Why?
- You...

348
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,264
I like Dan Oh.

349
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,905
And it's not my character.
I mean it.

350
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,464
Oh, and you know that...

351
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,534
she's my fiancee, don't you?

352
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,805
The writer wants to put an end
to Dan Oh's one-sided love too.

353
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:47,105
Things are going
according to the plan for us.

354
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,575
What do you think
will happen to you?

355
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,115
One thing I'm sure of is...

356
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:54,514
that you won't end up with Dan Oh.

357
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,585
As I said, you're just an extra.

358
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,264
That has nothing to do
in the time that Dan Oh and I spend.

359
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,794
Oh, is that so?

360
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,034
What can you do for her?

361
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,434
Oh, changing things? But how?

362
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,105
You have no idea how the story
will unfold from now on.

363
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,615
And Dan Oh needs someone...

364
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,484
who already knows the story.

365
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:38,387
(Episode 26 will air shortly.)

366
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:40,820
(Episode 26)

367
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:52,670
Excuse me.

368
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,279
Could you give me a hand?

369
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,479
My real first love...

370
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:07,479
that my set-up doesn't hold
sway over.

371
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:09,389
First love?

372
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:14,660
Thank you.

373
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:17,314
I heard you only give out food
when dried squid is on the menu.

374
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:18,655
Is that why
you're the Dried Squid Fairy?

375
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,130
I heard it from the other kids.

376
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:22,100
That's hilarious.

377
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,525
I love dried squid too.

378
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:26,469
Then I'll give you extra.

379
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,100
Thank you.

380
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:30,865
Su Hyang, did you take off
all the posters?

381
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,365
Yes, it's all done.

382
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,805
I'll get going.

383
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,634
See you again, Dried Squid Fairy.

384
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:36,709
Sure.

385
00:31:45,785 --> 00:31:47,490
This is just too harsh.

386
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,890
I'm a bit grateful for the writer...

387
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:53,300
that she's not self-aware.

388
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:03,610
Goodness.

389
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:08,679
- Girls.
- Yes?

390
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:09,874
Nam Ju is looking for you.

391
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:11,574
- Nam Ju is looking for me?
- Yes.

392
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:12,904
Nam Ju!

393
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:14,619
- Nam Ju!
- Hey!

394
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:17,344
What? I don't think he's here.

395
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:19,445
Ju Da, are you sure
he called us here?

396
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:21,660
- He's not here!
- Darn it.

397
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:23,630
Sae Mi.

398
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:26,959
Why am I always smiling,

399
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,994
energetic, and kind to everyone...

400
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,600
even when you bully me?

401
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,165
- What are you saying?
- Whatever.

402
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:35,025
It's probably because
I'm the main character.

403
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:36,169
The main character?

404
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:43,610
How do you feel?

405
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,080
Isn't it scary?

406
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:48,479
Isn't it awful?

407
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,914
Sae Mi, do you remember?

408
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,389
You told me that Cinderella
married Prince Charming...

409
00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:56,859
because she was of the nobility.

410
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,660
- So what?
- You're wrong.

411
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:03,269
Even if she was a beggar,
she would've married him.

412
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:05,329
Because she's the main character.

413
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:10,039
- Hey, Ju Da.
- You.

414
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:11,635
- Hey.
- What? Hey!

415
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:13,004
Hey!

416
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:14,164
- Hey!
- Open the door!

417
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:15,710
- Open it!
- You!

418
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:20,419
Girls, learn your place in there
before you come out.

419
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:22,374
- Hey, open the door!
- You!

420
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:23,444
It's scary in here!

421
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:25,319
I'm more scared of you!

422
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:29,130
- Hey!
- Ju Da, this is scary!

423
00:33:43,365 --> 00:33:44,639
Do you want to
listen to it together?

424
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,109
Sure.

425
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,485
Do you like this song?

426
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:00,514
Yes.

427
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:03,229
But I like the version
you play better.

428
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:11,329
Ju Da.

429
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:14,569
Why do you keep making me hopeful?

430
00:34:15,124 --> 00:34:16,410
What do you mean?

431
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:19,135
Why do you keep making me hope...

432
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:20,710
that you might like me?

433
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:23,949
Gosh, forget it.
You won't remember this anyway.

434
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:28,350
Can you be hopeful?

435
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:31,889
Please be hopeful.

436
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:36,530
I'll try to change myself too.

437
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:48,100
Here. Do you want to read it?

438
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:49,410
No way.

439
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:52,979
Goodness, Nam Ju.
You're cool. I give you that.

440
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:57,534
You know you've been chanting
that Nam Ju is cool, don't you?

441
00:34:57,534 --> 00:35:00,344
Gosh, you totally sound
like a member of A3.

442
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:02,104
I don't feel as miserable...

443
00:35:02,104 --> 00:35:04,044
to play the supporting character
than before.

444
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:07,059
But it feels weird
whenever I look at Ju Da.

445
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:09,689
- Why? What?
- It's inexpressible in words...

446
00:35:10,015 --> 00:35:11,354
No, it's this thing.

447
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,284
Kyung is even weirder.

448
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:15,900
- Why?
- It's inexpressible in words...

449
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:17,695
No, it's this thing.

450
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,869
Gosh, I feel you.

451
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,669
Gosh.

452
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:28,135
Nam Ju and Ju Da are finally dating.

453
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:29,635
Let me see. What does it say?

454
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:31,404
Did he officially declare
that they're dating as of today?

455
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:33,604
Don't you think
the story is completely absurd?

456
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,645
The lines are horrible. The story
isn't persuasive. What is this?

457
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:36,914
Tell me about it.

458
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:39,075
My surgery and marriage are
all over the place too.

459
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:41,284
I mean, how can
high school students get married?

460
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:42,654
Who would read
a comic book like this?

461
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:43,654
Writer, quit writing this!

462
00:35:43,654 --> 00:35:44,854
- Quit!
- Quit!

463
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:45,924
- Cross!
- Cross!

464
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,100
- Quit!
- Quit!

465
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:50,629
Ta-da.

466
00:35:53,364 --> 00:35:55,340
I brought her here from Paris.

467
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:58,410
I thought of you
as soon as I saw it.

468
00:35:58,435 --> 00:35:59,710
She's so pretty.

469
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:03,010
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

470
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:04,733
I have something to say to you.

471
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:05,809
What is it?

472
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:09,020
It took me a long time
for me to tell you this.

473
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:10,650
Go out...

474
00:36:12,114 --> 00:36:13,189
with me.

475
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:14,520
What?

476
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:17,189
Well, should we start dating...

477
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:19,929
as of today?

478
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:22,970
Gosh.

479
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,464
This is 1,150 euros.

480
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:37,510
That's about 1,500 dollars.

481
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:40,619
That's very much like you.

482
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,914
- What?
- I said thanks.

483
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:45,720
Oh, okay.

484
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:51,414
It seems like there isn't
a lot of thought put into this,

485
00:36:51,414 --> 00:36:52,955
but I keep reading it anyway.

486
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:55,760
This is why soap operas do well.

487
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,224
The first day of their relationship?

488
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:01,525
Hey, you always have
that book with you.

489
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:04,010
I just checked it to see
if it changed well.

490
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,505
Hey, shouldn't you thank me?

491
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:09,005
I saved you from embarrassment
by changing that stage.

492
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:10,974
Well, strictly speaking,
it was Haru.

493
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:13,150
But I helped out a little bit too.

494
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:15,705
I mean, you aren't a type
who can say such a cheesy line.

495
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:17,414
Gosh, it's horrible.

496
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:19,720
That's why I saved you, man.

497
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:21,260
Hey, this is...

498
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:23,260
my stage...

499
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:25,129
and my scene.

500
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:26,854
What right do you people have...

501
00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:28,554
to change the stage
no matter what I do there?

502
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:29,895
I was trying to help you...

503
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:31,799
Do you think
you can also change everything...

504
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:34,364
after you started
hanging out with Haru?

505
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:36,094
Hey, that's a bit harsh.

506
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:37,710
Don't be delusional.

507
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:40,840
It's really annoying.

508
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,350
You have no idea how the story
will unfold from now on.

509
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,789
And Dan Oh needs someone
who already knows the story.

510
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:01,929
Haru, Kyung is
way too sharp-tongued.

511
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,799
Haru, you have
always been so nice to me.

512
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:14,739
I can see why
Dan Oh likes you more than him.

513
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:19,520
You're good looking, nice,

514
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,580
and you can change the stage too.

515
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,249
Hey, Jun Hyun.

516
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:26,989
Change? Change what?

517
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:30,085
Your brother almost said something
really cute...

518
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,784
with A3's honor,

519
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:34,585
but Haru and I stopped him...

520
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:36,470
by changing the stage.

521
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:38,854
This is getting really interesting.

522
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:41,270
It's really sad
because you won't remember.

523
00:38:41,765 --> 00:38:43,895
Haru, it's you and me, partner.

524
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:46,304
I asked Su Hyang for the USB...

525
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:47,679
and you did as I told you.

526
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:51,379
Excuse me.

527
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:55,650
Hello, I'm Baek Jun Hyun,
Kyung's younger brother.

528
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:58,549
- Yes.
- Aren't you new in the tennis team?

529
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:00,520
I've seen you often with my brother.

530
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:04,189
Just leave him alone.

531
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,830
That'll be better...

532
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:09,429
for you and everyone else.

533
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:14,170
Please get along with him
without getting into fights.

534
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:15,840
I ask of you.

535
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:17,609
What are you doing here?

536
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:19,680
Kyung.

537
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,810
You really are awfully annoying.

538
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,379
How much more
will you meddle with this?

539
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:39,830
There is nothing more...

540
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:42,225
than an official announcement
that can capture a woman's heart.

541
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,225
- An official announcement.
- Right.

542
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:46,424
- No, women hate that.
- You're right.

543
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:47,424
I think it sounds great.

544
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,895
Announcing your feelings
in front of all of these strangers.

545
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:52,670
That's only possible because he's
truly in love and is determined.

546
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,365
- You're great.
- Great, my foot.

547
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:55,765
Everyone, listen up.

548
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:58,275
I hate getting asked out in public.
Okay?

549
00:39:58,275 --> 00:39:59,275
- Okay.
- Okay.

550
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:01,804
We only accept them
when we also have feelings for them.

551
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:04,574
If you do as he says,
you will stay single forever.

552
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:05,920
- What?
- Quiet!

553
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:07,960
Just trust me.

554
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,460
You're all wrong.

555
00:40:10,385 --> 00:40:12,229
- What?
- Yang Il.

556
00:40:12,355 --> 00:40:15,385
You should be thankful to me
and Haru.

557
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:16,395
What?

558
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:18,125
Because we changed
the stage into an awesome one.

559
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,229
What?

560
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:21,194
Guys, he said steak.

561
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:22,735
- I see.
- You're amazing.

562
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:26,635
Kyung and Dan Oh's stage
was handed over to you.

563
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,235
You're their replacements.

564
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,875
- Replacements?
- Replacements?

565
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,479
Right, it's not easy to do either.

566
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:35,404
Who is that guy, Haru? Who is he?

567
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:38,074
You already know.
Someone who can bring change.

568
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:39,885
So you like anyone
who can change the stage?

569
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:40,944
It started that way at first.

570
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:43,489
When I was with Haru,
the stage changed.

571
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:46,629
Can you please keep this
as a secret from Haru?

572
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:48,859
Do Hwa.

573
00:40:49,595 --> 00:40:50,729
Be quiet.

574
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:53,170
What do you mean? He's sharing
a valuable tip.

575
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:55,070
Get out of the way.

576
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:57,694
Kyung, do you want to join in?

577
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:59,465
Oh, right. You don't need to.

578
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:01,465
You don't need to do anything...

579
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,704
for the girls to be swayed.

580
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:04,875
You're so cute!

581
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,220
- Tell us the tip.
- Yes, tell us.

582
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,044
I'll buy you a steak.

583
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:11,149
- Get out.
- No.

584
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,519
Dan Oh and I share many stories
that you have no idea about.

585
00:41:14,715 --> 00:41:16,159
Even now,

586
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:18,489
there's a side of her
that you don't know.

587
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:20,800
But I know everything.

588
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:23,800
I'm always a part of Dan Oh's story.

589
00:41:30,664 --> 00:41:32,470
You changed the stage as you wished.

590
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,609
But guess what?

591
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:41,649
Thanks to you,
she'll be receiving surgery.

592
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:43,544
Surgery?

593
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,720
Dan Oh and Do Hwa were oblivious,
and you took advantage of them.

594
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:50,159
But then again,

595
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,255
Do Hwa had a trivial role
and was in one-sided love,

596
00:41:52,255 --> 00:41:53,899
and Dan Oh had a heart illness.

597
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:56,930
I would've been tempted had you
said you'd change my fate too.

598
00:41:58,395 --> 00:41:59,639
Did you have fun?

599
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:03,639
You'll no longer be able to change
anything since I found out...

600
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:06,810
how you changed the stage
as a mere extra.

601
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,749
I wonder how you changed it.

602
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,649
Was it through the storyboard
that Dan Oh read?

603
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:15,320
Or was it through that book?

604
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:18,590
"Trumpet Creeper"?

605
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:30,629
You're finally home.

606
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:33,639
What? Why are you here?

607
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:35,399
You're all that I have now.

608
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:38,639
My family and friends are all fake.

609
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,940
Everyone's fake to me.

610
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:44,680
Everyone whom I've cherished
left me.

611
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:48,019
I had hoped you'd never leave me.

612
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,375
That's why I didn't want
to like you.

613
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm sorry, but don't do this.

614
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:55,544
Then you shouldn't have liked me
from the beginning.

615
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:57,684
You know very well
that it wasn't intentional.

616
00:42:57,684 --> 00:42:59,090
Are you bringing up your set-up
once again?

617
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:02,355
- Don't use such excuses.
- Excuses?

618
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:04,025
Are you telling me that the stage
is fake, the shadow is real,

619
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,729
and that you cannot control
your set-up?

620
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:08,725
How do you differentiate
what's real and fake...

621
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:10,034
when this is real to me?

622
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,635
I'd still be in love with you
had I not been aware of myself.

623
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:15,365
But as you know,
I can no longer do that.

624
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:18,050
Then you shouldn't have made me
like you!

625
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,420
You said the shadow was real.

626
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:24,674
Then that means my feelings
for you are genuine.

627
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:26,659
- Kyung, but I...
- I don't care...

628
00:43:27,414 --> 00:43:28,615
about how you feel.

629
00:43:28,615 --> 00:43:31,184
I don't know how Haru is going
to change your fate,

630
00:43:31,184 --> 00:43:32,590
but I can do it as well.

631
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:34,855
- What?
- I'll change your fate...

632
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:36,670
so that you won't have to die.

633
00:43:37,924 --> 00:43:39,570
I can change the story too.

634
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:42,440
Just watch and see.

635
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,009
You'll come to me
whether it's real or not.

636
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:49,009
Try to convince me
that my feelings are fake.

637
00:44:01,284 --> 00:44:02,615
But guess what?

638
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:05,330
Thanks to you,
she'll be receiving surgery.

639
00:44:07,985 --> 00:44:09,800
Perhaps, you are desperate...

640
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:12,470
because you've witnessed
her death already.

641
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:14,470
You won't be able to save her...

642
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,210
just like how you couldn't
back then.

643
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:22,580
If the stories are similar,

644
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:25,409
that means Dan Oh is in danger.

645
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:34,359
You were never able
to protect Dan Oh.

646
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:36,529
Haru.

647
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,759
Dan Oh, are you getting surgery
for your heart?

648
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:42,200
How are you?

649
00:44:42,284 --> 00:44:43,930
Kyung, that punk.

650
00:44:44,654 --> 00:44:46,540
No, I'm very healthy.

651
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:48,595
The date hasn't been scheduled.

652
00:44:48,595 --> 00:44:49,909
Haven't you read about it?

653
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,265
Really?

654
00:44:51,265 --> 00:44:54,379
Of course. I'm totally healthy.
I have a normal heart rate now.

655
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:00,350
I'm relieved.

656
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:09,190
But when you surprise me like this,
my heart beats faster.

657
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:11,460
I'm sorry.

658
00:45:12,855 --> 00:45:14,029
Let's go.

659
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,034
Look at these shoes.

660
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:26,034
Do you think
these are the artist's...

661
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:30,109
or someone else's?

662
00:45:31,034 --> 00:45:32,779
I think it's the artist's.

663
00:45:33,174 --> 00:45:36,320
Had the artist not drawn the shoes,
there wouldn't have been a painting.

664
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:40,820
What do you mean? The shoes
are real, but the painting isn't.

665
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:43,054
The painting is the real one.

666
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:46,290
What we're looking at right now
is the painting, not the shoes.

667
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:48,054
You're boring me.

668
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:50,654
See? A masterpiece like this one...

669
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:54,564
goes beyond the shoes themselves.

670
00:45:54,564 --> 00:45:57,340
It makes you contemplate
about existence.

671
00:45:57,694 --> 00:46:00,865
Today, you will draw things...

672
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:03,174
that can be interpreted
in various ways.

673
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:06,080
Draw your own masterpiece.

674
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:07,145
- Okay.
- Okay.

675
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:09,544
- I want to draw Kyung.
- Me too.

676
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:12,550
- Gosh. I want this one.
- Fine.

677
00:46:14,215 --> 00:46:15,420
Give me that too.

678
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:17,389
Are you okay?

679
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:21,029
Yes. I'm fine. I really am.

680
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:23,029
All right.

681
00:46:26,154 --> 00:46:28,124
- What's going on?
- What do I draw with?

682
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,324
I don't want you to get hurt.

683
00:46:29,324 --> 00:46:30,639
Then what should I draw with?

684
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:39,810
Are you okay?

685
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:41,019
Yes.

686
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:45,820
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

687
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:49,659
I'm sorry, Dan Oh.

688
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:51,584
- You must've been surprised.
- No, I'm fine.

689
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:53,600
- Should I protect you as well?
- No, it's okay.

690
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:58,924
I'm really fine.

691
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:01,399
- Are you?
- Yes. I am.

692
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:11,574
Look at them.

693
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:13,505
- My goodness.
- I'm fine.

694
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:14,680
I'm not.

695
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:16,515
You've become bolder
since they won't remember this.

696
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:18,314
You've become so touchy.

697
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:20,385
I heard there's no going back
on bases.

698
00:47:20,385 --> 00:47:22,019
If you're already
hugging each other,

699
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:24,414
- have you kissed already as well?
- Let's go.

700
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:25,855
Move aside.

701
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:28,460
- Hey!
- Who is it?

702
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,924
- It's Haru.
- Hi.

703
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:31,269
Watch where you're going.

704
00:47:31,495 --> 00:47:33,070
Fine, we will.

705
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:34,365
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

706
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:36,025
- We should've been more careful.
- Are you okay?

707
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,409
Are you hurt?

708
00:47:37,995 --> 00:47:39,294
What's wrong with him?

709
00:47:39,294 --> 00:47:40,334
I don't know.

710
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,810
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

711
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:47,480
Don't they suit me?

712
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:49,619
They're so comfortable.

713
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:53,144
- Really?
- They don't feel new.

714
00:47:53,144 --> 00:47:55,689
They're so comfortable as if
I've been wearing them for a while.

715
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,760
Just like you.

716
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:01,629
I'm going to wear these
every time we meet.

717
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:02,830
Ju Da.

718
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:04,425
Don't tell me...

719
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:08,070
"Take your time to think
about how you feel right now."

720
00:48:08,324 --> 00:48:11,270
Take your time to think
about how you feel right now.

721
00:48:12,364 --> 00:48:13,540
Ju Da.

722
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:16,040
Please remember...

723
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:18,804
this moment.

724
00:48:18,804 --> 00:48:21,619
"Please remember this moment."

725
00:48:23,374 --> 00:48:25,820
- Are you...
- You asked me to remember.

726
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:28,790
And I asked you to anticipate.

727
00:48:31,354 --> 00:48:33,600
I was suddenly curious.

728
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:37,500
"Why am I bullied
with no apparent reason?"

729
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,570
"And why do I feel like
it's natural?"

730
00:48:41,124 --> 00:48:44,340
When those natural moments
started to feel unfamiliar,

731
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:47,780
I remembered your voice.

732
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:51,850
"Take your time to think
about how you feel right now."

733
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:54,874
Even though others
couldn't remember...

734
00:48:54,874 --> 00:48:56,379
what they said to me...

735
00:48:57,844 --> 00:49:00,520
and there were gaps in my memory,

736
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:02,560
I wasn't afraid.

737
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:07,300
Because you started to fill
those gaps.

738
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:11,894
I'm truly exhilarated but...

739
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:13,639
Please keep it a secret.

740
00:49:15,225 --> 00:49:18,969
At least for now,
I want to stay this way.

741
00:49:19,634 --> 00:49:21,580
I want to be remembered by only you.

742
00:49:25,634 --> 00:49:27,050
Can you do that for me?

743
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:44,255
I promised to go home with Haru.

744
00:49:44,255 --> 00:49:45,699
Whose stage is this?

745
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:50,369
What's up with my lips?

746
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:53,480
The writer made me look too ill.

747
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,550
Are you okay?

748
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:03,719
Yes. I'm fine.

749
00:50:04,314 --> 00:50:06,245
I have a heart problem,
but I'm coughing?

750
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:07,790
This makes no sense.

751
00:50:13,084 --> 00:50:14,230
Let's go home.

752
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:22,939
Will that be the last leaf?

753
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:24,894
Dan Oh, can't you see...

754
00:50:24,894 --> 00:50:26,669
there's plenty of leaves
on the tree?

755
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:33,574
Gosh, I have to make it
this obvious that I'm crying?

756
00:50:33,574 --> 00:50:35,280
If you do everything you want to do,

757
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:37,844
will that help cure your illness?

758
00:50:37,844 --> 00:50:39,490
This is enough for me.

759
00:50:39,644 --> 00:50:41,284
You told me that you liked me.

760
00:50:41,284 --> 00:50:42,919
I don't hate you.

761
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:45,429
I hate that you're sick.

762
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:49,629
I don't hate you. I hate
that my father treats you as money.

763
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:51,699
And I hate that he's my father.

764
00:50:55,465 --> 00:50:56,909
I heard it from Do Hwa.

765
00:50:57,894 --> 00:50:59,439
You'll be getting the surgery soon.

766
00:51:00,534 --> 00:51:01,679
I don't...

767
00:51:02,364 --> 00:51:03,649
want the surgery.

768
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:09,280
Going to school with you
makes me so happy.

769
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:12,990
I hate that I don't know how long
I must stay in the hospital...

770
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:16,260
once I get the surgery and that
I have to wait for you to visit me.

771
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:18,230
I'll stay by your side all the time.

772
00:51:26,995 --> 00:51:28,070
Gosh.

773
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:32,109
Seriously. This writer doesn't
know the middle ground.

774
00:51:33,564 --> 00:51:35,639
Goodness, look at this.
I look awful.

775
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:39,580
Hey, I'll get going.

776
00:51:41,604 --> 00:51:42,879
What is this?

777
00:51:52,354 --> 00:51:53,530
Did you take your medication?

778
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,699
Taking the medication
probably won't do anything.

779
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,439
I wonder when the storyboard
for the surgery will begin.

780
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:02,199
The storyboard?

781
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:04,939
Yes. In the operation room...

782
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:09,040
Forget it. I might be able
to change it like last time.

783
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:11,675
Anyway, this lame set-up of mine...

784
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,980
is getting nothing like the real me
as time passes by.

785
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:16,820
I'm turning more into my character.

786
00:52:20,614 --> 00:52:21,859
Someone once asked me...

787
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:25,260
why she had feelings
that the writer didn't draw for her.

788
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:28,230
But why do I get...

789
00:52:29,284 --> 00:52:31,730
the feeling that the writer knows
more about my feelings than me?

790
00:52:33,594 --> 00:52:34,770
I just...

791
00:52:35,465 --> 00:52:36,969
know one thing.

792
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:39,639
If you die too,

793
00:52:40,905 --> 00:52:43,649
I'll suffer from a wound
I'll never recover from.

794
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:47,149
I don't care
if you think I'm selfish...

795
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:49,320
because I have always
been selfish...

796
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:51,050
and continue to be.

797
00:52:51,844 --> 00:52:53,520
Just like you've been doing so far,

798
00:52:55,314 --> 00:52:57,530
could you let me win this time too?

799
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:02,000
Let's get the surgery,

800
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:03,770
Dan Oh.

801
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,780
Haru, I'm sorry.
Did you wait for long?

802
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,350
I always make you wait for me.

803
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:26,344
- Are you okay?
- You asked me...

804
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:28,445
if I was okay so many times today.

805
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:30,659
You were overprotective
and made a fuss when it was nothing.

806
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:32,790
I was worried
that you might be sick.

807
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:35,584
Just because my heart
might stop any minute,

808
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:37,929
it doesn't mean I have to spend
every moment of my life in sadness.

809
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:40,899
And it doesn't mean you need
to protect me all the time. Okay?

810
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:44,594
What's the genre of our comic book?

811
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:46,469
It's a romance comic book.

812
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:50,405
I'm happy enough for having a chance
to spend time with you like this.

813
00:53:50,405 --> 00:53:52,480
Dan Oh's first love
in a romance comic book.

814
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:56,144
This is nice, you know?
I have my own first love,

815
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:57,820
not the one writer decided for me.

816
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:59,149
If you get the surgery,

817
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:03,219
our time together might be over.

818
00:54:03,915 --> 00:54:04,990
I know.

819
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:08,699
You...

820
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:11,830
You might die.

821
00:54:17,735 --> 00:54:19,909
Before "Secret"... So,

822
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:22,280
before this world began,

823
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:25,679
there was another story about us.

824
00:54:27,844 --> 00:54:29,119
In that story,

825
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:32,050
I saw you die.

826
00:54:33,044 --> 00:54:34,119
Haru.

827
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:36,185
Even if there was such a story,

828
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:37,415
we're here together.

829
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:38,859
That story...

830
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:42,800
That story is repeating
even in this world.

831
00:54:46,755 --> 00:54:48,169
I can't.

832
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:50,869
I can't live without you.

833
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:52,570
I will change it no matter what.

834
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:55,280
- I don't want to change it.
- No, we must!

835
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:57,550
I...

836
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:00,080
I can't let you go.

837
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:05,990
I'll change it no matter what.

838
00:55:16,324 --> 00:55:17,969
I'm scared that I might lose you.

839
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:23,969
I'm scared, Dan Oh.

840
00:55:46,955 --> 00:55:49,655
Well, you know
the story you told me?

841
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:50,995
The story where I died in?

842
00:55:50,995 --> 00:55:53,624
Don't pay too much attention
to the story in the past.

843
00:55:53,624 --> 00:55:55,765
I just feel like the story is
repeating in our world too.

844
00:55:55,765 --> 00:55:57,965
Is that what Dried Squid Fairy said?

845
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:00,409
There he goes again.
He's scaring you again.

846
00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:06,304
Gosh. How will you survive
in this tough world of comics...

847
00:56:06,304 --> 00:56:07,750
if you're that weak-hearted?

848
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:09,619
Dan Oh.

849
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:11,689
Since I was born
with a heart problem,

850
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:14,490
I didn't expect to live a long life
like the others.

851
00:56:15,314 --> 00:56:16,619
But I don't feel good...

852
00:56:17,255 --> 00:56:18,955
- about that surgery.
- I don't even know for sure...

853
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:20,525
if I'll get the surgery or not.

854
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:23,359
Besides, I won't die
just because I have the surgery.

855
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:25,655
I survived even after...

856
00:56:25,655 --> 00:56:28,364
so many complicated surgeries
since birth.

857
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:30,665
No way. There's no way...

858
00:56:30,665 --> 00:56:32,995
the writer would let me die now.
Don't you think so?

859
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:34,179
Do you...

860
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:36,639
want the surgery?

861
00:56:45,644 --> 00:56:46,719
Tell me...

862
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,419
what you want.

863
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:54,800
Spending time with you like this...

864
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:57,669
until the stage starts.

865
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:08,580
Bye, Haru.

866
00:57:59,915 --> 00:58:01,659
I really want to change it.

867
00:58:07,294 --> 00:58:10,040
I want to live
just as much as anyone.

868
00:58:15,604 --> 00:58:17,550
I don't know
how I should change the stage...

869
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:20,310
and what I should tell Haru.

870
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:25,449
Dear Writer,

871
00:58:29,515 --> 00:58:30,689
please.

872
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:34,699
Please let me live a bit longer.

873
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:38,169
Please.

874
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,800
I'm begging you.

875
00:58:44,094 --> 00:58:46,909
Please let me live a bit longer.

876
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:58,750
Please let me live a bit longer.
I'm begging you.

877
00:59:01,715 --> 00:59:03,760
Please.

878
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:10,030
Dear Writer, please let me live.

879
00:59:11,854 --> 00:59:13,699
Please let me live.

880
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:23,679
Nam Ju didn't have to be that cool.

881
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:27,010
- Do Hwa.
- Hey, Haru.

882
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:30,550
I'm just a mere character who
can't even change the stage himself.

883
00:59:31,074 --> 00:59:33,614
How did you change the stage?

884
00:59:33,614 --> 00:59:36,189
Is it because of
your ardent love for Dan Oh?

885
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:38,854
I get it.
Dan Oh's set-up is really sad.

886
00:59:38,854 --> 00:59:41,124
Right. Did you hear? I heard it
from my brother yesterday.

887
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:42,929
He picked a date
for Dan Oh's surgery.

888
00:59:43,554 --> 00:59:45,225
- What?
- Don't be so surprised.

889
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:47,894
Don't worry.
My brother is a great surgeon.

890
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:49,465
I think he's telling her tonight.

891
00:59:49,465 --> 00:59:50,540
Tonight?

892
00:59:51,995 --> 00:59:53,070
Do Hwa.

893
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,740
I need...

894
00:59:56,804 --> 00:59:57,949
to change the stage.

895
00:59:59,975 --> 01:00:02,619
I need to get my brother's clothes.
What else do I need?

896
01:00:04,515 --> 01:00:05,614
The watch?

897
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:08,384
No, the tennis ball.
No, this isn't it.

898
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:09,485
What are you doing?

899
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:11,784
Oh, Kyung. I didn't change anything.

900
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:12,889
I didn't do it.

901
01:00:13,455 --> 01:00:14,629
You're going to change it again?

902
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:17,084
This time, is it for Dan Oh?

903
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:19,669
What are you talking about?
You're one funny guy.

904
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:24,070
You don't have to tell me.
I'll find it.

905
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:26,709
It's already drawn anyway.

906
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:32,909
Dad.

907
01:00:33,705 --> 01:00:35,574
Yes, I'm almost there.

908
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:38,543
Where am I going? To the hospital?

909
01:00:38,544 --> 01:00:40,790
What is Dr. Lee going to tell me?

910
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:43,490
He made sure that I come with you.
It's scary.

911
01:00:44,314 --> 01:00:46,689
Okay, Dad. I'll see you there.

912
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:53,800
Will I really get operated on?

913
01:01:49,114 --> 01:01:52,159
Everything has been
drawn in this book...

914
01:01:52,715 --> 01:01:54,429
as if someone is watching this.

915
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:01,070
My lady!

916
01:02:02,394 --> 01:02:03,500
My lady.

917
01:02:04,165 --> 01:02:05,409
You must run away.

918
01:02:06,034 --> 01:02:08,840
He will put you in danger.

919
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:24,830
Explain this.

920
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:26,689
You will not remember it.

921
01:02:27,725 --> 01:02:28,725
What?

922
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,725
Everything will collapse
at this rate.

923
01:02:30,725 --> 01:02:32,270
Please stop your treason.

924
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:34,270
Please let Lady Dan Oh live.

925
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:36,725
- You.
- I already know...

926
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:38,034
this is far from what you hoped for.

927
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:39,310
So please...

928
01:02:40,935 --> 01:02:42,510
Please remember.

929
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,780
If you do not, we might end up
pointing our knives at each other.

930
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:56,189
My lady.

931
01:02:56,945 --> 01:02:58,129
My lady.

932
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:02,290
(Extra-ordinary You)
