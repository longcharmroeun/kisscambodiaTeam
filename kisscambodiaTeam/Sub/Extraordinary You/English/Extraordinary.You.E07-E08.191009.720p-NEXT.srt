1
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,539
(I want to live.)

2
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,850
Eun Dan Oh.

3
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,950
(Episode 7)

4
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,749
("Secret")

5
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,990
It's split exactly in half.

6
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,130
I think you're my destiny.

7
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,200
Move if you're done.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,899
Let me see
if Baek Kyung is my destiny too.

9
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,529
Please split it.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
You split it.

11
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:03,079
I don't even know
when and where I'll die.

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,779
Will I spend all the time
I have left getting hurt by Baek Kyung?

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,620
What's with her?

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,550
She's trying to look miserable.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,419
To win Baek Kyung's attention.

16
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:15,020
Dan Oh, while you're at it,

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,630
why don't you make
your heart rate monitor﻿ go off too?

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,289
Beep, beep, beep...

19
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:19,399
"Baek Kyung!"

20
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,899
"Dan Oh, are you okay?"

21
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,130
Let me make this clear.

22
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm not crying because of that jerk.

23
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,509
I'm just sad...

24
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,649
that having hopes
doesn't change anything.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,059
Why didn't you stay in the hospital
if you have heart problems?

26
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,910
Dan Oh, have you gone crazy?

27
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,009
You're the one who's crazy.

28
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,590
(If you're sick,
you should just stay at home.)

29
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,130
(What are you doing?)

30
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,460
("Secret")

31
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,070
Are you going to break
the Relationship Stone?

32
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,839
Why are you all dolled up?
Baek Kyung will love it.

33
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,999
Relationship Stone? Baek Kyung?

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,910
Don't you dare mention his name
in front of me ever again.

35
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,580
This is exactly why
I don't like you.

36
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,760
Dan Oh!

37
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:19,200
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,469
"This is exactly why
I don't like you"?

39
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,610
He sure knows what to say
to a patient.

40
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,209
How electric. Applaud.

41
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,179
I hate the writer.

42
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,850
And I hate Baek Kyung even more
for hurting me.

43
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,290
- Is someone talking about me?
- I'm sure many are.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,529
How many Relationship Stones
have you broken?

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,089
- Many.
- Do you even know...

46
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,130
what the meaning behind them is?

47
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,499
Do you actually believe that?

48
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,300
- Get ready to go out.
- I'm going to skip...

49
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,399
the evening schedule.

50
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,869
- Why?
- Thanks to the Relationship Stones,

51
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:02,339
I've been running away all day
from the girls, and I'm knackered.

52
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,580
The couple night trekking
sounds fun, though.

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,679
"Couple night trekking"?

54
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,719
What's that on your back?

55
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,790
- What is that?
- It's a girl's hand.

56
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,559
You deserve many of those
on a daily basis.

57
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:24,600
I think I know whose hand it is.

58
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,170
There's this girl who's crazy
about guys' backs.

59
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,369
What's gotten into you?

60
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,040
Are you trying to memorize
the entire route?

61
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:33,710
Yes, I am.

62
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,970
Why?

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,309
I'm planning to get lost.

64
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,350
Dan Oh, do you know
why our camp is also called...

65
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,780
a love camp?

66
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,389
"A love camp"?

67
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,520
I'm not interested.

68
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:54,259
It's because couples are made
during the night trekking.

69
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,030
You should pretend not to know
the routes, not memorize them.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,929
(Trail, Maebong)

71
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:02,499
You just need to follow
Baek Kyung's lead.

72
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,309
The darker the routes,
the brighter your love becomes.

73
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,210
"Nam Ju, I'm scared."

74
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:34,329
(Off Limits)

75
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,650
- What's your number?
- What's your number?

76
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,220
- What?
- She's with me.

77
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,850
- What's your number?
- 13.

78
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,689
- I'm number 3.
- I'm number 4.

79
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,160
This is unbelievable.

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
Why did you mix it
with other classes?

81
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,900
What can I do when everyone wants
to become partners with Nam Ju?

82
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,829
If you're meant to be,

83
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,270
you'll be partnered up with him
no matter what.

84
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,369
Exactly.

85
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,699
I actually like that
I'll be partners...

86
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,170
with a girl from another class.

87
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,639
Shut it! I'm going to pick him.

88
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,910
My goodness.

89
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,980
It's not him!

90
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,249
You look ugly right now.

91
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,420
Let me take a photo. 1, 2, 3.

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
That hurt.

93
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,389
You look perfectly ugly.

94
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:33,889
Come on.

95
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:35,429
- Shall we open at the same time?
- Okay.

96
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,530
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

97
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,900
- What is your number?
- Hey...

98
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,340
When did you come?

99
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,170
- I love it.
- I can't believe it.

100
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,840
- I thought you were exhausted.
- I am.

101
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
But...

102
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,350
There's a reason why
I want to do this.

103
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,650
It's not likely to be partners
with the person you want.

104
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,189
It's only possible...

105
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,290
Let's go.

106
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,400
I can't believe this.

107
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,259
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

108
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,530
Because the writer planned it out.

109
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,639
I'm so upset.

110
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,369
I'm in a pickle, but you're also
in trouble.

111
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,840
If it's your fate as an extra
to connect them together,

112
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,980
then I should get it over
with as well.

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,790
- He's probably number 27.
- No, he's number 3.

114
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,689
- No, he's probably number 27!
- Stop pushing me!

115
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,559
Baek Kyung, I got number three.
What about you?

116
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,290
- Are you...
- Baek Kyung, what's your number?

117
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,530
I'd love it if you were number 27.

118
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,230
It's neither one.

119
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,230
Excuse me.

120
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,600
- What?
- What are you doing?

121
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,739
Get up. Let's go.

122
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,470
- Go where?
- Where?

123
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,210
I bet you're number 10.

124
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,309
I know doing this won't end
this scene any quicker.

125
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,739
But I'm in a hurry, you see.

126
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,650
Ta-da. See?

127
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,579
Let me take him.

128
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,579
- Get up.
- Where are we going?

129
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,850
- Don't go!
- Don't leave!

130
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,489
Let's go! Let's go!

131
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,129
- We can do it!
- Go!

132
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,139
Have you been here before?

133
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,110
Of course not.
This is my first time.

134
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,579
Then how do you know
the way so well?

135
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,780
I know, right? Thanks to someone,

136
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,390
I skipped dinner
to memorize the routes.

137
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,750
Because of whom?

138
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,829
Gosh.

139
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,400
Can we slow down a bit?

140
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,050
This is exactly why
I don't like you.

141
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,449
This is exactly why...

142
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,979
I don't like you.

143
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,559
What a jerk.

144
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,270
Darn you.

145
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,809
I can't always act
like a love bridge.

146
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,660
It was around here.

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,969
You have a special talent.

148
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,969
You keep hugging me
every time you trip.

149
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,839
That's not true.

150
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,890
I should take responsibility
for this.

151
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,920
What?

152
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,420
What I mean is,
make sure you follow me.

153
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,959
<i>Which way do I go
to go back to our accommodation?</i>

154
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,329
I don't remember. Where is it?

155
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,900
My gosh.

156
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,640
What? I think I've seen
this tree before.

157
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,670
You flip the pages so often,

158
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,439
so why aren't you doing it
this time?

159
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,579
What? Is it dead?

160
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,319
Hold on. Where's my phone?

161
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,890
My phone...

162
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,990
is gone.

163
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,400
Can we slow down a bit?

164
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,079
(Eun Dan Oh)

165
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,979
- The number you have called...
- Darn it.

166
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,949
You're back.

167
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,079
What are you doing here?

168
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,449
It's your gift.

169
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,420
Control your temper in front of her.
She has a weak heart, you know?

170
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:36,929
Do you expect me
to carry something like this?

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,300
I'm in no place
to give others advice.

172
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,439
I can't believe this.

173
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,979
Please...

174
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:55,979
<i>Until that day
when Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>

175
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:59,650
<i>And the East Sea runs dry</i>

176
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,550
I'm not scared. I'm not.

177
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,359
I'm not scared. So what?

178
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,929
I'm scared. No, I'm not scared.

179
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,859
Dan Oh, get a grip.
Get a grip. Focus.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,429
You're one awful writer.

181
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,170
No, no. Dear writer,
I'm begging you like this.

182
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,540
I'm really scared.

183
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,579
I want to go home now.

184
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,439
I'm so scared.

185
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,910
What?

186
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,150
What is it?

187
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
Who's there?

188
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,689
Don't come. Don't come near me.

189
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,929
I really don't have any money.

190
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,390
Please spare me just this once.
Don't kill me.

191
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,410
Number 13?

192
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,329
I'm scared. Wait for me.

193
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,630
<i>I've got peace like a river</i>

194
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,099
Oh, goodness. I'm scared.

195
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,969
Hey, you know what?

196
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:30,979
Well,

197
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:32,740
I'm sorry,

198
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,609
but can you turn that on?

199
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
I see.

200
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,420
I'm so scared. Please.

201
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,099
Hey. You scared me.

202
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,870
Sorry.

203
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
You...

204
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,069
You could speak?

205
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:05,780
- Yes.
- My gosh.

206
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,010
It was so frustrating
to talk to you.

207
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,449
Since when? How?

208
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,920
No, how did that happen?

209
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,849
If you could talk,
why didn't you answer me?

210
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,729
What's happening?
Hey, wait for me. I'm scared.

211
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,130
This.

212
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,939
- This is fake.
- What if it's a real ghost?

213
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,010
Because we're real.

214
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,750
This is fake.

215
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,319
Stop complaining. Hurry up.

216
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,819
I'm scared too.

217
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,319
This is too much.

218
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,660
Dear deity, why did you give me
the same number with Sae Mi's?

219
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,490
- Number four here meant death.
- Hey, Su Chul.

220
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,199
Hurry up. What if we lose them
because you're slow?

221
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,630
Please just lose me.

222
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,800
Nam Ju.

223
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,740
Where are you?

224
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,040
- Hey, wait up.
- Your Sae Mi is right here.

225
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,339
Hey, wait for me.

226
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:17,150
If he could talk, why didn't he
say anything all this time?

227
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,920
Goodness. Does he just
have a quiet personality?

228
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,319
Or is it something else?

229
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:23,859
Gosh, I'm cold.

230
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:33,729
Hey, I told you I was cold.

231
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,370
You should take off
your jacket or something for me.

232
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,270
You're not considerate at all.

233
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,370
Hey, what are you doing?

234
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,770
I was going to take this off.

235
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,510
No, I was just saying it.

236
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,550
But you shouldn't take off
your clothes in front of me.

237
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,609
You must've gone crazy.
Just put it back on.

238
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Unbelievable.

239
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,290
Dan Oh, get a grip.

240
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,559
It's cold here.

241
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,640
I'm so cold.

242
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,689
I'm sorry,

243
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,459
but if you can't change my fate,

244
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,760
no matter how handsome you are,
it will be useless.

245
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,329
Dan Oh!

246
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,229
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

247
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,229
The story has changed.

248
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,469
Dan Oh.

249
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,150
- Let's go.
- I'm certain it was Baek Kyung...

250
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,880
who came looking for me.

251
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,329
Where are we going?

252
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,639
I think I hear some sounds.

253
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,409
Hey, where are we?

254
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,639
(Off Limits)

255
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:29,680
Hey, I think we came too deep
into the mountain.

256
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,579
How far are we going to go?

257
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:36,349
My gosh.

258
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,879
Hey, how far are we going to go?

259
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,099
This is so pretty.

260
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,639
How did you find this place?

261
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,879
Do you know what this flower is?

262
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
That flower?

263
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,889
No. But...

264
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,859
I can see that it's beautiful.

265
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,040
You don't know this place?

266
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:03,839
No, I don't.

267
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,079
Why?

268
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,119
Why is he looking at me like this?

269
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,760
What's he doing all of a sudden?

270
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,639
This was on your hair.

271
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,280
You know what?

272
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,990
I was a bit sad that I had
to follow a path that had already...

273
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,159
been decided for me.

274
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,990
But...

275
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:28,159
that just changed.

276
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,629
You showed me...

277
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,629
that there is another path just now.

278
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,669
I'm certain of it.

279
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,710
Thanks to you,

280
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,980
I think my day can change.

281
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:56,819
Can I...

282
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,889
call you Day?

283
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,750
We should go trekking again.

284
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,020
Why are we visiting
an ancient palace? It's so boring.

285
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,460
I wonder
what a guy and a girl did...

286
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,190
at a deserted mountain last night.

287
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,129
I bet it was a huge scoop, right?

288
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:41,129
I'm supposed to be with Nam Ju.

289
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,899
How could you pick that number
out of all numbers?

290
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:43,899
That hurts.

291
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:44,899
Dan Oh.

292
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,669
Where have you been?

293
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,240
Why are you here?

294
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,109
I've been looking all over for you.

295
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

296
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,050
Why are you saying this
in the shadow instead of on stage?

297
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,419
It's too late.

298
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,520
How's your heart?

299
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,419
Are you okay?

300
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,059
- What's with you?
- I'm worried about you.

301
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,490
What?

302
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,829
Forget it.

303
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,879
Hey.

304
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,079
- Baek Kyung.
- What?

305
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,109
Why are you so out of it
from the morning?

306
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,950
What did you do last night?

307
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,780
I went looking for Dan Oh...

308
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,220
Where was I?

309
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,430
- Step back!
- Even farther back?

310
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,859
My gosh. There are carp!
Come check them out first.

311
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,030
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

312
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:49,569
They're so cute.

313
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,500
- What are you doing?
- What?

314
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,540
Take a picture of me.

315
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,210
- Of you? Okay.
- Do it.

316
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,169
1, 2, 3.

317
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,540
One more.

318
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,139
- Another one?
- 1, 2, 3.

319
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:05,579
Well... This place is nice,

320
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:07,180
but it's even nicer over there.

321
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,790
Do you want to check it out with me?

322
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,220
- Over there?
- Yes. Let's go.

323
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,240
Can I call you Day?

324
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,710
I hope he remembers me.

325
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,319
What are you doing?

326
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,589
You're very good at drawing.

327
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,069
Every time I see you, I should
introduce myself first, right?

328
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:59,770
I'm Eun Dan Oh, number 7.
I'm a junior in Class 7.

329
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,940
And your name is Day.

330
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Day?

331
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,879
You remember me.

332
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,220
I can change the future.

333
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,129
Doesn't this place look familiar?

334
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,599
I must have been...

335
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,000
a princess in my past life.
A princess.

336
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,750
Hey, I was joking.

337
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,480
It was just a joke.

338
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,609
Day.

339
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,510
Too bad I'm the only one who knows.

340
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,050
Know what?

341
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,419
Your name.

342
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:22,550
Isn't it nice
that you have a name now?

343
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:37,899
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

344
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,240
Look at that.

345
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,490
What is it?

346
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:30,290
Isn't that the flower we saw
in the valley yesterday?

347
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,109
Let's try one more time.

348
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,349
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I must have strained myself.

349
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,750
- We'll be doing this all day.
- One more round.

350
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,780
- I don't want to.
- Let's do it.

351
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,419
- I don't want to!
- Come on!

352
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,970
Am I only imagining it,

353
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:27,040
or does Day really remember me?

354
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,990
Day.

355
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,169
(Dan Oh)

356
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,632
(Episode 8 will air shortly.)

357
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,739
(Episode 8)

358
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,940
Dan Oh, you came to school today.

359
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,880
"Guys, my heart..."

360
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,980
I'll recover.
I'll recover completely.

361
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,550
Yes. To have a good time
with your love, Baek Kyung, again,

362
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,189
you should recover quickly.

363
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:29,389
A good time. What did I say?

364
00:29:29,389 --> 00:29:31,189
- A good time!
- A good time!

365
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:36,360
<i>- A good time
- A good time</i>

366
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,500
I have no energy
to spend on you punks.

367
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,200
From today on, I'll be working...

368
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
on this great project
to change my fate. So move.

369
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,869
- A project?
- A project?

370
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:46,409
You'll be working on a project?

371
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,210
What kind of project?

372
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,280
- A project to win Baek Kyung's heart!
- A project to win Baek Kyung's heart!

373
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,280
<i>- To win Baek Kyung's heart
- To win Baek Kyung's heart</i>

374
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,180
<i>- To win Baek Kyung's heart
- To win Baek Kyung's heart</i>

375
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,049
<i>- To win Baek Kyung's heart
</i>- He's here.

376
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,790
- Baek Kyung.
- Baek Kyung.

377
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,150
Baek Kyung is here. Hi.

378
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:19,210
<i>- To win Baek Kyung's heart
- To win Baek Kyung's heart</i>

379
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,680
(Ahn Su Chul's Summer Camp,
4 dollars)

380
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,249
Guys, this is a rare opportunity.

381
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:30,850
These photos are all one of a kind.

382
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,150
Memories of Seuli High School
Summer Camp!

383
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,949
Masterpieces by Class Seven's
photographer, Ahn Su Chul.

384
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:36,059
The best of the best!

385
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,320
Each photo costs two dollars.

386
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,830
But photos of A3 cost
4 dollars each.

387
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,589
- I want one!
- Me too!

388
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,499
Su Chul, are there photos
of Nam Ju too?

389
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:44,859
- Come!
- I want this one!

390
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:46,600
Come take a look.

391
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,199
- Move!
- It's mine!

392
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,240
- I'll take these two.
- Okay, calm down.

393
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,040
- Hey!
- Hey!

394
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,880
Can I get a receipt?

395
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,040
No, I can't give you a receipt.

396
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,380
All right.

397
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,719
Ta-da. An Oh Nam Ju straight flush.

398
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,449
Lucky you.

399
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:10,559
What are friends for?

400
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,960
I got a few for you too.

401
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,190
Wait.

402
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,130
I want only this one.

403
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:22,300
But I'm not in it.

404
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,099
No. That's why
I'm keeping only this one.

405
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:31,080
Not this?

406
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,650
Hey.

407
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,580
- Dan Oh!
- What?

408
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,219
What is it now?

409
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:49,260
That jerk.

410
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,270
There aren't many photos left!

411
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,400
Take this opportunity!

412
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:00,909
This was a success.

413
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,480
What about my portrait rights?

414
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,249
Well... I need to pay for my films.

415
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:11,550
- Where are photos of me?
- They were sold out immediately.

416
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,920
You're so popular.

417
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,119
They were sold out? All of them?

418
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,420
Yes, they're all gone.

419
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:17,789
What's wrong?

420
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,760
Su Chul.

421
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,529
I'll take this.

422
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,400
- Ju Da?
- Ju Da?

423
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,469
It's all yours.

424
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:33,539
A3 made me so much money.
You can have it for free.

425
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:37,379
- What's going on?
- Nam Ju!

426
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,140
- Wait!
- Nam Ju!

427
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,349
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

428
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,119
- Gosh, it's Ju Da.
- What are you looking at?

429
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,860
Look at her eyes.

430
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,360
Let's look at these photos instead.

431
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,860
Hey, Ju Da.

432
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:06,270
In the mountain, you were
so aggressive. At school...

433
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,270
Hey.

434
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,879
Be careful. What if someone
gets the wrong idea?

435
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,640
Let them think what they want.

436
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,089
- Hey.
- Yes?

437
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:26,559
How have you been dealing with it?

438
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,830
- Deal with what?
- Everything.

439
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,859
We can't do things we want to do.

440
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,270
We can't see people we want to see.

441
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,000
We always have to follow the plans.

442
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:37,469
You're right.

443
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:41,609
But it can change.

444
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:43,479
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

445
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,049
He can't remember you.
Isn't that frustrating?

446
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,609
It frustrates me.

447
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:51,320
Whether I'm in the scene or not,

448
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,690
I only get to see Ju Da from behind.

449
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,089
If you try, you can see her
from the front too.

450
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,320
Wait. See?

451
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,390
I was right.

452
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,029
I'm seeing her from behind
this time too.

453
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:06,630
You can change it.

454
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,270
Both you and I can change it.

455
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,440
- Follow her.
- What? Right now?

456
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,299
Right now. Run!

457
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:20,080
Ju Da.

458
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,750
Do Hwa, where are you going?

459
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:25,880
I came...

460
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,750
to you.

461
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,599
They've been so lovey-dovey
ever since the camp.

462
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,729
It totally makes me cringe.

463
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,900
You have no idea.

464
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:43,440
- Did you have fun?
- Yes, absolutely.

465
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,839
But something strange happened too.

466
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:51,039
I guess I was tired
from spending time with Day.

467
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,909
- Day?
- Yes.

468
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:55,580
Being with Day
changes the storyboard.

469
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,620
I'm sure you don't believe me.

470
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,450
So you gave him a name?

471
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,890
Do you realize
what giving a name means?

472
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,830
You're an extra in this comic book.

473
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,859
I know that. So what?

474
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,169
Extras exist
for the main characters.

475
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,640
I've been supporting those guys
all this time.

476
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,969
When extras get names
and start acting on their own...

477
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,940
Everything will go wrong.

478
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:29,380
Leave.

479
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,690
Everything will go wrong?

480
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,390
If something changes,
it'll only be better for me.

481
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,789
Who knows
my heart will become healthy?

482
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,390
Why would he suddenly become
so serious?

483
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,330
Everything will go wrong?

484
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,570
(Mom's Flowers)

485
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,469
Dad, I'm home.

486
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,270
You look happy today.

487
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,640
Yes, I am.

488
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Dan Oh.

489
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,739
Look at this.

490
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,409
Do you remember planting these?
Mom's flowers.

491
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,580
I planted them with Mom.
How could I forget it?

492
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,620
They bloom so beautifully
every year.

493
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,650
As if your mom comes to see you.

494
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:12,820
You're right.
They're just as beautiful as Mom.

495
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,460
- Flowers!
- Hey.

496
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,330
Dan Oh, did you have fun?

497
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,500
Look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

498
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,799
Dan Oh, do you know
what this flower is?

499
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,940
I'm not sure.

500
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,570
- It's Mom's flower.
- Mom's flower.

501
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,710
Whose flower is this then?

502
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,080
- It's Dad's.
- It's Dan Oh's.

503
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,609
Whose flower is this then?

504
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,779
It's Baek Kyung's.

505
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:09,650
- Baek Kyung's?
- Baek Kyung's?

506
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,349
Even if I'm in a comic book...

507
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:17,460
and everything is decided
by the writer,

508
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,460
my feelings are real.

509
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,159
So I'll change it by all means.

510
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,929
The way I want.

511
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,179
(What are you doing?)

512
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:17,779
(It's a gift.)

513
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,449
Do you expect me
to carry something like this?

514
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,990
Well...

515
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:42,809
("Secret")

516
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,990
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

517
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,659
- No, I'm not.
- Let's put it down.

518
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:06,799
I'll carry it.

519
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,569
But it's our job.

520
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,900
No one cares about extras anyway.

521
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,880
What did he say? Extras?

522
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,150
I'm not sure. By the way,

523
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,650
who is he?

524
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,390
Shoot!

525
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,529
Over here.

526
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,299
Pass me the ball.

527
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,730
Do you like her so much?

528
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:43,539
No, I don't.

529
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,069
Try to keep a straight face.

530
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:47,169
Stop staring at her so intensely.

531
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:58,620
What are you doing?

532
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,949
I think I should practice some more.

533
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:11,929
You'll never succeed that way.

534
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:13,799
Nam Ju?

535
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:17,169
Don't use your hands.

536
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,400
Use your wrists instead.

537
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,740
- That's so cool!
- Nam Ju!

538
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,240
Can you teach me too?

539
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:29,819
Try it.

540
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
What?

541
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,549
Yes, go ahead.

542
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,819
I got it wrong.

543
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,130
It went in.

544
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,959
- What's up with her?
- She's so annoying.

545
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,360
I hate her.

546
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:53,669
(Screaming)

547
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:56,439
The writer didn't even
draw him properly.

548
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,409
Look at this. He doesn't have
any facial features.

549
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,860
("Secret")

550
00:42:13,689 --> 00:42:14,789
You almost got hurt.

551
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,699
I can't believe this.

552
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:25,000
Where is it?

553
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,500
The key ring Dan Oh gave you.

554
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:29,699
Why are you asking me for that?

555
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
I need it.

556
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:36,909
I threw it out.

557
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:43,579
Who are you?

558
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:47,020
Who are you?
Why do you keep popping up...

559
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,990
Day.

560
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,120
- What?
- My name...

561
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:53,990
is Day.

562
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:02,529
Hey, wait.

563
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,909
Darn it.

564
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,890
Extras aren't allowed to have names?

565
00:43:29,529 --> 00:43:30,630
Day.

566
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,559
It suits him well.

567
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
What are you looking at?

568
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,260
You.

569
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:00,929
Me?

570
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:08,829
You were just talking to me. Right?

571
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:10,270
You remember me, right?

572
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:14,610
You pointed at me with this pencil.

573
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,809
Just like this.

574
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,039
Like this.

575
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,510
- I pointed at you?
- Yes.

576
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,579
- Like this?
- Yes. Like that.

577
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,579
Like this.

578
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,789
If you can't even remember it,
why are you looking at me like that?

579
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,559
I almost thought that you did.

580
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:33,890
Just like this.

581
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:35,329
Ban Jang.

582
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:45,900
("Hoping for a Faint Light
Like the Moon and the Stars")

583
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:59,250
Come on.

584
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:18,470
I moved because of the sunlight.

585
00:45:19,669 --> 00:45:20,669
I see.

586
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:27,810
You keep getting on my nerves.

587
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:29,709
Baek Kyung.

588
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,650
Are you two having fun?

589
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:36,310
What's gotten into him
all of a sudden?

590
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,169
If you don't want
to end up like him,

591
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,409
don't get on my nerves.

592
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:14,919
There's only
so much I can put up with.

593
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,590
What's this?

594
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,100
I can't see anything.
I'm scared.

595
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,330
Could it be... Am I dead?

596
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,669
Just like that? Already?

597
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,249
Gosh, what a relief.

598
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:51,019
I thought...

599
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,659
something had...

600
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:54,689
gone wrong just like
what Dried Squid said.

601
00:47:58,659 --> 00:47:59,659
Right.

602
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,969
This isn't a thriller.

603
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:05,140
A romance story won't turn
into a sad story all of a sudden.

604
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,140
Right.

605
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,810
Dan Oh, you're awake.

606
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,090
Dr. Lee, don't look at me
with such sad eyes.

607
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,090
Dan Oh.

608
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,999
My gosh, you never change, Dr. Lee.

609
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,570
How could you be worried about me
both on stage and in the shadow?

610
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,239
Gosh, I've lived a successful life.

611
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:44,110
Although I was an extra,

612
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,310
someone sincerely cared about me.

613
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,509
Dan Oh, actually...

614
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,909
I know everything.

615
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:54,620
I don't have much time left.

616
00:48:58,419 --> 00:48:59,959
Don't worry.

617
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:01,360
I will change the story
no matter what...

618
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,900
and come up with
a new expiration date for my heart.

619
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:21,110
What is this?

620
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,110
Flowers!

621
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,150
Let's go.

622
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,090
- Dad.
- Yes?

623
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,729
What happened to the swing
and the flowers here?

624
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:37,259
What are you talking about?

625
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,130
You'll be late for school.
Let's hurry.

626
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,630
How can all of them
disappear like this?

627
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:42,830
What do you mean?

628
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:45,239
I planted them with Mom.

629
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:49,669
Dan Oh.

630
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:17,439
Can I call you Day?

631
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:29,509
When extras get names
and start acting on their own...

632
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,679
Everything will go wrong.

633
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,259
Everything is going wrong...

634
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,189
because of me.

635
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,759
Because of my greedy wish
to become real.

636
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,290
What should I do?

637
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:49,130
I told you to put on goggles.

638
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,199
No. I deserve to suffer.

639
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:56,229
You were right.

640
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,499
The harder I try to change things,

641
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:01,110
the worse everything gets.

642
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,040
I told you.

643
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:05,580
You told me the other day,

644
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,110
when extras get names
and start acting on their own,

645
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,820
everything will go wrong.

646
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,120
If I hadn't given him a name,
this wouldn't have happened.

647
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:19,360
No. If I hadn't sat next to him,

648
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,360
he wouldn't have gotten hurt.

649
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,459
These onions are burning my eyes.

650
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:27,900
I'm crying.

651
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,540
It was selfish of me
to drag someone innocent into this.

652
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:34,909
I'll stop talking to him altogether.

653
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:36,540
That'd be best for Day...

654
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,280
No! I take that back!

655
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,310
That'd be best for Number 13.

656
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,709
My eyes are burning.

657
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:32,199
He should put that antiseptic
on his wound.

658
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:35,630
Dan Oh.

659
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:36,830
Yes?

660
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:38,300
Isn't Baek Kyung coming to school today?

661
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,439
Isn't he here yet?

662
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:42,340
You're his fiancee.
How could you not know that?

663
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,179
After making that scene yesterday,
he's even skipping school?

664
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:48,209
This is not okay.

665
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,380
Hey, Number 13!

666
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,719
What if you get a scar
on your forehead?

667
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:55,590
You're bleeding.
Have you applied any antiseptic?

668
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,759
You're bleeding a lot.
It must have hurt.

669
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,509
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Day...

670
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,380
I mean Number 13.

671
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:48,070
You prepared food Dan Oh likes.

672
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,140
I'm sorry.

673
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,209
Dan Oh is not an easy girl.

674
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:54,380
We rarely get to even see her.

675
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:57,280
If you think about it,

676
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,150
isn't it amazing
that Baek Kyung won her heart?

677
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,989
Don't you agree?

678
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,659
I was looking forward
to seeing Dan Oh.

679
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,390
Why couldn't she make it?

680
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,259
The thing is, Dan Oh isn't
so happy right now.

681
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,229
- What happened?
- Nothing.

682
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,100
She's just a bit tired
of her one-sided love.

683
00:55:18,999 --> 00:55:20,939
Please be nicer to her.

684
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:23,909
I trust you.

685
00:55:25,479 --> 00:55:26,479
Answer him.

686
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,580
Sure.

687
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,679
Bye, Chairman Eun.

688
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:40,519
Follow me.

689
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,729
You punk. How dare you?
Didn't I tell you already?

690
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,769
Why can't you be more pleasant
to that Dan Oh girl?

691
00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:52,300
Father.

692
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:55,110
Honey, please stop.

693
00:55:57,709 --> 00:56:00,409
Ma'am, you don't have to do that.

694
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,519
Just stay out of this.

695
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:09,090
What? You punk.

696
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,519
You little...

697
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,060
Fine, let's settle this for good.

698
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,219
Baek Kyung!

699
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:44,860
Why didn't you come yesterday?
You didn't pick up your phone.

700
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:46,860
What happened to your lip?

701
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,689
- Where's Dan Oh?
- Dan Oh?

702
00:56:49,229 --> 00:56:50,489
Where is she?

703
00:57:09,949 --> 00:57:10,979
I'm jealous.

704
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,620
You always have everything your way.

705
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:17,320
I'm not in the mood. Give me that.

706
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,719
Why didn't you come yesterday?

707
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:22,659
I can't believe I have to be
on stage even in this situation.

708
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,630
Just because.

709
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:26,800
Just because?

710
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:35,209
- What are you doing?
- Are you trying to provoke me?

711
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,580
Just continue to be all smitten
with me like you've always been!

712
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,380
Quit playing
this childish trick already.

713
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:53,519
You always get what you want.

714
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:56,090
Just because you're sick,
people would do anything for you.

715
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,630
They'd give you anything.

716
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,100
Don't talk about it that way.

717
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,300
Using your darn heart disease
as an excuse, you start crying...

718
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,570
and collapse all the time.

719
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:06,169
It's not like you're dying.

720
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:16,550
Let's go.

721
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,850
Dan Oh.

722
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,959
Who are you?

723
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,729
You won't remember
even if I tell you.

724
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,699
The scene will change soon.

725
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:13,040
(Extra-ordinary You)

726
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:15,409
Do you remember me?

727
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:16,870
All I know is
that it all started with you.

728
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,110
That's impressive.

729
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,310
Isn't that too harsh for an extra?

730
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,580
No one knows
when her heart will stop beating.

731
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,749
I need you to change the stage.

732
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:27,150
Stop Dan Oh.
That's your reason for existence.

733
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:28,820
I'll be at your birthday party.

734
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,519
Oh, my. This is
such a private and secret place.

735
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:32,689
What's our job?

736
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,189
To change the given story.

737
00:59:34,189 --> 00:59:35,429
You'd better stop.

738
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:36,830
Will the stage really change?

739
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,530
I'm going to ask Ju Da out today.

740
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:39,600
I'm doomed.

741
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,330
Ju Da, I have something to tell you.

742
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,429
- What's wrong?
- Nam Ju disappeared!

743
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:44,739
I have an announcement to make.

744
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:46,540
As of today, our engagement is off.
