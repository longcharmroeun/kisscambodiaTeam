00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,525
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:50,825
Oh, hey, Baek Kyung.

3
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,369
I'm trying to hang out
with my fiancee.

4
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,855
Stop bothering us.

5
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,784
Why do you keep bothering us?

6
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,194
Baek Kyung.

7
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,435
Let's go.

8
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,730
- What happened?
- What's going on?

9
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,805
Hey!

10
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,544
What's going on?

11
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,384
This way.

12
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,485
- Go over there!
- Go!

13
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,194
- Move aside.
- What is this?

14
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,119
This way.

15
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,119
Where are we going?

16
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,094
Hey, go that way.

17
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,194
Get that!

18
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,784
("Secret")

19
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,564
Are you...

20
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:13,790
("Secret")

21
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,935
looking for this?

22
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,444
("Secret")

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,384
I guess you were in a hurry
to come here in that outfit.

24
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,895
You.

25
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,254
Had a lot of fun to this day?

26
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,989
- How?
- You said...

27
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,664
you had a crush on me for 10 years.

28
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,395
Do I have to spell it out for you?

29
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,034
I know it's just your character,

30
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,034
but it's still disappointing.

31
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,844
Who are you?

32
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,615
You won't remember
even if I tell you.

33
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,155
The scene will change soon.

34
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,955
At first, I had no idea
what he was saying.

35
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:08,655
From today on,

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
- we're no longer engaged.
- You...

37
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,850
annoyed me for 10 years,
and you suddenly call that off?

38
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,194
My gosh. I had no idea
I could say such things.

39
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,264
Oh, my!

40
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,865
By the way,

41
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,129
is your face all right?

42
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:27,670
I know everything's planned out
and not real, but it still hurts.

43
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,345
You said all this nonsense about
characters, set-up, how it's fake.

44
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,369
But ridiculous things...

45
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,045
started to happen.

46
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,309
(You said you're disgusted
and irritated by my disease.)

47
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:39,309
(From today on,
we're no longer engaged.)

48
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:41,555
I understood everything
once I read that book.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,524
Do you know what's even funnier?

50
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,495
There was another person
who knew of this.

51
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,735
You do know that
she's my fiancee, don't you?

52
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,564
It was fun...

53
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,530
to see that extra was
trying his best.

54
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,175
Do Hwa, now.

55
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,499
You knew everything,
yet you kept doing this?

56
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:06,285
You're the one
who made a fool out of me first.

57
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,884
You and that extra
got a little too smart.

58
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,555
That's why he disappeared.

59
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,280
Don't talk about him like that.

60
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,725
You're just an extra.

61
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,980
Did you think you became...

62
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,095
one of the lead roles
by doing whatever you want?

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,564
What if you disappear too?

64
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,805
Dan Oh.

65
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,274
Don't be delusional.

66
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,144
You're just an extra too.

67
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,785
You're just a character
who might disappear at any moment...

68
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,185
because of your heart condition.

69
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,939
(Yes, you. What's your name?)

70
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,915
(Do you want to be a part of A3?)

71
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,555
Haru...

72
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,024
disappeared.

73
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,590
- Have you seen Haru?
- Who?

74
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,550
Haru! Number 13!

75
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,720
What do you mean?

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,489
Mo Beom is Number 13.

77
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:35,105
Dan Oh, perhaps, you're sick
in your head as well.

78
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,100
All I did was worry,
and she's ignoring me.

79
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,198
Let's go.

80
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,600
Dan Oh, are you sick?

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,504
- Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh.

82
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,274
Dan Oh, did you come here
dressed like that?

83
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,470
Sae Mi, have you seen Haru?

84
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,615
"Haru"?

85
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,079
"Hi, there. Dan Oh"?

86
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,850
Haru!

87
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,154
Hey, what's going on?

88
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,894
What should I do? Haru is...

89
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,504
He disappeared.

90
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,704
I warned him that helping you
would make him disappear.

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,004
And he made a choice.

92
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,675
He helped us even though
he knew he would disappear?

93
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,710
- Yes.
- You never told me...

94
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,139
that he'd disappear.

95
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,615
I've warned you several times.

96
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,254
I said changing one thing
would change everything else.

97
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,384
You should be relieved...

98
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,454
that he's the only one who's gone.

99
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,720
How could you say such a thing?

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,964
After what has happened,
we can't predict the future anymore.

101
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,564
How much more will you destroy
this world just for your own sake?

102
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,435
Then...

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,160
Are you saying he disappeared
because of me?

104
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,305
That's right.

105
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,615
You're the one
who changed the story.

106
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,824
Haru!

107
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,694
Haru!

108
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,495
Haru!

109
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,699
Haru! Haru!

110
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,875
Dan Oh.

111
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:19,629
Stop it.

112
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,045
Then what should I do?

113
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,499
If I can find the storyboard,
I'd be able to find him.

114
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,045
But I can't find it.

115
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,745
What if he disappears for good?

116
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,884
All that I can do...

117
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,855
is search for him.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,625
Haru!

119
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,345
I think that one's better.

120
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,485
You're right.

121
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,054
- This one?
- Yes.

122
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,664
Baek Kyung.

123
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,235
Take it. It's for her.

124
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,034
Let's go. Jun Hyun must be waiting.

125
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,674
They should be here.

126
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,115
Are you waiting for someone?

127
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,355
Goodness, it's nice to meet you.

128
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:13,949
- Who are you?
- I've heard a lot about you...

129
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,625
from Chairman Eun.

130
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,355
He's President Baek of Silver Moon.

131
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,294
My name is Baek Dae Sung.

132
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,189
What a surprise.

133
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,359
I know.

134
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,219
You came all the way to the store.

135
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,160
The rumors about how detailed
you are must be true.

136
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,835
No wonder Serinne Fashion
became globally successful.

137
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,815
I'm guessing you got a gift
for someone.

138
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,784
He insisted that he buy
his fiancee's gift from here.

139
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,780
You're talking about Dan Oh, right?

140
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,914
"Dan Oh"?

141
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,024
She's Chairman Eun's daughter.
I told you last time.

142
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:51,995
This is a lovely coincidence.

143
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,894
We should meet together
with our children once.

144
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,819
Sure, I hope to see you soon.

145
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:57,894
Of course.

146
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,835
I should've done that sooner.

147
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,245
Do you consider this a gift?

148
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,575
I think you're just using her.

149
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,384
Watch what you say.

150
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:18,239
Father, for the first time,
I'm starting to pity her.

151
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,985
I'm doing something nice for a girl
who doesn't have much time to live.

152
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,719
Are you sure you're not
stepping over the line?

153
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,054
Watch what you say.

154
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,164
Don't be rude to your father.

155
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,995
Pick it up.

156
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,134
Pick it up.

157
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,605
Baek Kyung.

158
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,274
Baek Kyung!

159
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,434
I warned him that helping you
would make him disappear.

160
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,335
And he made a choice.

161
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,335
Are you saying he disappeared
because of me?

162
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:12,760
That's right.

163
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,705
You're the one
who changed the story.

164
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,475
I've given it a lot of thought.

165
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,945
I won't rebel anymore.

166
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,615
I'll do whatever the writer
intends me to do.

167
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,325
So tell me.

168
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,095
How can I find him?

169
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,264
Everything has consequences.

170
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,605
You wanted to change
your character, didn't you?

171
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,575
The consequence...

172
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,674
was Haru.

173
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,384
You need to shoot
in this perfect posture.

174
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,709
Gosh, it's not working.

175
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,179
That's not right.

176
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,020
Focus on the tip of your foot
when you kick.

177
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,495
That way, it'll go right in.

178
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,995
I'll show you.

179
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,599
Don't you think the girls
will go crazy during Sports Day?

180
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:51,630
- No!
- No!

181
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,829
- "No"?
- He's so scary!

182
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:55,729
- There's Nam Ju.
- "Nam Ju"?

183
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,144
Over there.

184
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,670
Should we ask Do Hwa
to play soccer with us?

185
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,315
Hey, don't say that!

186
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,654
- What did you just say?
- What?

187
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,215
What?

188
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,410
Come here.

189
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,410
- Us?
- Us?

190
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,585
Us?

191
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,719
I'm pretty sure I kicked Do Hwa out
of A3.

192
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,650
- Right.
- But still, it's Do Hwa.

193
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,164
Hey.

194
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,589
Do Hwa is not that good anymore.
Don't you think so?

195
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,130
- Right.
- He lost to Nam Ju...

196
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,189
during the swimming competition.

197
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,500
- Right, you were so good.
- Exactly.

198
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,345
Do Hwa. I mean, Nam Ju.

199
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,870
Do Hwa is not on your level.

200
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,369
You're the best.

201
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,044
- Am I?
- Of course, you are.

202
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,115
Hey, what are you doing?

203
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,855
What is it? Is there a problem?

204
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,150
- We're not allowed to...
- Hey.

205
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,620
- What?
- "What?"

206
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,250
- Hey.
- What is it?

207
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,634
You're afraid
Nam Ju will know, right?

208
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,390
We were going to go back in anyway.
Let's go.

209
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,160
I'm hungry. Do you want
to go to the snack bar?

210
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,629
- Let's go.
- I want to go.

211
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,774
Let's go.

212
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,245
Let's go.

213
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,575
I'm about to go crazy.

214
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,355
Do Hwa.

215
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,579
About what you said
at Nam Ju's birthday party...

216
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,654
Forget it.

217
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,054
How could I tell her to forget
about my sincerity?

218
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,325
- What?
- Just forget about it.

219
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,195
I think that's for the best.

220
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,029
Thanks. You're a great friend.

221
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,945
I'll forever be just a friend
to you on stage.

222
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,245
I'll see you later.

223
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,384
Bye.

224
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:01,959
Do Hwa.

225
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,975
Didn't I tell you that
you're no longer a part of A3?

226
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:07,745
I wanted to play the violin...

227
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,914
just because I wanted to,
not because someone told me to.

228
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,914
I was curious about how I'd feel.

229
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,414
It consoled me.

230
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,154
Nam Ju.

231
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:23,995
Let me ask you one thing.

232
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,524
Ask.

233
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,764
If you had the chance
to watch Ju Da and me...

234
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,465
spending time together like a deity,

235
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,095
what would you do?

236
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,004
I won't watch you two.

237
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,760
I will not be a coward...

238
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,134
and just watch the girl I like
spending time with another guy.

239
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,605
You are cool even outside the stage.

240
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,170
This feels awful...

241
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,375
because I feel like I'm cheating.

242
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,774
As if.

243
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,815
Did you think
you'd be a match for me?

244
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,485
Right.

245
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,010
It would've been nice
had I known that sooner.

246
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,510
Then, your birthday party
would have been cooler,

247
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,424
Ju Da would've been happy,

248
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,264
and Haru would still have been here.

249
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,764
Then, Dan Oh wouldn't
be having a hard time now.

250
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:10,305
Nam Ju.

251
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,204
I'm sorry.

252
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,105
Haru?

253
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,345
Aren't you going to the music class?

254
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,924
Drink it.

255
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,144
My goodness, stop acting so silly.

256
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,980
Dan Oh, I heard...

257
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,409
a great bakery opened up
in front of our school.

258
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:33,409
Do you want to check it out?

259
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:34,710
Bakery? Let's go with Haru.

260
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,109
Haru likes bread too.

261
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:37,224
Haru?

262
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,595
"Haru"? Were you trying
to say, "Hi, there"?

263
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,020
Are you serious?
Are you from the old days?

264
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,694
You should say, "DH".

265
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,059
What does that mean?

266
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,204
Dan Oh, hi.

267
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,234
That was so lame.

268
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,704
Hi, there. Dan Oh.

269
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,230
Attention. Everyone, attention.

270
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,669
As for the song
you are going to play today,

271
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,339
the tempo may vary
depending on the player.

272
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,869
So it's important
to follow the score precisely.

273
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,079
Who wants to play this song?

274
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,879
- Number 13.
- Yes.

275
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,954
Number 13? Haru?

276
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,865
Haru is Number 13.

277
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,434
How could no one remember him?

278
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,244
How could this be possible?

279
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,540
How is this possible?

280
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,644
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

281
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:37,884
Come with me.

282
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,164
Dan Oh, have you gone mad?

283
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,765
But you remember him, don't you?

284
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,005
Please.

285
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,234
Please tell me
that you remember him.

286
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,045
I do.

287
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,644
I remember him.

288
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,244
So stop it.

289
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,855
That's enough, Dan Oh.

290
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,105
What are you doing here?

291
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,105
I'm having a hard day today.

292
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,499
Are you also sad
because of that guy, Haru?

293
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,744
That too.

294
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,875
What? What?

295
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,015
Baek Kyung, did you...

296
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:45,515
When did this happen?
Does Dan Oh know this too?

297
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,085
She doesn't know?

298
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,010
When she finds out
you're aware of yourself now,

299
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,454
Dan Oh will be happy too.

300
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,319
Or not. She's too shocked
to process that Haru is gone.

301
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,694
She might not be happy about it.

302
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,290
I can't believe
you're aware of yourself now.

303
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,365
That's such comforting news, buddy.

304
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,134
I don't even know
where this story...

305
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,974
is headed.

306
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,414
Hey, Dan Oh.

307
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,714
Why do you keep stealing my seat?

308
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,085
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,525
Make yourself comfortable.

310
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:26,224
Hey, let's go.

311
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,015
Dan Oh.

312
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,625
Haru.

313
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,434
Are you looking for him again?

314
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,545
What's wrong? Why don't you
scream how you did earlier?

315
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,285
Go away.

316
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,085
How could you weep
over the disappearance of an extra?

317
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,255
Hey.

318
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,224
Dan Oh, I'm talking to you.

319
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,434
Hey.

320
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,365
Get in.

321
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,800
I don't need a ride.
My driver will pick me up.

322
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,045
Just get in.

323
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,075
Please.

324
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,714
Just get in the car, please.

325
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,085
Hey.

326
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:05,914
Why don't you just get in the car?

327
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,224
Are you all right?

328
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,974
You've been crying the whole day.

329
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,994
Put this on your eyes.

330
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,845
Are you that upset?

331
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,055
You barely ate your meal.
And you're crying all the time.

332
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:16,954
Yes.

333
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,154
I'm so upset that I might die.

334
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,924
I feel like this is all my fault.

335
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:25,565
I'll do whatever that jerk
did for you.

336
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:29,434
I can help you change the story.

337
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,005
Only Haru can do that.

338
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,744
You're bringing him up again.

339
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:38,515
Is that what he told you?

340
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,184
Did he ask you to change
this world with him?

341
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:44,255
You can still have a comfortable
life without doing so.

342
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,309
You have a decent house
and a nice family.

343
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,085
And you have friends who adore you.

344
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,525
I'm dying.

345
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,649
If the writer draws a scene
in which I die,

346
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,095
I'll die right away.

347
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,894
That's my set-up.

348
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,159
A female high school student
with a terminal disease...

349
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,565
that can kill her
anywhere and anytime.

350
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:06,704
- Hey.
- But all of my remaining time...

351
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,775
is only used for main characters
or supporting characters like you.

352
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,144
I'm your fiancee...

353
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,309
and a classmate
with Nam Ju and Ju Da.

354
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,015
But before that, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

355
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,180
You would never know
how desperate I am...

356
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,724
to spend my time for myself.

357
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,625
You would never know.

358
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,894
Goodbye.

359
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,154
Are you Yeo Ju Da?

360
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,855
What's all this?

361
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,750
Just take it.

362
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,295
Students of Seuli High School
must live with dignity.

363
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,694
A broken bicycle
and working as a part-timer?

364
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,875
If your grandmother is ill,

365
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,775
I'm sure you need to earn
every single penny.

366
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:16,505
How did you know?

367
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,515
Nam Ju told me.

368
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:19,970
He did?

369
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,884
You're one of
our scholarship students,

370
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:25,109
so Nam Ju has been
concerned about you...

371
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:27,214
because of our company's image
and all.

372
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,924
Here, if you need anything,

373
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,125
feel free to contact me.

374
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,494
I'm very grateful,
but I'll just accept your thoughts.

375
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,035
Just take it
while I'm offering it to you.

376
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,234
There is something in life
that's more important than pride.

377
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,375
Let's go.

378
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,154
You fool.

379
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:16,734
Who dares to knock A3's hideout?

380
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,305
I looked everywhere for you.

381
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:25,515
Me? Do you have anything to say?

382
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,214
I thought I should
give this back to you.

383
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
What are you doing?

384
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,149
- I had fun playing Cinderella.
- Cinderella?

385
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,924
Once the clock hits midnight,
the glass slippers, the dress,

386
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,164
and the carriage all disappear.

387
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,295
It feels pretty miserable.

388
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,664
Goodbye, Nam Ju.

389
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:57,644
Okay, microphone test.

390
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,414
1, 2, 3.

391
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,639
Ladies and gentlemen.

392
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:07,355
Welcome to Sports Day
of Seuli High School!

393
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,355
(The 112th
Seuli High School Sports Day)

394
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,095
(The 112th
Seuli High School Sports Day)

395
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,305
- All right!
- Let's go!

396
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:26,505
(MVP, third place, winner)

397
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,375
- Keep it up!
- 1, 2, 1, 2.

398
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,285
(Medical Aid)

399
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,355
No!

400
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,450
Gosh, I'm dying of heat.

401
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,724
Why couldn't the writer
give me short sleeves?

402
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:51,859
Or maybe give me less work.

403
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,359
I know we're in a comic book,

404
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,559
but how come
those students never study?

405
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,760
These high school students are
living a life far from the reality.

406
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,345
What's all this?

407
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,144
What is this?

408
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:06,214
Don't I make
this awful T-shirt look great?

409
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,214
Dan Oh's class's T-shirt is
even worse.

410
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,154
You looked pretty depressed
yesterday. Feeling better?

411
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:15,450
How did you know?

412
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,625
It seems like
you know quite a lot about me.

413
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,164
I need to be like this
to keep up my energy.

414
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,795
You're right. It's like that.

415
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,529
No way.

416
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,605
Why?

417
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,545
What's wrong?

418
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,311
(Episode 14 will air shortly.)

419
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,744
(Episode 14)

420
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,325
(Nam Ju and Kids)

421
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,054
Hot pink?

422
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:52,794
So tacky.

423
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,894
"Nam Ju and Kids"?

424
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,164
So childish.

425
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,389
Okay, 5 junior students in class 7.

426
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:00,690
They're getting ready to run.

427
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,999
Do you see everyone cheering?
All right, now.

428
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:07,900
Okay, then. It looks like
the teacher is about to get started.

429
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,875
Okay. On your mark.

430
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,240
Get set, go!

431
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,070
- Go!
- Keep running!

432
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,070
- Go, come on!
- Run, run.

433
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,354
Keep running!

434
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,040
Who's the winner? Isn't that Ju Da?

435
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,680
That's Ju Da!

436
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,054
Ju Da wins!

437
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,094
Yes!

438
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,220
- Yes, Nam Ju!
- There's Nam Ju.

439
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,919
- Nam Ju!
- Yes!

440
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,265
All right!

441
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:36,134
Hey, okay.

442
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,000
Ju Da, I'm sorry.
It's a misunderstanding.

443
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,099
Will you hear me out?

444
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,169
What? No?

445
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,840
Hey, Ju Da.
Apologize to me immediately.

446
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,099
I never said that.

447
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,614
What are you doing here?

448
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,944
What? Well.

449
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,415
Can't you see?
I'm practicing soccer.

450
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,149
You aren't practicing soccer.
You're practicing your apology.

451
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:59,118
The misunderstanding will be
resolved without you trying so hard.

452
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,924
That's the life of the lead roles.

453
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,094
Wait.

454
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,364
Don't tell Ju Da.

455
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,935
I won't.

456
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,734
I trust you.

457
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,364
I envy you.

458
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,775
You two will end up
seeing a happy ending.

459
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,569
On your mark.

460
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,610
- Come on, get ready!
- Get ready!

461
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,670
- All right!
- We can do it!

462
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,980
- We can do it!
- Get ready!

463
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,754
- All right!
- It's Nam Ju!

464
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,754
Hey, Nam Ju.

465
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:30,355
Hey, man.

466
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,649
- My gosh, it's Nam Ju.
- It's Nam Ju.

467
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:36,825
Get set, go!

468
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,734
You cheated!

469
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:47,899
Will he be able to pass?

470
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,899
He fails!

471
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,899
Let's see what she does.

472
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,375
Go lower.

473
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:56,585
- What was that?
- No way.

474
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:58,055
Keep it up!

475
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,425
Who was that?

476
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,365
- Gosh!
- Get him!

477
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:19,634
Hey, that's mine.

478
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,305
Everyone is having fun.

479
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,044
The world seems fine
even without Haru.

480
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,239
Okay, we're going to do
a three-legged race next.

481
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,910
If you wish to participate,
you can come to me and...

482
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,140
Be quiet!

483
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,185
Su Chul! Turn off your microphone.

484
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,709
It's scorching hot out here.

485
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,254
We aren't elementary school kids.
Who would want to do that?

486
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,119
I was told by our teacher.

487
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,390
I'll do it.

488
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,264
- Baek Kyung!
- I'll do it with you.

489
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,890
You can get some rest.

490
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,965
Baek Kyung, I'll run with you.

491
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,104
- No way.
- Stop fighting.

492
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,205
(Baek Kyung loves Dan Oh.)

493
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,175
Gosh, can the writer be any worse?

494
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,115
Baek Kyung, will you run
in the three-legged race?

495
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,540
Of course, they will.

496
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,980
She's his only fiancee.

497
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,179
- Gosh. "Fiancee"?
- How awesome! Husband Baek!

498
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,194
- Husband Baek!
- Husband Baek!

499
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,820
- Husband Baek!
- I don't want to.

500
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,890
Husband Baek!

501
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,564
Why did you prepare this?

502
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,264
Because I was happy.

503
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:21,134
About what?

504
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,905
I've never participated
in a sports day before.

505
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:25,604
I'm happy.

506
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:28,645
My time with you has become
even more special.

507
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,284
(Baek Kyung loves Dan Oh.)

508
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,254
Dan Oh.

509
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:40,854
Where are you going?

510
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,995
Our stage is over.

511
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,764
You didn't care about it
when you were with him.

512
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,995
You'll always have to be by my side.

513
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,360
Because that's what
the writer intends.

514
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,205
No. That's just who you are.

515
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:58,235
It's natural for you
to always like me.

516
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,274
Don't you think
we have distanced ourselves...

517
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,115
because of that mere extra?

518
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,545
Nothing has changed.

519
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:09,785
My true self...

520
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,014
never liked you.

521
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,964
Tie your shoelaces well.
You better not trip.

522
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,819
Dan Oh, are you sure you can run?

523
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:28,264
Of course. I have him.

524
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,675
The power of love is strong, indeed.

525
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,305
All right. 1, 2...

526
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,464
This is so cruel.

527
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:00,829
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to be here.

528
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:03,134
I hate everything that's going on.

529
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

530
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,475
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

531
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,970
- Hey, let's take a break.
- Let's do that.

532
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,230
1, 2.

533
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,345
(The average heart rate)

534
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,045
Again?

535
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,745
Give me a minute.

536
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,254
- What's going on?
- He's leaving.

537
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:16,074
Haru?

538
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,884
Haru.

539
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,605
Here you were.

540
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,204
What is this?

541
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,334
The teacher wants everyone
to practice the dodge ball.

542
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,714
Are you okay?

543
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,714
I found you.

544
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,055
I thought our shirts were tacky.

545
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:07,725
But I'm so relieved.

546
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:11,834
I could spot you from afar.

547
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:15,764
I won't let you go anymore.

548
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,274
What's wrong with you?

549
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,074
You're crumpling it.

550
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,504
What?

551
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,144
Don't touch me when you talk.

552
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,384
Let's go.

553
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,725
Dan Oh! Dan Oh!

554
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,685
What is this?

555
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,720
(Haru, Male, 18 years old)

556
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,654
(Tennis team, loyal to Baek Kyung)

557
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,334
Isn't that guy next to Baek Kyung...

558
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,194
Haru?

559
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,605
What's wrong?

560
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:54,170
Let's go.

561
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,499
(Haru, Male, 18 years old)

562
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:58,875
(Tennis team, loyal to Baek Kyung)

563
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,574
This is him.

564
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,069
But why?

565
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:04,239
(Haru, Male, 18 years old)

566
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,485
(Tennis team, loyal to Baek Kyung)

567
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,065
What? He's appearing
alongside Baek Kyung.

568
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,235
It's exactly like the book.

569
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:20,965
Baek Kyung.

570
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,689
You're so mean.

571
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,504
Are you ignoring me just because
I'm no longer an A3 member?

572
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,205
Oh, I'm sorry.

573
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:29,205
Who is he?

574
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,939
He's in my tennis team.

575
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:32,075
Hey, Do Hwa.

576
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,044
No way! He even has lines?

577
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,085
Hey, good luck dealing with him.

578
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,154
He may seem rude at times,
but he's a nice guy.

579
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:44,355
Do Hwa.

580
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:47,595
- Don't tell Nam Ju that...
- Stay out of it.

581
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,595
That's between him and me.

582
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,434
Bye.

583
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,189
I'll see you guys
at the soccer match.

584
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:55,965
You better play fair and square.

585
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,404
Bye.

586
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,240
Haru! Haru!

587
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,509
Where have you been?
I was worried sick about you.

588
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,615
"Worried sick"?

589
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,280
Don't joke around with me.

590
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,715
Dan Oh will get hurt.

591
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,754
I think you're the one
joking around.

592
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,125
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

593
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,154
Let's go.

594
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,995
Baek Kyung, something's strange,
isn't it?

595
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,565
It's Haru.

596
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,894
But it's not him.

597
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,835
Aren't you coming?

598
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,534
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

599
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,674
Hey.

600
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,845
Who is he?

601
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,315
Haru.

602
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,620
My father sent these
in the early morning.

603
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,865
Drink up.

604
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:08,199
It's so refreshing.

605
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,699
What did your parents send?

606
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,144
They sent several food trucks
run by chefs.

607
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,784
My mother sent some baristas.

608
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:17,410
But they should've sent
food trucks just like yours did.

609
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,615
Hey, baristas are better than
what our family sent.

610
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:22,179
My grandpa set up massage chairs
in each classroom,

611
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,595
saying the students would be sore
from all the exercise.

612
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,894
Everyone is pitching in.

613
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,589
I hope there's no one
at our school...

614
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,565
who'll try to enjoy all that
so shamelessly.

615
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,934
Don't be like that.
Ju Da will be hurt.

616
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,475
Ju Da, you should take some home.

617
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,945
You don't get to have these
every day.

618
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,625
Here.

619
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,095
Thanks.

620
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,420
How did you know
this was my favorite?

621
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,495
I read it.

622
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,495
- You read it?
- Drinking it like this is tasty.

623
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,144
You know me very well.

624
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,705
It must be
because you're my guardian angel.

625
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,644
I don't deserve to be one.

626
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,569
What?

627
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:24,270
A guardian angel...

628
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,455
doesn't just stand there
when you're being bullied.

629
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,524
I'm always so apologetic...

630
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,695
to you and the kids.

631
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,134
Your shirt is really cute.

632
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,089
I didn't know
you could be sarcastic.

633
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,404
I'm not being sarcastic.
You're really cute.

634
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,404
You're just like Nam Ju.

635
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,439
You're lovely, good-looking,
and adorable...

636
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,245
both on and off the stage.

637
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,985
About Haru becoming
an entirely different person...

638
00:42:58,809 --> 00:42:59,955
and everything else
that has happened,

639
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:02,554
I think it was all
because of my greed.

640
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,225
Ju Da.

641
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,164
I'm sorry.

642
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,105
Why aren't you practicing?

643
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,634
I should.

644
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,000
Are you seriously going to listen
to the teacher and practice?

645
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,370
- Aren't you guys tired?
- I know, right?

646
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,969
- They're not all here anyway.
- Let's rest.

647
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:30,939
If an A3 wants to practice,
just do it without complaining.

648
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:33,414
That's right. You're always right.
Wait for me.

649
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:35,455
Yes, the ones who are already here
can practice together.

650
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,725
Even that annoying brat, Ju Da,
isn't here for the first time.

651
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,979
Let's go.

652
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:42,565
- Hold on.
- Wait up.

653
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,195
Haru.

654
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,965
It doesn't seem like you're lying.

655
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:52,674
But we'll see...

656
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,504
if you're pretending
not to remember...

657
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,014
or if you really can't.

658
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,884
Ball! Here's the ball.

659
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,325
20 seconds.

660
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,125
Haru.

661
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:11,855
Haru, don't you remember me?

662
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,520
A long time ago,
when we played dodgeball,

663
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,790
you kept me safe.

664
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,189
- Here it goes.
- Hey.

665
00:44:17,189 --> 00:44:18,589
Back then, you didn't have a name.

666
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,664
But I knew you would come
and save me.

667
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,304
Haru, do you really
not remember that? No?

668
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,235
My gosh.

669
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,804
- Yes!
- Nice.

670
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:31,068
- Stop taking photos.
- Hey.

671
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,315
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Here we go again.

672
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,345
- Get this.
- Over there.

673
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,254
- Hey.
- Get away from there.

674
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,565
- You have to dodge the ball.
- Hey, hide in a corner.

675
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,875
Good job.

676
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:15,910
- We won.
- We won.

677
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,184
- We won!
- My gosh.

678
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:25,264
- We won.
- We won.

679
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,429
- Haru.
- Haru.

680
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,189
Haru, will you play soccer too?

681
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:32,329
I'm just on the bench.

682
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,459
You can play soccer too? I thought
you were in the tennis team.

683
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:35,644
Baek Kyung put him on the list.

684
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,544
I bet he'll pretend to die
if Baek Kyung tells him to do that.

685
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,184
Here. Baek Kyung told me
to give this to you.

686
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:51,894
You don't have the scar.

687
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,825
You had a scar in a diagonal line
on your left hand.

688
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,995
I never had a scar.

689
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:06,804
Baek Kyung.

690
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:09,199
So did you give that to her?

691
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,274
Yes.

692
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,585
Gosh, she keeps fainting
which is annoying.

693
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,815
I need to give her a present
once in a while,

694
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,554
so she bothers me less.

695
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,924
- Is that so?
- Haru.

696
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,380
When we played dodgeball earlier...

697
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,524
Dodgeball?

698
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,794
When did we play dodgeball?

699
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,325
I didn't play dodgeball.

700
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:32,134
Yes, you did.

701
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:34,534
Our team won.

702
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,205
You hit Dan Oh with the ball.

703
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,835
What are you talking about?

704
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:39,400
Did you have a dream?

705
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,030
Stop talking nonsense
and get ready to play.

706
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,504
Do Hwa wants to have
a fair match with you.

707
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,274
I'll get going.

708
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,945
It's as expected.

709
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,754
You remember the stage,
but not the shadow.

710
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:56,625
Because you're not aware
of yourself anymore?

711
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,695
What are you saying?

712
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,965
- Great, Do Hwa.
- He's great.

713
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,404
Do Hwa!

714
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,760
- Do Hwa.
- Hey.

715
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,845
Let's go.

716
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,630
- Right here.
- You're so good!

717
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,740
- Keep going!
- Yes!

718
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,384
- Nam Ju!
- Go, Nam Ju!

719
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,845
There you go!

720
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,254
(MVP of the Year, Oh Nam Ju)

721
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,825
- There's Baek Kyung.
- Fair-Skinned Baek Kyung.

722
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,894
- Go, Baek Kyung!
- Hey, I got it.

723
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,365
- Okay.
- Okay.

724
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,319
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

725
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,130
- That's all right.
- Baek Kyung!

726
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,264
Nice.

727
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,345
Okay.

728
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:57,285
Come on.

729
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:58,879
That was so cool.

730
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,480
My gosh, Baek Kyung.

731
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,125
Let's win this match!

732
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,480
Hey, what are you doing?

733
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,879
I'm not in the mood for this.

734
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:09,619
Even if you're not in the mood,

735
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:10,889
cheer for him.

736
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,490
- Baek Kyung is really good.
- Baek Kyung!

737
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,760
- Go, Baek Kyung.
- That was great.

738
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,335
- That was awesome, Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

739
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:18,234
(Haru)

740
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,505
Hey.

741
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,744
It's about Dan Oh.

742
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:27,944
Okay.

743
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
You know her, don't you?

744
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,555
Hey, everyone in our school
knows who she is.

745
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,984
She's your fiancee.

746
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:35,184
Weren't you close with her?

747
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,325
- Me?
- Yes.

748
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:38,825
Why would I be close with her?

749
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,825
You should take care
of your fiancee.

750
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,065
Right.

751
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,424
No one but I should
take care of her.

752
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:50,664
You came back
as a completely different person.

753
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:52,674
What do you mean?

754
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,805
I'm saying that I like...

755
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,575
you.

756
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,250
His name and face are the same,

757
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,154
but he only lost his memory.

758
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,825
And he has a set-up now.

759
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,765
On top of that,
he has lines on the stage too.

760
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:25,805
("Secret")

761
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:28,605
I wonder
if he's pretending not to know...

762
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,944
or if he really doesn't
remember her.

763
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:36,815
I wonder if the change
will be someone's set-up...

764
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,585
or someone's story.

765
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,875
"Wait".

766
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,305
That's what the flower symbolizes.

767
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,384
What's your problem?

768
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,154
So it's really true.

769
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,154
You really are Haru.

770
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,295
Your personality has changed a bit,

771
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,265
but actually, you're
more like your old character now.

772
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,494
What about your hand?
It doesn't hurt anymore?

773
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:28,835
Have you gone mad?

774
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:31,634
I've never seen this happen either.

775
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,944
I'm not sure
if this is a good thing or not.

776
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,644
I should let time take care of it.

777
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:41,809
All right. You have to do it
from the bottom like this.

778
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:43,585
- You must straighten your back...
- Right.

779
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,879
and kick.

780
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,040
This isn't for tennis.

781
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,210
- No.
- Strike from below. Use your back.

782
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,250
- That's it.
- Like this.

783
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,409
- Just like this?
- You have to hit it far.

784
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,394
I noticed that you use
your wrists a lot.

785
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,550
You don't know anything.

786
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,065
Hot pink...

787
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:57,095
He stands out too much.

788
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:00,095
He should at least
stay out of my sight.

789
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,990
Gosh, that doesn't look right.

790
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,290
- You have the right form.
- Right.

791
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,159
- You should practice harder.
- Use your legs more.

792
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:06,659
- Use your back.
- Right.

793
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:08,575
- Strike it gently.
- No, his wrist...

794
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,845
- Hey, don't snap your wrists.
- I don't do that.

795
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,770
If Tae Ho finds out later...

796
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,515
that one of the cameras
ended up with me...

797
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,125
I cursed at Tae Ho
for the first time in my life.

798
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,619
I won't let you go anymore.

799
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:31,765
What's wrong with you?

800
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,394
You're crumpling it.

801
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:42,129
Dan Oh, why don't you go
and check who it is?

802
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:44,545
I bet you'll be happy to see
this unexpected guest.

803
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,075
Okay. Coming.

804
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,125
My gosh,
you didn't have to bring all that.

805
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:01,424
I know it's a bad manner
to visit you at such a late hour,

806
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,265
but I lost out to
my son's determination.

807
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:07,565
Look. Baek Kyung bought
a present for you, Dan Oh.

808
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:10,030
Gosh, my apologies
for making you stand here.

809
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,904
- All right. Come on in.
- Okay.

810
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,909
Baek Kyung, you're getting
more good-looking day by day.

811
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,484
That's too kind of you.

812
00:52:28,649 --> 00:52:30,980
I don't feel good, so I'm going
upstairs. Please excuse me.

813
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,050
Are you not well?

814
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,220
- Should we go to the hospital now?
- Stop with your act.

815
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,825
You're not even worried.

816
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,865
Besides, I didn't buy this present.

817
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,335
You did...

818
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,930
because you wanted to make
a good impression on her.

819
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,460
Hey, have you gone mad?

820
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,605
What's the point of playing along?
They won't even remember.

821
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:49,270
It doesn't matter who bought it.

822
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,204
It's all right
as long as it's for Dan Oh.

823
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:53,644
"For Dan Oh"?

824
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,045
Sir, I'm asking you
because I'm truly curious.

825
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:58,480
Can't you see that...

826
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,510
he's trying to use your sick
daughter to get your approval?

827
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,780
- Hey, Baek Kyung.
- Have you lost your mind?

828
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,255
No, I have not unlike you guys.

829
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,619
Baek Kyung, you're getting
more good-looking day by day.

830
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,994
That's too kind of you.

831
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:16,265
My gosh, this must've been
really hard to buy this.

832
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,964
Thank you, Baek Kyung.

833
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:21,734
I guess he wanted to come here
at this late hour for a reason.

834
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:25,275
I wanted to see her happy
as soon as I could.

835
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,944
Goodness.
Baek Kyung, you're such a romantic.

836
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,615
I'm going to focus on Dan Oh now.

837
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,855
You have no choice
but to marry him now.

838
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,780
Shall we set a date?

839
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,818
I'll be happy to
as long as Dan Oh is happy with it.

840
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:40,694
I should do everything she wants.

841
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,525
All right.
Please have some refreshments.

842
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,700
Did you have
to make a ruckus like that?

843
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,960
As long as I'm not on the stage,

844
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,700
I can do whatever I want
wherever I am.

845
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,275
You should at least feel sorry.

846
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,684
Your family is using my family
because of money.

847
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,214
What about that?

848
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,240
I just do things the way it's drawn
unlike you,

849
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,424
who wants to change things around.

850
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,355
But...

851
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,795
you make me annoyed,
angry, and irritated.

852
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,724
- What?
- Let me ask you something.

853
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,790
Do you want to be
more than an extra?

854
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,164
Or do you want to change
your set-up for terminal illness?

855
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:26,904
Or is it him?

856
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,444
He can't change your destiny.

857
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:31,944
I'm the one who can.

858
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,315
Not just an extra, your partner
in this comic book, Baek Baek Kyung.

859
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,285
I'll help you.

860
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,325
I mean it.

861
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,194
Chairman Eun thinks
you honestly like Dan Oh.

862
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,164
I just did as I was told.

863
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:57,505
Great work.

864
00:54:57,629 --> 00:55:01,275
If you insist that you won't
marry her like last time,

865
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,144
I won't consider you as my son.

866
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:06,099
Don't ruin everything
because of your rebellious spirit.

867
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:07,974
Marry her no matter what happens.

868
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:11,714
Answer me.

869
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,355
Yes.

870
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:18,755
Take this.

871
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,505
Darn it, President Baek.
You're always the same.

872
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,408
I'm not rebelling. I mean it.

873
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:45,909
I'm a character who can't say a word
to my biological father...

874
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,384
who uses me as a tool because
I don't want to be abandoned.

875
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,525
It's just awful.

876
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,180
What did you just say?

877
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,365
I told you that
you won't remember anyway.

878
00:55:56,849 --> 00:55:58,025
You little jerk.

879
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,134
Who's there?

880
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,835
Baek Kyung?

881
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,974
Why are you here at this hour?

882
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,474
I came to get my racket.

883
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:50,109
We have to practice
tomorrow morning.

884
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:51,444
Darn it, I thought...

885
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,954
- What's that?
- Oh, this?

886
00:56:56,909 --> 00:56:59,025
I left an important book here.

887
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,424
Have you...

888
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:05,224
ever seen this book?

889
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:08,734
("Secret")

890
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:12,734
No.

891
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,704
Should I have seen it?

892
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:16,505
Oh, no.

893
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:20,775
What's with your face?

894
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,545
What's with your face?

895
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:25,755
Oh, things happened.

896
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,154
Are you okay?

897
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,154
That's weird.

898
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,720
What is?

899
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,194
You're worried about me...

900
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,164
at this point in time,

901
00:57:38,149 --> 00:57:39,394
and of all people, you.

902
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,535
I thought everything was
already decided in this world.

903
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:48,159
But there are such variables.

904
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:50,545
("Secret")

905
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,644
I don't want to be an extra...

906
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:57,015
that can vanish whenever, wherever,
and however the writer wants.

907
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,815
I decided to be the only person
who can change...

908
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:02,924
someone's fate.

909
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,279
If there's no answer
as to how I came to this world,

910
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,194
I will make my own answer...

911
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:12,265
with Dan Oh.

912
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,484
This was the only place
I could think of.

913
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:39,194
Haru came back.

914
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,924
I know.

915
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,424
But he can't remember me.

916
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:48,694
Didn't you say you'll do anything
if he can come back?

917
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,664
Dan Oh.

918
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,075
You're one needy girl.

919
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,904
Why?

920
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:00,174
Are you going to run after him
and make him self-aware again?

921
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,115
No.

922
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:07,585
I loved it
whenever Haru and I...

923
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,555
changed the story together.

924
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,194
I didn't care
if the story got twisted.

925
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,795
I had the hope
that I might be able to live.

926
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,164
I thought the answer
I could create in this world is...

927
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,075
to change my fate to face death
as a terminally-ill patient.

928
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,805
But...

929
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,615
I became frightened of everything
ever since Haru disappeared.

930
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,115
I tell myself that
I should just live as an extra.

931
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,825
But then I get really scared.

932
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,494
I don't want to die.

933
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,134
Haru was the only one
who helped me find my answer.

934
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,505
But it's...

935
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:06,015
But it's all ruined now.

936
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,894
I will make my own answer.

937
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:48,575
With you.

938
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:39,035
(Extra-ordinary You)
