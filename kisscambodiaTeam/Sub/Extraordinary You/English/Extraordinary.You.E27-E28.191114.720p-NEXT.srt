2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,116
I need...

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,445
to change the stage.

4
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:45,115
Man, my brother has one odd taste.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,639
But you look kind of similar to him.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,341
He's the only guy who would
dress like that in this world.

7
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,811
The writer would have no idea...

8
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:53,626
that this is you
even if the stage begins.

9
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,820
But doing this
won't make Dan Oh's heart better.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,556
Just trust Ju Hwa with this.

11
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,766
Okay, fine.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,661
- His office is somewhere in...
- Dr. Lee?

13
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,761
Hello.

14
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:07,865
I thought he was Dr. Lee
because of his outfit.

15
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,675
Is he your friend?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,300
He's very handsome.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,605
Right.

18
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,871
Don't stare at her like that.

19

You stand out
because you're too handsome.

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,770
Why did the writer
make the extra look too good?

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,976
This is so inconvenient.

22
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,446
Can you find his office by yourself?
Hurry up.

23
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:24,211
- Just go.
- You can come with me too.

24
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,140
He's in a lot of pain.

25

your throne.

of losing your beloved.

160
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,006

163
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,035
I was wondering
who was following me.

164
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,106
The sword of destiny has pierced me.

165
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,716
Now, it is heading
towards you and your lady.

166
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,815
I saw something
that I should not have.

167
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,285
It is filled with letters
that I cannot read.

168

But the drawings...

169

170
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:23,265
It feels like
someone is watching us.

171
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,366
I am sure you were aware of it
as well.

172

No.

173
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,665
You felt it.

174
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,736
You felt that absurd things
were happening to you.

175
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,976
But there is one thing
that you do not know.

176
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:44,015
If you die in a place
that is not in this book,

177
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,685
you still exist,

178
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,285
but your memories disappear.

179
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,165

180
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,836
But I hope
you can change your story.

181
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,285
I don't want to read it with you.

182
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,086
If I do,

183
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,456
I think it will infuriate me.

184
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,866
Stop acting as if you don't know.

185
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,405
You read the book,
"Trumpet Creeper", here.

186
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,535
The scar on your hand.

187
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,106
Have you thought
about why you have it?

188
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:45,675
The writer gave you a hint,
so you can remember...

189
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,445
the consequence you faced
after changing the stage.

190
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,015
Shall I tell you?

191
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:53,415
You killed her.

192
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,256
You killed Dan Oh.

193
00:15:57,551 --> 00:15:58,795
I guess you didn't know.

194
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,950
Right, you probably didn't.

195
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,925
If you knew,
you wouldn't be with her.

196
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,435
You were the one
who tried to kill Dan Oh.

197
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,765
So you didn't see
how Dan Oh died in the story?

198
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:11,305
In this story, the writer has
no reason to kill Dan Oh.

199
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,031
Hadn't you changed it,
she could have been...

200
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,706
healthier with the surgery.

201
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,001
Everything is repeating
in the world of comics.

202
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:19,901
I can only put up
with this messed-up story...

203
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,545
because I have Dan Oh.

204
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:23,586
So stop it...

205
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,486
before you put Dan Oh
in bigger danger.

206
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,515
He said that
I was definitely getting better.

207
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,275
Dan Oh.

208
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:56,870
My gosh, Haru is so amazing.

209
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,356
How could he completely
change the stage?

210
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,850
Change? Haru did?

211
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,980
He was worried about you.

212
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,521
A small action of Haru,
trying to stop your surgery...

213
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,425
No, this is pretty big.

214
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:07,866
I'm so envious.

215
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,425
What?

216
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,935
Were there not
that many empty pages before?

217
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,516
(Thank you.)

218
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:30,856
Right.

219
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:34,386
I doubt that the writer would heal
my heart problem that easily.

220
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,155
If the story goes on as it is,

221
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,395
will I die?

222
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:05,356
Haru!

223
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,026
Hello.

224
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,021
Are you all right?

225
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,050
Yes.

226
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,650
My heart has gotten
healthy overnight.

227
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,761
I found out
that someone changed my fate.

228
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,536
I wonder who that is.

229
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,705
Haru, thank you
for helping me change my fate.

230
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,935
Dan Oh.

231
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,445
If our story...

232
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,645
is going according to
the writer's intention...

233
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,945
I'll try to change it to the end.

234
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,570
So you need to help me. Okay?

235
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,041
When we keep changing the story,

236
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,441
we can make our own fates
according to our will.

237
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,481
If we succeed,

238
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:42,880
I'll take care of you.

239
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
Number 13
and a terminally ill patient.

240
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,150
These are our characters.

241
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,791
If we change our stories, it'll be
a happy ending for both of us.

242
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,965
"Okay.
Let's change our fate together."

243
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,471
Here. Take them.

244
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:11,316
If I tie myself
to the previous story,

245
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,281
I feel like I'm losing out
to the writer.

246
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,056
- Dan Oh.
- Pretend that I don't know...

247
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,685
about this in front of Haru.

248
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,725
You told me not to tell him
about the surgery.

249
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,090
Why do you want to stay with him...

250
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,866
when you have to hide things
and hold yourself back?

251
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,836
What if something goes wrong
with you?

252
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:32,576
I'm getting better
even without the surgery.

253
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:37,576
Good luck.

254
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,056
That's the same ring.

255
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,096
I guess some things are bound to...

256
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,925
It's my late mother's.

257
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,721
I wanted to give this to you.

258
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,191
No one asked me to do this.

259
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,366
It is coming from my heart.

260
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,766
And this scene
is right in front of Haru.

261
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,306
It's my late mother's.

262
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,531
Why are you giving me this?

263
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,276
I wanted to give this to you.

264
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,741
No one asked me to do this.

265
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:13,076
It is coming from my heart.

266
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:22,251
This stage is...

267
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,596
too cruel for me...

268
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,296
and for Kyung too.

269
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:29,296
We both know
how we feel about each other,

270
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:32,965
but we can only act
according to the writer's intention.

271
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,036
Kyung.

272
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,405
I'm really happy...

273
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,445
that my love has reached you.

274
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,546
Kyung.

275
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,116
It has always been you for me.

276
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,145
You're my beginning.

277
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,816
Kyung.

278
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,451
I'm your beginning, am I not?

279
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,180
I always liked Haru from the start.

280
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,481
He's my beginning.

281
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:35,350
It has always been you for me.

282
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,796
You're my beginning.

283
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,495
Kyung.

284
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,205
What an honor.

285
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,945
You came to me, not Haru.

286
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,610
What are you doing?

287
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,086
I know how important this is to you.

288
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,326
That's why I can't accept it.

289
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,455
When I see you,

290
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,636
I'm reminded of my mother.

291
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,836
The hospital smell.

292
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:18,036
The sound of the heart rate monitor.

293
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,846
And her forced smile
in case I got worried.

294
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:23,701
Using you...

295
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:25,816
to continue this fake relationship
was torture.

296
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,215
I actually wanted to hate you.

297
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,056
But you were always sincere
when I wasn't.

298
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,225
No matter how much I pushed you...

299
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:38,425
and how angry I got at you,
you still liked me.

300
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,995
So I had no choice
but to like you back.

301
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,495
You'll leave anyway.

302
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,366
And I'll be the one
who will be left alone.

303
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:50,806
Kyung.

304
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,306
The only moment when I'm myself
in this bleak world...

305
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:57,475
is during the stage with you.

306
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,316
In the previous work
as well as this world,

307
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:04,185
during the scenes between you and me
drawn by the writer,

308
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,715
that's the real me.

309
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,225
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:14,566
- Why?
- I won't follow the storyboard.

311
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:17,965
Just like how I was hurt for being
in unrequited love on stage,

312
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:20,195
you will be hurt...

313
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:23,136
during the shadow in our future.

314
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:27,106
You didn't have to clarify that.

315
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:29,846
I'm sorry.

316
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,586
I'm really sorry.

317
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:03,505
What do these flowers mean?

318
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,516
"Dan Oh is stupid."

319
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,755
(Light pink roses mean,
"Only you know how I feel.")

320
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:26,235
My gosh, I'm so jealous of Dan Oh.

321
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,536
Who will put a ring on my finger?

322
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,735
It will be Nam Ju, right?

323
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,945
Did you just laugh?

324
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:39,840
You just laughed at me, right?

325
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,985
What was that?

326
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,715
Sae Mi.

327
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,116
Sae Mi, Nam Ju and I are
officially dating.

328
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,556
- What?
- What did she say?

329
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:53,096
I figured
you'll find out soon enough.

330
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,066
You know that
Nam Ju likes to declare things.

331
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,495
Unbelievable.

332
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,505
I gave this a though...

333
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,005
and figured that
I feel sorry for you.

334
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,806
The only thing
you can do is bully me.

335
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,316
- You feel sorry for me?
- Even though I know...

336
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,070
that you can't do things
as you wish,

337
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,155
that still doesn't make the wounds
I got from you melt away.

338
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:22,925
I'm so glad...

339
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,326
I'm the main character...

340
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:27,965
and you're the villain.

341
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:31,336
Nam Ju.

342
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,866
I declare that...

343
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,660
Oh Nam Ju and Yeo Ju Da are
an official couple...

344
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,806
of Seuli High School.

345
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,306
- What?
- What?

346
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,801
So we don't have to
blow balloons anymore?

347
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:43,801
Come on, clap for them.

348
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,046
Let's give a hand for the official
couple of Seuli High School.

349
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,745
Hey!

350
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:51,781
If anyone messes with Ju Da,

351
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:54,485
I'll take that as a challenge
against me, the number one here.

352
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,685
Why? Because Ju Da is my woman.

353
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,826
- My gosh.
- That's huge.

354
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:06,596
- Ju Da, you.
- Didn't you hear him?

355
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:11,106
If you bully me from now on,
you'll be challenging Nam Ju.

356
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,905
Nam Ju.

357
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:20,099
- My gosh.
- You two look great.

358
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,086
- Goodness.
- What a great couple.

359
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:29,485
I don't feel bad for you.

360
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,580
- What?
- I've gone through too much.

361
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,296
They take out their feelings for you
by bullying me.

362
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:36,320
I can't just sit around anymore.

363
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
I won't let them bully you.

364
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:39,721
You won't let them?

365
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,136
Because I like you.

366
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,491
I'll do anything for you.

367
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:44,606
I don't want it.

368
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:47,776
I'm sick and tired
of getting your help.

369
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:17,435
That's not the right posture.

370
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,935
Do Hwa.

371
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,076
I'll help you.

372
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,316
Okay, first of all,
fix this on your left shoulder.

373
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,616
And take this hand and put it here.

374
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:32,886
The bow.

375
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:37,086
- Like this?
- Yes.

376
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,435
I believe 80 percent of playing
the violin depends on your feelings.

377
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,830
The same song may sound different...

378
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,136
depending on
the emotion of the performer.

379
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,876
Do Hwa, then you play it.

380
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,076
What do you want to listen to?

381
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,505
"Love's Joy"?

382
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:02,016
Do you know the kind of emotion
you need for that song?

383
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,245
I'm not sure.

384
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,255
Ju Da.

385
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,316
I like you.

386
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,995
That's the emotion.

387
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,145
Do you think we can be together
until the end of that song?

388
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:44,425
No. Probably not.

389
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,306
Ju Da.

390
00:28:58,761 --> 00:28:59,830
What is this?

391
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,276
To celebrate how we became
an official couple.

392
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,576
I'm giving these back to you.

393
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:06,245
These shoes are yours
and yours only,

394
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:08,140
like Cinderella's glass shoes.

395
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,941
- Nam Ju.
- You said that...

396
00:29:09,941 --> 00:29:12,715
Cinderella goes back to her life
after midnight.

397
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:14,485
And you came back to me.

398
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,725
You're Ju Da,
Oh Nam Ju's Cinderella.

399
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:24,465
Yes, hello?

400
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,235
Yes, that's me.

401
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:32,136
What? My grandma?

402
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,376
What is it? What's wrong?

403
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,876
It's too obvious.

404
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,745
Your mom will help me out
and she'll yell at me again.

405
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,356
My grandma is ill. I have to go.

406
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,026
- And the operation fee...
- I'll take care of that.

407
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:57,271
So I have to get your help again?

408
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,241
Why? Will you overuse
your power with money again?

409
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:00,666
Overuse my power?

410
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,805
Do you think money can solve
all of life's problems?

411
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,241
It's because I like you.

412
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:06,410
I'll do anything for you.

413
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,521
You don't even remember.

414
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,660
(Dan Oh's Bucket List)

415
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:22,660
You killed her.

416
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,630
You killed Dan Oh.

417
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:26,795
The writer gave you a hint,
so you can remember...

418
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:29,071
the consequence you faced
after changing the stage.

419
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,071
If you knew,
you wouldn't be with her.

420
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:35,910
Haru.

421
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,506
- Haru.
- Yes?

422
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,776
Were you thinking about
something serious again?

423
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,680
Something like,
"Is she going to die?"

424
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,045
It's all because of the writer.

425
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,160
How can they use
the same characters again?

426
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,216
Writer, be honest. Okay?

427
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,591
I'm sure your readers
all complain to you. Right?

428
00:30:58,496 --> 00:31:01,496
But because the writer was careless,
the stage changed many times,

429
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,571
the operation was canceled,
and I take way fewer medications.

430
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,996
I believe that you and I are...

431
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:08,365
changing this world this much
without the writer noticing us.

432
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,741
Eun Dan Oh won't die that easily.

433
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,150
I don't need this list either.

434
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:17,145
(Dan Oh's Bucket List)

435
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,650
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

436
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,420
You wanted to do things like these?

437
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,690
- Yes.
- Then should we cut class again?

438
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:26,315
Okay.

439
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:28,155
My gosh, it's so pretty!

440
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:30,200
Dan Oh, calm down.
Go just a little slower.

441
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:34,525
Haru, thanks to you,
my world got a lot bigger.

442
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:35,700
Thank you.

443
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,666
The writer may be careless,

444
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,811
but they're pretty detailed
about these things.

445
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,210
- Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh!

446
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:45,851
Why are they here?

447
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:47,251
I called them.

448
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:51,206
- Haru, you're an idiot.
- I didn't feel like staying there.

449
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:52,446
- I'm glad.
- Why?

450
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:55,045
It's simple. Nam Ju and Ju Da
became an official couple...

451
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,615
after Dan Oh and Kyung...

452
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,416
My gosh! Be quiet.

453
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,885
Okay. Let's go and change things up!

454
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,960
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

455
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,956
Let's go!

456
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,430
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

457
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:09,741
Can you bring those?

458
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,696
This is so good.

459
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:15,405
It's great to have a meal out here.

460
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:16,581
Yes, really.

461
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:18,380
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

462
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:22,751
You go.

463
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,615
- Great job.
- Hey, the center is here, now.

464
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:28,385
So it's safe to put one here.

465
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:29,986
- I'll put it here just to be safe.
- Okay.

466
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:32,061
It's getting a bit wobbly now.

467
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:35,956
Come on, lie down.

468
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:38,531
- Indian bop!
- Indian bop!

469
00:32:39,496 --> 00:32:40,630
Take this.

470
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,470
Haru.

471
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,370
No, you shouldn't shake
the handle around that much.

472
00:32:45,536 --> 00:32:46,670
It's scary.

473
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:51,875
Wait, no. No, keep your eyes ahead.

474
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,751
You can't keep turning it around.

475
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:57,351
- Dan Oh, one second.
- Yes?

476
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,620
You need to hold me with your arms.

477
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:04,416
Like this?

478
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,190
- Yes.
- Okay.

479
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,545
Are you working the pedal?

480
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:31,305
Of course. Gosh, this is tough.

481
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:33,176
Why is this so hard?
I'm about to throw up.

482
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,375
Gosh, look at the pretty flower.

483
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,761
It's so pretty.

484
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,815
Sae Mi, you aren't doing it,
are you?

485
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,286
Look ahead. Be careful.

486
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,726
You aren't doing it!

487
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,230
No, I am.

488
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,271
Haru!

489
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:04,920
Dan Oh.

490
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,620
Dan Oh. Are you okay?

491
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,190
Yes, I'm fine.

492
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:16,361
I'm fine.

493
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:22,623

The operation...

503
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:53,792
will go well.
I'll make sure that happens.

504
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:56,462
- Why?
- Because I like you.

505
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:00,532
- You always say the same thing.
- And Ju Da.

506
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:02,763
You can cry when you're with me.

507
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:05,328
I like how bright you are
and how you smile all the time,

508
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:06,632
but I like...

509
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:09,172

but I have to come
all the way here to check.

513

dried squid on the menu today.

Haru, do you know
how to change the setup?

530
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:15,392
You can change the stage
like it's not a big deal.

531

Never mind, you aren't the writer.

532

just got an operation.

- She was supposed to get it done,

Right? That's enough, isn't it?

541
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:44,718
Anyway, she was at our hospital,

542
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:46,563
and her doctor was my brother.

543
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,733
We should've done something
when we were there together.

544
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:51,357
How did you change it this time?

545
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:53,533
Can you tell me?
At least I can give it a shot.

546
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:56,573
I changed the charts.

547
00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:57,872
The charts?

548
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:02,073
There were only two charts
that looked real.

549
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,182
The past subjunctive mood is...

550
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,013
easier to get if you memorize
the expressions in sentences.

551
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,408
Let's take a look.
"If it were not for..."

552
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,208
Ju Da's grandma got the operation...

553
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,892
on the day that
Dan Oh was supposed to get it.

554
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:15,953
(Medical Chart)

555
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:18,793
(Ok Kyung Soon)

556
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:21,892
(Eun Dan Oh)

557
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:25,862
Then that means
Dan Oh isn't entirely well.

558
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:35,296
The writer gave you a hint,
so you can remember...

559
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:37,842
the consequence you faced
after changing the stage.

560
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:51,323
Su Hyang.

561
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:54,763
Are you acquainted with Dried Squid?

562
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:56,902
- What?
- You two looked close.

563
00:38:57,488 --> 00:38:59,162
And it seems like
you know something.

564
00:38:59,788 --> 00:39:01,803
- Me?
- Oh, it's nothing.

565
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:03,868
It seems like
you might know something.

566
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:05,003
Kyung!

567
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:12,183
Go.

568
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:14,152
Just leave.

569
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:23,248
Do not mess with her.

570
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:24,788
I didn't mess with her.

571
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:27,162
Don't mess with us in this world.

572
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:28,817
"Us in this world"?

573
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:30,232
Just pretend like you never saw her,

574
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:32,303
and don't even say hi to her.

575
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:33,558
That's odd.

576
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:35,303
She isn't even aware of herself.

577
00:39:37,428 --> 00:39:39,243
You killed her.

578
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:43,542
She died...

579
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:47,782
She died twice because of you!

580
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:52,707
She died twice?

581
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:54,392
It's very convenient...

582
00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:57,962
to not remember.

583
00:39:58,517 --> 00:40:00,863
You took away her self-awareness,

584
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:04,003
and you killed her again
when she returned.

585
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,628
I took away her self-awareness?

586
00:40:06,628 --> 00:40:08,232
If you die on the stage,

587
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:11,303
you disappear completely
in the comic book.

588
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,212
But if you die in the shadow,
only your self-awareness disappears.

589
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:16,313
They end up
not remembering a thing...

590
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,467
and return to
just another character...

591
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:20,313
who moves
only according to the setup.

592
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,053
You go back...

593
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:32,063
to the time when you're
better off knowing nothing.

594
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:45,243
Hey.

595
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:55,212
- Are you in pain?
- That's odd.

596
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:56,907
I was fine on the stage,

597
00:40:56,907 --> 00:40:58,823
but I'm still in pain in the shadow.

598
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:02,392
It's okay. I'll go see Dr. Lee.

599
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:06,522
Dan Oh.

600
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,633
Wait, what happened?

601
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:17,902
You fell down...

602
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,472
during P.E. class.

603
00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:21,943
Why don't you lie down?

604
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,982
Lie down until you feel better.

605
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:28,412
Stay here.

606
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:29,982
I'll bring your bag.

607
00:41:55,038 --> 00:41:58,782
(Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo)

608
00:42:06,478 --> 00:42:07,553
Dan Oh.

609
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:10,292
Dan Oh. Are you all right?

610
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:11,462
Don't be so worried.

611
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:12,587
As you know,

612
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:16,292
my character on the stage is
a weak girl.

613
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:20,232
What's wrong?

614
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:25,467
Haru, can you bring me
the medicine from my bag?

615
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:26,542
Wait here.

616
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:04,913
You're still here.

617
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:08,237
Yes, Dan Oh is sick.

618
00:43:08,238 --> 00:43:09,352
I see.

619
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:10,783
Do you...

620
00:43:11,748 --> 00:43:13,023
remember everything?

621
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:14,417
About what?

622
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:15,893
How I and Dan Oh was...

623
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:18,462
in "Trumpet Creeper".

624
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,023
You were...

625
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:22,893
the same.

626
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:24,703
I think...

627
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:27,673
I was probably better than this.

628
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:31,297
When you die in the shadow,
you're no longer aware of yourself.

629
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:33,813
Then you'll lose all
your precious memories.

630
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:36,212
It'd be too sad...

631
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:38,943
to live as you're told to.

632
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,382
But when you're no longer aware
of yourself,

633
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:44,683
you won't be able
to feel sad about it.

634
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:48,352
You'll only feel the feelings
the writer allows.

635
00:43:54,387 --> 00:43:55,893
That doesn't sound too bad.

636
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:58,403
At times, being oblivious...

637
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:01,933
is less cruel in this world.

638
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:32,433
I'll take you home.

639
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:50,053
I'm so happy these days.

640
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:53,893
My heart is finally starting
to get better.

641
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:57,523
And most of all, you're by my side.

642
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:16,043
- Please stop the car.
- Can you...

643
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,382
just go?

644
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,198
What? I will die?

645
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:48,897
Prince Kyung, his father,
and their gang...

646
00:45:48,897 --> 00:45:50,582
are trying to frame your father
as a traitor.

647
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:53,643
I will save you...

648
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:57,023
no matter what.

649
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:11,332
I am finally starting
to have an appetite.

650
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:15,598
No matter what,

651
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:17,943
His Majesty should not eat
what you give him.

652
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:21,742
Why is my body not moving?

653
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:28,783
Your Majesty, do forgive me.

654
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:30,982
You must spit out what you just had.

655
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,653
I cannot escape death.

656
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:38,962
No matter what happens,

657
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:41,362
it will not be your fault.

658
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:46,132
You must not go down
the same path as I did.

659
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:51,533
Where is Haru?

660
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:01,872
She conspired against the King.

661
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,012
Kill her.

662
00:48:04,137 --> 00:48:05,242
Yes, my lord.

663
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:18,693
Kill him!

664
00:48:21,488 --> 00:48:22,517
Stop.

665
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:23,828
Do not stop!

666
00:48:23,828 --> 00:48:24,933
Stop!

667
00:48:27,098 --> 00:48:28,232
Father.

668
00:48:46,348 --> 00:48:47,592
Prove it.

669
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:52,122
Prove that you did not deceive me.

670
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:54,793
Prove that you did not covet
my woman.

671
00:48:58,787 --> 00:48:59,862
Prove...

672
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:03,273
that you serve me.

673
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,512
Stab her.

674
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,523
Haru...

675
00:49:45,407 --> 00:49:46,643
Why?

676
00:49:58,748 --> 00:49:59,862
My lady.

677
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:03,632
My lady.

678
00:50:04,387 --> 00:50:05,502
My lady.

679
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:10,332
My lady.

680
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:12,403
Dan Oh.

681
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,712
Dan Oh!

682
00:50:23,578 --> 00:50:24,953
I was the one...

683
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:36,132
who killed her.

684
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:54,913
This is fine.

685
00:50:59,448 --> 00:51:00,553
Haru.

686
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,622
Haru.

687
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:10,293
Haru, what's wrong?

688
00:51:34,078 --> 00:51:36,052
I'm not going to water
the flowers anymore.

689
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:38,987
No matter how well
I took care of them,

690
00:51:38,987 --> 00:51:41,133
they withered if the writer wanted.

691
00:51:41,957 --> 00:51:43,492
I couldn't do anything for them.

692
00:51:45,157 --> 00:51:46,787
You couldn't do anything?

693
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:48,558
It's like how I can't do anything...

694
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:49,828
without you, my guardian,
and Nam Ju,

695
00:51:49,828 --> 00:51:52,173
the most popular student
at our school.

696
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:55,042
You're a guardian, and he's
the most popular student.

697
00:51:55,637 --> 00:51:56,873
Isn't that funny?

698
00:51:57,538 --> 00:51:59,508
Why didn't I realize
how cringy that was?

699
00:51:59,508 --> 00:52:00,838
It was worse for me.

700
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:03,653
Flowers blossomed around your face.

701
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:09,653
By the way, Ju Da.

702
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:12,623
Do you want to change
the story as well?

703
00:52:13,848 --> 00:52:15,917
Just like Dan Oh and Haru.

704
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:18,962
They changed the story,
and it changed their set-up a bit.

705
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:22,373
What do you want to change?

706
00:52:24,098 --> 00:52:25,203
Me?

707
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,512
What do you think I want to do?

708
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:39,482
I'm relieved. I truly am.

709
00:52:43,548 --> 00:52:44,887
Your grandma pulled through.

710
00:52:44,887 --> 00:52:46,262
You must've been worried sick.

711
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:48,833
Starting now,
I'll take care of her...

712
00:52:49,018 --> 00:52:51,403
on the honor of A3.

713
00:52:56,727 --> 00:52:58,568
What is this? It's so silly.

714
00:52:58,568 --> 00:53:00,472
I thought this put
you in a good mood.

715
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:03,542
Starting now,
you'll only be in a good mood.

716
00:53:12,078 --> 00:53:13,522
I don't like sweet things.

717
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:15,093
What?

718
00:53:16,177 --> 00:53:17,762
But you definitely
liked them before.

719
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:20,593
What do you like then?

720
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,093
Money.

721
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:25,903
Don't be surprised.

722
00:53:26,227 --> 00:53:29,572
But that doesn't mean
that you can buy my love with money.

723
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,242
I didn't want...

724
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:35,113
to feel the same way...

725
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:37,782
with the character
in the comic book.

726
00:53:38,637 --> 00:53:40,542
But this isn't all that bad.

727
00:53:41,578 --> 00:53:42,883
It's not fair.

728
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:46,848
Dan Oh, I think
your health is getting better.

729
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,977
It's the power of love.

730
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,578
Power of Kyung's love.

731
00:53:49,578 --> 00:53:50,917
It's not that.

732
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:53,118
It's because Haru changed
the stage for me.

733
00:53:53,118 --> 00:53:54,863
- "The stage"?
- Haru?

734
00:53:55,018 --> 00:53:56,093
Haru?

735
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,502
Haru!

736
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:03,603
Dan Oh.

737
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:05,472
Are you all right?

738
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:08,042
Haru.

739
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:12,042
You were never able...

740
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:15,883
to protect Dan Oh.

741
00:54:16,707 --> 00:54:17,782
Haru...

742
00:54:48,237 --> 00:54:49,312
Haru.

743
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:52,982
Haru.

744
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:55,292
Why are you avoiding me?

745
00:54:56,147 --> 00:54:57,992
I don't know what to do.

746
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:02,232
If the scenes we changed so far...

747
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,833
have been hurting you all along,

748
00:55:08,457 --> 00:55:10,002
what am I supposed to do?

749
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:22,413
My health is getting so much better.
I'm almost fully recovered.

750
00:55:27,008 --> 00:55:28,453
So you knew.

751
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:32,292
Seriously. Dr. Lee tells
everyone about my condition.

752
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,863
Congratulations
on your recovery, Dan Oh.

753
00:55:39,058 --> 00:55:41,272
I love you the most in this world.

754
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:45,772
I feel like I'm dreaming.

755
00:55:46,227 --> 00:55:47,302
Why?

756
00:55:47,768 --> 00:55:50,397
My heart is all better now,
and you like me.

757
00:55:50,397 --> 00:55:51,907
I'm happy,

758
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:54,512
but I'm scared at the same time
because I'm too happy.

759
00:56:04,687 --> 00:56:05,762
Sorry.

760
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:09,557
You're healthy now.

761
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:11,863
You don't need him to change
your terminally-ill fate...

762
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:15,128
- anymore.
- Haru isn't someone...

763
00:56:15,128 --> 00:56:16,403
who can change my fate.

764
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:19,443
Haru is my fate.

765
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:35,717
(Congratulations
on your recovery, Dan Oh.)

766
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:37,477
Haru!

767
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,687
It's about Dan Oh.
She's at the hospital.

768
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,762
What are you talking about?

769
00:56:41,118 --> 00:56:42,758
In the book, it said
she completely recovered now.

770
00:56:42,758 --> 00:56:44,863
My brother told me
that she's severely ill.

771
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:48,603
What? Why isn't
that drawn in the book?

772
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:54,542
Hey, Haru!

773
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:09,423
Dan Oh.

774
00:57:13,187 --> 00:57:14,687
If you die on the stage,

775
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:17,318
you disappear completely
in the comic book.

776
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:19,833
But if you die in the shadow,
only your self-awareness disappears.

777
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:22,697
Then you'll lose all
your precious memories.

778
00:57:22,697 --> 00:57:24,603
It'd be too sad...

779
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,443
to live as you're told to.

780
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,403
- Stab her.
- I cannot.

781
00:59:08,237 --> 00:59:09,373
Haru.

782
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:41,943
I...

783
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:45,482
I killed you.

784
01:00:43,628 --> 01:00:44,703
How's Dan Oh?

785
01:00:46,828 --> 01:00:48,042
How's she?

786
01:00:48,568 --> 01:00:50,712
I wasn't going to change the story.

787
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:54,042
I just...

788
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:58,752
couldn't change anything.

789
01:01:03,018 --> 01:01:04,522
Just like in the previous story,

790
01:01:06,217 --> 01:01:08,262
my character hasn't changed.

791
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:31,782
Dan Oh.

792
01:01:32,278 --> 01:01:33,982
Dan Oh.

793
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,722
Dan Oh.

794
01:02:06,378 --> 01:02:08,322
I saw you in the comic book.

795
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:12,423
Your heart is healthy now.

796
01:02:16,088 --> 01:02:17,562
So you'll be fine.

797
01:02:19,588 --> 01:02:21,673
When we move onto the next scene...

798
01:02:37,137 --> 01:02:38,222
Dan Oh.

799
01:02:38,878 --> 01:02:39,953
Dan Oh.

800
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:41,552
Dan Oh, wake up.

801
01:02:41,647 --> 01:02:42,792
Dan Oh.

802
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,032
Please...

803
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,532
Please let the next stage come.

804
01:02:58,098 --> 01:02:59,173
Please.

805
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:01,673
Please skip over to the next scene.

806
01:03:03,568 --> 01:03:06,913
Please... Please let Dan Oh live.

807
01:03:19,048 --> 01:03:20,562
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

808
01:03:20,747 --> 01:03:22,232
What are you doing after school?

809
01:03:23,088 --> 01:03:24,163
Why?

810
01:03:24,788 --> 01:03:26,103
Just asking.

811
01:03:26,927 --> 01:03:28,133
Are you asking me out?

812
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:30,572
Something like that.

813
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:51,663
Dan Oh.

814
01:04:02,858 --> 01:04:03,972
Dan Oh.

815
01:04:44,538 --> 01:04:48,613
(Extra-ordinary You)
