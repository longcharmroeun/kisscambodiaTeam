00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,655
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,835
Who...

3
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,535
am I?

4
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,385
I want to know...

5
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,254
where I came from...

6
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,395
and where I'm headed.

7
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,859
(Extra Characters)

8
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:34,105
(Eun Dan Oh, female, 18 years old,
Baek Kyung's fiancee)

9
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:40,535
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- I don't think this is right.

10
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,345
Dan Oh.

11
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,954
I heard my voice for the first time.

12
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,590
You didn't work out.

13
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,520
- Don't lie.
- I used a pull-up bar yesterday.

14
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,834
Do you have a bar at home?
Seriously?

15
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,435
This outfit is a bit tight.

16
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,304
Did you see it?

17
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,629
Like this?

18
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,870
No, that is oversized.

19
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,644
How do I know her name...

20
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,285
when I don't even know mine?

21
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,524
Why do I always
have my eyes on you?

22
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,644
I don't even know who I am.

23
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,924
Tell me...

24
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,325
why it has to be you.

25
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,259
Using your darn heart disease
as an excuse,

26
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,334
you cry and collapse all the time.

27
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,305
It's not like you're dying.

28
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:36,454
Let's go.

29
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,514
Dan Oh.

30
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,055
Who are you?

31
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,735
You won't remember
even if I tell you.

32
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,505
The scene will change soon.

33
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,774
I heard you correctly, right?

34
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,445
It doesn't make sense,

35
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,474
but I wish it did.

36
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,454
Do you...

37
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,185
remember me?

38
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,594
Since when?

39
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:55,964
I don't know.

40
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,735
But...

41
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,375
I know that you started it.

42
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,175
Dan Oh.

43
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,584
Baek Kyung.

44
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,724
Why are you drenched?

45
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,695
Did the writer make it rain?

46
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,790
Isn't it strange how it's dry
everywhere else,

47
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,664
but you're the only one
who's wet?

48
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,230
No, Dan Oh was there as well.

49
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,945
She's unlike you
since she's aware of herself.

50
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,945
You don't even realize
that it's strange.

51
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,709
Just hang in there for a bit.

52
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,985
Once the scene changes,
you'll become dry again.

53
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,154
"Once the scene changes"?

54
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,850
I'm upset.

55
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,120
I don't think
Nam Ju, Ju Da, or you...

56
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,925
will ever be aware of yourselves.

57
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,420
Cheer up.

58
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,865
At times, it's better
not to remember.

59
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,495
Bye.

60
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,500
Do you also not remember...

61
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,644
what happened
in between the scenes?

62
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,009
Then do you also hear
a strange noise...

63
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,209
whenever you lose your memory?

64
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,910
And you don't know when
or where you'll wake up,

65
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,654
and do you have the dates
and places all mixed up?

66
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,094
- Yes.
- And those around you...

67
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,795
can't remember what
you've said or done?

68
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,524
You're right.

69
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,594
But I remember all the moments...

70
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,005
we've shared together.

71
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,034
No way.

72
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,104
Have you truly
become aware of yourself?

73
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,914
That's Dan Oh.

74
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,379
What brings you here?

75
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,084
I wanted to see something.

76
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,180
You're not my type.

77
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,024
I'm not talking about you.

78
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,195
I'm talking about that.

79
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,005
Hey, isn't this...

80
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,435
Stage. Shadow. Stage. Shadow.

81
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:19,930
What are you doing?

82
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,870
I still cannot believe
that we're in the world of comics.

83
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,639
But when I see those
who aren't aware of themselves,

84
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,709
I can easily believe that.

85
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,985
It's rather frightening.

86
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,779
"Ju Da."

87
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,379
- "Do Hwa, where are you going?"
- "I..."

88
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:35,784
I came...

89
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,124
to you.

90
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,224
No matter how sincere I am,

91
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,435
once the stage is lit,

92
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,364
she can't remember a thing.

93
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,565
Please, Ju Da.

94
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,805
That's because the writer controls
everything that happens on stage.

95
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,000
The writer has no plans
to make you confess.

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,269
Exactly. That's why
I was playing the violin here.

97
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:00,744
But in the shadow, I'm rather cool.

98
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,610
It can't be helped.

99
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,879
Those who are aware
of themselves...

100
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,854
are the only ones who can remember
what happened in the shadow.

101
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,250
Isn't it wonderful
to appear and disappear...

102
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,525
at the right time
for the main characters?

103
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,460
"He confesses his feelings
straightforwardly."

104
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,220
Why didn't the writer
write such a thing about me?

105
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,159
That's because
you're an extra in this comic.

106
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,330
There are many manly
and amazing male extras.

107
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,405
I've looked through
other comic books as well.

108
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,840
Hey, what is this?

109
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,915
Is Dan Oh...

110
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,315
- I know.
- She doesn't have much time?

111
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,124
It means we don't know
when her heart will stop beating.

112
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,850
I had no idea.

113
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,250
I feel terrible for her.

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
Isn't this too cruel
for an extra to undergo?

115
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,624
It's only possible...

116
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,695
because she's an extra.

117
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,334
Haru...

118
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,504
remembers me.

119
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,830
Thank you, writer.

120
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,714
Please forget all the gibberish
I've said up until now.

121
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,915
Oh, yes!

122
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,155
Dan Oh.

123
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,325
Take this as my apology.

124
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,195
No, thanks.

125
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,994
- Take it.
- No.

126
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,435
We're over.

127
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,374
What?

128
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,844
I want to stop liking you.

129
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,275
You said you're disgusted
and irritated by my disease.

130
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,884
- That was just...
- Don't worry.

131
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,714
I won't let this
affect your father's business.

132
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,084
Dan Oh!

133
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,655
One-sided love...

134
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,425
wasn't only torturous
to the one doing it.

135
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,124
It's also painful for the one
on the receiving end.

136
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,665
I'm sorry...

137
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,065
for everything.

138
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,035
From today on,

139
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,175
we're no longer engaged.

140
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,675
My gosh. I had no idea
I could say such things.

141
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,785
Oh, my!

142
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,878
By the way, is your face all right?

143
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,210
I know everything's planned out
and not real,

144
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,624
but it still hurts.

145
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,325
Gosh, you're still a jerk.

146
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,165
But I'll accept your apology.

147
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,935
Take back what you just said.

148
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,435
About what?

149
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,204
What's with you?

150
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,295
(Time to take medication)

151
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,504
Look at these extra medications
I have.

152
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,614
What a useless detail.

153
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,039
Are you all right?

154
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,254
What's up with you?

155
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,879
Didn't you buy this for Ju Da?

156
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,195
No, I didn't. I bought it for you.

157
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,265
I want you to eat
a lot of good food.

158
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,090
You definitely read that part.

159
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,419
Hey, don't worry.
It's nothing. Okay?

160
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,190
The writer just
added an extra set-up.

161
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,675
My gosh, don't say it is nothing.
You could...

162
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:50,004
You could die.

163
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,015
You and Ju Hwa
have the same reaction.

164
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,639
You two are indeed brothers.

165
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,515
I had no idea.
I only pined after Ju Da.

166
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,555
Do you know
what a butterfly effect is?

167
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,480
It's a principle...

168
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,149
that a small flutter of a buttery
can bring a huge typhoon.

169
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,720
What does that have to do with you?

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,759
A small action from an extra...

171
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,990
can change the whole world.

172
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,474
Well, Dried Squid did say
that I'm messing things up.

173
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,470
So even if the scene
has nothing to do with you,

174
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,045
keep making changes.

175
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,075
Then, I won't need these eventually.

176
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,114
From today on,
we're no longer engaged.

177
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:34,750
You'd better watch
where you're going.

178
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,254
I'm sorry, Baek Kyung.

179
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,325
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

180
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,065
What are you looking at? What?

181
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:48,204
Don't do that. You'll get hurt.

182
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,575
Why do you care
if I get hurt or not?

183
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,334
I thought it might hurt.

184
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,614
And I felt bad for you.

185
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,200
My gosh,
I must have lost my mind!

186
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,415
Why did I close my eyes
at that moment?

187
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:34,509
Some people might think
I really like him or something.

188
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,015
But I'm really
not interested in him.

189
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,015
This is ridiculous.

190
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,450
"Let's change our fate together."

191
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,490
Hi. Hello.

192
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,220
Hi. Hi.

193
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,295
Hi.

194
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,204
Stop. Stop thinking about him.

195
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,145
I must have gone mad.

196
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,075
This is so embarrassing.

197
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,084
No way. There's no way
I'd remember every single thing.

198
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,084
I'm doomed.

199
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,604
I want to know...

200
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:08,974
why it has to be you.

201
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:43,704
Dan Oh.

202
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,685
Hi.

203
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,750
My gosh, I can't exactly ask him...

204
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,120
because I humiliated myself
many times.

205
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,090
How much of memory does he have?

206
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,690
How much do you remember?

207
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,029
What? What do you mean?
I remember nothing. Who are you?

208
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,205
Nothing?

209
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,144
My gosh, it's quite chilly
this morning.

210
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,670
Hey, what are you doing?

211
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,039
You said I should take it off
when you're cold.

212
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,444
Hey, that doesn't apply here.

213
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,315
So you remember everything.

214
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,584
Darn it. He knows everything.

215
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,594
What are you staring at?

216
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,495
You.

217
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,535
I have always been watching you.

218
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,965
Why?

219
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,174
Just because.
I just felt like I should.

220
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,029
How much does he know about me?

221
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:51,174
Dan Oh is engaged to Baek Kyung...

222
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,215
and is frail due to heart disease.

223
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,414
And...

224
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,114
you've recently found out
you don't have much time left.

225
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,584
You read the comic book.

226
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,555
I don't have much time left.

227
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,495
I don't like that.

228
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:14,705
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,535
Dan Oh.

230
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,344
I didn't know such a handsome guy
went to our school.

231
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,914
- Who is he?
- Haru.

232
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,045
Haru, hello.

233
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,854
Hello. "Shin Sae Mi".

234
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,950
My gosh, if you call my name
in that gentle voice of yours,

235
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,680
you'll make my heart pound.

236
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,265
What's going on? I thought
you only liked Nam Ju.

237
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,805
You're impressively tall.

238
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,575
What's your name?

239
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,515
So this is the snack bar.

240
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,055
Try it out. Here. Go.

241
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,009
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

242
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,579
- Stop trying to cut.
- Come on.

243
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,519
<i>- Let us pass through
- Let us pass through</i>

244
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,150
- Stop that.
- Why do you keep pushing?

245
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,119
Move out of my way. Move.

246
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,390
- Hey, come on.
- How dare you cut?

247
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,059
- Out of my way.
- Move.

248
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,890
- Move.
- Come on, man.

249
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,789
- I told you to move.
- Stop it!

250
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,705
- Move out of my way.
- What are you doing?

251
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,035
You trust me, right?

252
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:29,329
- Excuse me!
- Come on.

253
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,215
- Step aside.
- Hey.

254
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,480
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

255
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,315
- These, please.
- Come on.

256
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,055
What do you think?

257
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,890
You have to try that hard
every time you buy food?

258
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,690
"Try that hard"?

259
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,194
I can't believe you.

260
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,289
Listen. You can't learn
these skills overnight.

261
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,029
Do you know how hard it is
for extras like us...

262
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,035
to buy food at the snack bar?

263
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,644
Thinking about my old days
makes me cry.

264
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,854
When you have nothing else to say,
you just smile.

265
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,825
Nam Ju.

266
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,765
What is it, Errand Girl?

267
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,134
I'm no longer your errand girl.

268
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,035
For getting your uniform cleaned.
That's the last of it.

269
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,369
My gosh.

270
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,700
The writer has no creativity at all.

271
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,144
How long will the writer drag it out
with the cleaning fee?

272
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:44,815
So they are the main characters
of this comic book.

273
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,680
- I want to do something different.
- Something different?

274
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
I don't want to be your errand girl.

275
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,654
I want to be your friend.

276
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,594
I hope we get along.

277
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,660
- I don't want to.
- What?

278
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,465
I don't want to be your friend.

279
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:03,190
She wants to be friends with him
after flirting with him.

280
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,834
That's so typical for a heroine
in a romance comic book.

281
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,805
- It's making me cringe.
- Dan Oh.

282
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,140
Hey, you're here.

283
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,839
Hello, Back.

284
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,785
That's not his name. It's Haru.

285
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:19,354
Hey, I get why you go crazy
for his back.

286
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,084
Stop it.

287
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,450
Stop it.

288
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,779
Did you know Dan Oh went crazy
for your back?

289
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,124
Hey, stop making up stuff!

290
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,950
That's not true. No.

291
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,289
Hey, Ju Da went that way.
Go that way. Hurry.

292
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,819
Dan Oh, don't be shy.
It doesn't suit you.

293
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:35,705
He won't even remember this anyway.

294
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,104
Look at your eyes.

295
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,404
My gosh, his eyes look
like the main character's eyes.

296
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,575
Scoot over.

297
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,039
He's not a main character, but he's
the other guy in the love triangle.

298
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,410
Remember Nam Ju and Ju Da earlier?

299
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,980
He's supposed
to make their love deepen.

300
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,225
His role is...

301
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,795
- What?
- Well...

302
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,424
It's similar to our roles.

303
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:04,959
What?

304
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,134
Why do I have to
let an extra feel bad for me?

305
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:09,904
Cheer up.

306
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,934
He can talk.

307
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,099
Do Hwa.

308
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:19,715
He knows my name too.

309
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,180
I want to do something different.

310
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,480
I don't want to be your errand girl.

311
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,779
I want to be your friend.

312
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,255
I don't want to.
I don't want to be your friend.

313
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:31,124
What's this?

314
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,779
The stage where the story unfolds.

315
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,025
Okay, then.

316
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,495
They're the main characters
of this comic book.

317
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,519
I see.

318
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,664
Where are we now?

319
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,490
Outside of the story, the shadow.

320
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,065
And what do we have to do?

321
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,259
Change the story.

322
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:48,170
Exactly. You can go into the stage,

323
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,674
so you'll definitely
be able to change it.

324
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,599
Although only small things
have changed thus far.

325
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,245
It's called the butterfly effect.

326
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,410
The fluttering of
Dan Oh and our wings...

327
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,210
will soon bring a huge typhoon.

328
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,455
Exactly. Who taught you that?

329
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,094
Dan Oh.

330
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,295
Right?

331
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,194
You're a smartie.

332
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,334
You shouldn't touch
what's not yours without permission.

333
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,134
Hi.

334
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,630
(I want to stop liking you.)

335
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,930
(From today on,
we're no longer engaged.)

336
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,215
Dan Oh. That was awesome.

337
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,785
"I want to stop liking you."

338
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,609
See that? Isn't it odd how
my character completely changed...

339
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,250
after liking Baek Kyung for 10 years?

340
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,710
The storyboard changed
a number of times too.

341
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,154
You'd better stop.

342
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,890
Why do you want
to change this so badly?

343
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,250
Why can't I do it?

344
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,059
You're one scary guy.

345
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,194
You know
about Dan Oh's heart condition.

346
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,889
You always say I can't do anything.

347
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,759
All I want to do
is use my time freely,

348
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,799
the freedom to eat when I want,

349
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,099
hang out with friends
when I want to,

350
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,844
and not to go to the hospital
when I don't want to.

351
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,944
Such trivial things
will ruin this world.

352
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,838
Then you expect me to sit around
and wait until the day I die?

353
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,640
I just want to live my own life.

354
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,339
Instead of the Dan Oh who says
and does what she has to,

355
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,124
I want to live as the Dan Oh
who says and does what she wants.

356
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,295
Don't be a nuisance
if you aren't going to help.

357
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:13,894
Hey, Dan Oh.

358
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,035
What are you doing?

359
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,205
So what's the stage again?

360
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:29,630
The stage
is the outside of the story.

361
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,139
That's the shadow.

362
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,745
The stage is where the story
of the comic unfolds. Do you get it?

363
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,444
I'm going to ask you again tomorrow.

364
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,785
Bye.

365
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:15,624
What's with you?

366
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,225
Who are you?

367
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:20,295
You can't remember.

368
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,394
What?

369
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,825
My name is...

370
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,065
Haru.

371
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,735
Haru?

372
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,490
You won't remember
when the scene changes...

373
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,505
The scene changes? I won't remember?

374
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:33,975
Is this some kind of joke?

375
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,444
You need to speak in a language
that I can understand, you idiot.

376
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,245
That's enough, Baek Kyung.

377
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,940
(I don't even know...)

378
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,354
(where I came from!)

379
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,785
("Flower")

380
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,495
I thought some comic books
had recently gone missing.

381
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,295
So there was another person
who had been checking these out.

382
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,634
So you've woken up.

383
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,205
Who are you?

384
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:49,604
Me?

385
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,315
The Dried Squid Fairy.

386
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,374
Have you always known me?

387
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,144
I'm not sure.

388
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,485
How?

389
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,985
By chance.

390
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,684
I guess you won't tell me anything.

391
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:05,255
But I don't care.

392
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:08,025
I'll find the answer myself.

393
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:13,894
You can't do that.

394
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,305
The pain will slowly
get worse and worse...

395
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,775
if you make a mess of the stage
in order to find your answer.

396
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,144
Stop Dan Oh.

397
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,344
That's the reason why you exist.

398
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,604
Dan Oh.

399
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,000
Why are you just passing me by?

400
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,160
Am I not allowed to do that?

401
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,670
It's weird. You always...

402
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,670
I always get clingy
when I'm with you.

403
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,844
I feel bad for myself too.

404
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,269
That's why I want to be free
in the shadow.

405
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,715
- "The shadow"?
- The outside of the comic...

406
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,184
- Forget it.
- You need to explain.

407
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,825
You'll get hurt if I do.

408
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,269
My goodness, that's amazing.

409
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,829
- Move.
- What's going on?

410
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:31,400
Cha Ji Hyun is here.

411
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,339
- The beloved actress?
- Nam Ju's mom?

412
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,914
Exactly. My goodness!

413
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,039
See that? What is our role here?

414
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,539
Being amazed.
Screaming out reactions.

415
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:41,779
Providing quick information.

416
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,109
Okay, let's start
with the reactions.

417
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:45,354
Give it a go.

418
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,924
What are you doing?

419
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,194
Come on, stamp your feet
a little more.

420
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,045
- That's Nam Ju's mom!
- All right!

421
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,644
Ms. Cha!

422
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,210
- Ms. Cha!
- Cha Ji Hyun!

423
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,515
- Cha Ji Hyun!
- You're so pretty!

424
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,094
- Ms. Cha!
- Ms. Cha!

425
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,420
Nam Ju was the one
who changed the camp location?

426
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,589
Well, yes. Nam Ju insisted...

427
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:31,065
that we should go somewhere
within the country.

428
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,799
Why did he suddenly do that?

429
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,630
Many people are saying...

430
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,130
this school causes social disharmony
because of our prestigiousness.

431
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,900
It could've been worse
if they had traveled abroad.

432
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,469
Nam Ju made a perfect decision
during this time.

433
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,985
Yes, of course. That's Nam Ju.

434
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,084
He'll probably be as smart
as his older brother.

435
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:51,025
Hee Ju is one smart kid
because he took after me.

436
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,650
Let's use this year's photos
for our public relations.

437
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,250
Let's leave out everything
we took abroad from last year.

438
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,795
Yes, sir.

439
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,664
What about Nam Ju's birthday party?
Should we prepare it here?

440
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,259
What are you going to do?

441
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,900
We're planning
on holding a small party...

442
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,245
with a few close friends of him.

443
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,075
You don't have to prepare anything.

444
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,015
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,710
(Cha Ji Hyun is here!)

446
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,215
(What about
Nam Ju's birthday party?)

447
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,025
What are you doing?

448
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,705
Why do you draw these things?

449
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,975
To remember.

450
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,045
I want to know...

451
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,815
where I came from...

452
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,015
and where I'm headed.

453
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:19,652
(Episode 10 will air shortly.)

454
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,735
(Episode 10)

455
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,135
Ju Da, I'll give you a hand.

456
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,745
Look at Do Hwa. My gosh.

457
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,569
Do Hwa, didn't you forget something?

458
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:37,569
Like what?

459
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,369
You forgot your wings.

460
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:41,014
You're my guardian angel.

461
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,194
Listen to those cheesy lines.

462
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:53,050
It must be tough for him,
don't you think?

463
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,265
It's not so bad, though.

464
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,864
He's with Ju Da all the time.

465
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:00,175
I always had to look for you.

466
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,044
Haru.

467
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,230
- Watch your mouth.
- What?

468
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,440
Don't say such things
while looking at me with those eyes.

469
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,700
I'm willing to let you off,

470
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,214
but a girl like Sae Mi would think
you two start dating from today.

471
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,815
I see.

472
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,009
There's so much to teach you.

473
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:21,195
Where am I going to begin?

474
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,675
I like the rooftop the most...

475
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,274
in this school.

476
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,515
- Why?
- Because my favorite color is blue.

477
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,685
It feels like
my sad feelings all fly away...

478
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,155
when I look up into the blue sky.

479
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,194
Looking good.

480
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,664
Nice view.

481
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,089
I was wondering
what you two were doing here.

482
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,465
Is this your secret date spot
or something?

483
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,759
A date?

484
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,160
Do Hwa helped me out, that's all.

485
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,600
Is this why you said you wanted
to be just friends with me?

486
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,729
It's not like that.

487
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:12,905
Hey, Nam Ju.

488
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,175
That's enough.

489
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,845
I warned you.

490
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,455
I said I hate it when
other people touch my things.

491
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,855
Nam Ju.

492
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,009
Why are you suddenly like this?

493
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:27,994
The rooftop will remain closed
as of today.

494
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:32,464
Nam Ju.

495
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,769
It feels like
my sad feelings all fly away...

496
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:47,015
when I look up into the blue sky.

497
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,755
Nam Ju!

498
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,494
Why don't we say hi to Nam Ju
while we're here?

499
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:12,334
It might be embarrassing
for him at school.

500
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,460
Let's go.

501
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,535
Okay, then.

502
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:26,485
Why are you following me?

503
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,639
Why didn't you stay with Do Hwa?

504
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,955
Nam Ju,

505
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,024
you shouldn't be like that.

506
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,624
Isn't it enough to just bully me?

507
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:38,594
- Why are you bullying him...
- Did you follow me to say that?

508
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,535
It's my fault for thinking
that we became friends.

509
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,105
Why are you...

510
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,605
Why are you so clueless?

511
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,304
What more can I do?

512
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,015
What are you talking about?

513
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:57,169
Do you really have no idea,

514
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:58,744
or are you only pretending?

515
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,819
(It feels like my sad feelings...)

516
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,364
(Looking good.)

517
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:14,334
Isn't this funny?

518
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:15,964
What is?

519
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,834
How everyone is so serious.

520
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,735
Even if the sky turns black
and chairs are floating around,

521
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,475
they still have no idea because
they have to say their lines.

522
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,229
No matter what you say
in the shadow,

523
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:28,075
they won't remember
in the next scene.

524
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,844
Because they aren't aware
of themselves.

525
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,485
How stupid.

526
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:36,485
But I seem more stupid
for liking such a stupid girl.

527
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,585
- That's your character.
- I've become self-aware,

528
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,655
but why am I still the same person
as my character...

529
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,525
that the writer gave me?

530
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:45,994
It's not fair.

531
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,074
Will things change between us...

532
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,605
if Ju Da becomes self-aware?

533
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:04,944
Has anything changed for you
since you became self-aware?

534
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:09,215
I want to know more about myself.

535
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,324
I'm jealous of you.

536
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,994
There are things you want
to know and do.

537
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,494
If you don't have any character,
that means anything is possible.

538
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,864
It's really sad
how you have to play a certain role.

539
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:23,704
My role is...

540
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,335
just to watch her.

541
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,999
Why isn't it coming?

542
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,574
- Why won't it come?
- Is it today?

543
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,014
- When will it come?
- Please come.

544
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,539
I'm his number one fan
in Seuli High School.

545
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:39,939
I'll get it, won't I?

546
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:41,309
- Hey, wait.
- I'm so nervous.

547
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,679
- His birthday is tomorrow.
- It didn't come?

548
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,850
They said it'd be sent soon.

549
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,655
What's with everyone?

550
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,049
I finally got it.

551
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,665
An invitation
to Nam Ju's birthday party.

552
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:53,450
What is this?

553
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,859
"You're invited to a reception..."

554
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:56,335
"to celebrate
Oh Nam Ju's birthday..."

555
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,260
- My goodness.
- Isn't this great?

556
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,675
Dan Oh, take a picture of me
with Nam Ju.

557
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,669
Where did you get this?

558
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:05,600
- What?
- Where is the other one?

559
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,729
- Where?
- Did you see it?

560
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,645
Hey, where is the picture panel
that was standing here?

561
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,239
The picture is a little worse
than how he looks in real life.

562
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,570
Why do you care so much
about some panel?

563
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,479
Hey! "Some panel"?

564
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,080
The moment Nam Ju's picture
got printed on the panel,

565
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,780
the panel became alive
with Nam Ju's life.

566
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,020
It's like Nam Ju's magic.

567
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,950
You might as well take it home.

568
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,665
Yes, I will.

569
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:26,020
Do you like him so much?

570
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,235
Yes, I like him the most
in this world.

571
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,994
- Why?
- What?

572
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
There's no reason
because we're meant to be.

573
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,004
I just like him.

574
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,760
Don't touch him.

575
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,874
"Meant to be"?

576
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,645
- Don't talk casually to me.
- My gosh.

577
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:50,785
A birthday present for me.

578
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:52,624
Please take good care of this.

579
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,324
My woman likes strawberries.

580
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,520
Let me make a formal announcement.

581
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,465
From now on,
Ju Da is the only woman for me.

582
00:39:12,669 --> 00:39:13,845
Oh, no.

583
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,675
Ju Da's stage is...

584
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:19,444
This is unfair.

585
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,439
If the main characters announce
that they're officially dating,

586
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,855
what will happen to me?

587
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,910
I help out the female lead
and let the male lead take glory...

588
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,454
just like
all supporting characters do.

589
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,025
It's so obvious.

590
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:31,064
- I'll help you.
- You know how it is.

591
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:33,320
Everything will happen
as the writer planned.

592
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,689
Hey, we should
at least give it a try.

593
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:37,105
How are we going to change that?

594
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,324
Why won't you go?

595
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:00,384
I don't want to.

596
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,520
You said you'll change
the story with me.

597
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,919
Why are you suddenly doing this?

598
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:04,989
Because it might be dangerous.

599
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:07,020
For whom? Me? You?

600
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,134
That stage has nothing to do
with you anyway.

601
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,590
I just want to change something.

602
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,634
Why is everyone telling me
that I can't?

603
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,530
You also know...

604
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,845
that I don't have much time left.

605
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,570
I need you to change the stage.

606
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,485
It's something that only you can do.

607
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,314
Please?

608
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:30,884
Dan Oh.

609
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:36,655
We need to talk.

610
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:39,789
Hey, that hurts.

611
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:41,535
What's with you?

612
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,905
Why are you all like this?

613
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,505
I don't think
Dan Oh has anything to say to you.

614
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,775
Why do you care?

615
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,255
Hey.

616
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,665
Hey.

617
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,995
I have something to say to her.

618
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,905
What are you looking at?

619
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,074
I'll go to the birthday party.

620
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:37,324
I'll help you.

621
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,785
Dan Oh.

622
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,824
Are you here to see Baek Kyung?

623
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,680
Sae Mi, you know how Baek Kyung
got mad at me in the classroom?

624
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,724
When? Did he get mad at you again?

625
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:22,859
I knew it. It wasn't the stage.

626
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,459
What's his problem?

627
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,865
How great does he think...

628
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,635
He is handsome, indeed.

629
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,645
But still, he's this tall...

630
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:34,074
Maybe taller than this?

631
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,844
He's even tall.

632
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:39,714
You should be more understanding.
He's handsome, you know.

633
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,755
Everything is changing...

634
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:46,025
bit by bit.

635
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,220
Baek Kyung's here!

636
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,820
- Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung!

637
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,859
He's so handsome!

638
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:57,359
- He looks great in blue!
- I know!

639
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,505
My gosh!

640
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:06,999
Good luck, Baek Kyung!

641
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:09,814
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

642
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,785
Good luck!

643
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:15,515
You first.

644
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,320
What was that?

645
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,064
What kind of serve was that?

646
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:30,629
Baek Kyung, good luck!

647
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:32,135
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

648
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,804
- Did you just see that serve?
- You're so awesome!

649
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,444
- This is so boring for me.
- Good job!

650
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,804
Happy now?

651
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:57,854
Give me your racket.

652
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:00,525
Give it to me.

653
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:03,255
Is this an antique or what?

654
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,295
From now on, play tennis with me.

655
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:09,834
Why should I?

656
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,865
I'm going to keep you in check.

657
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:14,304
I need to know
what kind of guy you are.

658
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,684
Can you stop already?

659
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,765
- Hey.
- What?

660
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,165
Is something going on?

661
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,460
It's bothering me.

662
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,405
What is bothering you? Dan Oh?

663
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,670
Hey, be good to her.

664
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,245
She's really ill.

665
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,139
Even Haru is helping her
so she'd live.

666
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:59,415
Aren't you being too harsh?
You're her fiance.

667
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,249
Baek Kyung, aren't you being too cruel?

668
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:12,820
I'm the second best, okay?

669
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,619
The third best has no right
to ignore me like that...

670
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:17,064
although we're in the shadow.

671
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,064
"Shadow"?

672
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:22,005
On stage, Nam Ju bothers me.
In the shadow...

673
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,245
Was it that upsetting
when I told you to be good to her?

674
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,745
What?

675
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,074
Hey, Haru.

676
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,314
I'm glad you're here. I'm so upset.

677
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,155
Do Hwa.

678
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:36,255
Do you know him?

679
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:37,925
He's Haru from your class.

680
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,425
Right, you won't remember.

681
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,795
"Haru"?

682
00:46:56,729 --> 00:46:58,930
Baek Kyung, our PE teacher wants you
to write some candidates' names...

683
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,775
on this soccer team list.

684
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:03,869
- Why should I?
- You're the head.

685
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:06,444
You should do it.

686
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,885
Okay.

687
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,684
- Hold on.
- Yes?

688
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,964
Thanks.

689
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:24,228
(Candidate Names: Haru)

690
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:25,560
I'm going to hang it in my room.

691
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,629
- Really? Look at this.
- You've got to hear this!

692
00:47:28,629 --> 00:47:30,729
- What is it?
- Did you get one?

693
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:31,944
Nam Ju.

694
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,875
Did you not invite him?

695
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,970
- Do you like coffee?
- I'm going to dress like this.

696
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,470
- Like that?
- It looks neat.

697
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,785
Is he in our class?

698
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,639
- Do you not know him?
- Who is he?

699
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:42,184
I don't like it.

700
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,190
(You first.)

701
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,560
(Oh, okay.)

702
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,265
(What kind of serve was that?)

703
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:14,310
(You first.)

704
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,515
(Oh, okay.)

705
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:53,909
Eight ham and cheese sandwiches
and milk tea to-go, please.

706
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,694
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

707
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:05,529
Here are your delicious sandwiches
and milk tea.

708
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:07,635
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

709
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,015
Nam Ju.

710
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:18,045
Why are you here?

711
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:21,615
Make sure you come.
I have something to tell you.

712
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:29,294
Bye.

713
00:49:38,189 --> 00:49:39,560
(Knock, knock)

714
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,135
(Make sure you come.
I have something to tell you.)

715
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,915
I'm sick of watching.

716
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,855
I want to confess my feelings
for her at least once.

717
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,229
- Where are you going?
- Don't talk casually to me.

718
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,974
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

719
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,199
Hey, guys.

720
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:19,175
Oh, my. It's so private
and exclusive.

721
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,369
My gosh, guys.

722
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:22,639
I am currently
at Oh Nam Ju's birthday party!

723
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,815
He's the most popular guy
at Seuli High School.

724
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:26,439
Cameras are banned.

725
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:27,639
I'll just film a little bit...

726
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:28,915
- and turn it off.
- Come on.

727
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:31,810
Hold on! Sae Mi, wait for me!

728
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,350
I think you got the wrong idea.

729
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,325
- I'm with her.
- No, he's not!

730
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:37,925
He's not with me.

731
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,050
- Sae Mi!
- Come on in.

732
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,095
You need to scan my barcode.

733
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:48,605
Hey, look.

734
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:51,830
His outfit is very flamboyant.

735
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,944
It's too much.

736
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:55,899
What could I do? That was
the most ordinary-looking one...

737
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:56,969
out of my brother's clothes.

738
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:59,845
What's up with his taste?
It's so weird.

739
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:02,439
- Hey.
- Hello, Haru.

740
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,109
- My gosh, look at you.
- Look at you.

741
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:06,109
Goodness, you look...

742
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:07,280
so great. You look great.

743
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,355
- You look great.
- Good.

744
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,090
All right. Hey, focus.

745
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,250
You all remember the storyboard
I told you earlier, right?

746
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,159
- Yes.
- No matter how small it may be,

747
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,135
we must change something. Okay?

748
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:19,764
But...

749
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,635
do you think the scene on the stage
will change?

750
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,000
When the stage starts,

751
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,704
everything goes back to its places.

752
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:29,300
Buddy, so are you telling me
that you'll just watch...

753
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,010
Nam Ju publicly announcing
his feelings for Ju Da?

754
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,510
- Never.
- Right?

755
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,969
Then, you ought to do
something about it.

756
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:36,780
We don't know
how and which scene might change.

757
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,055
But we can try
to change the scene together...

758
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:49,865
Darn it. No.

759
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:52,034
Go inside.

760
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,805
Hello?

761
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:03,274
- Hey.
- Who is he?

762
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,714
Do you go to Seuli High School?

763
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:06,669
Which grade and class are you in?

764
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:08,454
- Junior, Class Seven.
- Your name?

765
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,925
Haru. Let me check
your invitation card.

766
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:20,794
Junior, Class Seven?

767
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:22,494
Do you know who he is?

768
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,500
- Hey, you can't go in.
- Toss him.

769
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,899
How dare you try to enter here?
You're a nobody.

770
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:36,675
Hey, do a better job
securing the area.

771
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,784
My goodness.

772
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,109
Congratulations. You look dashing.

773
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:48,550
Darn the stage. Darn my violin.

774
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,719
You're here, Do Hwa.

775
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:52,119
- Hello.
- Hi.

776
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:54,294
My gosh,
you still look beautiful, ma'am.

777
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:57,464
You're always so sweet.

778
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,105
I bet only my son looks that sad...

779
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,375
on his birthday.

780
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,315
He must be nervous.

781
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:12,040
I heard
that you will play the violin today.

782
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,580
Yes, it's my best friend's birthday.

783
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,655
I ought to.

784
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:17,540
Thank you. Good luck.

785
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,625
Okay.

786
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:20,980
- Happy birthday to your son.
- Sir.

787
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,050
- Hello.
- Happy birthday to your son

788
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,679
Thank you. Please go upstairs.

789
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,550
Letting go of a woman I like...

790
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,149
and playing the violin in tears...

791
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:29,135
is the role
the writer set up for me.

792
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,335
- Do you want it?
- I told my dad to get it for me.

793
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:41,415
Who are you looking for?

794
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,675
Just someone.

795
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:45,869
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

796
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,484
You were never interested
in what I did before.

797
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,454
You have something to do. Look.

798
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:56,250
- Baek Kyung.
- Baek Kyung.

799
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,990
That's the character
the writer gave you,

800
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,919
so do your best to hang out
with the girls today. Okay?

801
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:02,320
- Have fun!
- Dan Oh.

802
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,294
- Why did you come with her?
- Baek Kyung.

803
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,434
Hey, Dan Oh!

804
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,734
Stop playing.

805
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,575
I don't want to play it either.

806
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:15,399
I heard this song relaxes people.

807
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,744
You think I need to relax?

808
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,115
Aren't you the one who's nervous?

809
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,555
I'm going to tell Ju Da
my feelings for her today.

810
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:30,480
What's the look on your face?

811
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,865
I thought you two were just friends.

812
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,219
How do I look?

813
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:37,694
Check out the look on your face
in the mirror.

814
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,385
Why weren't you in the green room?

815
00:55:13,459 --> 00:55:14,534
Who is this?

816
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,774
Your face looks familiar.

817
00:55:20,669 --> 00:55:23,145
My gosh, happy birthday to your son.

818
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:40,524
In the end, the scene is going
according to the storyboard.

819
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,385
Open it.

820
00:56:02,379 --> 00:56:03,615
No one in the world...

821
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:05,555
has the same shoes.
That's the only pair.

822
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:23,635
Today is your birthday.

823
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,675
Your presence here...

824
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,444
is a birthday present for me.

825
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:34,244
There.

826
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:36,754
How beautiful.

827
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,655
The shoes look beautiful.

828
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,095
See you at the party.

829
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,645
Hello.

830
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,744
Please take good care of this.

831
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,469
My woman likes strawberries.

832
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:08,510
I will count on you.

833
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:09,984
- Okay. Please don't worry.
- Okay.

834
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:14,080
Mr. Oh Nam Ju specifically
ordered this birthday cake.

835
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,895
- Let's take good care of it.
- Yes, sir.

836
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,224
Hey, you. Take this.

837
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,744
Unbelievable.
Don't eat like you've starved.

838
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:38,609
Sae Mi, this is so good.
It tastes divine.

839
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:40,544
- What? Which one tastes divine?
- It's divine.

840
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,325
Baek Kyung, you look so handsome.

841
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,425
You look so hot in your outfit.

842
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:00,189
How do I look?

843
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:02,875
I wore this to match your outfit.

844
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:08,274
Yes?

845
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,969
How do I look?

846
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:11,044
Get out of my way.

847
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,615
Darn it.

848
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,310
He paid no attention to you.

849
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,284
What? Go away!

850
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,524
This is all ruined.

851
00:58:54,609 --> 00:58:55,694
Come in.

852
00:58:58,719 --> 00:58:59,719
Put them over there and leave.

853
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:00,794
Hey.

854
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,305
Not everyone can enter this place.

855
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:08,274
What's going on?

856
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:09,835
I don't think
he's supposed to be here.

857
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,530
When did you get in?

858
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,075
- Earlier.
- Do Hwa.

859
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:18,115
Do you know him?

860
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,014
What's your problem?

861
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:27,925
Do Hwa, now.

862
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:29,524
Go to Ju Da now.

863
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:46,730
Hey, Do Hwa.

864
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,875
Ju Da.

865
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,034
What's all this?

866
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:20,474
You look so pretty today.

867
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,974
I look awkward in this, right?

868
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,010
I guess outfits can change you.

869
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,085
No.

870
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:30,415
You were always pretty
even without a fancy dress.

871
01:00:35,379 --> 01:00:36,454
Ju Da.

872
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,395
I need to tell you something.

873
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:41,994
What is it?

874
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,835
I like you.

875
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:51,530
Everyone, you've been waiting
for a long time.

876
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,929
I give you...

877
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:55,815
the man of the hour, Oh Nam Ju.

878
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,409
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

879
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:02,209
- Nam Ju!
- Oh Nam Ju! Oh Nam Ju!

880
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:04,109
- This isn't good.
- Oh Nam Ju!

881
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:06,254
- What's going on?
- Nam Ju is gone.

882
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:08,085
Oh Nam Ju...

883
01:01:08,379 --> 01:01:09,954
- Where's Nam Ju?
- Where is he?

884
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:21,365
(Yeo Ju Da)

885
01:01:21,459 --> 01:01:24,100
Our star will always appear last.

886
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,770
Hey, Nam Ju is gone.

887
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,875
- What?
- What?

888
01:01:27,969 --> 01:01:30,444
The star is always late.

889
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,815
I don't think so.
Look at Ms. Cha's face.

890
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:35,740
Nam Ju is going to appear
a little bit later...

891
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,439
- as he gets ready...
- Follow me.

892
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:38,879
to make a perfect entrance.

893
01:01:38,879 --> 01:01:40,284
So please wait
for a little longer...

894
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,425
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

895
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,595
- What was that?
- Darn it.

896
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,065
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

897
01:01:51,889 --> 01:01:53,105
Dan Oh, where are you going?

898
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:55,675
What is she doing?

899
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,605
- What's going on?
- I was startled.

900
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:00,704
What is this? What's with me?

901
01:02:15,419 --> 01:02:17,655
This is definitely the scene
that I saw on the storyboard.

902
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,699
- What was that?
- My goodness.

903
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:40,544
- That was the cake.
- Oh, gosh. What will he do?

904
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:43,415
- He should've been more careful.
- My goodness.

905
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,724
- Oh, no.
- He ruined the cake?

906
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,355
Let me make a formal announcement.

907
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,264
Let me make a formal announcement.

908
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:55,464
- What about the cake?
- It's such a waste.

909
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,790
- The star isn't even here yet.
- Should we get the candles?

910
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,129
- Nam Ju isn't even here.
- I'll take care of this.

911
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:02,929
But the cake is ruined.

912
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:04,434
From now on,

913
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,805
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

914
01:03:13,109 --> 01:03:14,415
- What?
- My gosh.

915
01:04:00,189 --> 01:04:04,464
(Extra-ordinary You)
