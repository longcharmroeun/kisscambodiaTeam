1
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:08,310
From now on,

2
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:10,690
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

3
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:15,054
- No, Baek Kyung!
- Baek Kyung, you're awesome!

4
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:17,670
- Dan Oh, get away from him!
- All right!

5
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:19,270
- Dan Oh!
- Really?

6
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,399
Come on, Dan Oh.

7
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:24,039
- All right!
- Yes!

8
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,110
- Hey, Dan Oh!
- All right!

9
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,035
- Are you serious?
- Looking great!

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,204
- Come on, get closer.
- No way.

11
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:32,475
- This is amazing.
- This is insane.

12
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:33,680
What is it?

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,419
Dan Oh, I'll accept...

14
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,149
your sincere love.

15
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,620
If this is some kind of a joke,

16
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:41,185
you need to stop.

17
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:42,419
I'm not joking.

18
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:45,290
I'm going to try to like you...

19
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:46,800
as of now.

20
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:53,325
- You're awesome!
- My gosh.

21
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:54,594
- This is huge.
- Goodness.

22
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:57,465
- My gosh.
- Come on, Dan Oh.

23
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:58,970
This is insane.

24
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,600
Let me go.

25
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:29,639
You're looking at me,

26
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:33,010
but why does it feel like
you're talking to someone else?

27
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,919
You.

28
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,844
Don't you dare toy
with people's feelings.

29
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:48,960
"Toy"?

30
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,730
Isn't that what you're doing to me?

31
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:55,359
You used to cry because of me
and now...

32
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:57,954
How could I not be upset
by what you have just said?

33
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:00,669
That wasn't me.
It was what the writer wanted.

34
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:04,570
- What?
- I've never liked you willingly.

35
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,340
Say it again.

36
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:08,880
Repeat what you just said.

37
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:15,549
Baek Kyung, I've never liked you.

38
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:41,604
The pain will slowly
get worse and worse...

39
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:44,709
if you make a mess of the stage
in order to find your answer.

40
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:48,619
Stop Dan Oh.

41
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:55,720
Haru!

42
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,560
The stage changed.

43
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,530
Once the story begins,
everything needs to fall into place.

44
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,570
So why weren't
Nam Ju and Ju Da present?

45
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:09,239
Why? Why?

46
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,305
I'm sure there's something
between Do Hwa and Ju Da.

47
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:14,935
That's why the story changed,

48
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,305
and Baek Kyung and I became
the main characters.

49
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,619
You and I changed the story!

50
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,705
Stop Dan Oh.

51
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:23,720
That's the reason why you exist.

52
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:27,844
The stage has changed.

53
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:29,359
Soon...

54
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,230
No.

55
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:41,293
Ju Da. I need to tell you something.

56
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:42,369
What is it?

57
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:45,139
I like you.

58
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,609
Me too.

59
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:54,019
I like you.

60
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,790
We're friends.

61
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,660
"Friends"? That's what
the writer intends.

62
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:07,260
But I chose to like you.

63
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:12,030
This can't happen.

64
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,899
Why not?

65
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:17,040
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel right.

66
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:20,609
Think carefully about how you feel.

67
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,950
About how I feel?

68
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,209
Ju Da.

69
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:27,849
Please remember...

70
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:30,519
this moment.

71
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:46,940
(Yeo Ju Da)

72
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:48,599
Ju Da.

73
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,095
Nam Ju.

74
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,279
You're late.

75
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,209
I was about to go.

76
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:00,250
There's no need.

77
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,089
The party is over.

78
00:05:09,884 --> 00:05:11,060
Nam Ju!

79
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,099
Ju Da!

80
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:16,300
Are you okay?

81
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:24,339
What happened?

82
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:25,594
What is it?

83
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,504
- What's going on?
- What is it?

84
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,134
- Nam Ju!
- What?

85
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:31,010
- Are you okay?
- Yes!

86
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,849
It was a mistake.

87
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,444
Well...

88
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:39,884
Let me escort you.

89
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:42,659
- This way.
- I'll see you next time. I'm sorry.

90
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:47,060
Nam Ju.

91
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:52,399
Why don't you brag...

92
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,795
in front of everyone
about how disrespectful you are?

93
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:56,834
Mother.

94
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,979
If your father was here,
he would've gone ballistic.

95
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,010
Do you think this is a joke?

96
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:04,380
Until when...

97
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:07,675
am I supposed to manage
all of this singlehandedly?

98
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,750
You're just afraid
of getting kicked out.

99
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:13,285
- What?
- Don't use...

100
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:15,420
your son's birthday party
for your fame.

101
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:18,289
- How dare you?
- I am sick...

102
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,300
of everything.

103
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,800
You...

104
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:27,839
Everything's changed, right?

105
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:29,599
Right?

106
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:38,605
(Nam Ju.)

107
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:39,849
(Slapping)

108
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,670
Stop Dan Oh.

109
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:08,339
That's the reason why you exist.

110
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,300
(Your love for me never mattered
and never will!)

111
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:33,425
Isn't it basic etiquette
to make sure the book...

112
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,099
you borrowed is given back
in good quality?

113
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,839
I guess you were surprised
while reading.

114
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:44,134
But then again, I was startled
as well.

115
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:46,250
It's a cliche romance comic,

116
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:49,105
but I can no longer predict
the ending.

117
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:50,450
Just like you said,

118
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:53,589
the pain worsens every time
the story changes.

119
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:56,490
I told you so.

120
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:01,153
So why are you enduring the pain
and helping her?

121
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:02,860
Because Dan Oh knew my name...

122
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:05,670
when I didn't.

123
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,610
I keep seeing these flowers that
I've never seen before.

124
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,950
What's strange is,

125
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:23,349
they always appear when she's there.

126
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:26,420
What's even stranger is,

127
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,420
both the flowers and she...

128
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,659
seem familiar to me.

129
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,154
I believed she'd tell me...

130
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,930
why I felt that way...

131
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,339
and where I began.

132
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,670
She won't be able
to tell you anything.

133
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:48,239
She's just an extra
who's running out of time.

134
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:50,810
The writer created this world.

135
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:53,650
And you guys are just two
of the countless extras.

136
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,420
There are neither answers
nor meanings.

137
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,989
The writer will get rid...

138
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,890
of any extras who will interfere
with the story.

139
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:09,599
Then...

140
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,400
- will Dan Oh...
- She has a name and a role.

141
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:14,640
She's different from you.

142
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,300
There are levels for extras.

143
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:18,339
You're the only one...

144
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:20,879
who'll disappear.

145
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:39,629
- Haru.
- It's pretty.

146
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:43,599
Dan Oh!

147
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:46,024
Congratulations.
Baek Kyung was so amazing.

148
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:48,664
Is your love finally coming true
after 10 years?

149
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:49,965
Are you two really getting married?

150
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,034
Did he say that you are truly
the only girl for him?

151
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,865
Tell us how you seduced him.

152
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,004
"Seduced"?

153
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,205
It only worked
because she was sincere.

154
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,219
It's just like my feelings
for Nam Ju.

155
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:02,544
- Lucky you.
- You are amazing.

156
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:03,544
- Tell us.
- How did you do it?

157
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,075
She has a name and a role.

158
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,585
- Did you guys kiss?
- Did you?

159
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,190
- She's different from you.
- Did he confess his love?

160
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:10,855
There are levels for extras.

161
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:13,154
- Where did you kiss?
- Tell us.

162
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,329
You're the only one...

163
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,095
who'll disappear.

164
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,154
- My gosh!
- Seriously?

165
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:21,270
- You kissed?
- They did?

166
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:30,009
Hey, Haru!

167
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:35,979
- Haru.
- Dan Oh!

168
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:42,844
I didn't know such a handsome guy
went to our school.

169
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,160
Who is he?

170
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:49,725
You're making my heart flutter
by staring at me like that.

171
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,700
I thought Nam Ju was your only love.

172
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:54,440
The slot for my second love
is still available.

173
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,595
Hey, look at how many likes
I'm getting!

174
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,540
- I'll take care of this.
- But the cake is ruined.

175
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,434
- From now on,
- Your video is very popular.

176
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:02,339
- No way.
- Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

177
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,810
Oh, my. Dan Oh, look at this.

178
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:09,604
Gosh, his lines and actions
were totally Nam Ju's style.

179
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,075
Look at him hugging her!

180
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,914
My gosh. I can't believe
how close you guys have gotten.

181
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:16,044
Gosh, Baek Kyung is quite direct.

182
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:17,684
The entire school is going crazy.

183
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,514
All the kids in my class ask me...

184
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:20,959
if Baek Kyung has really set his mind
on you.

185
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,725
Only men know how other men feel.

186
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,800
In my opinion, this is a done deal.

187
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:26,625
- See? Look at his eyes.
- But...

188
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,099
wasn't this too sudden?

189
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:31,764
I mean, I'm happy because Dan Oh
isn't in one-sided love anymore.

190
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:34,209
Up until a while ago,
he was seeing other girls.

191
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,180
Did something happen
between you two?

192
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:42,119
- Something did happen!
- Oh, my!

193
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:47,020
We really did it this time.

194
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,320
Ju Da.

195
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,030
Nam Ju.

196
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,200
- Nam Ju.
- Hi, Nam Ju.

197
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:03,125
No way. He and I
have matching bracelets.

198
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,634
- Stop lying.
- What's wrong with you?

199
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,235
I'm serious.
I have the same one at home.

200
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:07,579
- Where did you buy it?
- You don't know anything.

201
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,780
Where did I buy it? Why do you ask?

202
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:13,619
You're not going to talk to Ju Da?

203
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,644
Why do I feel bad for those two?

204
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,144
You've been hassled by everyone
today because of me.

205
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,044
Hey, that's not your fault.

206
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:24,060
I changed it
because I wanted to change it.

207
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,690
I'd feel better once I told her
about my feelings, but...

208
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,930
Anyway, where is Haru?

209
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:32,170
I don't know. He's been acting weird
since this morning.

210
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:35,869
Was the changed story
too shocking for him?

211
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,115
- Just tell us.
- What happened?

212
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:54,615
- Everyone, I don't even know.
- You tell us.

213
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:56,144
- Dan Oh.
- Go away. Stop.

214
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,585
- Dan Oh.
- Hey, go away. Get lost!

215
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:01,430
- Hey, stop it. That's enough.
- What happened?

216
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:03,495
- We have a problem!
- What is it?

217
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,554
We don't have a goalkeeper.

218
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:06,865
- I can do it. I'll do it.
- Let me do it. Me, me.

219
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:07,940
What about him?

220
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:09,524
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

221
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:10,940
- Is he in our class?
- Hey, you!

222
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:12,565
- You startled me.
- Do you want to play soccer?

223
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,164
- My goodness.
- I guess he can't hear us.

224
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:15,879
- He can't hear us.
- Don't even try.

225
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:18,609
- I'll go get him.
- Baek Kyung.

226
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:19,979
- Do you know him?
- Do you know him?

227
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,150
- Hey.
- Get him to join us.

228
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:23,674
- Get him to join us.
- Let's go.

229
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,190
The guys want you
to play soccer with us.

230
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,190
Do you not have friends?

231
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:34,129
- I do.
- I see. Is that so?

232
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:36,030
But why are you alone then?

233
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,394
You don't hang out with A3
all the time.

234
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm not that close with them.

235
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,040
I'm really close with someone else.

236
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,540
The girl I'm engaged to.

237
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:47,540
You know her too, right?

238
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,404
Yes. Dan Oh.

239
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,410
I see. You knew?

240
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,550
Right. The whole school knows
she had a crush on me.

241
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:58,150
Should I let you in on a secret?

242
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm just toying with her.

243
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:09,355
Are you serious?

244
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:12,129
She'd even die for me
if I'm a bit nicer to her.

245
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,609
But who on earth are you?

246
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:19,264
You won't know even if I tell you.

247
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:20,709
I see.

248
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:22,739
Is that so?

249
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:57,379
Dan Oh!

250
00:14:58,705 --> 00:14:59,735
You're quite the trickster.

251
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,245
How dare you pull that stunt
at Nam Ju's birthday party?

252
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:02,575
Have you gone mad?

253
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,920
I guess faking your condition
worked on him.

254
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,615
What are you doing? What is this?

255
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,520
- Where are you going? Hey.
- Stop her.

256
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:12,085
This is pathetic, Dan Oh.

257
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:13,955
You should just keep
having a crush on him.

258
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,554
That kind of role
suits you perfectly.

259
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,495
That kind of role suits me?

260
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:20,524
- Yes.
- Aren't you embarrassed at all?

261
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:21,825
You begged him for love.

262
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:22,900
What?

263
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,369
- Look at her.
- She's pretending to be sick.

264
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,839
Hey, Dan Oh.

265
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,079
Dan Oh, you little...

266
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,375
What are you doing?

267
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,450
Who are you?

268
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:35,219
Are you all right?

269
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:41,560
Move. Dan Oh, come with me
to the nurse's office.

270
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,089
- Baek Kyung.
- Baek Kyung.

271
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,229
Oh, no.

272
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:50,969
What's your problem?

273
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,770
No, I'll take her.

274
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,140
Let's stop for a second.

275
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,450
Are you sure you're okay?

276
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,050
I think you have a fever too.

277
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:14,445
No. I'm...

278
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:17,160
I'll be fine
once I get some fresh air.

279
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:19,190
I promise.

280
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:30,869
I'm in it too.

281
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,310
Can you let me keep this?

282
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:39,904
You acted as if you didn't
know me this morning.

283
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:41,320
What was that earlier?

284
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,180
You made my heart pound.

285
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,290
I just had something to think about.

286
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:51,390
I get it. Changing a scene
on the stage happens rarely.

287
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:54,560
I can understand
how confused you must be now.

288
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:58,095
But I still think
I'm creating my own moments...

289
00:16:58,095 --> 00:17:00,129
to my heart's content.

290
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:08,209
What was that? Why did you smile?

291
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,009
You are right.

292
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:16,880
I'll just follow my heart too.

293
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:19,749
I'll keep going...

294
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,759
regardless of the price
I have to pay.

295
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,289
Right?

296
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:26,755
Trust me and follow my lead
just like you've been doing so far.

297
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,830
Okay?

298
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,039
Hey, wait up.

299
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,620
("Flower")

300
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:55,989
What about Dan Oh?
Why are you here alone?

301
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,759
I guess you are scared.

302
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,900
You told me that I would disappear.

303
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:03,130
Everyone would be scared then.

304
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:06,029
Exactly. It would've been nice
if you listened to me.

305
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:07,840
Your hand wouldn't have hurt.

306
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:09,739
And the story
wouldn't have changed either.

307
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,910
An extra in a romance comic
isn't that bad.

308
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:17,450
There's a lot to observe too.

309
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:18,779
Anyway, I'm glad.

310
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,150
You won't play along
with Dan Oh's plan, right?

311
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:24,249
It wasn't something I could stop.

312
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,090
I couldn't keep
my distance...

313
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:29,860
from her.

314
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,900
I will stay on Dan Oh's side.

315
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:35,459
What?

316
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,769
I started to want a different fate
for my character too.

317
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,255
- You...
- I don't want to be an extra...

318
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,164
that can vanish whenever, wherever,
and however the writer wants.

319
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,469
I decided to be the only person
who can change...

320
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:48,140
someone's fate.

321
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,519
If there's no answer
as to how I came to this world,

322
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,049
I will...

323
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,219
make my own answer...

324
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:04,029
with Dan Oh.

325
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:30,714
(If there's no answer
as to how I came to this world,)

326
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:35,420
(I will make my own answer.)

327
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:40,930
- I'm home.
- Dan Oh.

328
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:42,600
Come here.

329
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,370
What? What is it?

330
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,855
You forgot to tell me something.

331
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:49,464
I forgot something? No way.
I don't forget things.

332
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:52,610
Baek Kyung. Go ahead.
Brag all you want to me.

333
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,779
I don't know. I'm so tired.

334
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:59,110
My gosh, you're shy.

335
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:06,519
From now on,

336
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,319
- Dan Oh is the only woman for me.
- I can't watch this.

337
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:12,855
(Baek Kyung is too good for her.)

338
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:14,585
"Baek Kyung is too good for her."

339
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:16,325
"Eun Dan Oh chased after him
for a decade."

340
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:18,029
"She's almost a stalker."

341
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,840
My gosh,
these comments are infuriating!

342
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:22,464
The story has changed,

343
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:25,539
but is my set-up, my crush
of 10 years, still the same?

344
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,479
"Baek Kyung can do
so much better than her."

345
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,519
"Eun Dan Oh is too good for him."

346
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:40,249
My gosh.

347
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:02,539
Goodness.
What's wrong with this?

348
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:06,580
It's broken. It's definitely broken.
It's totally busted.

349
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,289
It's so noisy. Be quiet.

350
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,840
Leaving without saying goodbye?

351
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:50,989
It's me.

352
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,630
I want more information
on one of the students.

353
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:00,229
Nam Ju.

354
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:04,670
Why? Do you have
something to say to me?

355
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:09,265
Well, you know, on your birthday...

356
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:12,509
Oh, before you go on,
I have something to say to you.

357
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,590
You can stop running errands for me.

358
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:20,019
It got annoying.

359
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,795
Hey, you need to be quiet today.

360
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,299
Try to take a hint.

361
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:44,680
Hi.

362
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,150
(Heart rate: 123,
Normal heart rate: 65)

363
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,630
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

364
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:01,100
Yes. No. No, it's...

365
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:04,724
I think this is broken. It's broken.

366
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:06,670
Yes, it's broken.

367
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:10,299
Are you sure you're okay?

368
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:14,140
Yes, of course. Of course, I'm okay.

369
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:17,140
Let's go.

370
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:32,390
Oh, no.

371
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:35,059
Dan Oh, you must be broken.

372
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:06,690
Are you okay?

373
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,160
Hey, Do Hwa.

374
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:15,239
I wish I wasn't
aware of myself like you.

375
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:17,809
Then I wouldn't have to be
in so much pain right now.

376
00:24:28,244 --> 00:24:29,319
Do Hwa.

377
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:33,444
- Going to see Ju Da?
- No.

378
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:35,319
You don't need
to be conscious of me anymore.

379
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:38,015
- What?
- Use her as your errand girl.

380
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,590
I don't need her anymore.

381
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:40,830
Hey.

382
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:43,259
She's not a thing.

383
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:47,900
Why are you overreacting?

384
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:51,039
You said she's just a friend.

385
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:59,009
I can't stand
the way you talk about Ju Da.

386
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:02,549
- Who do you think you are...
- Because I like Ju Da!

387
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:07,244
I told you to
stop crossing over the line.

388
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:09,019
You said she's just a friend.

389
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:11,984
Answer me!

390
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:14,959
How many times do I have to tell you
that I like her?

391
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,900
I let you slide a few times
even though you were cheeky...

392
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,799
only because you're my friend.

393
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:25,110
I'm only holding myself back
because you're a friend.

394
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:28,934
(Going to see Ju Da?)

395
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,410
(I told you to
stop crossing over the line.)

396
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,804
- Are you thinking about Baek Kyung?
- What?

397
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:35,120
No.

398
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,204
You can't fool me.

399
00:25:36,204 --> 00:25:38,775
You look like you're thinking of
someone you like.

400
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,390
Me? No way.

401
00:25:40,644 --> 00:25:42,459
Okay, let's say you weren't.

402
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:46,654
Sae Mi, this is what happened
to a friend of mine.

403
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:48,085
She keeps thinking of this guy,

404
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,585
and her heart races
whenever she's with him.

405
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:53,469
Does this mean she likes him?

406
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:56,765
And your friend must be Eun Dan Oh.

407
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,370
No, it's not!

408
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:01,580
- He's coming.
- Haru?

409
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:07,875
Hey, Baek Kyung, let me make
an official announcement.

410
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,375
Here's your only woman, Dan Oh!

411
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,120
- Over here!
- Let me go.

412
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,430
This is getting on my nerves.

413
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:46,819
Dan Oh.

414
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,519
Are you asleep?

415
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:04,170
Darn it. Just leave already.

416
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:05,569
Dan Oh.

417
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,380
Why do I keep
getting concerned about you?

418
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:12,880
What?

419
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:15,880
What? This isn't even the stage.

420
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:26,190
It makes no sense.

421
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:28,999
Me, with someone like her?

422
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:40,769
What's with him?

423
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:44,621
(Episode 12 will air shortly.)

424
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,235
(Episode 12)

425
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,164
Everyone, listen up.

426
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,805
As of today, Lee Do Hwa...

427
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:55,330
isn't a member of A3 anymore.

428
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,570
- What?
- What?

429
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,944
- What?
- Do Hwa? Really?

430
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,699
I'm looking to add a new member.

431
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:01,769
- What?
- Do Hwa is out?

432
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,940
Hey, Ban Jang.
Do you want to be a part?

433
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,109
- Seriously?
- No way.

434
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:07,184
Then you?

435
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:08,825
You?

436
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,195
Okay, do you want to be a part?

437
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,664
Hey, curtains.

438
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,364
Yes, you. What's your name?

439
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,904
Do you want to be a part of A3?

440
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,229
- He must be insane.
- No way.

441
00:28:27,229 --> 00:28:28,874
- Really?
- What?

442
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:31,304
Nam Ju.

443
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:33,215
We need to talk.

444
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,955
Nam Ju! Hey, Nam Ju!

445
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,825
- Come on.
- Do Hwa is gone, then?

446
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,595
Did you and Do Hwa get in a fight?

447
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,665
If it's because of me,
it's a misunderstanding.

448
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,290
What misunderstanding?

449
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,605
Do Hwa and I are just friends.

450
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,459
- I...
- Hey.

451
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,959
Do you think you're a big shot...

452
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,704
just because I associated
with you a few times?

453
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,730
- What?
- Why do you care...

454
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,314
if Do Hwa gets kicked out or not?

455
00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:11,654
Do you like him or something?

456
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,055
- Is that why?
- No, it's not like that. Never.

457
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,654
I...

458
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:20,954
Stop it.

459
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,865
I don't want to hear it anymore.

460
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:32,374
Man, that really hurts.

461
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,005
You can try to talk it out
with Nam Ju again.

462
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,870
He won't remember, and he'll repeat
the same lines again and again.

463
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,715
Oh, the same goes
for Ju Da, I guess.

464
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,715
But still, I like her.

465
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,055
I feel much better
after telling you that.

466
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,734
Do Hwa, what's going on?

467
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,174
You're so slow.

468
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:12,214
My feelings change
several times a day.

469
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,445
Isn't it scary?

470
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,669
What?

471
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,580
The fact that this is
a world of comics.

472
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,379
Depending on what
the writer intends,

473
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,280
this romance comic can suddenly
turn into a dreadful one.

474
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,909
The genre can change just like that.

475
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,924
Even the main characters can become
extras in a blink of an eye.

476
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:29,794
What is it? Is it because
you were kicked out of A3?

477
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,334
Don't be bothered.
It's such a cheesy...

478
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,759
Does it hurt a lot?

479
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,135
You're so slow.

480
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:47,445
When one thing changes,
other things change along with it.

481
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:49,210
That's why it's driving me crazy.

482
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,285
No one knows what will change.

483
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:55,155
But there is one constant.

484
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,210
- What is it?
- My feelings for Ju Da.

485
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,580
Gosh, that was awesome.
It was perfect!

486
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,620
I'm going to keep liking her
even if it's in the shadow!

487
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,635
That's right! Even the writer
can't change the way we feel!

488
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,774
- What's with him?
- I know, right?

489
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:15,244
What should I do?

490
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,544
- I got 8 questions wrong.
- 8?

491
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,475
What?

492
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:21,669
(English)

493
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:23,770
I got eight questions right.

494
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,210
- There's no difference.
- Don't be ridiculous.

495
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,355
What?

496
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:29,625
You aced it?

497
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:31,924
- What?
- He aced it?

498
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,250
- What?
- What is it?

499
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,090
How should I say this?
From the moment I saw you,

500
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,389
I knew we'd click.
We're both good-looking too.

501
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,405
Don't we have so many things
in common?

502
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,800
What? But you got zero percent
in English?

503
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,300
- What?
- No way.

504
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,845
- Are you from the Joseon period?
- He aced it.

505
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,370
I didn't know such a handsome guy...

506
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,800
- went to our school.
- "went to our school."

507
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,315
- Who is he?
- "Who is he?"

508
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:57,509
What was that?

509
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:59,984
Can... Can you hear me?

510
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,050
Sae Mi goes head over heels
for any good-looking guys.

511
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,779
I bet she has a weaker heart...

512
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:06,480
- than you.
- You're right.

513
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,319
Do you want your heart
to become weak as well?

514
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,389
- Who is he?
- Come here.

515
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:11,389
It's that guy...

516
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,764
whom Nam Ju suggested
as Do Hwa's replacement. Haru.

517
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,135
Stop it.

518
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:19,904
- Come here.
- Let me go.

519
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,045
It's marvelous.

520
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,985
During my past 20 years here,
I've never seen such a student.

521
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,255
I feel such deep sorrows
in the melody.

522
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,250
I didn't know such a handsome guy...

523
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,024
Yes, he's been a student here
for a long time.

524
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,865
Hey, what's your name?

525
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,185
Oh, my goodness.

526
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:40,914
That touch... That texture...

527
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,980
Have you learned this before?

528
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,009
No, I just let my hand lead me.

529
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:46,195
Unbelievable.

530
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,889
- I...
- Yes, he's a handsome guy.

531
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:52,195
wish there were more guys
like Haru at our school.

532
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,135
He's so handsome.

533
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:56,930
- What?
- Nam Ju will forever be...

534
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,389
my first love.

535
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:59,800
But for the other female students,

536
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,160
there should be more handsome guys.

537
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,144
Everyone, attention.

538
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,175
Look at Haru's painting.

539
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,139
How should I explain this?

540
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,269
- "Haru"?
- In these leaves,

541
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,540
there is a beat, a rhythm,

542
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,278
- and a soul.
- Beat, rhythm, and soul.

543
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,310
"Help me, please!"

544
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,550
"Please don't pick me!"

545
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,019
Doesn't it seem like the wild orchid
is screaming?

546
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,925
- Yes.
- Right?

547
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:24,524
- Yang Il!
- Yes?

548
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:26,834
Yes?

549
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,195
Are you enjoying yourself?

550
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:29,464
Am I enjoying the weed?

551
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,500
Beat, rhythm, and soul.

552
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,929
Beat, rhythm, and soul.
What are those?

553
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,844
(Haru)

554
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:41,499
Isn't it so fascinating?

555
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,110
Did the writer intend
to write that...

556
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,180
or was it our doing?

557
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,724
What do you think?

558
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,825
Are you hot?
You're sweating a bucket.

559
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,394
I'm sweating?

560
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,464
I'm not sweating.

561
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,865
I've always had this.

562
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,399
Is it part of your character?

563
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,399
It seems to change with the stage.

564
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,675
Really? How so?

565
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,068
I don't know in detail but...

566
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,144
- Haru!
- Haru!

567
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,414
- Haru!
- Haru!

568
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,240
- Have this.
- This too.

569
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,379
Aren't you thirsty?

570
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:21,009
Is he your new love?

571
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:22,149
Can you give me your number?

572
00:35:22,149 --> 00:35:23,550
I don't have one.

573
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,750
You don't have a phone?

574
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,579
No, Do Hwa gave one to me
several times.

575
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,149
But once the stage ended,
it disappeared with it.

576
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:30,290
- "Stage"?
- "Stage"?

577
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,220
Yes. Do Hwa gave it to me twice.

578
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,135
Why would you bother
to explain it to them?

579
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:36,660
- Go away.
- Why?

580
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,329
- Who gives you the right?
- Go.

581
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,204
Go away.

582
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:00,394
That was nice. What's the title?

583
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,524
It's what I feel...

584
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:04,325
for you.

585
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:08,660
What is it?

586
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,065
"Pleasure of Love".

587
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:13,235
I like you, Ju Da.

588
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:17,600
- Me too. I like you.
- "Me too. I like you."

589
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,815
- We're friends.
- "We're friends."

590
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:22,915
What?

591
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:43,364
Did you see us?

592
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,234
She said we were friends
for the seventh time today.

593
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,399
This time, it was
a romantic version...

594
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,114
like the ones you often see
in romance comics.

595
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,714
But Ju Da won't remember.

596
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,815
Still, I can't hide my feelings.

597
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,415
She's so beautiful.

598
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,195
Dan Oh.

599
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:09,124
(VIP Movie Ticket)

600
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,864
Hello?

601
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,075
Are you okay?

602
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:23,500
- I saw the story.
- What was it?

603
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,639
Why does Baek Kyung keep doing that?

604
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,744
"Baek Kyung"?

605
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:29,384
Did he bother you again?

606
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,179
I liked it better when he did.

607
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,984
But now, he's saying that
he likes me.

608
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,525
That's great.

609
00:37:37,149 --> 00:37:38,549
I know it was part
of your character,

610
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,494
but you liked him
for the past 10 years.

611
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,165
How about you accept his...

612
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,659
- No, it's way too late for that.
- Right.

613
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:51,090
- You said it too late.
- I did.

614
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,659
You made a mistake.

615
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:54,104
- Right?
- Yes.

616
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,185
Dried Squid Fairy!

617
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,840
You're either at the cafeteria
or the library.

618
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,624
You should go out
and enjoy the sunlight.

619
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,895
Why are you here? Didn't you
tell me not to bother you?

620
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,289
(Dan Oh, it's all right.
Go to the treatment room.)

621
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:17,925
(I think you need
to prepare yourself.)

622
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,364
My time is limited.

623
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,565
It's so boring.

624
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:27,759
I admit that I was rude to you.

625
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:30,004
This is my apology gift.

626
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,970
They're my dad's favorites.

627
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,854
I stole them.

628
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,055
Italy.

629
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,450
- What?
- They're from Italy.

630
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,155
They're top-notch.

631
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,519
Forget it if you don't like them.

632
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,490
You can't take them back.

633
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,124
Since you gave them to me,
I'll use them well.

634
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,629
Did you read how chaotic it got?

635
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:56,629
Yes.

636
00:38:56,629 --> 00:38:59,504
The stage changed, and people
remember Haru's name.

637
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,645
They remember him?

638
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,000
Yes. Didn't you know?

639
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,844
He even has a name tag now.

640
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,344
Are you sure about that?

641
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:14,155
Look, he's not here.

642
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,809
That can't be.

643
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,655
He was on stage too.

644
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:21,695
See? I'm right.

645
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:24,190
They say good things happen in bulk.

646
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,289
The story changed, Haru got a name,

647
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:27,935
and the others remember him.

648
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,860
I don't want to hear it.
You're trying to scare me again.

649
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,075
Anyway, I'll take it that
you've accepted my apology.

(VIP Movie Ticket)

651
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,320
Gosh, it's begun.

652
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,789
It's Baek Kyung's time.

Hey, Baek Kyung.

Do you have plans today?

656
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,004
Plans? No, I don't. Why?

657
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,515
Take it.

658
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,384
What's this?

659
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,685
It's a movie ticket.

660
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:23,555
I know what it says here.

661
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,594
I'm asking you out on a date.

662
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,754
What is this?

663
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:30,964
Do you not want to?

664
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,435
No. I'm just a bit worried.

665
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:35,964
About what?

666
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:40,104
Actually, I don't know
how you really feel.

667
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,429
You said you didn't like me
because I was sick.

668
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:43,500
And I think you only said...

669
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,515
what you said at the party
because I broke off the engagement.

670
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,945
Should we not go to the movies then?

671
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:50,070
No.

From now on, you will never...

673
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,685
want to break off the engagement.

a good day today.

with Chairman Eun.

Baek Kyung, I heard that
you did a fine job this time.

686
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:47,059
Why don't we speed things up
to become Chairman Eun's in-laws?

687
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:49,344
What do you mean?

00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:53,700
announced that he was going
to officially date...

Pardon?

00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,525
You should've done it sooner.

693

We're dining out tonight.

00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:10,795

- Plans?
- With Dan Oh.

- Give me my wallet.
- Okay.

00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,084
- Honey.
- Take it.

698
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,655
You should learn to be extravagant
if you're a man.

699
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:40,954
Give me some water.

700
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:43,124
Okay.

00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:51,964
Baek Kyung.

702
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Did you mean what you said...

703
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,474
at Nam Ju's birthday party?

704
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,474
Why? Do you feel insecure
now that Dad complimented me?

705
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,440
And that I might steal your spot?

706
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,645
It's not that.

707
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,210
It's just that I like Dan Oh.

708
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,714
Your mother won't like that.

709
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:10,724
What if Dad hears you?

710
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,464
I hope you meant what you said.

711
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,159
Dan Oh is really kind.

712
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,604
Who are you to butt in my business?
Darn it.

713
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,374
I just thought...

714
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,204
Dan Oh might be part of our family.

715
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,384
Family, my foot. Are you...

716
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:38,344
my family?

717
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,384
- Of course.
- Hey.

718
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,425
Stop talking nonsense. Got it?

719
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:50,464
Darn it.

720
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,899
(I came from a meeting
with Chairman Eun.)

721
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:04,974
(Why don't we speed things up
to become Chairman Eun's in-laws?)

722
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:09,240
This is your first date.
You should dress up.

723
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,315
Come here.

724
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:13,210
As for this white dress,
the back is see-through.

725
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,980
And the front is see-through
for this one.

726
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,325
And this one is pink.
What do you think?

727
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,795
These are the best three options.
Let me take photos. Let me see.

728
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:22,994
All right. Wait.

729
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,665
Okay. Look over here. 1, 2, 3.

730
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,190
Gosh, you look so pretty.

731
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,565
Another one. 1, 2, 3.

732
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:30,004
Smile.

733
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,405
Take a look.

734
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,970
I bet you'll look pretty.
You'll totally look pretty.

735
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,045
You look pretty, right?

736
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,870
Hey, what is this?

737
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,775
My gosh, you look
so pretty in those!

738
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,139
It's perfect. All right.

739
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,545
Let me put some here and here too.

740
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,214
Don't you look pretty? Dan Oh.

741
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:49,584
Listen up.

742
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,684
When you eat the popcorns,

743
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:54,255
make sure you brush his fingers
as much as you can.

744
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,779
- Brush his fingers?
- Yes.

745
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,349
When you drink Coke,
have only one straw.

746
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:58,694
- One straw?
- You got it, right?

747
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:00,795
An indirect kiss.

748
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:02,660
The moment he sees you,

749
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,730
he'll go crazy.
It'll be over for him.

750
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,604
Let me see you, Dan Oh.

751
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,144
(VIP Movie Ticket)

752
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,559
So this scene on the stage...

753
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,535
is about Baek Kyung running away
after seeing me like this, right?

754
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,644
Where are you meeting her?

755
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:50,015
At the theater.

756
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:52,785
Driver Kim, take us
to the theater first.

757
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,414
Once you see her,

758
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,285
set up a meeting
with Chairman Oh's son.

759
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,985
Okay.

760
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,795
The meeting has to be
at Chairman Oh's house.

761
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,420
- Okay.
- Chairman Eun hasn't been...

762
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,134
that cooperative lately.

763
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,364
He'll only do something
when we please that girl.

764
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,705
Is it certain that she likes you?

765
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,975
Yes.

766
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:19,874
Then, push forward...

767
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:21,475
to marry her.

768
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,910
- Marry her?
- Why not?

769
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,955
You officially started dating her.

770
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:31,055
I don't think I can marry her.

771
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,795
You said I could quit
pretending to like her...

772
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:34,995
once the business wrapped up.

773
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,065
- What?
- How far...

774
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,795
are you willing to exploit your son?

775
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,160
Am I even your son?

776
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,404
You, brat.

777
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,035
Get off.

778
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,674
Get off the car immediately!

779
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,624
Hello?

780
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,364
Hey.

781
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,565
I'm not going to the theater.

782
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:15,720
- What?
- I'm not in the mood for movies.

783
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,864
Don't wait for me.

784
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,055
Darn it!

785
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,364
How could he
consistently be so rude?

786
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:01,674
I found you.

787
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,864
By the way, why did you come here?

788
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:24,805
Baek Kyung was acting a bit weird.

789
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:27,174
He was? Why?

790
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,975
Just because.

791
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:38,785
Why does he have
such broad shoulders?

792
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,325
I think the screen got flipped
because we're in the shadow.

793
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,465
Right.

794
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,159
When you eat the popcorns,

795
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,374
make sure you brush his fingers
as much as you can.

796
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,325
When you drink Coke,
have only one straw.

797
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,555
You got it, right?

798
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,654
An indirect kiss.

799
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:29,604
Darn it. Why did you say
something like that, Sae Mi?

800
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:41,644
Why are you two together?

801
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,239
Why are you here?

802
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,384
I thought you were waiting for me,
but you watched the movie.

803
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:46,539
That doesn't matter.

804
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:47,680
You stood me up.

805
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,325
Of course, it matters.
I'm your fiance!

806
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,785
Don't talk to Dan Oh like that.

807
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:58,924
- What?
- She may be your fiancee,

808
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:00,565
but she's also my friend.

809
00:50:07,529 --> 00:50:09,005
Dan Oh, let's go.

810
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:41,930
Why are you two together?

811
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:42,970
Why are you here?

812
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,670
I thought you were waiting for me,
but you watched the movie.

813
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,700
That doesn't matter.
You stood me up.

814
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,245
Of course, it matters.
I'm your fiance!

815
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:52,069
That's odd.

816
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:54,755
He was supposed to stand me up
in that stage.

817
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,884
Why did he come back?

818
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,619
(Push forward to marry her.)

819
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:03,619
(I'm not going to the theater.)

820
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:04,694
(Crying)

821
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,035
I keep fading away.

822
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,134
She's different from you.

823
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,344
There are levels to extras.

824
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,404
You're the only one...

825
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:20,545
who'll disappear.

826
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,184
What is this?

827
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,825
You must be
highly interested in Dan Oh.

828
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,694
You do know that
she's my fiancee, don't you?

829
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,735
Man, you little jerk.

830
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,275
This is interesting.

831
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:04,285
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

832
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,720
- 2, 2, 3, 4...
- It's so cold.

833
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,119
I can't even go in.
Why was I brought here?

834
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,795
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

835
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,805
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

836
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:28,414
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

837
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:33,339
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

838
00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:35,114
I've been looking for you.

839
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:37,450
Why didn't you come
to the movies yesterday?

840
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,725
Something came up.

841
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:40,455
I see.

842
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:43,525
Why are you here?

843
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,194
Why? I came to see you swim.

844
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,934
Keep the towel on you.
You might catch a cold.

845
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,005
Okay.

846
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,575
Haru.

847
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:04,715
Let's go play over there.

848
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:23,104
I'm dressed like this
because I'm supposed to be weak,

849
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,965
but why are you in your uniform?

850
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,674
You're right.
I think the writer made a mistake.

851
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,404
The writer is quite sloppy at times.

852
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:32,805
Exactly.

853
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,309
Hey, what are you doing?

854
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:44,555
It looked like you were having fun.

855
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,825
Let's go.

856
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,035
I'm trying to hang out with
my fiancee. Stop bothering us.

857
00:54:02,529 --> 00:54:04,404
Why do you keep bothering us?

858
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:16,725
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

859
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:20,150
- Who is he?
- Baek Kyung!

860
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,380
- Baek Kyung.
- What happened?

861
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,349
He pushed him in.

862
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:25,495
Let's go.

863
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,035
What was that?

864
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,035
Gosh.

865
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,599
Guys, let's all do a race
for some ice cream.

866
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:40,114
One person from each class
can be the representative.

867
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,315
- Let's do it.
- Sure.

868
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,910
The swimmer for our class is...

869
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,579
You just saw me swim.

870
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:50,450
- Me.
- Nam Ju!

871
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,325
- Hi, Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

872
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,455
- It's Nam Ju.
- Really?

873
00:54:55,819 --> 00:54:56,995
That's amazing.

874
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,265
Then who wants to swim
from your class?

875
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,795
I will.

876
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:09,558
Guys, shouldn't
someone else volunteer?

877
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:10,869
Hey, anyone else?

878
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:12,904
No, I'm going to do it.

879
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,815
You can do it.

880
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,955
I won't let you win.

881
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,525
It sounds as if
you let me win before.

882
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,164
On your mark.

883
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,545
And 1, 2, 3.

884
00:55:56,609 --> 00:56:00,549
- Lee Do Hwa!
- Lee Do Hwa!

885
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:03,319
- Oh Nam Ju!
- Oh Nam Ju!

886
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,725
Oh Nam Ju!

887
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:16,705
Hey, it's Haru.

888
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,410
- Lee Do Hwa!
- Oh Nam Ju!

889
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,515
What? What's with his name tag?

890
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:31,384
Why is his name gone?

891
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,325
Why?

892
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,535
What's going on?

893
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,904
- Hey!
- What is it?

894
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,505
This way.

895
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:53,104
- Go over there!
- Go!

896
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,424
Hey! Go over there!

897
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,475
What's going on?

898
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,184
What about Haru? Where is he?

899
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:13,795
Mom.

900
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,535
Mom!

901
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:33,815
Mom!

902
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:38,285
Mom...

903
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:43,884
Mom...

904
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:09,174
Dan Oh.

905
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,485
Everyone who was by my side
ends up leaving me.

906
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,725
What do you think
will happen to you and me?

907
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:24,955
This is Haru's seat.

908
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:27,079
What are you talking about?

909
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:28,825
I've always been sitting here.

910
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:30,795
That can't be true.

911
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:32,250
This seat is for number 13...

912
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,259
Yes, it's for number 13,
Park Mo Beom.

913
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:35,465
It's me.

914
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,735
Anyway, are you okay?

915
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:39,630
Where's your uniform? Goodness.

916
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,305
Hey, you look... Hey.

917
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:45,305
(Seuli High School Student Photos)

918
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:54,315
(Number 13: Park Mo Beom)

919
01:00:56,109 --> 01:00:57,525
No way.

920
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:47,775
Where's the book?

921
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,205
Haru is gone.

922
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,004
It didn't get twisted.

923
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:57,210
Everything ended up
coming back to its place.

924
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,110
Where's the comic book?

925
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,285
It's not here.

926
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,024
At this rate,

927
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,194
the next one will be...

928
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,125
("Secret")

929
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,705
Are you...

930
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:03,375
looking for this?

931
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,694
("Secret")
