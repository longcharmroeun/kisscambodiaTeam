00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:08,570
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,899
- My gosh, it's Dan Oh!
- It's Dan Oh.

3
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:43,569
Hey, it's her.

4
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:46,504
There are a few things...

5
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,079
that always happens to a heroine.

6
00:00:58,314 --> 00:00:59,389
Dan Oh.

7
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:03,560
Why won't you pick up my call?

8
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:07,200
It's her destiny to have
hot guys obsess over her.

9
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,480
Something like that always ends up
coming to the heroine.

10
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,349
Dan Oh, can you kick it over?

11
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:47,269
You can never leave out
the lone rebel.

12
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:50,510
He's definitely the lead
among the male cast.

13
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,139
Long time no see, Dan Oh.

14
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:57,310
But I don't want to accept him
that easily.

15
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:01,920
Sorry.

16
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,290
What a tacky taste.

17
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:14,229
Hey, Nam Ju.

18
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:22,610
This is yours, isn't it?

19
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,379
- What was that?
- They fell in love.

20
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:32,774
Goodness, it's so predictable.

21
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:34,705
That's why it's more thrilling.

22
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:35,874
A fateful encounter,

23
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,020
a romantic relationship,

24
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,460
and Prince Charming
on a white horse.

25
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:44,330
- You're delusional.
- It's A3!

26
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:46,560
Nam Ju!

27
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,755
It's Baek Kyung!

28
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:50,755
Hey, Nam Ju!

29
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,469
My gosh, it's A3!

30
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,714
Aren't they so amazing?

31
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,355
The amazing 3, A3.

32
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:18,560
- They're so amazing.
- Baek Kyung!

33
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:33,605
- My gosh.
- Move, it's dangerous.

34
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:34,740
What is this?

35
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:47,684
- What was that?
- What's going on?

36
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,015
- Goodness.
- What happened?

37
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:50,485
- Hey, get up!
- What was that?

38
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,930
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,870
Take your hands off.

41
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,969
Oh, I'm sorry. Goodness.

42
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,035
You ruined the art supplies,

43
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,749
my uniform,

44
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,419
and my face.

45
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:16,590
Are you insane?

46
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,020
Nam Ju.

47
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,190
Enough.

48
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:27,799
Are you okay?

49
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:34,369
Do you think you're something
because you're A3?

50
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,669
All of you are the same too.

51
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,530
You're the first woman
who did that to me.

52
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,140
Dan Oh.

53
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,669
Hi, Nam Ju.

54
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:27,020
What was that?

55
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,984
"Scops Owl" by Kim So Wol.

56
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:31,854
My sister who lived...

57
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:34,254
I told you to stop messing with me!

58
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:36,325
Enough! Darn you.

59
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,625
You're so scary.

60
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,030
I was trying to study.

61
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:41,739
Gosh, I lost my timing to study.

62
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,435
Dan Oh, did you study?

63
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,534
Bad students...

64
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,464
always pretend like they're
studying hard right before the test.

65
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,005
Look at how clean your textbook is.

66
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,205
Did you buy that today?

67
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,109
Do you want me to hit you
with this book?

68
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,505
Today is the midterm?

69
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,604
Good students...

70
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,719
always pretend like they
didn't study right before the test.

71
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,815
Look at how worn out
your textbook is.

72
00:05:58,815 --> 00:05:59,914
You can't even recycle this.

73
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:01,659
You have to throw it out as
burnable, you know that, right?

74
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:03,659
Gosh, you're so tenacious.

75
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:06,484
Dan Oh, you said you didn't study,

76
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:07,960
but you studied so hard.

77
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,799
- This is my handwriting.
- You said...

78
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:15,125
All right, get ready for your test.

79
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,664
Wait, three more minutes!

80
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:17,909
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

81
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,164
- I'm not done reading yet.
- Wait, isn't this an English test?

82
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,940
I studied for the English test.
It's not English?

83
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,075
- It's Korean?
- It's literature.

84
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,150
I'm going to do so bad.

85
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,929
(Korean)

86
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:44,200
Wait, is this a dream?

87
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,510
(1st-semester midterm, 1st day)

88
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:01,875
All right, time is up.

89
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,549
Everyone, put down your pens.

90
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,945
Wait, we just got started.

91
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:08,020
(Name: Eun Dan Oh, Subject: English)

92
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,489
Please.

93
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:11,385
(1st-semester midterm, 4th day)

94
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:13,354
- I'm done.
- Thank you!

95
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,059
(English)

96
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,254
What's going on?

97
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,669
Thank you, sir.

98
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,024
It's finally over. Let's hang out.

99
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,565
- How about some pasta?
- Okay!

100
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,435
The midterm just began.

101
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:25,510
What?

102
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:28,104
Are you two joking?

103
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:29,609
Did you study that hard?

104
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,710
You're completely gone.

105
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:35,575
Yes! I got over 200 likes!

106
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,875
I can't believe Ju Da
fell right into...

107
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,945
Nam Ju's arms...

108
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:40,789
as if she planned this.

109
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:43,789
How dare she do that to Nam Ju?

110
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,760
I won't let her slide.

111
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,859
Look at Sae Mi's face.
It's a state of art.

112
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,154
Su Chul, shut your mouth.

113
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,140
"Su Chul, shut your mouth."

114
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,495
- Do you really want to die?
- "Do you really want to die?"

115
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:56,640
- Darn you!
- Goodness.

116
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,270
Come here!

117
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:00,909
I remember up until this moment.

118
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:04,349
Ju Da fell over Nam Ju.

119
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:07,820
Then I don't remember.

120
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,219
What is this?

121
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:15,719
I must be crazy.

122
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:18,615
Don't worry.
People don't go crazy that easily.

123
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:21,099
No, my memories really disappeared.

124
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,555
Is it a side effect
of my heart surgery?

125
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:25,130
Or is it because of my new drug?

126
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,224
Doctor Lee, am I going to die?

127
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,039
It smells great.

128
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:31,309
Please thank your father for me.

129
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:32,594
Doctor Lee.

130
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,265
I heard
you cut back on your sleep...

131
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,739
to study very hard.

132
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:37,775
- I did?
- The weather is getting hotter,

133
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:38,874
and a girl
with a weak heart like you...

134
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:40,045
strained yourself.

135
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,645
It's not the first day
I've been sick.

136
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,714
How many times do I need
to tell you that it's not that?

137
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:47,045
I teleported and heard
strange noises.

138
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:48,419
You're completely healthy.

139
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,730
A good night's sleep will fix
the ringing in your ears.

140
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,799
As for the teleporting...

141
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,870
Reading fewer comics
will alleviate that.

142
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,395
I'm not joking right now!

143
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:05,993
It's a temporary symptom
that all teenagers can go through.

144
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,939
It's not that big of a deal,
so don't worry about it.

145
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:10,275
Right. It's not.

146
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,104
It's actually a huge deal.

147
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:13,945
Calm down.

148
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,575
I bet I'm the only teenager
in this country...

149
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,120
who's suffering from such symptoms.

150
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,415
I thought the heart disease
was enough.

151
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:22,955
Gosh, I'm living
such a dynamic life.

152
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,929
Why is this happening to me?

153
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,699
Is Baek Kyung bothering you
these days as well?

154
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,299
One-sided love
can also cause stress.

155
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,900
I'm so frustrated.
Why are you bringing him up?

156
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,370
Kids these days are
so passionate about falling in love.

157
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,579
I swear. There's something wrong
up here.

158
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:47,104
"New facts. You fail to remember
objects and people's names."

159
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:49,750
"You also cannot remember
what happened in the past."

160
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,213
That's not me.

161
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:53,214
(Alzheimer's disease)

162
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:56,114
"You have trouble speaking
and lack judgment skills."

163
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:58,155
"You cannot function
in your everyday life."

164
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:00,500
"When it gets worse,
you hallucinate."

165
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:03,829
"Hallucinate"?

166
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,069
(1st-semester midterm, 1st day)

167
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:10,094
But then again,
it only lasted for a short time.

168
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:11,669
Other than that, I'm totally fine.

169
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,750
So exactly what do I have?

170
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,750
Did you stop by the hospital?

171
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,589
Did you not?

172
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:32,929
Didn't I tell you...

173
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,025
to make sure you stay...

174
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,093
with Dan Oh every time
she goes to the hospital?

175
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,094
I didn't know.

176
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:40,199
Don't you know how many businesses
Chairman Eun has?

177
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,069
How could you let go
of such an opportunity?

178
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:44,294
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:45,409
Get out.

180
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:47,709
Go.

181
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,260
Darn it.

182
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:11,799
Baek Kyung.

183
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:14,400
Good morning.

184
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:17,535
I heard you went to the hospital.

185
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,439
What? How did you know?

186
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,539
My father told me that
your father was worried.

187
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm fine. It was nothing.
I was just stressed out.

188
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:28,974
Are you so desperate
for my attention...

189
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,919
that you'd involve my own family
in this?

190
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:33,344
- What?
- This was how you proceeded...

191
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,445
with our engagement.

192
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,289
At times, I just...

193
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,230
Forget it.

194
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:45,500
I was really sick.

195
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,025
I can't remember things these days,

196
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,364
and I hear noises.

197
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:53,380
Dan Oh. Just blame
your heart disease as always.

198
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,079
Don't overdo it.

199
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,374
That little...

200
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:04,145
I went to the hospital
because I was really sick, okay?

201
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:06,844
I have trouble with my memory,
and I hear things.

202
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,084
That little punk!

203
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,990
- Isn't that Dan Oh?
- You're right.

204
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,900
- Why does she have a fist?
- I bet she fights well.

205
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:24,195
Dan Oh! You're here early.

206
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,780
Sae Mi, don't I look strange
these days?

207
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:29,705
You look the same.

208
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,705
I can't remember things,
and I hallucinate.

209
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:33,679
Right. My personality has changed
as well.

210
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,974
Did something happen with Baek Kyung?

211
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,514
That too.

212
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,289
I saw him back there,
and I was so irritated.

213
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,315
Don't be ridiculous.

214
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:45,260
Everyone at this school knows
that you like him.

215
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:54,925
Dan Oh! Dan Oh!

216
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,370
Let's go to the snack bar.

217
00:12:56,935 --> 00:13:00,104
- Weren't you just talking to me?
- What?

218
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,380
We were sitting here, talking
about how I was strange.

219
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:05,110
You look the same.

220
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:08,104
What is it?
Did something happen with Baek Kyung?

221
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,150
No, that's not the issue right now.

222
00:13:11,815 --> 00:13:14,084
- My gosh!
- My gosh.

223
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,589
What's wrong?

224
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:19,655
What are these?

225
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:21,224
What do you think?

226
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:24,199
They're our love fridges
that are full of love.

227
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:26,470
Yours is for Baek Kyung,
and mine is for Nam Ju.

228
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,565
Why exactly am I making this?

229
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:34,280
What's wrong?
Did something happen with Baek Kyung?

230
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,374
Never mind. That's ridiculous.

231
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:40,480
Everyone at this school knows
that you like him.

232
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,705
Don't be ridiculous.

233
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:45,720
Everyone at this school knows
that you like him.

234
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,890
Something is wrong with me.

235
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:52,415
Did you know that you need
to support the bowl...

236
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,659
with your ring finger
when eating noodles?

237
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:54,929
It's your middle finger.

238
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:57,799
No one watches your channel,
so why do you do it?

239
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:00,169
That's how it all begins. And then,
you get 200,000 likes.

240
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,263
I can't believe it.

241
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:03,665
At times, I leap two hours in time.

242
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,039
Other times, it's several days.

243
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:10,549
Are you all right?

244
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,250
I have no idea when and where...

245
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:19,150
I'll open my eyes.

246
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:28,429
My memory...

247
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:30,894
is fading.

248
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:33,169
See? I heard it again.

249
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,789
Breathing? Normal.

250
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,415
Chest pains? None.

251
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:58,429
Heart rate? Normal.

252
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:01,730
Memory?

253
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,000
Abnormal.

254
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:35,220
"Forgetfulness"?
No, it's not this one.

255
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:36,929
"Amnesia"?

256
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,059
It does sound similar.

257
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:43,270
"Total amnesia...
Partial amnesia..."

258
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:45,370
Loss of memory in bits?

259
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,640
I don't know.

260
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,629
("Secret")

261
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,680
You followed me all the way here?

262
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,180
That's enough.

263
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:56,539
You followed me all the way here?

264
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:03,809
That's enough.

265
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:16,484
That's so disturbing.

266
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,385
How did you endure it for 10 years?

267
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,430
That's not some innocent
one-sided love.

268
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:24,030
That's stalking right there.
Gosh, I got the goosebumps.

269
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,994
I'm so sick and tired of her.

270
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,569
I'm sure you feel worse.

271
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:36,910
Gosh. Hey.

272
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:38,849
Hey.

273
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:40,579
Hey!

274
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,990
Where are you going?

275
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:53,730
Do you know him?

276
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:54,885
No.

277
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,200
When will you give me a ride
on your motorcycle?

278
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:11,804
Go ahead. Erase my memory.

279
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,180
Go ahead. Do it again.

280
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:19,020
Why is it the same?

281
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,520
Is anyone out there?

282
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:26,629
Please help.

283
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:29,000
Please help.

284
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:31,670
Hey.

285
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,970
Is anyone there?

286
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:39,539
Hey.

287
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,490
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

288
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:54,345
Gosh. What's this?

289
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:55,490
Dan Oh.

290
00:19:57,514 --> 00:19:59,160
Did they bully you again?

291
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,324
No.

292
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:02,899
You just transferred to our school.

293
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,655
They should be nice to you.

294
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:07,770
Look who's talking. You should
be looking out for yourself.

295
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:09,770
I'm really okay.

296
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,240
Thank you for getting me out.

297
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,514
Eun Dan Oh,
you're losing your memories.

298
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:29,460
You should be worried
about yourself.

299
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:33,899
What is this now?

300
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,734
My memories are going away.
I'm hallucinating.

301
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,569
I think my personality
is changing too.

302
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:49,609
On top of that, I was so nosy
around Ju Da.

303
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:52,710
Is it possible that
I have a serious illness?

304
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,549
Oh, no.

305
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:59,445
- She's so loud. I can't sleep here.
- Why did I say,

306
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,085
"Are you all right? Are you hurt?"

307
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,115
Why did I say that to her?

308
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:04,115
And where did I get the wet wipes?

309
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:05,355
I didn't buy those wet wipes.

310
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:06,530
Hey, Eun Dan Oh.

311
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:09,460
You keep getting on my nerves.

312
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,770
Pretend that I'm not here.
Mind your own business.

313
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,500
Where on earth
did I get the wet wipes?

314
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,670
Something is definitely going on.

315
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,710
Is this how you treat Baek Kyung too?

316
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,879
Him again.

317
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,450
That's not
what's important right now.

318
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:29,705
What?

319
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,250
Leave. Leave right now.

320
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,685
- Leave.
- Why? I was here first.

321
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,514
- I was about to get some sleep.
- Okay, okay.

322
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:37,829
- Hey, I need to get more sleep.
- Just go.

323
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:48,240
What am I going to do?

324
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,020
How rude.

325
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,859
She's getting on my nerves
every single time. I don't like it.

326
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,700
Who?

327
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:16,230
Don't touch it. It's mine.

328
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:17,430
That's yours?

329
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:19,530
- Yes.
- I see.

330
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:22,899
I didn't know
your taste has gotten cute.

331
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:26,240
Hey, Baek Kyung.

332
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:28,435
What do you think about her?

333
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:29,510
Who?

334
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,049
I told you. She's not my type.

335
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:35,220
Is that so? I'm glad.

336
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:38,289
- You're glad?
- She's been on my mind lately.

337
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:50,530
I'm certain
this isn't simple amnesia.

338
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,195
Just blame
your heart disease as always.

339
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:55,794
I was really sick.

340
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:57,195
I went to the hospital
because I was really sick, okay?

341
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,539
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

342
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,375
I thought I was
only hearing strange noises.

343
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,119
My thoughts and behaviors
don't match.

344
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:10,619
My gosh, am I
in "Jekyll and Hyde" or what?

345
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:14,760
You followed me all the way here?

346
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:17,359
That's enough.

347
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,099
You followed me all the way here?

348
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:27,799
That's enough.

349
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,039
That's right.

350
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:32,539
Then, what was
that hallucination about?

351
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,905
No, no. If I was hallucinating,

352
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:36,639
it's not supposed
to happen in real life.

353
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,450
Goodness.

354
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,980
Am I seeing the future or what?

355
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,549
No way.

356
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:47,089
Have I really gone mad?

357
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,484
Why is she doing that
in the cafeteria?

358
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:54,824
- What is it?
- You startled me.

359
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,585
- Sae Mi. Su Chul.
- Dan Oh.

360
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,799
My goodness!

361
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,069
My heartbeat is in the normal range.
That's good.

362
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,695
Come on. Am I that pretty
to give you a heart attack?

363
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,695
I think I saw her
during the East Asian History class.

364
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,139
She was somewhere in China.

365
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,205
Are you saying
that I look like a queen?

366
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:10,274
Like Yang Guifei?

367
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,205
- Come on. I'm not that pretty.
- No.

368
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:13,819
- Jiangshi.
- Yes, that's the one.

369
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:16,544
You're lucky that Dried Squid Fairy
is here today.

370
00:24:16,544 --> 00:24:17,675
"Dried Squid Fairy"?

371
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,074
He's only here
when dried squid is served.

372
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,244
So we call him Dried Squid Fairy.

373
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:22,585
Oh Nam Ju, Lee Do Hwa,

374
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,214
Baek Kyung, and Dried Squid Fairy
are called...

375
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,490
A4 of Seuli High School.

376
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,915
Isn't it A5?

377
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,760
"A5"? Is there one more?

378
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:30,569
You must count me in.

379
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:33,455
- Look.
- You startled me.

380
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,794
- He's here.
- He's here!

381
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:37,740
- Hey, he's here.
- Awesome.

382
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:39,839
Gosh, it's Dried Squid Fairy.

383
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,304
- I was here first.
- My gosh.

384
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:44,849
I was here first.

385
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:47,645
- His smile is out of this world.
- He's so hot!

386
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:50,044
Looking at his face is fun enough.

387
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:52,789
- Hey, I'm about to pass out.
- He's so handsome.

388
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:56,389
Thank you.

389
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,099
You seem out of energy.

390
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:09,940
All right. Eat a lot and cheer up.

391
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,534
Even if you give me a lot,

392
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:14,079
I won't be able to eat
if I skip my memory.

393
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:25,889
I just want to get less curry on me.

394
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:29,559
Thank you.

395
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:34,859
I'm so full.

396
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,899
Gosh, I lost my appetite.

397
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:43,809
What are you talking about?
You finished everything.

398
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:47,879
Hey, what would you do
if you can see the future?

399
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:50,750
I will make a hit with my channel
claiming myself as a prophet.

400
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:52,780
I'll get one million subscribers!

401
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,480
He's such an attention seeker.

402
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:55,744
I'll win the lottery.

403
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,004
And I'll buy Nam Ju an expensive...

404
00:25:57,004 --> 00:25:59,244
and luxurious bag
that he will rock wearing.

405
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:01,359
And I'll buy him shoes,
studded with 100 diamonds.

406
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,829
There are so many things
I want to buy him.

407
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:06,460
What about you?

408
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:11,230
I'm going to prevent impending
misfortunes from happening.

409
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:12,670
- "Misfortunes"?
- What?

410
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,799
If I can really see the future...

411
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:22,139
Look at you.
You're eating a lot, Ju Da.

412
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,205
It's a free meal for you.
You ought to eat as much as you can.

413
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:27,875
You had to get sponsored
by Nam Ju's foundation...

414
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,504
to have this precious meal.

415
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,675
How will you pay
to get Nam Ju's uniform cleaned?

416
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,714
You'll have to get
about 10 part-time jobs.

417
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:35,690
- Part-time jobs?
- What are you doing over there?

418
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:37,514
Don't bother Ju Da.

419
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,415
Go to your seats now.

420
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:40,500
Okay.

421
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,224
- Hello.
- Hello.

422
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:46,670
Hi, sir.

423
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,264
Something about the air here...

424
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,309
tells me there will be a huge story.

425
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:09,214
- What are you doing?
- I told you.

426
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:10,730
I'll try to prevent
the misfortune from happening.

427
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,030
Ju Da, is it good?

428
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,734
I just have to make sure
Ju Da doesn't trip.

429
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,450
I asked you a question.
You should answer me.

430
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:44,430
- Where are you going?
- Hey.

431
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,809
- My goodness.
- No way.

432
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:01,180
Keep going!

433
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:11,544
- Hey!
- Look at them.

434
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:13,415
Look at them on the floor.

435
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:14,415
Hey, film this.

436
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:16,319
- I got this.
- Keep filming.

437
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:18,389
You got the food all over you.

438
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:24,054
Darn it. Forget
about preventing the misfortune.

439
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:26,625
- That was classic.
- It stinks. What's this smell?

440
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,794
- Gosh, it smells.
- Good going for you.

441
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,095
Poor Ju Da.

442
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:31,365
How could she come to school
after this?

443
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:35,264
Ju Da got her scholarships
with curry.

444
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:36,435
Film this.

445
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:37,974
Gosh, it smells.

446
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,304
Which jerk took my phone?

447
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:41,074
- Who is it?
- It's Nam Ju.

448
00:28:41,074 --> 00:28:42,149
Nam Ju?

449
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:48,160
- Hey.
- What?

450
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:50,190
Are you all insane?

451
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:01,165
Okay, let's learn about the life
of Kreisler, a renowned violinist...

452
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:04,365
and a songwriter who left many
great songs in the 20th century.

453
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:07,039
I really love
the songs that he wrote too.

454
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,039
They're all classics.

455
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,010
Here's a quiz.

456
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:14,049
Among the songs
which Kreisler wrote,

457
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:17,945
there's a song named "Love's Sorrow"
and "Love's" something else.

458
00:29:17,945 --> 00:29:19,490
What do you think it is?

459
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:22,014
- I know!
- Yes, what is it?

460
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,389
"Love's Fool".

461
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:26,185
- I know!
- Okay, Il Jin!

462
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:28,359
"Love's Stick".

463
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:30,730
- Are you the stick?
- Wait.

464
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:34,539
Am I losing my memories
because I can see into the future?

465
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,464
I mean, is this that hard?

466
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:38,695
(Memory loss, hallucination,
foreknowledge)

467
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,680
Do Hwa guessed it right away
in the next classroom.

468
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:43,910
I can't believe this.
I can see the future?

469
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:47,420
Yes, Dan Oh?

470
00:29:48,345 --> 00:29:49,450
Pardon?

471
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,945
- May I go to the nurse's office?
- Come on.

472
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:58,430
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

473
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:00,415
- I thought she would answer.
- What is it?

474
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:04,329
I'll buy you something delicious
from the snack bar if you guess it.

475
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,200
Okay, wait.

476
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:10,000
How can I see into the future?

477
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:12,510
Show me, show me, show me!

478
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,639
This isn't it.

479
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,549
If I focus my mind...

480
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,180
Okay, that's not it either.

481
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:25,149
Show me the future!

482
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,314
What is it?

483
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,754
How do I see into the future?

484
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:33,455
- "Love's Happiness"?
- "Love's Happiness"?

485
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:34,559
Baek Kyung.

486
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:37,329
Can you go outside and
take Dan Oh to the nurse's office?

487
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,470
- What?
- What is she doing?

488
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:45,210
- Why should I?
- I thought you two were engaged.

489
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:50,609
- Mr. Baek!
- Mr. Baek!

490
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:52,605
You're all too noisy.

491
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:54,680
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

492
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:02,190
Focus.

493
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,129
Dan Oh.

494
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:06,789
What are you doing?

495
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:09,085
Don't bother me and go on your way.

496
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:11,369
I think you're stopping me
from seeing something.

497
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:12,824
Go.

498
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:15,639
Why do you always say
the same thing?

499
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:20,139
- What?
- This is a very tiring way...

500
00:31:20,435 --> 00:31:22,339
of having a crush on someone.

501
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:23,680
A crush?

502
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:26,379
Wait, I have a crush on you?

503
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,845
Yes, well, you're right.

504
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,314
It's not wrong,
but you know, it's a little...

505
00:31:32,314 --> 00:31:33,420
Forget it.

506
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:40,129
Hey, look. You're always rude to me.

507
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,730
Dan Oh.

508
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,695
- Enough is enough.
- What is?

509
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:49,700
I don't like a woman who's ill.

510
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:51,869
It's annoying.

511
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:54,440
Do you want me to tell you again?

512
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:57,804
You're wasting your time
having a crush on me,

513
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,549
in the past, right now,
and in the future.

514
00:32:00,675 --> 00:32:02,780
I'll never like someone like you.

515
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:14,155
Gosh, why didn't I say
anything like an idiot?

516
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:15,784
Why do I suddenly act nice...

517
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:19,000
and get angry whenever I see Baek Kyung,
a guy I liked for my entire life?

518
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:23,339
What kind of disease is this?

519
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:25,809
What's with her again?

520
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:29,180
This is embarrassing.

521
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:46,059
(Episode 2 will air shortly.)

522
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,296
(Episode 2)

523
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:17,981
Hey, you.

524
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:19,210
Come here. Stop right there.

525
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,556
Stop right there!

526
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,745
Excuse me.

527
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:45,415
What are you doing over there?

528
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,616
Me?

529
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:50,826
There's no one else around.

530
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,356
You know me, don't you?

531
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,350
I'm not sure. Where have we met?

532
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,020
We both saw that weird thing
on the bridge.

533
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,835
The black hole.

534
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,595
- Did we?
- You were looking at it.

535
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,391
It's probably more than
meets the eye.

536
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:07,436
Just answer my question.

537
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,805
Nothing good will come
from knowing the answer.

538
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,376
("Secret")

539
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,615
("Secret")

540
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,656
("Secret")

541
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,751
If you have time to spare,

542
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,195
can you give me a hand?

543
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,595
So you won't give me an answer?

544
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:37,166
She's more quick-witted
than I thought.

545
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,815
I thought it was
somewhere around here.

546
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,675
Everything is definitely connected.

547
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,775
This space, that book,

548
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:22,745
and Dried Squid Fairy.

549
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,070
(I don't like a woman who's ill.)

550
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,630
(It's annoying.
Do you want me to tell you again?)

551
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,040
(You're wasting your time
having a crush on me.)

552
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,816
(I'll never like someone like you.)

553
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,411
I don't like a woman who's ill.

554
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:00,715
It's annoying.

555
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,155
Do you want me to tell you again?

556
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,080
You're wasting your time
having a crush on me,

557
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,880
in the past, right now,
and in the future.

558
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,826
I'll never like someone like you.

559
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,435
Wait, is this...

560
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,305
me?

561
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:22,675
(Are you all right?)

562
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,200
(Did they bully you again?)

563
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,775
(No.)

564
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,501
(You just transferred to our school.
They should be nice to you.)

565
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,386
(I'm really okay.
Thank you for getting me out.)

566
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,856
Goodness, you saw this.

567
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:40,296
You pervert.

568
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,425
That's too harsh.

569
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,566
What's in that comic book is...

570
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,566
me, isn't it?

571
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,666
I'm sorry,

572
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,606
but you're wrong.

573
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,775
Wait, can you see the future too?

574
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:01,471
I can see into the future...

575
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,841
ever since I touched that.

576
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:05,011
And that hole.
You and I were the only ones...

577
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:06,610
who saw that hole.

578
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,841
Calm down.

579
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:10,685
Why don't you hear me out first?

580
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,625
We aren't humans.

581
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,296
What you're feeling is the gap
between scenes.

582
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,060
You didn't fall asleep,

583
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,661
but you're living in the next day.

584
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,131
You don't remember coming to school,

585
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:27,675
but you're at school.

586
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:29,805
A few days pass by...

587
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,875
in a blink of an eye.

588
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:34,141
You wouldn't usually feel it,

589
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:36,610
but once you gain consciousness,
you become aware of that gap.

590
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,685
Then...

591
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:40,385
you end up thinking
you lost your memories.

592
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,656
This isn't amnesia?

593
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:47,156
This is...

594
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:49,796
"This is"?

595
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:52,526
The world of comics.

596
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,536
What a lunatic.

597
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,661
I'm getting bashed on
quite often today.

598
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:03,075
I think I'll live longer
than the writer had intended.

599
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,106
I'm such a fool
for actually hearing him out.

600
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,385
Dan Oh.

601
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,055
You're a character
in this comic book.

602
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,781
So you're saying...

603
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:22,180
that this world I'm living in
is the world of comics,

604
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,350
and I'm a character.

605
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,750
Despite being a character,
I've become aware of myself.

606
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,490
So every time the scene changes,
my memory gets cut off.

607
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,990
Exactly.

608
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,135
Thank you for your insane babbling.

609
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,100
I expected this reaction.
I doubted you'd believe me.

610
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,201
We're strangers,

611
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:40,515
so we lack trust in each other.

612
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:43,586
Get lost.

613
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:45,815
Okay.

614
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:50,786
Gosh, she intimidated me just now.

615
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,125
Dan Oh, just hear me out!

616
00:38:58,591 --> 00:39:00,836
How is this the world of comics?

617
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:02,419
- Dan Oh.
- My gosh.

618
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,630
- Hear me out.
- Why are you following me?

619
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,661
- I'm not a bad person.
- Don't come near me.

620
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,360
- Dan Oh, hold on.
- Stay away.

621
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,330
Dan Oh? Dan Oh.

622
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,445
Eun Dan Oh.

623
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,315
Just hear me out.

624
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,086
Let's take a break!

625
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,081
Just leave, already!

626
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:24,911
- I'm about to get a shock.
- I just need a minute.

627
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:25,986
Dan Oh.

628
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,656
Dan Oh.

629
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,430
Would you believe me
if I pushed you?

630
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,505
Why are you doing this to me?

631
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,046
Will your limbs break?

632
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,276
Don't worry.

633
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:50,146
By the next scene,
you'll be good as new.

634
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,846
I'm going to report you.

635
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:54,656
This is better.

636
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,026
No!

637
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,726
Have you gone mad?

638
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,505
Aren't you going to report me?
Do it.

639
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,675
Wait...

640
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,540
Come here! Gosh, you little...

641
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,815
Sae Mi!

642
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,841
Hey, what are you doing up there?

643
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:29,040
Dried Squid threatened to push me
over this handrail.

644
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,911
- And my phone was here.
- What is she saying?

645
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,456
Hey, are you pulling
a one-man show or something?

646
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:39,726
What?

647
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,565
Guys, did you not see Dried Squid?

648
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,500
- What?
- That psychopath tried to kill me.

649
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,201
- What do you mean?
- He cornered...

650
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:49,831
and threatened me.

651
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,071
And my phone was floating
in the air.

652
00:40:52,071 --> 00:40:53,141
That's not important.

653
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,740
You were with us the entire time.

654
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,300
Your phone is in your hand.

655
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,385
What?

656
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,480
- This is...
- Rock-paper-scissors!

657
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,125
the world of comics.

658
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,995
No way.

659
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:12,490
You've been reading
way too many comics.

660
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,036
That's why you're so gullible
into thinking that it may be true.

661
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,831
No, then how are you
seeing the future?

662
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:20,706
What? What would I do
if I saw the future?

663
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:22,635
I'd...

664
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:26,076
I will make a hit with my channel
claiming myself as a prophet.

665
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:28,145
I'll get one million subscribers!

666
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,285
I will make a hit with my channel
claiming myself as a prophet.

667
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,316
I'll get one million subscribers!

668
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:35,155
He's such an attention seeker.

669
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:37,981
I'll win the lottery.
And I'll buy Nam Ju an expensive...

670
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:39,920
and luxurious bag
that he will rock wearing.

671
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,080
I'll win the lottery.
And I'll buy Nam Ju an expensive...

672
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,251
and luxurious bag
that he will rock wearing.

673
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,251
And I'll buy him shoes...

674
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:47,466
And I'll buy him shoes,
studded with 100 diamonds.

675
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:50,261
If what Dried Squid said is true,

676
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:52,960
I can remember everything
since I'm aware of it.

677
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,230
You're right. I'm going
to buy him a brand new wallet.

678
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:57,731
- I'll buy him a new watch.
- Hey, I'll buy him a bag.

679
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:00,241
Those who aren't aware
of themselves cannot remember?

680
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:01,515
No way!

681
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,785
He's so handsome!

682
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,655
- Can I shake your hand?
- Me too!

683
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,950
- How did you do it?
- Do what?

684
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,025
You made my phone float.

685
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:15,556
I told you.
This is the world of comics.

686
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,190
I can't help but think that
you drew all that...

687
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,920
after watching me.

688
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,106
Do you know how terrible it feels
to be suspected as a pervert?

689
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:27,330
What? Where's that pervert?

690
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,836
- It's Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

691
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:30,930
Hey, it's Nam Ju.

692
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,930
Push me at the right moment.

693
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,070
You remember how Ju Da fell, right?
Push me just like how we practiced.

694
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,285
Okay? Like this.

695
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:40,686
He's so handsome!

696
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:44,651
I'll give you a chance.

697
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:45,651
What does he mean?

698
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:47,525
A chance to thank me.

699
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,336
Oh, that? Thanks... Thanks...

700
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,391
What? Why can't I talk?

701
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:59,106
Thanks. I mean it. Thanks!

702
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,161
- What?
- Nam Ju!

703
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,531
I can't hear you.

704
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:05,131
Nam Ju, I'm truly thankful.

705
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:08,241
- I'm thankful for your existence.
- My gosh!

706
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,615
You know how I feel, right?

707
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,316
Right? Nam Ju, you do know, right?

708
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,115
He probably does.

709
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:17,550
Dan Oh, I won't give up.

710
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,726
Push me towards him again
at the right time, got it?

711
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:29,861
I'll give you a chance.

712
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:31,361
A chance to thank me.

713
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:32,765
This just happened.

714
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:36,076
You weren't there,
so how did you know?

715
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,245
Writers are all-knowing.

716
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,045
They're the creators of such worlds.

717
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,511
- Let me see.
- No!

718
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:47,040
No! Stop!

719
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,115
You're going to rip it! No!

720
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:02,765
Just accept it, already.

721
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,875
You're Eun Dan Oh,
a character in the comic book.

722
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,415
(I don't like a woman who's ill.)

723
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,846
This is insane.
It's making my heart flutter.

724
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,371
You're right.

725
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:19,946
The more obvious it is,
the crazier I'm getting.

726
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:23,086
He's so handsome.
I want to live in here.

727
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,226
- Sae Mi.
- Yes?

728
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,326
- It's here.
- What?

729
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:30,926
The world you're in right now
is the world of comics.

730
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:33,696
What? This is the world of comics?

731
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,865
Hey, it's a secret.

732
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,391
Eun Dan Oh has spoken.

733
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:40,135
This is the world of comics!

734
00:44:43,101 --> 00:44:45,501
Dan Oh, your imagination
is top-notch!

735
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:46,631
- Top-notch!
- Top-notch!

736
00:44:46,631 --> 00:44:48,241
Did you read comic books all day
at the hospital?

737
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,511
Imagination. That's just great.

738
00:44:50,511 --> 00:44:53,911
Someone said that the best talent
a person had...

739
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:55,540
was their imagination.

740
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,751
"Imagination".

741
00:44:56,751 --> 00:44:58,826
What? What did you say?
"Image"?

742
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,891
Mo Beom, you may get good grades,
but your pronunciation is terrible.

743
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:04,950
Follow me.

744
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,950
- "I..."
- "I..."

745
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,960
- "Ma..."
- "Ma..."

746
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,991
- "Ge".
- "Ge".

747
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:13,736
- "Image".
- "Image".

748
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,375
(Independent Study)

749
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,330
- Sae Mi.
- Yes?

750
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,140
Do you remember what I just said?

751
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:22,141
What did you say?

752
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,515
That this was the world of comics.

753
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,086
What? This is the world of comics?

754
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,741
Eun Dan Oh has spoken.

755
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:31,525
This is the world of comics!

756
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:34,950
Dan Oh, your imagination
is top-notch!

757
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,021
- Top-notch!
- Top-notch!

758
00:45:36,021 --> 00:45:37,521
Did you read comic books all day
at the hospital?

759
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:39,696
Imagination. That's just great.

760
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,790
Someone said that the best talent
a person had...

761
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,405
was their imagination.

762
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:45,861
"Imagination".

763
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,806
What? What did you say? "Image"?

764
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,309
So none of them can hear this sound?

765
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,881
Sound? What sound?

766
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:03,450
The sound of a page turning.

767
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,751
This is the world of comics,
you see.

768
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:07,096
What? This is the world of comics?

769
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:08,580
Eun Dan Oh has spoken.

770
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,525
This is the world of comics!

771
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,035
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

772
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:28,515
No. No.

773
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:35,385
You're a character
in this comic book.

774
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:38,356
Just accept it, already.

775
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,949
You're Eun Dan Oh,
a character in the comic book.

776
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,056
Oh, no.

777
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,966
It must be true.

778
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,375
They all don't make sense.

779
00:46:56,661 --> 00:47:00,070
They don't, but if I were to believe
that I'm in a comic book...

780
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,601
I'm from a wealthy family.
I'm pretty, studious,

781
00:47:02,601 --> 00:47:04,611
and I'm ill.
I have heart disease, at that.

782
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:05,611
There's more.

783
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:07,440
The guy I've been in love
with for the past 10 years...

784
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,755
is now my fiance.

785
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,086
They all fit into the criteria
of a female lead.

786
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:22,596
I'm a character in a comic book?

787
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:40,486
Dan Oh, what are you doing here?

788
00:47:41,911 --> 00:47:43,986
- Dad.
- Are you not feeling well?

789
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,255
Dan Oh.

790
00:47:46,651 --> 00:47:47,795
Dad.

791
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,151
I'm Eun Dan Oh, right?

792
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:51,751
Of course, you're Dan Oh.

793
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,936
What is it?
Did you have a nightmare?

794
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,995
Dad.

795
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,806
What would you do
if the world we're living in is...

796
00:47:58,891 --> 00:48:00,131
the world of comics?

797
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,800
What? Gosh, you and your jokes.

798
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,901
I'm not joking.

799
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:05,576
What would you do then?

800
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,070
It would be great
if I'm the main character.

801
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,741
I can do everything I want to.

802
00:48:09,741 --> 00:48:11,840
If that's true,
I can fix your heart first.

803
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,340
That's not what I meant.

804
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,885
We're in the world of comics.

805
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:18,881
Whether we're
in the world of comics or movies,

806
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,326
it's the same for me.

807
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:22,651
It won't change that...

808
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,895
you're the person I love
the most in this world.

809
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,720
Stop your wild imaginations
and go to sleep.

810
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,196
Okay? You have school tomorrow.

811
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:10,306
My heart is beating like this.

812
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:11,806
Nothing will change.

813
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:14,371
I am who I am.

814
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:15,716
I'm real.

815
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,661
See?

816
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:39,190
Look how they are all over me.
This proves I'm the main character.

817
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,700
I'm coming. Hey, you in the front.
Move out of the way.

818
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,231
Gosh, what's going on?

819
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,346
Are you making deliveries?

820
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:45,946
Come on.

821
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,415
Hey.

822
00:49:53,071 --> 00:49:54,355
Poor her.

823
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:57,010
I get that she's supposed
to be bullied.

824
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,525
Dan Oh. Hello.

825
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:01,595
But I'm glad she's cheerful.

826
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,565
18-year-old Eun Dan Oh.

827
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,936
I'm the main character
of a romance comic book.

828
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:16,236
Which one should I wear today?

829
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:26,841
- No way. Isn't it limited edition?
- What's that?

830
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:28,381
My dad bought me.

831
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:31,456
That's right.
Her dad is really sweet.

832
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:34,651
A rich family's only daughter...

833
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:36,196
who gets all the love in the family.

834
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,236
I had a weak heart since birth.

835
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,291
However,
after several rounds of surgery,

836
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,005
I miraculously survived.

837
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,500
- Hi.
- Hi, Dan Oh.

838
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,631
- Hi, Dan Oh.
- Hi.

839
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,571
Above all, I'm a classy
and graceful princess...

840
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:56,075
of Seuli High School.

841
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,446
That's me.

842
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:01,811
The heroine of a romance
comic book, Eun Dan Oh.

843
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:02,940
- Hey.
- Gosh.

844
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,025
It was you, right?

845
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,081
- What?
- Who on earth...

846
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:07,851
would steal a wallet
other than you here?

847
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,621
- It wasn't me.
- All right then.

848
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:10,920
Let me check your bag.

849
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,990
What are you doing? It wasn't me.

850
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,166
Give it back.

851
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,636
Give it back.

852
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,605
Hey, give it back to me.

853
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,805
Is it time for me to step in?

854
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,216
Enough is enough.

855
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,355
I saw everything.

856
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:37,126
So what?

857
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,585
Apologize to her.

858
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,065
Sorry.

859
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,926
Happy now?

860
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:47,995
Hey, let's go.

861
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:50,430
Why are you butting
in all of a sudden?

862
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,035
You're unbelievable.

863
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,075
Dan Oh, thank you.

864
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:01,176
You're pretty and kind too.

865
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,500
Of course.

866
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,616
It's a tiny bit bothersome,

867
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,515
but this is my role.

868
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:27,030
Who could be...

869
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,706
a good match for me?

870
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:32,571
A musician? Good, good.

871
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:33,730
An athlete?

872
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,176
Oh, gosh. I can't even...

873
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,470
Gosh, Lee Do Hwa.

874
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,986
Look at him, flirting with me.

875
00:52:42,381 --> 00:52:43,851
Should I say hi back? Or not?

876
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:45,025
Should I? Or not?

877
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,525
Fine. I'll say hi back.

878
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:54,595
Gosh, that annoying jerk,
Baek Kyung.

879
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,966
Okay. You're hot.
I'll give you that.

880
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,275
Oh Nam Ju too?

881
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,416
My gosh, this is crazy.

882
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,270
What am I going to do?

883
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,085
Which one should I choose?

884
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,355
I don't know who I should choose.

885
00:53:17,351 --> 00:53:19,055
Hi, guys.

886
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:20,456
Hi.

887
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,765
What are you doing?

888
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,090
What?

889
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:28,166
Out of my way.

890
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,030
What? Unbelievable. You little...

891
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,301
How dare you ignore me?
Have you gone mad?

892
00:53:35,301 --> 00:53:36,436
What's wrong with her?

893
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,876
How should I know?

894
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,411
I saw this coming.

895
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:46,745
Hey, Dan Oh.

896
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,126
There's only one spot.
Whoever comes first will get it.

897
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:53,456
Hey, Dan Oh.

898
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,065
- Are you up?
- Yes.

899
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,775
Where am I?

900
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,505
You're at the hospital.

901
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,500
Gosh. I know that.

902
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,745
Since you're awake, I'll go.

903
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:18,686
Hey.

904
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,480
What about Nam Ju and Do Hwa?

905
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,755
Why are you...

906
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,156
looking for them?

907
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,755
Gosh.

908
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,035
What? That guy...

909
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,990
How much regret
is he going to suffer later on?

910
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,805
I don't understand him.

911
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:42,060
Gosh, that was so upsetting!

912
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:44,000
He has no idea how important I am!

913
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,200
I'm Eun Dan Oh.

914
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,275
Come on.

915
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:50,245
He's awful.

916
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,911
Since I'm the main character,

917
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:56,686
I was going to
be understanding about this.

918
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,386
But come on! This isn't right!

919
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,355
My heart is about to explode
out of frustration.

920
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,866
Here's what's more frustrating.

921
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,466
The only person I could talk to
about this is Dried Squid.

922
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:13,805
I'm here at this hour...

923
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:15,876
in this hospital outfit.

924
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,476
I feel sick.

925
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,255
You're here.

926
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,825
You don't seem angry today.
That's new.

927
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,495
You're not cursing at me either.

928
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,825
I'm sick.

929
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:37,466
Aren't you glad though?

930
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,821
You won't die...

931
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:41,196
from a ruptured heart
outside the scene.

932
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,565
"Glad"?

933
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:43,990
I'm always sick, get dumped,

934
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,236
and am looked down on.

935
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,331
How could a main character face
such treatment?

936
00:55:49,331 --> 00:55:51,801
The set-up I have is totally lame.

937
00:55:51,801 --> 00:55:53,230
You agree that being a daughter...

938
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,740
of a rich family with a fiance
is so outdated, right?

939
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,371
And being a weak heroine...

940
00:55:57,371 --> 00:55:59,311
with a lot of sob stories
doesn't work these days.

941
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:01,010
It's so old-fashioned. It's lame!

942
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,180
That's...

943
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,010
Besides, I would like it more
if I had guys all over me.

944
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,411
Do I need to work this hard?

945
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:08,696
What on earth
is the writer thinking?

946
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:11,196
I hate being sick.

947
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,821
You know what?
That serves him right.

948
00:56:13,821 --> 00:56:15,896
He'll beg me to date him
after turning me down so many times.

949
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:18,666
What?

950
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,166
Where did he go?

951
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:22,636
Come on.
Why is everyone so mean to me?

952
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:24,305
Hey!

953
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,141
Everyone is trying to give it
to someone they like.

954
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:31,871
I will make this
with all of my heart...

955
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:33,616
for Nam Ju.

956
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,750
Hey! What are you doing?

957
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,821
I'm sorry. Does it say, "man"?

958
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:43,581
Whose name should I write?

959
00:56:43,581 --> 00:56:44,950
If you do this, it says, "man".

960
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,020
I was going to write, "Nam Ju",
not, "man".

961
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,361
That rude brat.

962
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:51,936
Seriously. Old habits die hard.

963
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,436
Nam Ju.

964
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:56,331
Hey, let me borrow this.

965
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,406
Okay.

966
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:01,470
- Wait, will it be Nam Ju then?
- Nam Ju.

967
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,116
- Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

968
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,345
No, no. There are too many rivals.

969
00:57:06,811 --> 00:57:08,010
Then...

970
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,081
Can I taste yours?

971
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:11,325
No, that's not right!

972
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:13,210
Fine, I won't.

973
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,480
You're so clueless.

974
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,480
Of course, this is for Baek Kyung.

975
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,795
Come on.

976
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,530
Didn't you make this for Baek Kyung?

977
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:27,091
- No, I didn't.
- Come on.

978
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:28,700
Of course, you did.

979
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,871
You said that
he was the only one for you.

980
00:57:30,871 --> 00:57:32,230
I said he wasn't.

981
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,530
You startled me.

982
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,240
When did I say
that he was the only one for me?

983
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,476
You said that every day
for the past 10 years.

984
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,740
You were the one who said it.

985
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,170
Why are you yelling at me?

986
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,216
I said that
when I wasn't aware of myself.

987
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,180
Anyway, it's different now.
It's not him.

988
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,585
No, never.

989
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,495
What are you saying?

990
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,361
Wait, if I am
the star of this story,

991
00:57:54,361 --> 00:57:56,091
why should I give a cake to anyone?

992
00:57:56,091 --> 00:57:57,565
They should be giving one to me.

993
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,206
Goodness.

994
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,146
I should have known
ever since he got cute last time.

995
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:08,770
How did you know
that I like chocolate?

996
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:10,646
I don't think it's for you.

997
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:14,315
I love cakes. Especially when
it's made from scratch.

998
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,386
Guys.

999
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:22,595
To be honest,
I haven't made a decision yet.

1000
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,291
I hope your friendship
won't be sacrificed because of me.

1001
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,866
I truly mean that.

1002
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,666
Don't get into a fight.

1003
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:30,335
Promise me.

1004
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,406
Okay, guys.
I'll split this up into three.

1005
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:41,601
Nam Ju, why don't you take
a piece with extra chocolate?

1006
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,840
What? You don't like sweet food?

1007
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:46,745
Do Hwa, you're number two.
You have to wait.

1008
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,041
Wait, Baek Kyung, you won't eat? Really?

1009
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,156
How disappointing.
This should be really good.

1010
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,855
It's a very funny book.

1011
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:57,525
What am I saying?

1012
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,495
- I'll help you.
- Curry.

1013
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,775
Curry? My gosh, he's so tacky.

1014
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,716
Never mind. Go on.

1015
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:18,670
Wait, has it begun?

1016
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,745
Curry, I had fun
looking at your curry show.

1017
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:22,411
- I had fun looking...
- This is such a tacky way...

1018
00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:23,411
- at your curry show.
- of bullying.

1019
00:59:23,411 --> 00:59:25,825
You broke my phone,

1020
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:27,726
so carry this.

1021
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,525
You can carry my bag.

1022
00:59:29,881 --> 00:59:32,791
If you have no money to buy me
a phone, carry my bag.

1023
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,636
Carry his bag!

1024
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,605
I can feel it.
My prince is going to show up soon.

1025
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:47,601
- Hey, it's Nam Ju.
- My gosh!

1026
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:49,341
- Goodness!
- It's him!

1027
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:50,575
It was Nam Ju?

1028
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:52,871
It was Nam Ju!

1029
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:55,815
I knew it wasn't Baek Kyung,
that mean jerk.

1030
00:59:55,841 --> 00:59:58,051
- Gosh.
- Nam Ju.

1031
00:59:58,051 --> 01:00:00,686
- How much was this?
- It's awesome.

1032
01:00:03,551 --> 01:00:04,765
What are you doing?

1033
01:00:06,551 --> 01:00:08,321
Well, he's not my type,

1034
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:10,866
but he's hot, and he's
the number one guy in this school.

1035
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,161
Oh, we're giving her a moral lesson
in your place.

1036
01:00:14,161 --> 01:00:17,101
- A moral lesson?
- She was rude to you.

1037
01:00:17,101 --> 01:00:20,030
She needs to be our errand girl
and learn her place.

1038
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,416
- Who said you can do that?
- Yes, she'll learn her place.

1039
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:25,515
Move.

1040
01:00:27,571 --> 01:00:30,116
It's finally my turn.

1041
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,986
Wait, what is this?
Why can't I move yet?

1042
01:00:35,051 --> 01:00:38,795
Oh, I see.
You're going to come to me?

1043
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:59,416
I hate it when someone touches
something that's mine.

1044
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:01,881
- Oh, right.
- What?

1045
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:03,341
If you know that, you should go.

1046
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:05,051
Hey, there's something new
at the snack bar.

1047
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,051
Hey, right. My mom quit cooking.

1048
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,855
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

1049
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:10,626
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1050
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:17,065
Did you hear me?

1051
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,775
You'll be my errand girl
from now on,

1052
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:23,930
Yeo Ju Da.

1053
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,775
- Is he serious?
- Yeo Ju Da?

1054
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,376
Ju Da, your last name is Yeo?

1055
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:35,486
Sorry.

1056
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,280
Are you okay?

1057
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,626
You're the first woman
who did that to me.

1058
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:53,065
I'll give you a chance.

1059
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:55,335
A chance to thank me.

1060
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,245
Hey, let me borrow this.

1061
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:05,216
I love cakes.

1062
01:02:05,911 --> 01:02:07,486
Especially when
it's made from scratch.

1063
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:17,396
Nam Ju is the male lead,
which is what his name means.

1064
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,896
Yeo Ju Da. Yeo Ju Da...

1065
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,495
Yeo Ju Da? You're the heroine?

1066
01:03:10,841 --> 01:03:12,116
(Extra-ordinary You)

1067
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,581
I'm an extra? I, Eun Dan Oh?

1068
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:15,940
Everything I say and do is...

1069
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,980
done for Nam Ju and Ju Da.

1070
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,010
The writer will figure out
what you'll say and do.

1071
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,381
That's what I hate!

1072
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:26,325
Everything will happen
according to the plan in this world.

1073
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,750
I can see the future.

1074
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,621
For example, it's fate.

1075
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:32,490
If I can see it beforehand,
doesn't that mean I can change it?

1076
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,460
Nothing will change in this world.

1077
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,030
The story changed?

1078
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,646
I might be able to become
someone more than an extra.

1079
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,900
Is he planned to save me?

1080
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:42,670
I'm sure. There's something
going on with that boy.

1081
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:43,670
Found it.

1082
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,386
I will not live
according to the writer's plan.
