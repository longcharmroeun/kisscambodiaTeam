1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,795
Do you...

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,464
like Dan Oh?

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,075
- What?
- Forget about your character.

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,545
Do you like Dan Oh?

5
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,769
Who are you to ask me that?

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,975
Because I do.

7
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,344
I like Dan Oh.

8
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:35,825
(Episode 19)

9
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,724
(Thank you.)

10
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,945
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,140
(You always say this to me.
"Your happiness is my happiness.")

12
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,439
I'm right here, Dan Oh.

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,814
That's not possible.

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
You always say this to me.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,579
"Your happiness is my happiness."

16
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,239
I can't ever win, can I?

17
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,525
(I prepared this for you.)

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,019
(I prepared this for you.)

19
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,219
(I love you the most in this world.)

20
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,424
I love you the most in this world.

21
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,794
(I love you the most in this world.)

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,044
What kind of nonsense is this?

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,615
My gosh.

24
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,284
How can he be so romantic?

25
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,454
"I prepared this for you.
You like flowers."

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,255
"My gosh, I love you the most
in this world. I love you."

27
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,949
Bringing out the flowers
in the most decisive moment!

28
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,794
Gosh, cliches are the best.

29
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,565
I'm not done with it yet.

30
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,734
This is only possible because
they're main characters, right?

31
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,834
Main characters?

32
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,714
These kinds of scenes are only given
to the main characters.

33
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,575
It's cool and heartrending.

34
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,345
I can't be compared to Nam Ju,
not even in 100 years.

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,315
I should stop reading
something like this.

36
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,240
The supporting male characters are
so foolish...

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,379
that it makes me feel miserable.

38
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,755
I can connect with them as
a fellow supporting male character.

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,905
Inductive reasoning
isn't very difficult.

40
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,605
We're just looking at
these sequences in another light.

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,214
The relationship between
the neighboring numbers.

42
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,069
Finding out the relationship is...

43
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,614
what we call an inductive reasoning.

44
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,379
If we want to know more
about a guy named Yang Yi,

45
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,680
we won't just
find out more about him.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,250
We'll look at
the relationship he has...

47
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,825
with Yang Il and Yang Sam too.

48
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,264
We're looking at the relationship
between each of these numbers.

49
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,195
You three always go around together.

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,665
Is this a love triangle?

51
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,000
No way!

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,005
The girl I like is sitting up there.

53
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,345
Hey, man.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,375
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

55
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,580
Okay, I'll give you
another example. Ban Jang?

56
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,210
This is only possible because
they're main characters, right?

57
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,424
These kinds of scenes are only given
to the main characters.

58
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,565
Stop mimicking me.

59
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,334
The main characters?

60
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,354
Darn it, you're making it
way too obvious...

61
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,964
that you burnt this book.

62
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,435
(Thank you.)

63
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,735
Will you pretend
like you're clueless again?

64
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,404
- How did you find that?
- I told you...

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,534
that you'll have to talk to me
once I find that book.

66
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,604
I don't think
that story is from this world.

67
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,644
Is this a book
that the writer made before?

68
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,084
I guess I'm right.

69
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,354
So what if it's
the writer's former book?

70
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,825
The former work
has nothing to do with this.

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,079
It already ended,
so it has no power.

72
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,120
You say it's already over
and it has no power,

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,264
but why do you
try so hard to hide it?

74
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:10,660
Dan Oh said exactly the same lines
as what's in that book.

75
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,735
So what?

76
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,829
What do you want?

77
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,135
What do I want?

78
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,175
Getting back
what was taken from me.

79
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,274
That's what I want.

80
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,385
For everything to go back
the way it was.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,295
I thought
I burnt up the entire book.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,635
This is too dangerous.

83
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,034
He's way too dangerous.

84
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,214
What are you up to?

85
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,245
Nothing.

86
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,815
What is this?

87
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,584
What...

88
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,724
(Daily Test)

89
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,625
Goodness.

90
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,065
Give it to me.

91
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm a specialist
when it comes to English.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,704
Specially?

93
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,204
Be quiet.

94
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,129
In order to speak English very well,

95
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,500
you need to know many, many words.

96
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,730
- Many, many?
- Yes.

97
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,014
What are you not sure of?

98
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,009
- Question 24.
- Okay.

99
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,438
I studied that just now.

100
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,514
Give me a moment.

101
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,014
Right here.

102
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,154
Extraordinary.

103
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,555
What do you think that means?

104
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,649
Extras like us?

105
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,649
Sure.

106
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,360
"Ordinary" means typical.

107
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,490
Typical?
Like what Bo Tong's name means?

108
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,660
Me? What about me?

109
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,499
Come on, focus.

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,470
If you add "ordinary"
with "extra", like us,

111
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,445
it becomes extraordinary.

112
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,445
It means remarkable and amazing.

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,985
This word is...

114
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,745
like us.

115
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,214
Two ordinary extras met up...

116
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,654
and are making
a special time out of this.

117
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,695
So to me,

118
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,990
you aren't just an extra.

119
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,865
Extra-ordinary you.

120
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:26,104
My gosh. You're good
at applying these words.

121
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,274
Okay, then. Out of 10 points,

122
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,230
you get 100.

123
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,644
No, 1,000 points.

124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,274
Okay, write it down.

125
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,185
Stop looking at me
and write it down.

126
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,714
I hope our special time...

127
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,284
last a very long time.

128
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,594
Ordinary...

129
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,764
No, that's wrong.

130
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,594
Ordinary. It's an O. Where's the O?

131
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,635
Two ordinary extras met up...

132
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,435
and are making
a special time out of this.

133
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,670
So to me, you are...

134
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,815
Extra-ordinary you.

135
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,524
My gosh, what was that?

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,755
Focus.

137
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,204
"He definitely stood out to me..."

138
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:35,735
"among the numbers of people."

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,815
"When he approached me
from a distance,"

140
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,244
"my heart began to ache a little."

141
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,354
"When the little things he did..."

142
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,624
"began to have big
and small meanings to me..."

143
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,535
Hello.

144
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,065
Let's go.

145
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,075
"I finally realized..."

146
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,474
"that I am in love with him."

147
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,675
Love?

148
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,915
Dan Oh.

149
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,145
What are you reading?

150
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,925
Oh. Hey, Haru. Hi.

151
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,224
Goodness.

152
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,325
Are you okay?

153
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,535
No, it's...

154
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,065
My gosh. This is...

155
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,874
Why haven't I seen
Dried Squid Fairy lately?

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,305
It doesn't feel like
I had a satisfying meal for a while.

157
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,200
You always say that
after finishing your meal.

158
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,940
I have no appetite.

159
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,139
Then what are you eating?
Is that a nutritional supplement?

160
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,045
I have another stomach for dessert.

161
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:53,909
Just be honest.

162
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,984
Tell me that it's so good
that you want another serving.

163
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,155
Gosh, don't come near me.

164
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,879
What are you looking at?
By the way, where's Haru?

165
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,820
Haru? Why?

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,325
It feels boring without him.

167
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,058
I found you.

168
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,805
- What?
- Hi, Haru.

169
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,244
Why did you leave back there?

170
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,594
Guys...
Guys, I'm going to leave first.

171
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,065
Dan Oh!

172
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,134
Dan Oh?

173
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,004
What?

174
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,529
Why does she look so awkward
around you?

175
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,529
"Awkward"?

176
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,504
She's embarrassed
by all the food around her mouth.

177
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,704
- Sae Mi.
- What?

178
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,244
How do my teeth look?

179
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,045
Gosh!

180
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,055
Sigma means "to add".

181
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,454
Let's look at an example.

182
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,624
Sigma K is from one to N, AK.

183
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,080
Add all of them.

184
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,364
You need to add until the end.

185
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,834
You can express it this way as well.

186
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,538
Where are you going?

187
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,874
I'm going to have lunch.

188
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,785
Right, lunch.

189
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,055
You already had lunch.

190
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,879
Right. Yes, I did.

191
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,649
But I'm going to eat again.

192
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,055
I'm ravenous.

193
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,395
Dan Oh.

194
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:52,994
Yes?

195
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,734
Why do you look so shy today?

196
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,834
I'm not.

197
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,474
Where is he?

198
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:06,129
Haru, are you coming?

199
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,515
Yes, I am.

200
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,015
I'll see you later.

201
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,509
Hurry up.

202
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,785
- Come on.
- Let's go.

203
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,704
Haru. Haru.

204
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,634
Gosh, you are too handsome.

205
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,830
She's so consistent.

206
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,815
She has the same face
from the previous story.

207
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,484
No. The writer lacks creativity.

208
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,685
It's the same story
over and over again.

209
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,785
- You like him too much.
- My goodness.

210
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,025
Who? Me? What do you mean?

211
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,295
Haru.

212
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,094
Is it that obvious?

213
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,025
So what if it is?

214
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,590
I don't want to hear
about how extras can't do this...

215
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,795
or that I'll change the world.

216
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,134
Everyone has the right
to like someone.

217
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,870
Whether it be a lead character
or an extra.

218
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,474
Oh, my. I can't believe
you said that.

219
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,374
What is it? Do you like someone?

220
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,515
I used to.

221
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,015
Who? Do I know her?

222
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,454
She's not in this world.

223
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,655
The writer didn't add her.

224
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,084
Perhaps, it's a good thing.

225
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,624
In a way, I should thank the writer.

226
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,224
I'm better off...

227
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,665
not seeing her again.

228
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,364
It's a good thing?

229
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,665
You should see the person
you like whenever you want.

230
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,230
Since we're mere extras,

231
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,504
we need to try hard to find love.

232
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,114
But even the writer cannot stop me
from liking someone.

233
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,145
The writer has nothing on me.

234
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,155
Come on.

235
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,854
Are you punishing me
for badmouthing you?

236
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,289
I'll forgive you
since Haru's in this stage.

237
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,464
Just say it.

238
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,234
Haru doesn't need to leave.

239
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,405
Okay.

240
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,575
Hey, that's my gift.

241
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,769
You must like it.

242
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,015
Actually, Haru helped me choose it.

243
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,854
I have enough of these,
so don't buy me any more.

244
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,395
- Okay.
- Don't cause any trouble.

245
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,795
Don't collapse and make me
visit the hospital again.

246
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,435
Every time I go there,
I want to go insane.

247
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,529
I'm sorry for being sick.

248
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,035
That's not what I meant.

249
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,759
- Look at him.
- What's his problem?

250
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,799
- Is he bothering her?
- Is he doing it again?

251
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,214
- I feel so bad for Dan Oh.
- Me too.

252
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,515
Hey.

253
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,744
You're always like this.

254
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:00,815
You always make me out
to be the bad guy.

255
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,655
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it!

256
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,325
Hey, keep this or throw it away.

257
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,665
- Let's go.
- Hey.

258
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,675
I know you don't mean it,

259
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,575
but it does hurt me.

260
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,515
Dan Oh, listen...

261
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,515
Hey!

262
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,614
I warned you.

263
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,084
Stop bothering her.

264
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,825
I was wondering why he was being
so good to her these days.

265
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,895
He treats her however he wants to.

266
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,704
Stop fighting, will you?

267
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,244
Since when...

268
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,214
have you become a lead character?

269
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,555
Did you see it?

270
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,664
("Secret")

271
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,055
The former work
has nothing to do with this.

272
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,924
It already ended,
so it has no power.

273
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:55,065
(Eun Dan Oh, Haru)

274
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,805
Then why does he keep interfering...

275
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,174
when he's a mere extra?

276
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,660
Among all the stars
that I have seen,

277
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,904
that one is the biggest,
the brightest,

278
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,834
and the most beautiful.

279
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,275
It must have been difficult
to find it.

280
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,944
Thank you.

281
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,584
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

282
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:48,114
and for remembering my wish.

283
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,174
It's that dream again.

284
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,275
That's why I couldn't give you
an answer about your beginning.

285
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,604
The secret about your beginning
doesn't exist here.

286
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,394
- Hey.
- Wait up!

287
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,694
- Hi.
- Hey.

288
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,795
Dan Oh.

289
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,194
What?

290
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,075
What I said on our stage...

291
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,245
You want to apologize to me, right?

292
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,309
You don't know how to apologize
because you've never done it.

293
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,354
And you don't know how to smile
because you never do.

294
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,450
Your character is tough to play too.

295
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,679
At times like this, it's better
off being an extra without a set-up.

296
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,755
Don't you agree?

297
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,150
But what about me?

298
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,934
I'm an extra. Yet, I have a lame
set-up like my heart problem.

299
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,990
You think
it's better to be an extra?

300
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,660
Yes, take Haru for example.

301
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,859
Because he doesn't have a set-up,

302
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,404
he can change the stage.

303
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,545
Why are you bringing him up now?

304
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,545
- What?
- Even during our stage,

305
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,815
you seem to look at him
while you talk.

306
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,914
Do you like him?

307
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:04,124
Forget it. Don't answer that.

308
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,624
Well...

309
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,904
Baek Kyung.

310
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,674
Baek Kyung. You wanted to check this out.

311
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,230
- Get that away from me.
- What is it?

312
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,630
Are you embarrassed
to read a romance comic book?

313
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,799
What's so bad about it?
We're in a romance comic book.

314
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,215
Get that away from me.

315
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,315
Fine. I should lend this
to Haru first.

316
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,880
- Haru?
- He doesn't know anything.

317
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,894
He should read this to get
a girlfriend, you know. Look.

318
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,319
("A Rose for You")

319
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,650
Why do you guys pay
so much attention to an extra?

320
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,920
What's so bad about being an extra?

321
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,664
I'm quite envious of Haru.

322
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,690
Think about it. When we walk
with Nam Ju like a trio,

323
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,230
doesn't that make you cringe?

324
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,460
Whenever that scene begins,
I'm utterly embarrassed.

325
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,099
That halo,

326
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,568
our gaze, and music...

327
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,644
- He's so handsome.
- He's so hot.

328
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,910
It's A3.

329
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,215
Hey, they are so hot!

330
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:10,009
I should watch my mouth.

331
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:12,309
I bet the writer is watching us.

332
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:13,819
What are you doing?
It's too early for that.

333
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,055
That's enough.

334
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,720
Keep the dignity of A3.

335
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,225
My dignity is
to return the greetings I get.

336
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,589
That was so cheesy.

337
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,965
I get the feeling
we're about to run into Ju Da.

338
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:26,960
She cried a lot in the science lab.

339
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,200
She looks okay. What a relief.

340
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,299
And making her your errand girl to
flirt is a way to keep our dignity?

341
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:32,299
Nam Ju.

342
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:34,599
- Hey, hey.
- I know. Your method is childish.

343
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,740
So when will you go out with her?

344
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
- Nam Ju.
- Yes.

345
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,614
Thank you for helping me
in the science lab.

346
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,680
Did something happen
between you two?

347
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,549
Well, Nam Ju...

348
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,755
Oh, that?

349
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,225
You don't need to know.

350
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,325
I guess he saved Ju Da.

351
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,235
Nam Ju is a true protagonist.

352
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,660
So when will you tell me your wish?

353
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,729
Today.

354
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,805
Today?

355
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,545
Meet me in the auditorium...

356
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,174
after class.

357
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,374
Okay.

358
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,009
Hey. You guys...

359
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,985
Nam Ju. I'm fine now.

360
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,325
No matter what happens to me,

361
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,565
you'll come to save me.

362
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,334
Nam Ju, we'll get going.

363
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,975
Do Hwa, let's go.

364
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,985
I should just throw out
this violin or something.

365
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,485
No way. Will she show up now?

366
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,664
I was wondering where this beautiful
melody was coming from.

367
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:05,965
It was coming from your fingers.

368
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:07,975
That's a compliment.

369
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,604
Are you going out with Nam Ju?

370
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:13,644
It's not that.

371
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,245
I'm glad.

372
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,015
What's the piece
you were just playing?

373
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,815
My feeling
which I hope you can recognize.

374
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,525
The name of this piece is called...

375
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:26,584
"Love's Sorrow".

376
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:35,819
"Love's Sorrow"?

377
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:37,660
The writer made the line sound
so cheesy.

378
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,465
How could it be so cheesy
and predictable?

379
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,160
I don't know why our scenes
are always the same.

380
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,599
And I always play this violin.

381
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,599
At this point,
my role isn't the deuteragonist.

382
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,205
I'm just a musician
for background music.

383
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,874
This is embarrassing.

384
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:51,644
Do Hwa.

385
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,555
- I like it when you play.
- What?

386
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,114
It comforts me.

387
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,825
I think about it
when I'm having a hard time.

388
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,589
Don't smile. I'm serious right now.

389
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:07,164
You only remember the good things,
so it's okay for you.

390
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,759
Ju Da, aren't you going
to the art class?

391
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,065
Okay, Nam Ju.

392
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,305
But I liked the piece
you played before.

393
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,174
I liked not "Love's Sorrow",

394
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,144
but "Love's Joy".

395
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:48,005
Let's keep a distance, okay?

396
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,485
Hey, Baek Kyung.

397
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,170
As you know,

398
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,410
Nam Ju and Ju Da
are the main characters of "Secret".

399
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,515
And I'm just an insignificant
supporting character.

400
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,210
- So what?
- I decided to root...

401
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,255
for the love of the main characters
to wish Ju Da happy.

402
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,924
It's hard to tell
how I feel on stage.

403
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,420
But you confessed
your feelings to her before.

404
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Right.

405
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,364
But Nam Ju was supposed to confess
his feelings on that stage.

406
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,735
What are you saying?

407
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,460
According to the storyboard
Dan Oh saw,

408
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,599
Nam Ju was the one who announced
Ju Da as his girlfriend.

409
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,869
But because I confessed
my feelings to her,

410
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:28,114
you and Dan Oh took over that scene.

411
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:32,444
From now on,

412
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,154
Dan Oh is the only woman for me.

413
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:42,354
Thanks to Haru, I was able
to confess my feelings too.

414
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,119
But it didn't change anything.

415
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,265
So...

416
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,694
the stage changed?

417
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,934
Yes.

418
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,364
How was that possible?

419
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,864
Because it's Haru.

420
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,829
I know that.
So what did that jerk do?

421
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:57,545
I'm not sure. Did he have
a special method to do that?

422
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,944
I don't know. How did he do that?

423
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,694
If the stage changes,

424
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,725
can the characters change?

425
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,164
I heard
that Haru can change the stage.

426
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,134
If I change it,

427
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,289
will something change?

428
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:27,404
Never.

429
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,205
Not everyone can change the stage.

430
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,315
So why is Haru capable
of doing that of all people?

431
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,815
I don't know.

432
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,515
Even the main characters
and I cannot do that.

433
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,914
But an extra, Haru, can do it.

434
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,094
Perhaps, being an extra
might be more helpful.

435
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:53,465
We can't fool the writer...

436
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,894
because our role
in each scene is set.

437
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,404
Besides, whatever the writer
intends will happen...

438
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:02,275
no matter what
regardless of how it happens...

439
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,104
because the changed stage
was drawn by the writer too.

440
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,750
Here.
You asked me to get this for you.

441
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,825
Okay.

442
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,795
Haru.

443
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,634
Thank you.

444
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,864
- Don't mention it.
- If...

445
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,735
If you don't have
a lot of time left,

446
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,174
what do you want to do the most?

447
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,305
Why?

448
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,874
I want to do everything...

449
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,144
for Dan Oh.

450
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,684
If I were her,

451
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,555
I would always want to be with you.

452
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,924
She likes you very much.

453
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,055
Dan Oh does.

454
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,344
I think Dan Oh is really sleeping.

455
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:16,914
- Go. I'll stay here.
- Move.

456
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,384
Why don't you just stick
to your role just like earlier?

457
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,955
You can't do anything
for Dan Oh on stage.

458
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,985
You can barely do
whatever I ask of you.

459
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,694
But you can change her fate?

460
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,924
So did anything change?

461
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,894
You can't beat me.

462
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,065
You're a mere extra.

463
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:46,365
(Episode 20 will air shortly.)

464
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,784
Everyone!

465
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,279
The test result is out.
Come and check.

466
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,779
- My gosh.
- We'll do it later.

467
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:52,854
Who wants to check that?

468
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:54,750
I'm sure Nam Ju is the first place.

469
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,219
Hey, Nam Ju didn't take the test
because of an event for Serinne.

470
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:58,680
Then who do you think is
the number one...

471
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,289
in year 2, class 7 without Nam Ju?
Me, obviously.

472
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:02,619
Hey, you are number one.

473
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:04,034
From the back!

474
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,020
You idiot.

475
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,760
- You're right!
- My gosh.

476
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,029
I'm happy to be number one anyway.

477
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:11,659
Hey, who do you think it'll be
without Nam Ju?

478
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:12,970
If the number one
of Seuli High School is gone,

479
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,175
who can fill that in?

480
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:18,340
Of course, it's our dear Baek Kyung,
you bunch of idiots.

481
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,440
- Idiots?
- Yes!

482
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,310
I studied through the night,

483
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,810
but I'm the third place again.

484
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,810
It's not that bad.

485
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,885
Wait.

486
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,055
What? Baek Kyung isn't
the top of the class.

487
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:29,880
Then who is it?

488
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,050
Gosh, Haru. Have you
always been that smart?

489
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,850
My gosh, that's so cool.

490
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,265
What? Haru?

491
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,590
What is this?
I'm disappointed in Baek Kyung.

492
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,660
Our teacher wants the top student
to help Dan Oh catch up.

493
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,529
- I'll do it.
- She told the top student to do it.

494
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,604
That's me.

495
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,245
I'll do it.

496
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,305
Why would you?

497
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,614
Why didn't you win
against the extra, then?

498
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,185
- What?
- I guess you didn't expect this.

499
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,185
Move aside, you idiots.

500
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,780
Haru, can you tutor me too?

501
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,119
Hey. I hope
someone can teach me too.

502
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,224
- You're better than Baek Kyung.
- Hey, me too.

503
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,664
Can you tell me about this question?

504
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,435
You can't do anything
for Dan Oh on stage.

505
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,435
But you can change her fate?

506
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,644
So did anything change?

507
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,504
You can't beat me.

508
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:24,474
You're a mere extra.

509
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,685
- Haru.
- Goodness.

510
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,185
- Yes?
- What's on your mind?

511
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,619
Something is getting on my nerves.

512
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,694
What is?

513
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:42,795
Oh, how I just collapsed?

514
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,334
Why?
Did you wait for me for so long?

515
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,559
I thought I would be fine
once the stage is over,

516
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,834
but my chest pain
has gotten worse lately.

517
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,569
No, it didn't get worse.

518
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:59,569
No, I'm totally fine. Really.

519
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:00,744
I'm good.

520
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,184
I know you're in pain.

521
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,255
Dan Oh.

522
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,755
I want to change your character.

523
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:11,894
Let's do it.

524
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,765
Let me do it.

525
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,964
What if you disappear again
like you did last time?

526
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,165
I have a role to play now
as Baek Kyung's friend.

527
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,175
I won't disappear that easily.

528
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,274
You're Baek Kyung's friend,
and I'm Baek Kyung's fiancee.

529
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:31,769
Gosh, the writer
must love Baek Kyung a lot.

530
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:34,885
His character is better than Do Hwa,
who plays the supporting role...

531
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,114
Right.

532
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,684
What if Baek Kyung is the one
who can change your fate,

533
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:43,054
and not me?

534
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,735
This isn't good.

535
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,229
I'm fine.

536
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,304
I'm not in pain.
Why is this ringing?

537
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,144
The stage is about to begin.

538
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,344
I'm going to change...

539
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,515
your story.

Sae Mi.

541
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,554
Hey, Haru.

542
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:20,220
- You. You're holding Dan Oh's...
- What's going on?

543
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,665
You'll probably collapse
during this stage.

544
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:26,035
Baek Kyung will show up to save you.

545
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,934
If this is your stage...

546
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,304
and if you need this
to play the scene,

547
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,404
something might change with this.

548
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:36,644
Look.

549
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,075
It's still ringing
although it's not on you.

550
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,314
What are you doing, Haru?

551
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:46,725
What is he doing?

552
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,524
But everything might
go back to the way it was.

553
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:56,389
Hey, why is this ringing so much?

554
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:57,834
Do you have a thing for me?

555
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,635
No way. Quiet.

556
00:34:01,229 --> 00:34:02,465
What's with you?

557
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,975
Maybe it'll ring faster
if I hold your hand.

558
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,600
No, this must be broken.

559
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,140
Wait, is your heart
beating faster because of me?

560
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,684
No, this is...

561
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,985
Dan Oh.

562
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,249
- This is bad.
- Oh, no.

563
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:23,249
- Is she okay?
- What are we going to do?

564
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:24,324
Wait and see...

565
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:27,025
if the main character
of this stage is you or me.

566
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,119
- Oh, no.
- Take her to the nurse's office.

567
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,335
- Oh, no.
- Move.

568
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:34,590
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

569
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,665
Why are you here?

570
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:37,374
Where's Dan Oh?

571
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,770
Gosh, Nam Ju was so hot...

572
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,970
that my heart almost popped.

573
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,915
- Come on.
- What was that?

574
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,415
Sae Mi.

575
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,415
- Goodness.
- Hey.

576
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,410
Don't get ill without my permission.

577
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,649
I told not to copy what Nam Ju said.

578
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,085
Darn it.

579
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,395
Are you all right? I was surprised.

580
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,549
I'll do whatever that jerk
did for you.

581
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,965
I can help you change the story.

582
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,295

I knew something was weird.

585
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,689
That brat got a good hold of you.

586
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:12,320
Don't talk about her that way.

587
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,105
Are you out of your mind?

588
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,564
How can you do this to me?

589
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,934
- Do you know how hard I tried...
- To keep my place?

590
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,944
You mean, your place?

591
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:24,045
I'm just like
some ornament to you, no?

592
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:26,400
I'm just a shell.

593
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,314

594
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,979
Come back. Come home immediately.

595
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:35,155
I can't.

how important this is.

to her, right?

- Yes.

- Sorry?

and hasn't shown up either.

to wait here?

What can I do?

632
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:27,694
The girls bully me at school.

633
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,259
And outside of school, I'm busy
part-timing to pay...

634
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:32,365
for my grandmother's hospital fees.

635
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:33,889
I wish my parents could pay...

636
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,635
for my school fee
just like you guys.

637
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,560

after school.

638
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,175

extra-curricular classes as well.

to offer his hand.

So...

643
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,580
even though you think I'm a fool...

644
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,094
that is waiting for someone
who's not even coming,

645
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,594
I can't help but wait for him.

646

on my own.

if you're slow-witted.

to go through to come this far.

- Please...

717
00:45:47,729 --> 00:45:50,369
The weather is wonderful,
and I have so much free time.

718
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:51,974
What should I do? What should I do?

719
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:53,885
Then...

720
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:56,214
do you want to hang out with me?

721
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,684
(English)

722
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:04,950
Hi, everyone. My name is Betty.

723
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,895
I'm an English teacher.
It's a very funny book.

724
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:16,734
Try it.

725
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:35,724
I feel so shy.

726
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,035
Do my legs look long?

727
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,635
What is this?

728
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,974
I wanted my legs to look long.

729
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:56,569
What is this?

730
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,845
They look long.

731
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:08,085
Come here.

732
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:10,794
Let's take one with this tree.

733
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,694
Okay.

734
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:19,034
Can you tiptoe?

735
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,194
Okay.

736
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,204
I'll crouch.

737
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,665
Thanks.

738
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:45,409
The view from up here...

739
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:47,555
makes everything look so small.

740
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,320
Is this how the writer feels
when the writer looks at us?

741
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,449
The writer watches us from above,

742
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:53,649
and we move exactly
how it's drawn...

743
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:55,224
and stop when the writer
erases the drawings.

744
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,934
We can move even
when we're not drawn in the scenes.

745
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,835
Right. That's true.

746
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,105
Haru, what's your dream?

747
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,014
- My dream?
- Yes. Like your dream job.

748
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,544
Well, I'm not sure. What about you?

749
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:18,014
I want to be...

750
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:22,484
an ordinary person who can spend
an ordinary day like today.

751
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:25,655
Someone who can do
whatever she wants.

752
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,305
What's the ending of the story
the writer is drawing?

753
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:42,169
I wonder
if I'll be able to live until 19.

754
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:45,044
You'll be right next to me
when you're 19...

755
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,645
and 20.

756
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:50,684
We're creating our own story.

757
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:55,784
What was that?

758
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,925
Right. The tree
where we took our photo earlier.

759
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,090
- Yes.
- Everyone told me...

760
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,290
that it was the oldest tree
at our school.

761
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,359
They said something about
October 10 being its 300th birthday.

762
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,605
300th birthday?

763
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:12,060
Yes, but I'm sure
the writer came up with this.

764
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,869
Even so, the fact that
the tree was here the longest...

765
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:16,875
makes it feel special.

766
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,570
Whether we're on stage
or in the shadow,

767
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,415
let's meet there on October 10.

768
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:31,595
If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

769
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,794
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

770
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:41,565
When we are 19...

771
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,065
and 20.

772
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:35,024
(October 10)

773
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:37,754
All done.

774
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:43,524
You'll be right next to me
when you're 19...

775
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,494
and 20.

776
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,434
We're creating our own story.

777
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,869
My goodness. He practically
confessed his feelings to me.

778
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:58,744
How can he say something
like that without even blushing?

779
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,550
I miss him.

780
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,724
How am I going to wait
until the morning?

781
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,605
How am I going to wait
until the morning?

782
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:32,969
Am I in the hospital? When?

783
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,585
This is a dream. Right? It must be!

784
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,165
This cannot be!

785
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:49,595
It's today.

786
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,760
Hey, did you hear?

787
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,429
Today is this tree's 300th birthday.

788
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:02,199
No way. It's so old.

789
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:04,740
Hey, don't call the tree old.

790
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,274
This tree is
like Ellen of the family.

791
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:09,639
It's "elder" of the family.

792
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,209
- Hey, I knew that.
- Goodness.

793
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:13,040
That's what I said.
It's the same thing.

794
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,125
- That was embarrassing.
- Hey. Darn it.

795
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,815
We'll keep her here
for a few days and observe her.

796
00:53:46,939 --> 00:53:48,184
She'll be okay, right?

797
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:49,709
To be honest,

798
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,395
I'm worried
whenever I get the test results.

799
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,425
I'm not sure
if Dan Oh can get through this.

800
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,395
She will.

801
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:59,494
She's brave.

802
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:03,689
Right. I'm brave.

803
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:05,675
So hurry. Please hurry.

804
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:12,214
Hey, Dan Oh. What are you doing?

805
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,800
Where are you going in that state?

806
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,645
Dad. I'm really fine.
I have an important plan.

807
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,524
No.

808
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:37,635
It's time for your medication.

809
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,034
What am I going to do?

810
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,184
Hey, Haru.

811
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:57,050
I think Dan Oh got worse.

812
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,454
She's been in the hospital
for a while now.

813
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:00,155
What should we do?

814
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:02,694
She's there?

815
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:42,034
When will Dan Oh come back?

816
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:44,105
I'm bored without Dan Oh.

817
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,875
Let's go visit her
and play with her.

818
00:55:48,899 --> 00:55:50,805
- Hey, Su Chul.
- What?

819
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,439
That's a great idea.
You're a genius!

820
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:54,199
- Right?
- Let's buy a lot of good food.

821
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:55,345
Great. Let's go.

822
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,784
What does she like?

823
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,850
Dan Oh!

824
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,159
- Dan Oh.
- Dan Oh.

825
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:13,734
I missed you so much.

826
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:15,629
Hey, is it serious?

827
00:56:15,629 --> 00:56:17,689
We came here
just in case you were bored.

828
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:19,859
Guys, thank you so much.

829
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,129
You need to stop being sick now.

830
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,399
My wrists hurt by the way.

831
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:24,899
- Do you have a pain relief patch?
- Guys.

832
00:56:24,899 --> 00:56:26,199
I appreciate this,

833
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:28,085
- but what about Haru?
- It was so heavy.

834
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:03,944
Whether we're on stage
or in the shadow,

835
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,184
let's meet there on October 10.

836
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:10,355
If we do that,
I sort of feel like...

837
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,595
we might see each other
for a long time like this tree.

838
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,055
Please.

839
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:54,605
Time for your shots.

840
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:12,155
Okay, fine. Who is it this time?

841
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:15,555
Baek Kyung.

842
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,994
Take it.
I only chose the ones you like.

843
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,055
Thank you.

844
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:23,595
- This is...
- I know.

845
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:26,635
I'll put in a good word to Dad.

846
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:28,704
Thanks, Baek Kyung.

847
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,274
What are you doing?

848
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:41,014
Dan Oh.

849
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:44,409
Let go of me. I have to go.

850
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:45,954
Where are you going
in this condition?

851
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,115
To see Haru.

852
00:59:00,859 --> 00:59:02,504
If it won't change,

853
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,375
if my life is bound to go
as the writer intended,

854
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,444
then I wish
to spend the time I have...

855
00:59:11,469 --> 00:59:13,815
with you, Haru.

856
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,714
Haru!

857
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:24,794
Haru.

858
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:32,565
Haru...

859
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:45,845
Haru!

860
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,165
I miss you. I do.

861
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:07,335
I miss you, Haru.

862
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,905
Haru...

863
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,524
Dan Oh.

864
01:00:40,919 --> 01:00:42,135
Haru.

865
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,294
I missed you.

866
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,194
I like you.

867
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:13,934
What?

868
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:17,004
I like you, Dan Oh.

869
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:33,815
I'm sorry.

870
01:02:40,909 --> 01:02:42,684
(Extra-ordinary You)

871
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,750
I want time to stop like this.

872
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,050
I keep thinking of you
all day, Haru.

873
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,919
Do you fall for anyone
who can change the stage?

874
01:02:48,919 --> 01:02:49,990
It doesn't matter anymore.

875
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,889
Haru and I are happy enough
outside of the stage.

876
01:02:52,889 --> 01:02:54,389
It drives me insane...

877
01:02:54,389 --> 01:02:56,230
whenever that jerk
meddles with my stage...

878
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,760
and whenever you show him
a face that you never showed me.

879
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,060
The memories I forgot
keeps on creeping back.

880
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,570
Even back then, Baek Kyung was...

881
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,240
- The fiance.
- You're my only love too.

882
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,669
Dan Oh and you cannot be together.

883
01:03:07,669 --> 01:03:09,709
You have to stop the one
who changes the stage.

884
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:11,310
Do not repeat the same mistake.

885
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,340
- Who is this?
- A new student...

886
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,379
- in our class.
- Hi.

887
01:03:13,379 --> 01:03:16,050
I'll make sure I find
whatever you're hiding.

888
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,179
Why do I feel so anxious?

889
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:19,350
Will you really die?

890
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,919
It's not too late for you and me.

891
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:22,764
I'll do anything for you.
