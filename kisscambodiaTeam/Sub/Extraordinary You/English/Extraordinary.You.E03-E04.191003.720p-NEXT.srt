1
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,044
You'll be my errand girl
from now on,

2
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:13,214
Yeo Ju Da.

3
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:14,709
- Is he serious?
- Yeo Ju Da?

4
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,253
- No way.
- My gosh.

5
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:18,684
Ju Da, your last name is Yeo?

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,724
Nam Ju is the male lead,
which is what his name means.

7
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:26,764
Yeo Ju Da. Yeo Ju Da...

8
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:28,694
Yeo Ju Da?

9
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,334
You're the heroine?

10
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:34,273
I wasn't the heroine?

11
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:35,733
I can't believe this.

12
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,173
(Episode 3)

13
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:43,644
You're here...

14
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:49,554
Where am I?

15
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,388
(Characters)

16
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:58,789
(Oh Nam Ju, Yeo Ju Da, Lee Do Hwa)

17
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,018
(Baek Kyung, Shin Sae Mi)

18
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,394
(Extra Characters)

19
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:04,633
No way.

20
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:08,203
(Eun Dan Oh, Baek Kyung's fiancee,
has a heart condition)

21
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:12,913
(Eun Dan Oh, Baek Kyung's fiancee,
has a heart condition)

22
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,314
I'm just an extra?

23
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:38,558
(Dried Squid, Ahn Su Chul, Mo Beom,
Ban Jang, Eun Dan Oh)

24
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,974
(Baek Kyung)

25
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,013
(Bumping)

26
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,314
(Sorry.)

27
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:49,913
(You're the first woman
who did that to me.)

28
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,224
(I love cakes. Especially
when it's made from scratch.)

29
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,798
Where did you get this?

30
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:22,908
Why?

31
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,268
It looks just like mine.

32
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:25,384
It's yours.

33
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:27,584
Then why do you have it?

34
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:31,253
I don't think this is
the right place to talk about that.

35
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,223
Wasn't it around here?

36
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,294
That you ruined my school uniform.

37
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:41,533
You didn't only ruin
my school uniform but...

38
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,834
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,433
For what?

40
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,204
For touching your face with my lips.

41
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:52,074
Does that bother you so much?

42
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,879
Do you want me
to take responsibility?

43
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,183
No, that's not what I meant.

44
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:07,794
Even if you can't do anything about
touching my face with your lips,

45
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,178
you should still pay
for the laundry.

46
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,764
But if you run errands for me well,
I'll exempt you from that...

47
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,503
and give this back to you.

48
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,898
How childish.
This is way too childish!

49
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:26,999
("Secret")

50
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,384
Romance comic books are
meant to be childish.

51
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,309
I did think all my classmates' names
were so weird.

52
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:33,879
Il Jin, Yi Jin, Sam Jin,

53
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,108
Ban Jang, Mo Beom...

54
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:36,884
Yeo Ju Da, Oh Nam Ju...

55
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:38,924
How nice and simple are they?

56
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,924
Dried Squid.

57
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,394
I wonder why I'm not called
Heart Disease.

58
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,488
In addition to being a part
of this ridiculous story,

59
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,629
I'm an extra? I, Eun Dan Oh?

60
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:52,734
Yes.

61
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:55,734
You're not the main character here.

62
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,843
- That's crazy.
- Open your heart and accept it.

63
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:02,768
I'm not even
the main character here.

64
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:05,368
I'm an extra in this childish comic.

65
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:08,309
Do you expect me to say,
"Thank you very much"?

66
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:09,708
You seem to be more shocked...

67
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,479
that you're an extra
than that you're in a comic.

68
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,948
Everything I say and do is...

69
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,093
for Oh Nam Ju and Yeo Ju Da.

70
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:17,849
What about me?

71
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,993
Am I supposed to only help
the main character all my life?

72
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,858
You have your role as an extra too.

73
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,959
The writer will decide
what you'll say and do.

74
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,503
That's what frustrates me!

75
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,568
Who says the writer can do that?

76
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:30,873
Calm down.

77
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,143
We're in a romance comic book.
Why don't we keep our dignity?

78
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,643
"Dignity"?

79
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,914
I'm not even the main character.
Who cares about my dignity?

80
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:41,479
That's ridiculous.

81
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,808
I hate this obnoxious writer.

82
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:47,154
What makes you think
you can do this to me?

83
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,024
I bet the writer had no idea...

84
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:52,524
you could be this aggressive.

85
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,573
All right. It's time to go back
to where you belong.

86
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:06,573
Gosh, what are you doing?

87
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,083
What's wrong with you?
Get out of my way.

88
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:15,108
Ju Da, what's all this?

89
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,748
Are you going to sell these?

90
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:18,784
Just sit down.

91
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,304
So this whole place is
for those two?

92
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,383
Even the sunshine
follows her around.

93
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,323
Ju Da, will you scoot over a little?

94
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,493
Darn it.

95
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,563
Can you sit over there instead?

96
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:10,829
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

97
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,269
I just want to sit here.

98
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,243
- Can you move?
- Okay.

99
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,143
Thanks.

100
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,714
Yes! This is it.

101
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,893
I can't believe this.
How can this be possible?

102
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:48,513
The writer is pretty clever.

103
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:50,568
Ju Da gets to have everything...

104
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,284
that boys go crazy for?

105
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,654
Dan Oh, please step up.

106
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,318
What are you waiting for?
You're today's model.

107
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:03,024
Give her a big hand!

108
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,678
Everyone, please look at Dan Oh.

109
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,079
Which side of her face
do you see from here?

110
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,108
- The right side.
- The left side.

111
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,193
- It's the left side, pig.
- "Pig"?

112
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,354
Pig, it's the left side.

113
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,089
That's right. Also,
even if you're on her left side,

114
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,818
depending on where you're sitting,

115
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:43,464
she'll look a little different
to all of you.

116
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,128
It all depends on the angle,

117
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,404
the direction of light,

118
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:52,503
and how you feel about the model.

119
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,469
You could say...

120
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,813
that each of us is actually
drawing a different person.

121
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:58,643
You can start.

122
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh, my. Nam Ju, you're so talented.

123
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,503
Look at that.

124
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,428
But Dan Oh has shorter hair.

125
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,274
This looks more like Ju Da...

126
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,128
It looks exactly like Ju Da!

127
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:27,373
Ju Da?

128
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:31,969
Su Chul, how dare you
comment on my drawing?

129
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,139
I'm sorry. You don't have to
get so worked up. We're friends.

130
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,724
What's the big deal?
He says it's Dan Oh.

131
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,853
I love boys who are good at drawing.

132
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:45,617
- What did she say?
- Why do you have to be so indirect?

133
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:47,618
Sae Mi, I've never thought of you...

134
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,929
- that way...
- I'm not talking about you!

135
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,929
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

136
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,998
Guys, just look at his drawing.

137
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:54,973
- Okay.
- Look at those eyes.

138
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:57,744
How deep do they look?

139
00:08:58,028 --> 00:08:59,699
They must be
at about 300m above sea level.

140
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,439
- It's "below", you idiot.
- Oh, she meant depth.

141
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,884
Look at the hair now.

142
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,907
It's extremely detailed, right?

143
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:09,683
I'm doing all this
for Nam Ju and Ju Da, right?

144
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,978
Guys! Attention!

145
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,823
There's a person over here too!

146
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,919
- What do you think?
- It looks like her.

147
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,264
Stop hitting me.

148
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,174
It looks just like her.

149
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:38,843
Gosh, I can't stand it anymore.

150
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,764
Are you guys finally looking at me?

151
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,093
Did you see that?

152
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,853
What just happened?

153
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,164
How did those plaster casts
go back to where they were?

154
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:27,264
Gosh.

155
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,363
What is this?

156
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,674
Here too?

157
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:37,603
What...

158
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,274
("Secret")

159
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:02,693
Weird things are happening here too.

160
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,358
You're not even surprised anymore.

161
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,463
Explain.

162
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,758
- What do you mean?
- Explain...

163
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,103
so that I can understand.

164
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,099
We're in a comic.

165
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:15,044
Anything can happen here.

166
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,884
But it doesn't make sense.

167
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,384
This right here. I smashed it.

168
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,254
How violent.

169
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,378
But no one seemed to notice it,

170
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:31,524
and the broken plaster casts
went back to normal.

171
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:34,994
Well, I'm not sure.

172
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,433
What about that one?

173
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,124
I really...

174
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,754
didn't want to use this.

175
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,024
Here we go. Ta-da.

176
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:09,634
All right. Listen up.

177
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,874
This world is in a comic
created by the writer.

178
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:17,544
And this is a secret place
in the romance comic.

179
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:22,174
Nothing happens here
unless it's intended by the writer.

180
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,569
That's why we only say lines
the writer intended us to say...

181
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,853
and behave the way
the writer drew us.

182
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,323
And this place is called the stage.

183
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,949
I was nice to Ju Da...

184
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:35,819
and couldn't talk back to that jerk,
Baek Kyung because of that?

185
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,063
Right. Bingo.

186
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,959
Scenes and spaces...

187
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,733
that the writer hasn't drawn
also exist.

188
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,904
Since the writer
didn't draw this scene,

189
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:49,174
that kind of odd stuff happens
as you can see.

190
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,573
This is called the shadow.

191
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:54,744
"Shadow".

192
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,638
It's outside the stage.

193
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:59,343
In other words,
characters are free in the shadow...

194
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,514
just like us here.

195
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,979
Only characters
who are aware of themselves...

196
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,294
can remember what happens
in the shadow.

197
00:13:12,219 --> 00:13:13,664
This is crazy.

198
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,189
However, just because
you are aware of yourself,

199
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,304
it doesn't mean
you can be free all the time.

200
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:21,534
Whatever a character does,

201
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,898
things are bound to happen
just as the writer has planned...

202
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,374
on the stage.

203
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,908
The plaster casts you broke
in the art classroom were restored.

204
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:32,384
You were sitting down when
you were standing up a second ago.

205
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:33,709
It means that
in the world of comics,

206
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:37,008
things are bound to happen
as planned.

207
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,654
It's the same...

208
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,754
as fate.

209
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,054
"Fate"?

210
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,404
I will never behave the way
the writer wants.

211
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,713
We'll see...

212
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,914
in whose hand my fate lies.

213
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,943
Stage.

214
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:16,079
"Instead of bidding farewell
to you,"

215
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,148
"I would rather give up my weaving."

216
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,254
This is so touching.

217
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:20,079
Okay, up to here was a year.

218
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,179
When you read through it,

219
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,248
it means that she is willing to go
after him even if it means...

220
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:25,849
she must give up everything...

221
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:28,233
she loves
as long as he loves her back.

222
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,933
It made a mark
in the history of literature.

223
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,833
Dan Oh.

224
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,573
All right.
Why don't you read the chorus?

225
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,343
Hey. What are you doing?

226
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:45,368
My gosh, this is the line.

227
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:47,254
This will get your heart to pound.

228
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,408
Excuse me.

229
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:51,353
You should definitely read up
on this excellent reference.

230
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:58,288
"If you are so kind to love me back,
I will follow you in tears."

231
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:01,388
- I'm on the stage again.
- "Pyeongyang is the capital,"

232
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:05,603
"but I love a new capital
that was just built."

233
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,034
What's this?

234
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:12,374
Since you feel sorry for me,
I should drink this?

235
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:16,914
You are the writer indeed.
You know what I like.

236
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,483
Again, again. It's the stage again.

237
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,378
I knew it.

238
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,979
There's no way
the writer would give me free food.

239
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,179
Dan Oh, hello.

240
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,254
Hi.

241
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,294
You didn't eat?

242
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,733
I had to do something
in the morning.

243
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:41,233
Have this.

244
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,874
- I'm okay.
- Just drink it.

245
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,274
Thank you.

246
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:49,439
I'm so thirsty too.

247
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:52,144
My role is to give this milk
to the main character.

248
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:59,124
You're always helping me, Dan Oh.

249
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,524
Thank you.

250
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,193
This is good.

251
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,103
I can't ever get used to that.

252
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,913
What is this?

253
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:35,853
Errand girl.

254
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:39,189
- Me?
- Is there another errand girl...

255
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,764
here other than you?

256
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:44,934
Let's go.

257
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,633
Hold on.

258
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:55,068
I earned that yesterday
with my part-time job.

259
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:56,969
I didn't ask you to give me
your pocket change.

260
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:59,444
I felt bad
for dirtying your uniform.

261
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,238
I should pay it back
as soon as I can,

262
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,538
so I won't have to carry your bag.

263
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:04,848
Do you think you can pay it back
until you graduate at this rate?

264
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,994
Yes. I can.

265
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,058
Hey, did you see that?

266
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,764
I didn't know she could be so bold.

267
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,913
What do you want to eat, Dan Oh?

268
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,923
I have to drink
strawberry milk today.

269
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,379
Okay, here I go.

270
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:42,454
Let's go.

271
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:45,149
- Wait up.
- Come on.

272
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,018
- What are you doing?
- Move.

273
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:50,328
- There's a line!
- Why are you cutting?

274
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,859
- Hey, move out of the way.
- Excuse me.

275
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,363
Hey, move back.

276
00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:58,143
It's A3!

277
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:03,837
It's A3.

278
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,508
- We're so lucky.
- Look at them.

279
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,714
- They are so handsome.
- It's A3.

280
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:10,113
The milk...

281
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,488
- You're so hot!
- Baek Kyung!

282
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,189
- Look over here!
- Baek Kyung!

283
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:26,563
- Hello.
- Have some milk.

284
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:29,133
- Can you look over here?
- That.

285
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,538
- Hey, A3 is here.
- My gosh.

286
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,568
That. Strawberry milk.

287
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:39,313
- Strawberry milk?
- I guess it's for me.

288
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:40,413
Give me all of it.

289
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:42,984
You're completely wet.
You should've been careful.

290
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,679
I can't even eat what I want.

291
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,994
That's odd.

292
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,823
Why is Nam Ju at the snack bar?

293
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,034
My strawberry milk.

294
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,188
Look what you did at the snack bar.

295
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,058
Why are you making
her carry your bag?

296
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:00,758
I'd like to know too. Nam Ju.

297
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,603
You don't seem like yourself lately.

298
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,573
Just because. I was curious.

299
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,038
I love this.

300
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,568
Hey, this is mine.

301
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,909
Gosh, you're so cheap.

302
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,684
You have a lot here.
I just drank one.

303
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,724
Hey, you don't like sweets.

304
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,494
Is it sweet?

305
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,133
I never said that I hated sweets.

306
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:29,264
This is good. It's nice.

307
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:31,333
(Father)

308
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:33,899
Because you failed
to win over a girl,

309
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,304
it affected the investment deal.

310
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:51,153
My gosh, this is so precious.

311
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:54,153
I will tape this back.

312
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,853
I'll destroy the writer.

313
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:59,063
You scared me for a second.

314
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:02,563
The writer ought to draw
the scenes more meticulously.

315
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:04,429
Look at that. Over there.

316
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,028
There are more than
a couple of those odd objects.

317
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:07,833
Right. And there was
another one here.

318
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,133
Here?

319
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,403
It was here before.

320
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:14,843
You know what it is, right?

321
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:17,813
You know that black space
that looks like a black hole.

322
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,083
It was here?

323
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:25,554
I definitely saw it.

324
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,078
Come on. There's no way.

325
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,663
No, my hand went
into that hole once.

326
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:34,163
Promise that you will never see
a dangerous thing like that.

327
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,393
- Promise me.
- "Dangerous"?

328
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,663
Why?

329
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:41,204
It will be too much
for you to handle.

330
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:44,573
I can't seem to handle myself
the most nowadays.

331
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,714
Ma'am, I have a question.

332
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:56,684
What is it?

333
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:59,609
I used a trigonometrical function
to get the right answer for this.

334
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,323
I was wondering if I could use
calculus to solve this too.

335
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,488
Let me solve it for you.

336
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,988
What? I got everything right.

337
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,434
Why am I asking a question?

338
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,143
Hey, you owe me again.

339
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,284
I had to ask a question
to let them flirt?

340
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,383
("Lee Ha Nee's Higher Mathematics"﻿)

341
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,853
Give this to Ju Da.

342
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:37,393
Why should I? Don't do it.
Don't do as you're told.

343
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:40,419
This is the best math lecturer,

344
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,494
Lee Ha Nee's note
for higher mathematics.

345
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,328
This is really precious.

346
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:45,464
Do that for me.

347
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,199
("Lee Ha Nee's Higher Mathematics")

348
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,328
What's this?

349
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:54,843
Nam Ju asked me to give it to you.

350
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,063
Why didn't you name me Love Bridge
instead of Eun Dan Oh?

351
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,194
Love Bridge.

352
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:20,699
My role in this story is
to be a cupid...

353
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,958
to the two main lead roles.

354
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,143
And...

355
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:29,798
get miserably ignored
by a jerk like him.

356
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:31,669
- Those two.
- We need to talk.

357
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,454
What are you trying to say to me?
No way.

358
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:41,194
I don't have any say in this.

359
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:42,949
I'll have to face him...

360
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:44,863
and talk to him
just as the writer wants.

361
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:47,964
Is this your way of protesting?

362
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,504
- What are you talking about?
- Don't pretend like you don't know.

363
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,603
You're why Chairman Eun is
trying to reduce the investment.

364
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,643
Bullying us with money.

365
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,038
Is that the way you express
your awesome first love?

366
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,568
Baek Kyung, you need to listen to me.

367
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,908
Goodness, what are you saying?
That's completely misunderstandable.

368
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:07,113
This is so annoying.

369
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:08,954
Don't jump to conclusions.

370
00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:11,224
I never told my family...

371
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,054
that you hate me.

372
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:16,123
And I won't tell them
in the future either.

373
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,294
This isn't a problem for the adults.

374
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,464
It's a problem...

375
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,264
between you and me.

376
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,088
You should be swearing at him.
Why are you crying?

377
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:29,974
Dan Oh, say it.
Punch him or something.

378
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,204
I'll talk to my dad...

379
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,673
about the investment.

380
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:38,409
Goodness, what a pushover.

381
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,754
Talk to him about what?

382
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,524
Can you go alone?

383
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,863
I'm sick of working
as your caregiver.

384
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,494
It's awful enough that
I have a heart condition,

385
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,159
but I have to keep liking him
even after he's that rude to me?

386
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,964
Because that's my character?

387
00:24:59,988 --> 00:25:01,573
What you said really hurts.

388
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:06,204
My heart is already a wreck.

389
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,544
Please stop hurting me anymore.

390
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,153
Forget about this character
that only hurts me.

391
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:23,054
Writer, I will make sure
I take it back from you.

392
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,663
Because my life belongs to me.

393
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:29,063
Hit him hard.

394
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:33,429
- Your turn.
- Hit her hard, okay?

395
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,673
Cham-cham-cham.

396
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,359
- Do it.
- Hit her hard.

397
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,373
- I've been waiting for this.
- He's going to hit you.

398
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:40,768
Forget it. Hit me hard.

399
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:42,514
- I'll hit you really hard.
- Keep it up!

400
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,969
- Come on.
- What was that?

401
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:48,954
- Are you two flirting?
- Goodness.

402
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:55,593
They look so happy.

403
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:59,063
If I wasn't aware of myself,

404
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,363
would it have hurt less
whenever Baek Kyung turned me down?

405
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,903
Would I have been happy
every single day of my life?

406
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,113
No, I still like who I am now.

407
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,744
I can change whatever that hurts me.

408
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:23,214
I will change this. I will.

409
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:33,093
What? Dan Oh,
you're cleaning up? Why?

410
00:26:33,848 --> 00:26:36,694
Aren't you Ms. Eun, who feels
comfortable in chaos?

411
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:39,903
I've been reborn today.

412
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:43,333
You're watching a historical moment
of Dan Oh cleaning up her...

413
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,097
I think something smells.

414
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:47,568
Darn it.

415
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:50,514
If you aren't going to help,
stop bothering...

416
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,913
Is that mold?

417
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,784
Right, I can see into the future.

418
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:36,853
What you saw isn't the future.
It's called a storyboard.

419
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:42,619
It's like a rough sketch
that a writer creates.

420
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,804
It includes lines
and the presentation method.

421
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:48,998
Kind of like a preview.

422
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:51,369
Whatever.
If I can see it beforehand,

423
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,869
doesn't that mean I can change it?

424
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:54,913
I can change my character
and the next scene.

425
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,714
No, nothing changes in this world.

426
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:02,883
Never.

427
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:11,663
Why doesn't he have
any dreams or hope if he's a fairy?

428
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,954
("Guardian Angel Story")

429
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,103
What was that?

430
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,333
Has Ju Da always been that pretty?

431
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,139
Goodness, it finally began.

432
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,044
The fateful moment when
the supporting actor falls in love.

433
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,754
Poor Do Hwa.

434
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:10,113
You'll have
an awfully tough time too.

435
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:18,194
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:27,673
Thanks.

437
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:55,363
(Episode 4 will air shortly.)

438
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,186
(Episode 4)

439
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:00,125
I heard you're busy preparing
your company to be listed.

440
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,426
I'm barely busy.

441
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,865
What we do is like a joke...

442
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,296
compared to your business.

443
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:06,896
Everyone knows how talented
of a businessman you are.

444
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:07,995
And you have
a great personality too,

445
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:09,541
so I have a lot to learn from you.

446
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:12,250
If you help us out a little more,

447
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,576
things might go smoother.

448
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:16,675
I doubt there's
anything I can do to help.

449
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:18,551
There are a lot of things.

450
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:23,546
Oh, I'm thinking about having
dinner with Chairman Oh too.

451
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:25,160
Chairman Oh of Serinne Fashion?

452
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,591
I didn't know you were
interested in fashion too.

453
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:30,626
Now I see...

454
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:32,355
why you've become
such a huge success.

455
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,626
Since our kids are
all in the same class,

456
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:35,156
it could be a great gathering.

457
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:36,596
What was his son's name again?

458
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:38,000
Oh Nam Ju.

459
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:40,066
You met him at my school.

460
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:43,811
Right, I heard Chairman Oh's son is
close with Baek Kyung.

461
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:45,535
When did you get this big?

462
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:47,336
It seems like just yesterday
when you were this tiny.

463
00:30:47,336 --> 00:30:49,120
You can probably get married soon.

464
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:52,245
It feels like we're a family...

465
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:53,720
to dine together like this.

466
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,061
I'll invite you
to my house next time.

467
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:58,145
The pasta that Mother made
last time was...

468
00:30:58,145 --> 00:30:59,791
really delicious.

469
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,360
Mother, my foot.

470
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,100
If you want to have
that pasta again,

471
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:11,401
come over anytime.

472
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,550
Come in.

473
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:31,291
Dan Oh, stay out of
my family matters.

474
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:32,986
Mother, my foot.

475
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:34,431
That jerk.

476
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:42,740
Why would you keep this?

477
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,841
I know. I don't understand either.

478
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,535
Look at it closely.

479
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:51,236
- You were such a brat as a kid too.
- What?

480
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:55,110
I always wondered why you never
said nice things or smiled.

481
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:58,681
But now I know
it wasn't your choice.

482
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:01,291
What's wrong with you?

483
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:07,490
What's this?

484
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:11,460
Leave it alone. It's my destiny.

485
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:13,396
Your destiny? This?

486
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:14,731
You don't have to know.

487
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,780
Right. Baek Kyung,
you better stay away from me.

488
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:25,806
What?

489
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:28,705
Keep a distance from me
at all times.

490
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:31,221
Also, don't even dream of
carrying me in your arms, okay?

491
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:32,620
Are you crazy?

492
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,821
Forget it.
You won't even remember this later.

493
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,415
Get out. Get out right now!

494
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:43,731
- I will.
- Get out!

495
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:46,930
Gosh, that jerk.

496
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:49,941
I'll be nice and eat this.

497
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:54,370
No matter how many times I tell you,
you won't understand.

498
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,201
What is she doing?

499
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,881
Ju Da is so cute.

500
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:38,306
You think that's cute?

501
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:40,851
She's completely different
from all the other girls.

502
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:42,460
Ju Da.

503
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,131
You're lucky that you fall in love
with her at first sight.

504
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:52,601
Dan Oh?

505
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:55,071
You just fell in love with Ju Da
at first sight, didn't you?

506
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:59,466
That's wrong. Considering
what happened at the library,

507
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:01,765
technically,
this is not a love at first sight.

508
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,165
That's the destiny
of a supporting character.

509
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:06,776
You're always a little late
and falls a little short.

510
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:10,050
Especially when Ju Da is in danger.

511
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:15,321
Still, some readers will like
a supporting character like you.

512
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,416
Even an extra like me is
working so hard.

513
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,830
So cheer up.

514
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:23,660
Is she really okay though?

515
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:27,330
What's with her?

516
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:37,381
She's so cute.

517
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:45,520
- Sae Mi.
- Yes?

518
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,176
Is it very painful to break a leg?

519
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:49,746
Don't get me started.

520
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:51,945
I once broke my leg
while horseback riding,

521
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:53,686
and the pain was killing me.

522
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:55,090
Is it that bad?

523
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:58,385
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how painful was it?

524
00:34:58,385 --> 00:34:59,631
I'd say it was nine.

525
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:00,926
Nine?

526
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:03,195
- No. It was 9.5.
- 9.5?

527
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:05,400
It's extremely painful.

528
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:07,741
I'm doomed.

529
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,150
All right. I'm ready.

530
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:15,676
Are you having an MMA fighting?

531
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,845
If I can't avoid it,
I should confront it.

532
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,491
Are you going to confront me?

533
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:22,491
I'll just avoid you. I lose.

534
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,160
This looks a little different.

535
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:27,186
Let me do it. Guys.

536
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:29,286
I'll clean the whole place alone.
You guys can go home.

537
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:31,255
- What's with you?
- Guys!

538
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,025
I'll clean the whole place alone!

539
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:35,655
No one should be left in the lobby!
Leave!

540
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:38,501
Judging from her determination,
I'm sure she'll be the champion.

541
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:41,410
This will do.

542
00:35:46,236 --> 00:35:49,176
As you know,
I'm officially Nam Ju's first love.

543
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:51,106
That new girl can't do this to me!

544
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,476
Of course not.

545
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:54,546
She could transfer here thanks to
Nam Ju's foundation scholarship.

546
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:55,746
She should know her place.

547
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:58,185
But she can't stop
flirting with Nam Ju.

548
00:35:58,186 --> 00:36:00,215
Gosh, this is exactly
what I saw in the storyboard.

549
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:02,530
She pretends to be so innocent.
"Nam Ju!"

550
00:36:03,356 --> 00:36:04,925
I can't stand it.

551
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:07,556
Okay. Baek Kyung isn't here.

552
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,265
Everything's fine so far.

553
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:10,970
I just need to leave this place...

554
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:15,036
Please let me move.

555
00:36:15,036 --> 00:36:16,566
Do you remember the play...

556
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:18,980
we did back in kindergarten,
"Sleeping Beauty"?

557
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,376
I played the princess,
and Nam Ju the prince.

558
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:23,546
Is that right?

559
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:25,751
The moment Nam Ju kissed me
on the lips...

560
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:28,920
As you know,
that's when our history began.

561
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:31,546
But Nam Ju doesn't seem
to remember that.

562
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:32,830
Isn't that so sad?

563
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,255
Unbelievable. Really?

564
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:35,460
Yes.

565
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:37,786
It's all Ju Da's fault.

566
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:38,926
You're right.

567
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:41,296
Am I an audience member?
Why did I say she was right?

568
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:43,965
If she flirts with Nam Ju again,

569
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,195
I'll destroy her.

570
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:47,195
Of course, you should.

571
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:49,566
Everything I say sounds so lame.

572
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:51,441
- That foxy wench.
- Nam Ju is here!

573
00:36:51,536 --> 00:36:55,704
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

574
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,705
Nam Ju!

575
00:36:57,705 --> 00:36:59,720
Look at me! Hi!

576
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,420
Hi.

577
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,931
I saw this...

578
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:16,595
In addition to having a pain
in my heart,

579
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:19,410
I have to break my leg
while trying to help Ju Da?

580
00:37:21,796 --> 00:37:24,840
Oh, no. Why is she already here?
I'm not ready yet.

581
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:27,910
Hey, Errand Girl.

582
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,745
Are you ignoring me?

583
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:33,545
Good. Ignore him and walk away.

584
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:35,590
You don't even have any bag
I should carry right now.

585
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,714
Well, that's...

586
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:38,891
I have to go.

587
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:44,385
No. You can't leave yet.
Stay a bit longer.

588
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:45,701
Wait.

589
00:37:48,796 --> 00:37:50,441
What's going on?
Is she not coming here?

590
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:48,861
Dried Squid was right.

591
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:53,631
There's nothing I can change
after all.

592
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:03,741
Dan Oh!

593
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:36,111
Dan Oh.

594
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:39,481
You were asleep for so long.
I was getting worried.

595
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,436
According to the storyboard,
I should be in the nurse's office...

596
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:45,705
and wearing a cast on my right leg.

597
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:46,790
How is your leg?

598
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,660
It's different from the storyboard.

599
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:56,861
This can't be a coincidence.

600
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:59,001
Someone must have helped me.

601
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:02,530
I've had heart problems since birth.

602
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,125
But right now, my heart isn't
pounding because of the disease.

603
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,611
Why did Ju Da have to fall over you?

604
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:10,241
It's all my fault.

605
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:12,310
I'm sorry, Dan Oh.

606
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:13,881
It's okay.

607
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:15,780
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:20,776
Baek Kyung carried you all the way here.

609
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:22,945
What are you talking about? Baek Kyung?

610
00:40:22,945 --> 00:40:26,961
Yes. As soon as you fell, he picked
you up and carried you here.

611
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:28,430
It was pretty cool.

612
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,886
Didn't I fall on someone?

613
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,926
I'm not sure.

614
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:34,770
That's strange. I'm sure...

615
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,670
Sae Mi!

616
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,235
What did you do to Ju Da?

617
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:43,680
Nam Ju, the thing is...

618
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:46,936
You should stop.
This has nothing to do with you.

619
00:40:46,936 --> 00:40:49,820
It does. You got hurt.

620
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,875
Don't get hurt
without my permission again.

621
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,621
Don't go anywhere dangerous.

622
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,430
Just stay right beside me.

623
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:02,861
Why are they suddenly being
all romantic?

624
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:06,930
Guys, I'm the one
who's actually hurt.

625
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:10,841
Gosh, it's so heartbreaking
to be an extra.

626
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:14,566
Dan Oh?

627
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:15,641
Do Hwa?

628
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:19,036
What are you doing here?

629
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:21,036
I was just passing by.

630
00:41:21,036 --> 00:41:22,636
I was checking up
on my friend who's hurt.

631
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:24,575
- Ju Da is fine.
- What?

632
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:25,751
I'm the one in trouble.

633
00:41:41,556 --> 00:41:43,426
- Hey, let me borrow your back.
- Why?

634
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:44,965
Just don't ask.
Let me see your back.

635
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:46,396
I need to find someone.

636
00:41:46,396 --> 00:41:47,495
Who?

637
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:49,735
Someone who can change my fate?

638
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:52,111
What if that's me? What will you do?

639
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,475
Go ahead. Check it out
as much as you want.

640
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:56,351
You should take a good look at it.

641
00:42:05,345 --> 00:42:07,985
Why are you drooling over my back?

642
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,060
That's scary.

643
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,930
Be quiet.
I'm taking this really seriously.

644
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:16,266
- What are you doing?
- Like this.

645
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,770
- Just like this.
- Hey.

646
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,420
You have a good back,

647
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,251
but that wasn't it.

648
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:35,650
Bye.

649
00:42:38,186 --> 00:42:39,615
If I find the mysterious guy,

650
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:41,361
the story might change.

651
00:42:41,485 --> 00:42:44,331
If I do, my fate might change!

652
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,625
You're mistaken.

653
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,141
The story changed.

654
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,800
That's enough.

655
00:42:54,465 --> 00:42:55,995
You said nothing can change.

656
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:59,410
But what I saw doesn't match
the plot of the comic.

657
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:00,950
If things keep changing,

658
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:03,581
will I be able to
be more than an extra?

659
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:06,751
I'm certain of it.
There's something about that guy.

660
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:13,361
But why are these pages empty?

661
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:16,131
Those are the pages for the plot
that hasn't happened yet.

662
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:18,761
After each stage,
a page will be filled.

663
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:20,770
I see.

664
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:23,501
That means
I must find the guy myself.

665
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:25,371
How?

666
00:43:27,495 --> 00:43:28,865
I just need three things.

667
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:31,211
Pacemaker, the sound of my heart,

668
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:33,611
and my back.

669
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:34,810
"Back"?

670
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:38,520
Don't be so surprised
when you see him in person.

671
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:41,751
I'm sure he was there.

672
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:44,121
The story changed.

673
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:47,591
- Hey.
- Seriously.

674
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:52,526
- Hey, let's go out.
- Give me a second.

675
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:54,871
Come on. Hurry up.

676
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,195
- What are you doing?
- Move.

677
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:00,971
This is the most important task
in my life.

678
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:03,780
Gosh.

679
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:06,611
Are you here to peep
when I'm changing?

680
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,280
Do you think I'm a pervert?

681
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:11,050
You saw me.
That's what you came for.

682
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:12,445
Don't bother me.

683
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:13,891
Just butt out.

684
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:19,316
What about your leg?
Are you all right?

685
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:20,530
Goodness.

686
00:44:20,715 --> 00:44:22,861
Are you trying
to make it up to me now?

687
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:24,231
You seem okay.

688
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:30,501
Hey.

689
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,341
Let me check something.

690
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,211
What's wrong with you?

691
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,375
I knew it. It wasn't you.

692
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,375
Have you gone mad?

693
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,351
If you were him,
I would feel wronged.

694
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:51,060
Bye. I think I'll be
really busy from now on.

695
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:54,331
Baek Kyung.

696
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:57,625
Where are you going?
Do you want to go to the snack bar?

697
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,731
Did you eat?

698
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:07,865
(Back)

699
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:10,581
(Classroom 1: 13 students,
Classroom 2: 12 students)

700
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:15,276
If I start with the juniors,

701
00:45:15,276 --> 00:45:17,351
I have to check at least...

702
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:20,420
10 students a day.

703
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:24,790
This is so complicated.

704
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:45,235
(Change the story,
be more than an extra,)

705
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:47,306
(change my set-up,
and establish my own fate.)

706
00:45:47,306 --> 00:45:49,705
(Be more than an extra,
change my set-up,)

707
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,950
(and establish my own fate.)

708
00:45:54,345 --> 00:45:56,121
Okay.

709
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:17,111
What was that?

710
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:18,410
Did something pass by here?

711
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:20,410
Isn't that Dan Oh?

712
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:25,981
Yes!

713
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:33,331
Bounce!

714
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:37,030
Come on!

715
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:40,656
Dan Oh, what's wrong with you?

716
00:46:40,656 --> 00:46:42,556
I'm sorry. It just came out.

717
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:43,641
I'm sorry.

718
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:45,601
That totally caught me off guard.

719
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:47,741
She's working hard.

720
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:50,780
I told her so many times
that nothing would change.

721
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,251
I get it. It's not something
she can just ignore.

722
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:56,751
At first,

723
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:58,981
everyone has expectations.

724
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:14,296
I'm so busy. What do you want?

725
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:15,355
Are you here for Ju Da?

726
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:17,026
I came here for Nam Ju.

727
00:47:17,026 --> 00:47:18,796
All right.
Don't beat around the bush.

728
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:19,895
Let's make this easy on us.

729
00:47:19,895 --> 00:47:20,966
You're bound to ask anyway.

730
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,996
You want to know about Ju Da
right now, not Nam Ju.

731
00:47:22,996 --> 00:47:24,341
You like Ju Da.

732
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:27,605
- I do?
- Don't play innocent with me.

733
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:30,420
Ask me quickly.
I have a lot of backs to check.

734
00:47:30,546 --> 00:47:32,581
Where is...

735
00:47:33,816 --> 00:47:34,891
Ju Da?

736
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:36,190
In the schoolyard.

737
00:47:39,855 --> 00:47:40,990
Hey, Do Hwa.

738
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:46,700
Did you get hurt badly?

739
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:50,000
No. I'm really strong, you know.

740
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:52,071
I was just taking a break.

741
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:55,311
I'm glad.

742
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:57,381
I was worried.

743
00:48:00,236 --> 00:48:01,311
Do Hwa.

744
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:03,480
You seem...

745
00:48:04,476 --> 00:48:06,081
different.

746
00:48:07,446 --> 00:48:10,490
You are always nice to me.

747
00:48:11,385 --> 00:48:12,891
- It's because...
- You're like...

748
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,131
my guardian angel.

749
00:48:27,395 --> 00:48:30,281
It's summer. Where did
the cherry blossom come from?

750
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:35,281
Good for you guys.

751
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,351
All right. Shall I start?

752
00:48:49,615 --> 00:48:50,831
Hey.

753
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:53,631
Hey, can you run slower?

754
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:56,900
Gosh.

755
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:59,910
I can't run with this darned heart.

756
00:49:09,276 --> 00:49:12,121
Gosh, I feel like a pervert.

757
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:15,450
Dan Oh, calm down. Relax.

758
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:29,230
Right. I can make him come find me.

759
00:49:30,226 --> 00:49:31,700
I'm such a genius.

760
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,271
Fire.

761
00:49:35,865 --> 00:49:38,135
- Here!
- Great.

762
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:39,781
- Get the inner corner.
- Darn it.

763
00:49:42,036 --> 00:49:43,250
- Hey.
- Please.

764
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:47,546
- Let's do this.
- Yes. Even the writer won't know...

765
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:49,220
if I stay under the radar like this.

766
00:49:52,446 --> 00:49:55,291
Hey, isn't our team the best?

767
00:49:55,816 --> 00:49:57,056
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

768
00:49:57,056 --> 00:49:59,230
I thought you couldn't take PE
because of your heart condition.

769
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:01,000
It's okay.

770
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:04,200
Let's go!

771
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:07,095
Please. Before the stage is over,

772
00:50:07,095 --> 00:50:09,470
someone should throw a ball
at me hard. Please.

773
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:10,980
- Please.
- Fire.

774
00:50:13,536 --> 00:50:14,811
Why aren't you playing?

775
00:50:16,335 --> 00:50:17,405
Just because.

776
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,381
I see. "Just because."

777
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,091
Hold on.

778
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:27,460
Is it that good?

779
00:50:28,615 --> 00:50:29,986
- Give that to me.
- Move.

780
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:31,986
- Come on, block that.
- Hey.

781
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:33,496
- Fire!
- Hey.

782
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:35,526
Hey, throw it over there, not here!

783
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:36,766
That was a foul.

784
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,000
- Nice!
- Over here.

785
00:50:40,736 --> 00:50:42,635
It's not good
if you drink it like that.

786
00:50:42,635 --> 00:50:44,010
Hey, pass it to me.

787
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:46,635
Hey, rest. Everyone, rest up.

788
00:50:46,635 --> 00:50:48,006
- You must use a straw.
- Let's resume.

789
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,235
Then, it's good.

790
00:50:49,236 --> 00:50:50,246
Take a deep breath.

791
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:52,321
Hey, don't. We can do this.

792
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,091
My gosh.

793
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,760
Hey, I'll get...
I'll get you a new one.

794
00:51:06,956 --> 00:51:08,101
I'm sorry.

795
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:15,010
Okay, things are going
according to my plan.

796
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:18,010
Keep flirting for a long time, guys.

797
00:51:19,335 --> 00:51:21,111
- Where's the ball?
- Move!

798
00:51:21,306 --> 00:51:23,450
Over here, I'm the one
you're supposed to hit.

799
00:51:24,746 --> 00:51:26,446
Hey, can't you see me?

800
00:51:26,446 --> 00:51:28,821
I'm the one you should be aiming at.

801
00:51:31,185 --> 00:51:33,091
- Give me the ball.
- Opposite side.

802
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:34,730
Watch out, I'm coming for you next.

803
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:41,296
Yes, you look like someone
who can throw well.

804
00:51:41,296 --> 00:51:43,000
Welcome to Eun Dan Oh's world!

805
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:49,036
- All right!
- Hit him. Kill him!

806
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:52,180
Have I always been
this good at dodgeball?

807
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:53,736
Let's go.

808
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,081
- Come on, Ban Jang.
- That's it.

809
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:16,601
Yes, that's it. Throw it hard at me.
Give it to me!

810
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:34,450
I found you.

811
00:52:55,736 --> 00:52:57,440
Darn it, that was so awful.

812
00:52:57,905 --> 00:52:59,611
Why was I suddenly summoned here?

813
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:01,950
Where in the world is Ju Da?

814
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:04,976
Hey, she's coming in.

815
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:08,351
He was right in front of me,
and I had to come here to say this?

816
00:53:13,516 --> 00:53:15,331
- Ju Da.
- Yes?

817
00:53:15,385 --> 00:53:16,824
Nam Ju is looking for you.

818
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,325
Nam Ju? Why?

819
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:20,131
No idea, you should go.

820
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:23,571
You can give me
this strawberry milk.

821
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:37,720
Darn it, I have no time for this.

822
00:53:39,645 --> 00:53:40,776
Where am I? What is this?

823
00:53:40,776 --> 00:53:43,051
I have to be on the field,
but I'm in the nurse's office?

824
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:46,291
I'm sure he's already gone by now.

825
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:49,556
Move. Get up, Dan Oh.

826
00:53:49,556 --> 00:53:50,685
What's going on in this scene?

827
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,561
Baek Kyung? Nam Ju? Do Hwa? Or...

828
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:55,470
Okay, it's Ju Da.

829
00:53:57,996 --> 00:53:59,200
Nam Ju.

830
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:00,940
Are you here?

831
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,180
What's with the door?

832
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:10,821
Hey.

833
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,075
I guess I won't be able to move
until this scene is over.

834
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:16,415
- Who's out there?
- At this rate,

835
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:17,915
I'll lose that guy forever.

836
00:54:17,915 --> 00:54:20,160
Ju Da, not bad.

837
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:22,786
You go to this school with
Nam Ju's company's help,

838
00:54:22,786 --> 00:54:24,730
and you always
hang out with him too.

839
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:26,531
Are you flirting with him
or something?

840
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:28,771
You should know your place.

841
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:31,841
Cinderella stories
only exist in books, Ju Da.

842
00:54:32,696 --> 00:54:34,266
Stop giving him pennies...

843
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:36,365
to get his clothes cleaned
in order to stay involved with him,

844
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:38,641
and look back on what you did
in there, Ju Da.

845
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:40,635
Open the door. Open it.

846
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:43,311
- Let's go.
- Open the door. Open it.

847
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:45,480
Open it.

848
00:54:45,675 --> 00:54:47,190
Open the door.

849
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:05,526
Dan Oh.

850
00:55:05,526 --> 00:55:08,210
No one is going to come
even if you cried like that.

851
00:55:08,365 --> 00:55:09,571
Don't you have a phone?

852
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:15,910
Right.

853
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:18,650
No one ever has a phone
in a crisis like this.

854
00:55:20,746 --> 00:55:21,990
Move aside.

855
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:27,260
Do you trust me?

856
00:55:30,685 --> 00:55:32,660
What? What was that? That was easy.

857
00:55:32,786 --> 00:55:36,325
Hey, I'm sorry. Nam Ju is
supposed to open this, not me.

858
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:37,500
- Wait...
- Sorry.

859
00:55:38,796 --> 00:55:41,041
Nam Ju is going to come soon,
so pretend like you didn't see me.

860
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:42,641
You won't remember anyway.

861
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:46,010
Hey, it's Nam Ju. See? I'm right.

862
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:47,535
He came here sooner than I thought.

863
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,010
Okay, I'll be leaving.

864
00:55:56,216 --> 00:55:57,990
Anyway, how did he know?

865
00:55:58,415 --> 00:56:01,190
Coincidences like that are a must
in a romantic comic.

866
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:11,801
- Nam Ju.
- Hey.

867
00:56:20,776 --> 00:56:21,851
Errand Girl.

868
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:24,920
I told you to stick next to me.

869
00:56:25,575 --> 00:56:26,851
What?

870
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:30,615
- Good riddance.
- What do you think she's up to?

871
00:56:30,615 --> 00:56:32,316
She's probably crying.

872
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:34,531
You should have seen her face.

873
00:56:35,615 --> 00:56:37,831
Hey, Sae Mi. Isn't that Nam Ju?

874
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:39,000
Where?

875
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:41,371
You're right. That's Nam Ju.

876
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:43,571
Did he save her?

877
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,900
I can't believe
she cried in front of him.

878
00:56:46,425 --> 00:56:49,410
See that?
She's crying in the perfect timing.

879
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,566
She's such a sly fox.

880
00:56:51,566 --> 00:56:53,365
She can never do anything...

881
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:56,575
unless Nam Ju gives her a hand.

882
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,806
Is she an idiot?

883
00:56:57,806 --> 00:56:59,650
I can't let things go like this.

884
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:05,490
What is it this time? That guy.
Where's the guy with the back?

885
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:08,690
What? Seeds?

886
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,561
Oh, this must be it.

887
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:15,670
I can't believe
how hard it is to find him.

888
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:24,141
Ju Da.

889
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:25,611
Hey, Dan Oh. What is it?

890
00:57:26,236 --> 00:57:28,750
These. Our teacher told me
to give these to you.

891
00:57:31,145 --> 00:57:32,551
The flower garden will
look prettier.

892
00:57:33,105 --> 00:57:34,291
Thanks, Dan Oh.

893
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:36,276
Nam Ju's errand girl is Ju Da,

894
00:57:36,276 --> 00:57:38,286
and I'm the writer's errand girl.

895
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:39,986
I've seen people run errands
for bread,

896
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:41,591
but never for seeds.

897
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:44,900
What? Is my job over?

898
00:57:47,956 --> 00:57:50,371
Make it look pretty, then.

899
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:58,405
Hey, isn't that her?

900
00:57:58,405 --> 00:57:59,910
That's her.

901
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:02,381
Nice location.

902
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:10,121
She's the main character.
I'm sure she'll figure it out.

903
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:16,591
I didn't become their cupid
according to my will,

904
00:58:17,425 --> 00:58:19,900
but I can't just pass by
even when I see something unjust.

905
00:58:36,135 --> 00:58:37,446
Nice shot.

906
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:40,375
- Sorry, my hand slipped.
- Boo-ya.

907
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,150
- Gosh, bad news.
- Good for her.

908
00:58:46,286 --> 00:58:47,960
I can't even do this?

909
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:50,291
Nothing changes in this world.

910
00:58:50,316 --> 00:58:51,430
Never.

911
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,131
Gosh, darn it.

912
00:58:55,996 --> 00:58:58,665
How come nothing goes
the way I want it to?

913
00:58:58,665 --> 00:58:59,871
Dan Oh, are you okay?

914
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:02,841
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

915
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:09,875
Wear it.

916
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,281
You can't go back to the classroom
looking like that.

917
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:13,450
Dan Oh.

918
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:17,220
I'm not looking to flirt
with the heroine,

919
00:59:18,115 --> 00:59:21,260
but should the main character
or the supporting character do this?

920
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:24,861
Thanks.

921
00:59:24,986 --> 00:59:26,801
Don't get it dirty
before you give it back.

922
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:43,750
Of course. There's no reason
for him to be here at this point.

923
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:47,250
Is his character
someone who saves me?

924
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:49,821
Why? I'm not even the heroine.

925
00:59:50,816 --> 00:59:52,021
What are you doing?

926
00:59:55,456 --> 00:59:56,561
Hey, you.

927
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,631
You've been odd lately.

928
00:59:58,685 --> 00:59:59,955
Mind your own business.

929
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:02,700
Baek Kyung, are you
making that ball or something?

930
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:04,801
Hey, it's you, Dan Oh.

931
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:07,236
Man, I'm here with a huge headache,

932
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,811
but good for you two.
You have time to play ball.

933
01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:12,740
Darn you.

934
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:30,786
- My gosh.
- You little...

935
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:32,960
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

936
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:36,200
You two would never know.

937
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:51,381
That is...

938
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:35,490
Finally.

939
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:41,730
I found him.

940
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:48,631
This time, I won't...

941
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:50,571
let him go.

942
01:02:56,095 --> 01:02:57,170
Hey.

943
01:04:15,576 --> 01:04:16,921
(Extra-ordinary You)

944
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,486
I can't believe
a guy who's as hot as him...

945
01:04:18,486 --> 01:04:19,486
is just an extra.

946
01:04:19,486 --> 01:04:20,986
Hi, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

947
01:04:20,986 --> 01:04:22,716
Next time, please remember me.

948
01:04:22,716 --> 01:04:23,986
I have a heart condition.
I had a crush for 10 years.

949
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,026
That's my character.

950
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:26,085
If we change the given story,

951
01:04:26,085 --> 01:04:27,955
you and I will both be
more than just extras.

952
01:04:27,955 --> 01:04:29,256
Let's do this together.

953
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:30,765
Do you think an extra...

954
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,596
with less of a presence
can really change your fate?

955
01:04:32,596 --> 01:04:33,796
You didn't buy that stone?

956
01:04:33,796 --> 01:04:34,966
If you write your wish
on a broken stone...

957
01:04:34,966 --> 01:04:36,935
and build up a tower with it,
it'll come true.

958
01:04:36,935 --> 01:04:39,035
Baek Kyung is a lucky guy.

959
01:04:39,035 --> 01:04:41,375
There's no one who is
as faithful as Dan Oh.

960
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,305
Nothing can ever change
in this world.

961
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:45,906
I thought you could
help me change this.

962
01:04:45,906 --> 01:04:47,320
I was wrong.
