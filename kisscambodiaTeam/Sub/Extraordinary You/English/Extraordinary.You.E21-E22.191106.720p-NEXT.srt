1
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,407
I miss you.

2
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,208
I do.

3
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:15,447
I miss you, Haru.

4
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:24,418
Haru...

5
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,338
Dan Oh.

6
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:48,908
Haru.

7
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:11,837
I missed you.

8
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:17,677
I like you.

9
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,477
What?

10
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,548
I like you, Dan Oh.

11
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:41,128
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:25,678
(Episode 21)

13
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,658
Wasn't it difficult to come
all the way here?

14
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,327
No, it must've been harder
for you...

15
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:43,658
since you had to wait for me.

16
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:45,958
I told you...

17
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:48,968
that I wasn't going anywhere.

18
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:55,808
And no matter where you were,

19
00:02:58,002 --> 00:02:59,408
that I'd find you.

20
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:05,077
I wish time would stop.

21
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:09,447
I wish the next stage...

22
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:11,917
wouldn't come.

23
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,227
(Eun Dan Oh)

24
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,167
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

25
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,637
(Dan Oh, where are you?)

26
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,977
(Dan Oh, where are you?)

27
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,982
Let go of me. I have to go.

28
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:24,582
Where are you going
in this condition?

29
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,857
To see Haru.

30
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:30,898
Dan Oh.

31
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,338
Kyung.

32
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,292
I'm ready to take my medicine.

33
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,468
Okay.

34
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:41,508
Bibbidi bobbidi boo.

35
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:51,758
I'm done.

36
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:53,888
What is this?

37
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,427
This?

38
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:58,958
My mom said all flowers
have meanings.

39
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,727
Here.

40
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:06,098
What do these flowers mean?

41
00:05:06,193 --> 00:05:07,908
"Dan Oh is stupid."

42
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:17,648
(Light pink roses mean,
"Only you know how I feel.")

43
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:25,958
(Light pink roses mean,
"Only you know how I feel.")

44
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:23,377
Dan Oh.

45
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,648
Get up.

46
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,617
- Dan Oh!
- Dan Oh!

47
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:37,083
It's been ages
since I've seen you at school!

48
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,088
I've missed you.

49
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:42,183
Hold on. You look better.

50
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,183
I do?

51
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:46,127
Seeing how your cheeks are rosy,

52
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,493
our hospital visit
helped you recover!

53
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:50,862
You're right!

54
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,123
What would you have done
without us?

55
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,537
Thanks, guys.

56
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,462
Don't you ever get sick again, okay?

57
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:58,807
- Don't be sick!
- Back off.

58
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,172
This isn't your time to join us.
Let's go.

59
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,747
Don't be sick.

60
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,402
I have so many viewers!

61
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,518
- Let me see.
- Here.

62
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,318
Catch up.

63
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,088
Dan Oh.

64
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:21,828
Haru.

65
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,537
Good morning.

66
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,657
Let's go inside.

67
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,428
Dan Oh.

68
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,627
Why can't I get you out of my mind?

69
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,198
That's ridiculous.

70
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,068
How could I like her?

71
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:40,247
She bothers me.

72
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,523
Dr. Lee told me...

73
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,863
that holding hands is good
for blood circulation.

74
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,162
It's good for your heart, your eyes,
and will make you smarter.

75
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:10,702
That's why I held your...

76
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:11,777
That's not why.

77
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:15,808
I just like it.

78
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,603
Come on, now.

79
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:23,918
- You're so straightforward.
- Haru. Dan Oh.

80
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,282
- Hello, Do Hwa.
- What's going on between you two?

81
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,928
What? What do you mean?

82
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:30,552
Count me in too.

83
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:31,822
Don't have fun without me.

84
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,767
- Wait.
- What?

85
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,637
I want the two of us to be alone.

86
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:41,863
- You...
- Well...

87
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:42,863
Right. With me,
it's just the two of us.

88
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:46,477
And if you join us,
it would be the three of us.

89
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,032
Haru sometimes gets
his numbers wrong.

90
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,007
Right. There are more things
he doesn't know than just numbers.

91
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:51,603
Take this.

92
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,072
("A Rose for You")

93
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:54,613
I got this just for you.

94
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,958
You should study
how to win over girls.

95
00:10:58,343 --> 00:11:00,017
That way, your love can blossom.

96
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,357
Shall I...

97
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:07,068
study?

98
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:08,298
What?

99
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,662
Are you all right? Oh, no.

100
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,267
Hey, you two...

101
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,737
Okay. Bye, Do Hwa.

102
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,038
- Bye.
- Let's hurry.

103
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:22,477
When did that happen?

104
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:26,048
Thank you.

105
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,617
Hey.

106
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:31,058
What just happened?

107
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:37,698
It stings.

108
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:58,318
Why did Do Hwa bring a romance
comic book out of nowhere?

109
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:00,848
No way.

110
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:04,318
There's no way Do Hwa figured out
what's going on between us, right?

111
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,458
No way.

112
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,527
That cannot be.
He wouldn't have noticed it.

113
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:11,123
Dan Oh, you didn't make
it obvious, right?

114
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:12,682
I probably didn't. I didn't.

115
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:13,828
It's all right.

116
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,993
Dan Oh, you must be going crazy.

117
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,777
How could you think about Haru
all day long?

118
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:29,048
- Don't make that face.
- For goodness' sake.

119
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,918
Who was that?

120
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,487
Don't make that face in front of me.

121
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:40,627
There you go again.
You want to pick a fight with me.

122
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:43,328
I thought it was odd that
you were being nice to me lately.

123
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:45,582
- It's odd?
- Yes, totally.

124
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:46,828
You were right.

125
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:50,838
Haru can change the stage
however he wants.

126
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:54,267
So you like anyone
who can change the stage?

127
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,377
Yes, that's right.
It started that way at first.

128
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,733
When I was with Haru,
the stage changed.

129
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,531
I wanted to change
my character's terminal disease.

130
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,617
So what then?

131
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:05,973
What will you do
after you change it?

132
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,442
It doesn't change the fact
that both of you are...

133
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,348
What? We are just extras?

134
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:13,017
Yes. That's true too.

135
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,952
I'm still an extra
and have the same set-up.

136
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:17,182
But I don't care now.

137
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:19,227
Now, Haru is special to me.

138
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,623
Remember what I told you? I'm
the classmate of Nam Ju and Ju Da,

139
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:25,098
your fiancee,
and an extra in "Secret".

140
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,838
Before all that, I'm Eun Dan Oh.

141
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,233
When I'm with Haru, I become myself.

142
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,463
He makes me the main character
every moment I'm with him.

143
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:33,832
I don't care what kind of role
I play in this world.

144
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:37,218
Haru and I are happy enough
outside of the stage.

145
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,452
- Hey, what's happening?
- What are they doing?

146
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,623
He blew a kiss with his hand.
What's wrong with him?

147
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:59,897
- Just go.
- My gosh, what are they doing?

148
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,808
- What's he doing?
- What?

149
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:05,938
I've never met a woman like you.

150
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:07,801
Really? Never?

151
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:10,718
Well, yes.

152
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:13,147
- Should I take responsibility?
- Responsibility?

153
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:16,072
My mom told me not to do things
that make me responsible for.

154
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,082
She told me to be careful
about everything.

155
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,483
Fine. I'll take responsibility.

156
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,958
Everyone, I'll take care
of him forever!

157
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,353
Hey, it's Nam Ju.

158
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:25,157
- Nam Ju!
- Nam Ju!

159
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:28,853
What was that?

160
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,123
He looks so handsome.

161
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:31,692
- Nam Ju's magic.
- Magic.

162
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,397
You said you'd take responsibility.

163
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,603
Look at this.

164
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,538
Hey, I'll tell you what.

165
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,233
- Come on.
- Look at his face.

166
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:43,503
- You keep doing that.
- Stop it.

167
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,318
Hey, I got into a fight
with guys from Class Two.

168
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:49,617
I'm sure you are aware of...

169
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:51,657
how important this is.

170
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,428
Even if you're just a shell, go.

171
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:57,527
Hold on.

172
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:00,767
I'm telling you.
I really did that yesterday.

173
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,027
You're laughing?
Is this funny to you?

174
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,422
- Your buttons are coming off.
- That's not important.

175
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:06,463
- It's important.
- No, it's not.

176
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:07,662
- It's important.
- Just stop it.

177
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:08,993
- Hey.
- It's important.

178
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:11,107
Hey, will you just go home today?

179
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,932
- Everyone, get out.
- What?

180
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,902
I just want to be alone with Ju Da.

181
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,218
Get out, everyone.

182
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,818
What is it?

183
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:29,383
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

184
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,798
Ju Da, let's talk.

185
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,497
I have nothing to talk about.

186
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:38,897
Don't just avoid me.
Let's just talk.

187
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,838
Can't they just leave the classroom?

188
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,893
What? Why are we all here?

189
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:44,233
Hey, it's Nam Ju.

190
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,902
Whatever he says
becomes a lesson at this school.

191
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,432
- It becomes a rule.
- No, a lesson.

192
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:49,432
- You're so stupid.
- Hey, Ju Da is crying.

193
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:52,572
Goodness, that witch.
She always cries in front of Nam Ju.

194
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,172
Nam Ju is naive too.

195
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,373
He can't handle women's tears.

196
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,157
Can't you tell?

197
00:15:57,312 --> 00:16:00,117
Ju Da is figuring out her place now.

198
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,798
Did you mean
everything you said to me?

199
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,468
There's nothing between us?

200
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:09,867
Nam Ju.

201
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,968
You and I don't belong together.

202
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,808
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:38,497
Here.

204
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:49,168
Go. I don't want you
to see me like this.

205
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,562
You look awful when you cry.

206
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,078
- What?
- It's not like you.

207
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,702
Then, what am I like?

208
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:56,948
You always smile.

209
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,678
I'll put a smile on your face again.

210
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,688
I said I should keep
a distance from her.

211
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:11,328
My gosh, I almost played it again.

212
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:15,167
Wait, did you just smile?
You just smiled, right?

213
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,693
Do Hwa.

214
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:19,437
My gosh, no. Don't say
that I'm your guardian angel.

215
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:24,663
Ju Da, I didn't know
you could laugh like that.

216
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:26,207
I guess I can.

217
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,348
I didn't know
I could laugh like that.

218
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:30,008
Something seems off
about you lately.

219
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,677
Is that so?

220
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,288
So you like anyone
who can change the stage?

221
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:44,023
When I was with Haru,
the stage changed.

222
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:46,828
I wanted to change
my character's terminal disease.

223
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:50,667
She liked him
because he could change the stage?

224
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,907
It drives me insane...

225
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,578
whenever that jerk
meddles with my stage,

226
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:03,107
and whenever he tries to come in
between Dan Oh and me,

227
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:07,917
and whenever she shows him
a face that she never showed me.

228
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,957
I'm about to lose it.

229
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,687
I'll make sure I find...

230
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,887
whatever you're hiding...

231
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,897
and whatever you pretend
to be clueless about when you know.

232
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:02,627
You don't seem to visit often...

233
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,098
when I'm waiting for you.

234
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,167
My apologies.

235
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,867
Let's go.

236
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:24,612
Is he your son?

237
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:27,318
I apologize for the belated
introduction. I am Jun Hyun.

238
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:33,598
I must be on my way.
Please excuse me.

239
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,397
Don't let the Prince wait too long.

240
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,933
We can't have two suns
under the same sky.

241
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:47,673
Don't you know it's treason
to contempt the Royal Family?

242
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:51,141
Contempt?
That's an overstatement, my lord.

243
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:55,687
I just wanted to know
which sun you'll choose to follow.

244
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:59,117
You led an upright life, one of
integrity for all of your days.

245
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:03,312
I'm sure many subjects will
follow your lead.

246
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:07,028
Stay away from the Prince.
This is my final warning.

247
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:12,598
You're worried about my future too.

248
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:15,137
I am ever so grateful.

249
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:20,308
He will end up
getting blood on his hands.

250
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,238
Are you that furious?

251
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,778
Are you furious to see
the crowning of the Crown Prince,

252
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,677
whose only qualification is
his royal bloodline?

253
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:07,657
What you just said is...

254
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,588
treason.

255
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,598
The palace is only filled
with His Majesty's people.

256
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:16,598
If you do not stab him first,

257
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:18,768
you will be stabbed.

258
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,667
I am considering
taking you up higher.

259
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,238
In order to do that,

260
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:29,048
you need a sturdy rope.

261
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:34,647
- A rope?
- It's Eun Mu Young.

262
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:38,088
All of the subjects, high and low,

263
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:40,687
are all Eun Mu Young's
loyal followers.

264
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:43,657
Find his weakness...

265
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:47,197
and make him take your side.

266
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,667
Would you like a drink?

267
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:24,498
If you couldn't take that drink,
how could I do that?

268
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,407
Who would even imagine...

269
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:31,503
that the Queen Dowager
would poison my mother...

270
00:23:31,503 --> 00:23:33,778
because she was afraid
to lose the King's love?

271
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,207
You are just like...

272
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:40,377
the Queen Dowager.

273
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:50,058
Including how you keep
a court lady close with you.

274
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:59,268
Your Majesty, I truly hope...

275
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:02,467
you will remain healthy.

276
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:37,937
Are you afraid...

277
00:24:38,862 --> 00:24:40,377
of Prince Kyung?

278
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:48,288
I apologize for my bad manners,
Your Majesty.

279
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,157
However, why do you think
I did that?

280
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,657
You have taken the throne already.

281
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,322
You can only leave...

282
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:01,927
once your life ends.

283
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,298
If you must,
just leave your shell up there.

284
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,467
There cannot be...

285
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,137
any mistakes in your life.

286
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:16,407
Because this throne is
the foundation of this country.

287
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:19,617
Because I am your mother.

288
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,887
Because you and I
must live our lives...

289
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,758
in peace.

290
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:13,897
Do you really think something
this amazing really exists?

291
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,493
I mean, we're in a comic book,

292
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,838
so it means everything here is
made by the writer too.

293
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,548
But the writer can't be that smart.

294
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:28,773
Were we made
by a writer who isn't smart?

295
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:29,812
Of course.

296
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:32,387
How can someone like
you and me be extras?

297
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,857
Here's my wish.

298
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,697
- What is it?
- To see a sky full of stars.

299
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:43,427
There aren't any stars
in the sky we see here.

300
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,967
I'm sure I can see that
before I die.

301
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:49,207
You aren't going to die.

302
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,978
You must have forgotten
because I seemed too healthy.

303
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:55,778
I'm terminally ill.

304
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:57,748
Dan Oh.

305
00:26:58,703 --> 00:27:00,617
We can always change
something like that.

306
00:27:01,773 --> 00:27:03,687
I told you that
I'll change your story.

307
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:11,028
The period from when a star shines
until it ceases to shine is...

308
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:14,058
just a moment out in the universe.

309
00:27:14,523 --> 00:27:16,552
Those stars have
a limited amount of time,

310
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,268
but those stars come together
to create the infinite universe.

311
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:23,008
I'm sure the end of my life has
a certain significance too.

312
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:27,137
I believe you are
that significance, Haru.

313
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,617
But it's a little sad
that I can't see these stars myself.

314
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:22,467
It must have been difficult
to find it.

315
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,092
Thank you.

316
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:27,367
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

317
00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:30,808
and for remembering my wish.

318
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:44,588
Haru.

319
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:47,187
What's on your mind?

320
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,058
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

321
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,268
If we ever see some stars,

322
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:59,498
the light must have gotten here
from a faraway place.

323
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,038
I just read in a book...

324
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:06,778
that light can travel
at 300,000km per second.

325
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,877
I think...

326
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:13,778
we have been running
toward one another...

327
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:17,088
from a place further away
than what we're aware of.

328
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,606
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)

329
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,293
(Episode 22)

330
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:43,829
I want the two of us to be alone.

331
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:46,203
"I want the two of us to be alone."

332
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,573
My gosh.

333
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:54,073
He wants to be alone with me.

334
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,443
Alone.

335
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:00,814
My gosh, where did he
learn all these lines?

336
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,453
Haru, you.

337
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:08,688
But you're too much.

338
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:10,663
You always say those things
like it's nothing...

339
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:13,834
when my heart is about to...

340
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:20,198
So this is how it feels...

341
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,303
to like someone.

342
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:25,298
I had no idea when I was
just a bridge between them,

343
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:26,639
but Nam Ju and Ju Da,

344
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:29,813
I think I'm starting to understand
why you two are so cheesy.

345
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:34,413
Eun Dan Oh,
a terminally ill high school girl.

346
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,693
I wonder how much time I have left.

347
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:44,023
I hope I can spend
all of my leftover days with Haru,

348
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:46,793
except for the pages of "Secret".

349
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:51,103
I want those pages to remain
only for Eun Dan Oh.

350
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,213
What does he want to do with me
when we're alone?

351
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:10,224
Excuse me.

352
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,754
Where's the teachers' office?

353
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:17,764
Thanks.

354
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:52,764
Found you.

355
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:54,803
Hi, Haru.

356
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,234
Hi, Dan Oh.

357
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:13,454
Haru, when you
call out my name like,

358
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,548
"Dan Oh."

359
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:18,294
It feels like my heart will burst
when it's already weak enough.

360
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,523
But it's not fair because
you don't seem that nervous.

361
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:28,164
I get...

362
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:29,963
really nervous too.

363
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,234
Dan Oh.

364
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,398
What brings you
this early to school?

365
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:38,839
Su Chul nagged at me...

366
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,599
from the morning
saying I'll be late.

367
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,039
Hey, you're the one who's at fault.

368
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,708
Hey, this is really suspicious.

369
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:44,783
What is?

370
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,354
Are you two dating or something?

371
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,454
Yes.

372
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,418
Dating? No way.

373
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:52,948
Dan Oh likes Kyung.

374
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:55,018
How can you be so clueless?

375
00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:56,048
He just said yes.

376
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:57,648
They looked at each other
like that too.

377
00:32:57,648 --> 00:32:59,958
You have no idea
what women are like.

378
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,828
- Let's go. I'm sorry.
- Didn't you see them?

379
00:33:01,828 --> 00:33:03,063
Did anyone?

380
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,204
Why?

381
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:10,773
Hey, gosh.

382
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:15,283
You're really tiny,
but you're really strong.

383
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,208
Nam Ju, have a safe trip.

384
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,939
And stay healthy. Don't get sick.

385
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,309
- Make sure you eat well.
- Are you his mother?

386
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,178
Y3 will keep Seuli High School safe.

387
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:24,619
- Bye.
- Nam Ju, stay in touch.

388
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,219
I can't believe Nam Ju is
leaving Seuli High School.

389
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:27,894
My heart is broken.

390
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,194
Ju Da.

391
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:32,533
I'm really leaving.

392
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:41,373
Nam Ju.

393
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:46,813
Don't worry about me.

394
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:51,283
I want to know
what I'll be like without you.

395
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:54,184
- You without me?
- It might be fun too.

396
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:56,124
Goodbye.

397
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,448
- Hey.
- What was that?

398
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:00,648
- What did she say?
- My gosh.

399
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:02,919
See? I told you
she doesn't like him.

400
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,549
- What did she say?
- Nam Ju...

401
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:07,388
Let's take a look at "The Stars",
a short story by Alphonse Daudet.

402
00:34:07,388 --> 00:34:09,788
It expressed the romantic love
of a shepherd boy...

403
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:13,173
who is in love with a lady
by using stars.

404
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:16,499
Everyone, think of
someone you like...

405
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,543
as you enjoy the last paragraph.

406
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:20,939
"I began to think..."

407
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:25,638
"that the prettiest
and the most brilliant star..."

408
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:29,948
"lost its way and came
to sit on my shoulder to sleep."

409
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:33,324
I want to see the stars
in a vast field like this...

410
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,363
with my beloved.

411
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,564
That's my wish.

412
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:43,304
Haru.

413
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:45,173
Haru.

414
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:51,973
Why are you staring at me?
You might poke a hole on my face.

415
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,514
- Dan Oh.
- Yes?

416
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:58,353
You must have liked the stars
a long time ago too.

417
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:06,853
Let's go.

418
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:18,334
What's that?

419
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:21,204
None of your business.

420
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,103
Man, how can you say that to me?

421
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:26,514
You became so different
in just a few days.

422
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:30,543
You were once a friend
who listened to everything I said.

423
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:33,213
Of course,

424
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:36,023
that's still your character,
isn't it?

425
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,454
You're really annoying
when you are...

426
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,494
aware of yourself.

427
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,153
Do you still refuse...

428
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,578
to side with me?

429
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:09,408
You must keep
the order of the Royal Family.

430
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:11,179
I will take you down...

431
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:12,448
to fix the wronged order.

432
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:15,023
I will protect His Majesty
to the very end.

433
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:27,973
Good for my brother.

434
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:30,603
He has so many faithful subjects.

435
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:34,273
You're the only one...

436
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:36,944
who's loyal to me.

437
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,853
That's why...

438
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,983
I'll make sure
Eun Mu Young takes my side.

439
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,824
Go find out more about Eun Dan Oh.

440
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,204
Father!

441
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:09,444
Why are you running up to me?

442
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:11,653
I told you to keep your elegance.

443
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,384
Yes, Father.

444
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:17,749
What is this?

445
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,394
You can open it inside.

446
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:21,624
Let's go inside. The wind is cold.

447
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,163
My lady!

448
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:32,804
My lady! My lady!

449
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:35,043
My lady, wait for me.

450
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:37,744
My lady!

451
00:37:58,049 --> 00:37:59,163
We have to go.

452
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:14,373
Who are you?

453
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:17,003
- You are skilled.
- Answer me.

454
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:18,568
I cannot.

455
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:20,774
Why are you following me?

456
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:24,213
- Just because.
- Answer me!

457
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,253
Because I need to protect you,

458
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,013
my lady.

459
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:11,184
Is this his name?

460
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,123
I wonder what kind of person he is.

461
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:21,034
How could I meet him again?

462
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:24,363
Should I wait at that place?

463
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:30,304
I should have told him
that Eun Mu Young has no weakness.

464
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,353
I heard it again.

465
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:49,623
Will he not come today either?

466
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:03,074
I knew she would be here.

467
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:07,074
I can see through her quite easily.

468
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,554
I must stop him.

469
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:19,123
Master.

470
00:42:22,048 --> 00:42:23,463
What are you doing?

471
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:31,363
You ruined everything.

472
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,473
Tell me why you did that!

473
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:38,103
Where is this sound coming from?

474
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,454
I knew I would not be able
to see him here.

475
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:04,733
I can see through her quite easily.

476
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:08,674
It is happening again.

477
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:32,863
Excuse me.

478
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:48,613
Are you all right?

479
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,414
They say that three encounters
mean it is fate.

480
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:57,449
You and I have already met twice.

481
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:00,393
Do you remember me?

482
00:44:03,288 --> 00:44:04,424
Master.

483
00:44:08,928 --> 00:44:10,064
Your name.

484
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:13,274
Please tell me your name.

485
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,444
We will meet again one day.

486
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,544
What is bound to happen
will happen no matter what.

487
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:34,379
The Prince is busy.

488
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:35,664
I know.

489
00:44:35,788 --> 00:44:38,363
I knew he would not like flowers.

490
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:42,064
Why is he so busy all the time?

491
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:47,704
Do you like flowers?

492
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:50,603
Yes, I do.

493
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:53,068
I knew it.

494
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,239
I am going to walk to the end
of this path.

495
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:56,544
Will you join me?

496
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,544
1, 2, 3, 4.

497
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:05,983
I have to take two additional pills
after my discharge.

498
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:52,663
("Secret")

499
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,784
You told me that I existed
before "Secret".

500
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:14,084
The forgotten memories of the past
keep coming up.

501
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,824
Every time I remember a scene
from the past,

502
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,893
a wave of emotions consumes me.

503
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:21,824
My heart aches.

504
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:25,564
I feel anxious and sad.

505
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:28,459
Even in the past,
Kyung was Dan Oh's...

506
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:29,633
Fiance?

507
00:47:31,528 --> 00:47:33,528
Our writer lacks creativity.

508
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:35,199
The writer keeps using
the same characters.

509
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,798
The settings may have changed,
but the stories are similar.

510
00:47:37,798 --> 00:47:40,214
That's why regaining your memory
is painful.

511
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:43,284
You need to stop the person
who's changing the stage...

512
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,953
even if it's Dan Oh.

513
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:52,294
Don't make the same mistake again.

514
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:55,489
- "The same mistake"?
- You are only provoking...

515
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,193
the writer by changing the stage.

516
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,064
Do you still want to keep going?

517
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:02,964
Solely because of Dan Oh?

518
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:05,004
What happened to Dan Oh and me...

519
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,474
in that story?

520
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:09,343
You two...

521
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:11,903
will never be together.

522
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:16,544
That's what the writer had decided
from the very start.

523
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,348
Ju Hwa told me...

524
00:48:28,348 --> 00:48:31,163
that Dan Oh's recent check-up result
didn't look too great.

525
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,433
Make sure you treat her well.

526
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:34,834
(Lee Do Hwa)

527
00:48:36,528 --> 00:48:37,603
(Eun Dan Oh)

528
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:46,843
(Baek Kyung)

529
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:48,843
What?

530
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:52,978
Hello? If you have nothing to say,
I'm hanging up.

531
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:54,183
Dan Oh.

532
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,084
When are you visiting
the hospital again?

533
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:59,353
I'm not sure. Why?

534
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:00,994
You know why...

535
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,088
I hate going there, right?

536
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:06,818
I do. I won't call you.
You know what? Tell the writer...

537
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,433
that I don't want you
to come either.

538
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:12,028
Do you think
I like having you there...

539
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:13,159
What? Hello?

540
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,774
Hello?

541
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:17,399
He called me out of the blue...

542
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:19,074
and asked me
when I'll be going to the hospital.

543
00:49:19,538 --> 00:49:21,314
He keeps doing things
he never did before.

544
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:23,843
Could it be...

545
00:49:26,078 --> 00:49:29,554
(The death anniversary
of Kyung's mother)

546
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:39,393
Jun Hyun.

547
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:42,264
My dear, Jun Hyun. Take this.

548
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:44,834
I almost left it here
if you didn't bring it for me.

549
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:49,969
My gosh. Your tie is always crooked.

550
00:49:49,969 --> 00:49:51,804
You're just like Jun Hyun.

551
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:54,199
The apple never falls far
from the tree.

552
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,338
He should take after
my good quality.

553
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:57,009
Why is he clumsy like me?

554
00:49:57,009 --> 00:49:58,943
I got a lot of nice traits from you.

555
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:08,224
- You're not coming?
- Well,

556
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:10,393
it's about Dan Oh.

557
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:13,189
It looks like she was very sick.

558
00:50:13,189 --> 00:50:14,863
The sicker she gets,
the better for us.

559
00:50:15,288 --> 00:50:16,959
Chairman Eun's soft spot for her
will be greater.

560
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,804
I get that
you're not aware of yourself,

561
00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:22,203
but can't you at least think like
a human being outside the stage?

562
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:24,343
What on earth are you talking about?

563
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:27,244
No wonder. That's why he treated
Mom at the hospital like that.

564
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:30,538
Do you know what today is?

565
00:50:30,538 --> 00:50:31,683
Oh, right.

566
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:34,014
I almost forgot.

567
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,679
Empty your schedule this evening.

568
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:38,453
What's today?

569
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:39,754
Goodness.

570
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,764
Today is Mom and Dad's
wedding anniversary.

571
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:46,464
Right.

572
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:48,794
Of course, you wouldn't remember.

573
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,264
You.

574
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:53,804
Don't ever utter the word,

575
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:55,828
"Mom" in front of me.

576
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:56,999
How dare you be so rude?

577
00:50:56,999 --> 00:50:58,373
What? You'll hit me again?

578
00:50:59,669 --> 00:51:01,044
It's a good day.

579
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:02,413
Why...

580
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:05,214
Why don't you try
to control yourself?

581
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:08,314
Unbelievable.

582
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:14,724
Kyung.

583
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:17,693
Kyung.

584
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:19,734
I'm sorry about today.

585
00:51:21,118 --> 00:51:22,334
Forget it.

586
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:25,703
I'm sure they are not treating you
this way because they want to.

587
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:28,203
You don't know anything.

588
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:30,943
You don't know
how I was always alone...

589
00:51:32,499 --> 00:51:34,074
outside the stage.

590
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:38,314
Just go.

591
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:45,683
I also...

592
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:47,554
know that.

593
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:51,123
Let's learn about
a traditional Korean poem...

594
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:52,659
that talked about one's feelings...

595
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:55,558
how desperate he or she sought
for love a very long time ago.

596
00:51:55,558 --> 00:51:56,663
The title is...

597
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:58,088
- "Jeongseokka".
- "Jeongseokka".

598
00:51:58,088 --> 00:51:59,603
That's it. That's the title.

599
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,328
I'm sure you guys also break up...

600
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,669
when things don't work out.

601
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:06,969
- Yes. We break up all the time.
- Yes. He does.

602
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:09,514
Right. But in this poem,

603
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,343
before there is
an impossible situation...

604
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,883
Why isn't he answering his phone?

605
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:16,423
Dan Oh.

606
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,284
Do Hwa.

607
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,578
Who is she?

608
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:21,848
She's a transfer student
in my class.

609
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:23,649
My teacher told me to give
her a tour of the school.

610
00:52:23,649 --> 00:52:25,989
- I see. Hello.
- Hi.

611
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,118
Which school are you from?

612
00:52:27,118 --> 00:52:29,403
What? Well...

613
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:30,863
I don't think she has her set-up.

614
00:52:31,788 --> 00:52:33,004
"Set-up"?

615
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:35,004
But you have a name.

616
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,969
It's time for lunch.
We should hurry today.

617
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:39,368
When they serve stir-fried
dried squid,

618
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,768
the line is pretty long.

619
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:42,268
- That's true.
- See you later.

620
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,338
- Okay.
- I like stir-fried dried squid.

621
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:45,568
Which way is to the cafeteria?

622
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:46,984
- Cafeteria?
- Oh, right.

623
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:48,984
- Have you seen Kyung?
- Kyung?

624
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:51,308
I'm not sure. I don't think
I saw him today. Why?

625
00:52:51,308 --> 00:52:52,578
He's not at your hideout?

626
00:52:52,578 --> 00:52:54,878
This isn't the first time to skip
school when he doesn't feel like...

627
00:52:54,878 --> 00:52:56,024
coming to school.

628
00:52:56,818 --> 00:52:58,224
That's true.

629
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:15,139
- Hey.
- Ma'am.

630
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:16,669
See? This is what he does.

631
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:17,969
He skips classes.

632
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:20,538
You don't know how mean he is to me.

633
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:22,484
He's such a jerk and a bully.

634
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:26,578
But seeing how he came
to see you today,

635
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,593
I guess he's not a jerk, after all.

636
00:53:37,058 --> 00:53:38,133
Here.

637
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:44,004
How did you know?

638
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:45,567
Know what?

639
00:53:45,568 --> 00:53:48,173
That it was my mom's death
anniversary today.

640
00:53:49,538 --> 00:53:51,214
She passed away
around this time of the year.

641
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:53,484
When the autumn leaves
changed into beautiful colors.

642
00:53:54,538 --> 00:53:56,953
I remember
how you cried a lot that day.

643
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:03,949
My gosh, when you were young,
you cried easily...

644
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,318
and you were pretty cute.

645
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:07,034
I don't know
how you turned out this way.

646
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,133
Dan Oh.

647
00:54:12,528 --> 00:54:13,903
I only have you.

648
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:15,474
What do you mean?

649
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:17,173
Someone who remembers me...

650
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:20,074
on the stage and outside the stage.

651
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:24,143
Gosh. Did you just find that out?

652
00:54:25,808 --> 00:54:27,984
You're the only person
who really knows me.

653
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:32,224
You only smiled in front of me.

654
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:36,764
I realized too late how precious...

655
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:47,933
Let's go.

656
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:49,828
I'll give you a ride.

657
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,903
What?

658
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:06,018
Bye.

659
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:07,193
Are you...

660
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:09,254
really going to die?

661
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:12,449
Why? You can't wait until I'm gone?

662
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:14,433
You might live
if the surgery goes well.

663
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:16,729
Don't you know my set-up?

664
00:55:16,729 --> 00:55:18,863
You believe in my set-up than me.

665
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:21,203
It's because I believe in you.

666
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,899
Fine. All right. It was a nice way
of consoling me.

667
00:55:25,899 --> 00:55:29,514
"Successful surgery".
That's quite optimistic.

668
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,484
Get home safe. Bye.

669
00:55:40,818 --> 00:55:42,054
Things aren't too late...

670
00:55:42,848 --> 00:55:43,994
between you and me.

671
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:51,304
What's happening now?

672
00:55:51,729 --> 00:55:53,759
It hurts. Gosh, what's going on?

673
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:55,899
Dan Oh, are you in a lot of pain?

674
00:55:55,899 --> 00:55:57,373
Just a bit.

675
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,443
Okay.
Your fever has gone down a bit.

676
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:04,608
You just took your medicine.
Once you get some sleep,

677
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:05,838
you'll be fine.

678
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:08,413
Don't go to school today.
Let's just rest at home.

679
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:10,009
No, I can still go.

680
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:11,724
I must go to school.

681
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:18,494
Will I end up at the hospital again
after this scene?

682
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:20,693
Haru will be worried.

683
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:22,093
Oh, no.

684
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:27,074
Hey!

685
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:33,643
You're dead meat.

686
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:43,084
Dan Oh is sick again.

687
00:56:44,179 --> 00:56:46,123
There's nothing I can do.

688
00:56:58,058 --> 00:56:59,189
Here's my wish.

689
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:01,474
To see a sky full of stars.

690
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:05,004
There aren't any stars
in the sky we see here.

691
00:57:07,268 --> 00:57:10,514
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

692
00:57:10,768 --> 00:57:13,913
and for remembering my wish.

693
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:34,734
Why am I...

694
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,343
so heartbroken?

695
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:46,714
Why...

696
00:57:48,108 --> 00:57:49,784
do I feel so anxious?

697
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,453
I miss you,

698
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:58,324
Dan Oh.

699
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,044
Hello, Haru.

700
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:32,994
How are you?

701
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:34,459
Are you feeling better?

702
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:36,288
The writer is unbelievable.

703
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:38,504
The writer got totally hooked
on my terminal illness.

704
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:42,074
Look at me. I'm so healthy.

705
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,499
Did you wait a long time for me?

706
00:58:44,499 --> 00:58:46,028
If it means I'm waiting for you,
it doesn't matter how long.

707
00:58:46,028 --> 00:58:47,714
I'll always wait for you.

708
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:53,278
(If it means I'm waiting for you,
it doesn't matter how long.)

709
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:54,338
(I'll always wait for you.)

710
00:58:54,338 --> 00:58:56,724
(I will make my own answer.
With you.)

711
00:58:58,179 --> 00:58:59,353
I'm sure this was in...

712
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:04,464
Haru. I missed you!

713
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:07,464
Me too.

714
00:59:35,278 --> 00:59:36,817
Why? What is it?

715
00:59:36,818 --> 00:59:38,494
- Be careful.
- Okay.

716
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:41,064
- Right here?
- Yes.

717
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:43,228
Can you count to 10 right here?

718
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:44,304
Okay.

719
00:59:45,028 --> 00:59:47,873
1, 2,

720
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:50,943
3, 4,

721
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:54,913
5, 6, 7,

722
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:57,413
8, 9,

723
00:59:58,169 --> 00:59:59,314
10.

724
01:00:00,108 --> 01:00:01,214
Okay.

725
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,834
It's so pretty.

726
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:29,214
They seem like real stars.

727
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,943
They're so pretty.

728
01:00:37,749 --> 01:00:39,383
It's so pretty.

729
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:45,724
They're like real stars.

730
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:53,834
Dan Oh.

731
01:00:54,058 --> 01:00:55,173
Yes?

732
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:03,814
You know,
this might be a funny story.

733
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:06,383
Okay. I love funny stories.

734
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,353
We may have...

735
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:13,193
known each other a long time ago,

736
01:01:13,518 --> 01:01:15,224
much longer than we know.

737
01:01:16,078 --> 01:01:17,689
A long time ago?

738
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:18,794
Yes.

739
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:22,393
Much longer than
what we're aware of.

740
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:25,863
What was that?
It's not funny at all.

741
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:31,873
I will do anything for you.

742
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,044
- What?
- That thing you like.

743
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:38,784
Creating your own fate.

744
01:01:39,538 --> 01:01:41,278
I'm not going to change it anymore.

745
01:01:41,278 --> 01:01:46,254
I don't think we're doing things
only as the writer wants.

746
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:48,953
I think that's why...

747
01:01:49,818 --> 01:01:51,294
you found...

748
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:54,133
this nameless me.

749
01:01:57,229 --> 01:01:58,464
From now on,

750
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,703
no matter where you are,

751
01:02:03,128 --> 01:02:04,703
I will find you again.

752
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:10,514
I think I know...

753
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:15,514
why you were my beginning.

754
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:23,994
Haru.

755
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,794
Thank you.

756
01:02:30,058 --> 01:02:33,403
Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...

757
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:36,074
And...

758
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,274
for remembering my wish.

759
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:35,084
(Extra-ordinary You)
