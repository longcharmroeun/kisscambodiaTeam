1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,299
(Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...)

2
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,405
(and for remembering my wish.)

3
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,055
Did you get hurt? Let me see that.

4
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,265
Wait, did you get hurt...

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,365
as you prepared for this?

6
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,805
What is this?

7
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,265
It's all because of me.

8
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:53,144
I'll never forget this moment.

9
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:55,244
I'll remember it for life,

10
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:56,784
Haru.

11
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,824
(Thank you for presenting me
with the most gorgeous night sky...)

12
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,065
(Episode 23)

13
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,365
You must know, don't you?

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,230
What's the end of this story?

15
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,775
Will Dan Oh end up with me?

16
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:23,505
Or will she end up with him?

17
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,639
The end of this story?

18
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,370
I'm obviously
the main character in this story,

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,844
but why does this
make me feel so awful?

20
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,984
Don't beat around the bush again
and tell me frankly.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,749
Who is that guy, Haru?

22
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:37,184
Who is he?

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,955
You already know.

24
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,090
Someone who can bring change.

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,090
Oh, that darned stage?

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,494
I can change it too.

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,665
You?

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,374
- How?
- No matter what it takes.

29
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:58,505
You're going to change the stage?

30
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,574
I lost...

31
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:05,010
everything that's precious to me
because of that.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,184
As I said, talk in a language
I can understand.

33
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:12,624
All because of you, I...

34
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,765
All because of you.

35
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:22,735
Go away.

36
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:24,904
I have nothing to say.

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,124
(I can even marry him tomorrow.)

38
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:56,664
(I will not marry him.)

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,135
"I will not marry him."

40
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,775
Calling off the engagement?

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,744
Dan Oh?

42
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,869
- I mean it.
- Hey.

43
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:09,510
Hey, Kyung.

44
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,485
- Where are you going?
- Dan Oh.

45
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,015
You'll call off our engagement.

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
What do you suddenly mean?

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,825
You'll break off our marriage.

48
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:20,820
You'll tell Chairman Eun yourself.

49
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,895
That you won't marry me
because you hate me now.

50
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:26,459
The writer may not have
the best plot,

51
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,089
but I'm going to say I hate you?

52
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,290
In front of my dad?

53
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,865
If things go as I say,

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,434
don't ever be with that jerk.

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,000
- What?
- As I said,

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,075
I'm the one
who can change your fate.

57
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,444
Baek Kyung, your partner
in this comic book.

58
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,714
I'm not a mere extra.

59
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,784
Haru, what are you doing tomorrow?

60
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,679
I mean, if you're free tomorrow...

61
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,784
and there's no stage, let's...

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,025
I mean, you know,
we went to the movies too.

63
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,395
I have tennis practice tomorrow.

64
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,365
Right, tennis practice.

65
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,600
Look at this.

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,570
The writer's story
and lines are filled with cliches,

67
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,874
but these little setups are
too detailed for no reason.

68
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,139
But the writer is pretty ignorant
on something like that.

69
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:16,714
I never see any stars in the sky.

70
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,754
I definitely don't like it.

71
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:23,750
But you gave me
a beautiful night sky as a present.

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,610
I really won't forget it.

73
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,120
Seriously. I'll never forget it.

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,625
It's okay to forget.

75
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,224
I'll remember.

76
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,635
I won't forget...

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,995
the way you were excited...

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,604
to see the stars.

79
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,500
- Haru.
- Yes?

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,234
I want to hear that story.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,275
That old story you once mentioned.

82
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,344
("Secret")

83
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,440
Do you remember this?

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,114
Yes, from the camp.

85
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,424
- They're the same.
- I thought it was a dream,

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,464
but I had a conviction
once I saw this.

87
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,734
That everything I saw
wasn't a dream,

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,130
- but what I remember.
- What you remember?

89
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,674
I gave you this as a present
in those memories.

90
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,604
I think that's why
I kept seeing this flower...

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,705
to remember you.

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,875
To wait for you...

93
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:22,515
until you find me.

94
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,560
What brings you here at this hour?

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,364
It's what you like, my lady.

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,864
These are very rare.

97
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,104
Are these from Prince Kyung?

98
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,904
Thank you. You may leave.

99
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:30,914
Wait.

100
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,950
That is odd.

101
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,885
I am talking and acting
against my will.

102
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,625
Do you want to eat these with me?

103
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,734
What I mean is...

104
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,505
They seem too much for me
to have alone.

105
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,174
Prince Kyung.

106
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,769
I have prepared these for you.

107
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,714
Thank you.

108
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,085
You should go.

109
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,125
- Sorry?
- Did you not come to give these?

110
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,250
That is right but...

111
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,349
I am a busy man at the palace,

112
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:21,395
so please refrain
from visiting all of a sudden.

113
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,964
I understand.

114
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,654
That is fine.

115
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,079
Working for the country
must be exhausting.

116
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,195
Yes.

117
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,794
About seeing
those flowers together...

118
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,645
Prince Kyung, are you forcing
yourself to...

119
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,885
I do not like you anymore.

120
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,025
So you do not need
to come here anymore.

121
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,450
- Lady.
- She must be sad...

122
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,435
from waiting for you for so long.

123
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,964
Please forgive her.

124
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,705
That is not why.

125
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,635
Father, I would like...

126
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,775
to cancel our marriage.

127
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,444
She is a headache.

128
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,245
I convinced her
to withdraw canceling our marriage,

129
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,985
but I need to do something more.

130
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,355
Right. Did she not say
that she wanted to see the stars?

131
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,525
- That is right.
- Give her gifts...

132
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:57,225
that will mesmerize her
once and for all.

133
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,995
These are from Prince Kyung.

134
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,605
Do not leave.

135
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,845
I must be ill.

136
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:20,654
Do not mind me.

137
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,755
Do you hear...

138
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,184
strange sounds?

139
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,395
Does your memory fail you?

140
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,495
Can you not move as you wish?

141
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,495
How do you know that?

142
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,095
("Trumpet Creeper")

143
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,034
Even though I can move freely,
once I hear that sound,

144
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,704
I cannot move my body as I wish...

145
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,444
and have to say things
that I do not mean.

146
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,174
And everything that is happening...

147
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,515
is drawn in that book.

148
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,255
It is as if someone is watching us.

149
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,150
We cannot move as we wish...

150
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,824
and say things that we do not mean.

151
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,180
Are you saying not everyone
is like us?

152
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,294
There are those who can remember
and those who cannot.

153
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:08,534
I can remember.

154
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,735
I remember your favorite song...

155
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:13,875
and what you wanted.

156
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,745
I also remember
what you have gazed upon.

157
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,885
So do ask me for help
if you need to.

158
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,855
You are to marry Prince Kyung...

159
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,154
which means you are important
to me as well.

160
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,284
It is cold tonight.

161
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,324
- What about you?
- I am...

162
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,595
okay.

163
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,215
Why are you smiling?

164
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,444
Because...

165
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,645
you are pretty.

166
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,694
My lady.

167
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:26,304
This is...

168
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,845
Just like those flowers,

169
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,245
I will always wait for you.

170
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,554
I will...

171
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,424
protect you.

172
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,105
Dried Squid said...

173
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:08,044
that I was created
a long time ago.

174
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,784
When?

175
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,645
A long time ago in another world
before this comic book was made.

176
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,215
"A long time ago in another world
before this comic book was made."

177
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,109
Where is that other book?
I want to read it.

178
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,525
I've never seen it either.

179
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,794
I only remember scenes
from it bit by bit.

180
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,489
What? I can't remember a thing.

181
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:32,664
I feel upset.

182
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,934
How were we back then?

183
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:37,999
- We were...
- Don't tell me just yet.

184
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,204
Let me guess.

185
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,469
I was probably a princess,

186
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,084
and you were a prince.

187
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:46,680
What? Am I wrong?

188
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,184
I guess it's similar.

189
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:57,194
I'm so curious about how we were
in that other world.

190
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,725
Were we happy?

191
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,595
Really? I'm glad.

192
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,365
All of our moments
that I remember...

193
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:06,505
made my heart flutter.

194
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,704
Haru, I believe...

195
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:16,139
that we will have a happy ending
in this story as well.

196
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,814
Yes. I will see to it that we do.

197
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,125
You didn't come to practice.

198
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,965
It's so nice and quiet
since there's no one else.

199
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,074
We can talk in private as well.

200
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,700
What do you need to tell me?

201
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,530
Do I always need a reason
to see you?

202
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,570
If it wasn't for the stage,
we wouldn't be seeing each other.

203
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,414
Come on. That hurts.

204
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,914
We've known each other
for a very long time.

205
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,140
"Haru". "Tennis team".

206
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,109
"Loyal to Kyung".

207
00:14:58,109 --> 00:14:59,454
We're friends.

208
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:02,755
Actually, you can't
really call us friends.

209
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,164
You seem to enjoy pretending
to be the protagonist with Dan Oh.

210
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,329
- Let her be.
- And who are you to tell me that?

211
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,005
I've known her for a very long time.

212
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,430
I see.

213
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,574
And it's much longer than you think.

214
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,944
Don't make her suffer.

215
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,284
Okay.

216
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,814
I'm not going to.

217
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,784
By the way,

218
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,654
you say you're changing your fate.

219
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,150
Is that true,

220
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,595
or is it just going the way
the writer intends?

221
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,465
Have you given that a thought?

222
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,475
Kyung.

223
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,914
We are in the world of comics.

224
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,015
- So what?
- We have to move and speak...

225
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,339
as the writer intends.

226
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,414
If you know that,
just follow the storyboard.

227
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,839
This all started
when the writer drew the first page.

228
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,225
The writer definitely drew me,

229
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,595
but why do I feel emotions
that the writer didn't draw for me?

230
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,265
The feeling of liking someone...

231
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,265
and wanting to protect someone.

232
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,495
These feelings weren't drawn
by the writer.

233
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,959
They were all drawn by Dan Oh.

234
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,375
She's mine.

235
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,129
We were destined to be together
from the get-go.

236
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,544
Dan Oh is neither yours
nor the writer's.

237
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,570
She's just Dan Oh.

238
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,414
The writer drew Dan Oh...

239
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,170
as my fiancee.

240
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,314
You keep trying to change
the stage or whatnot.

241
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:36,255
Think about it. Was there anything
that changed as you intended?

242
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,485
In the end, we're following
the writer's story.

243
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,780
Don't talk as if you can
actually make changes here...

244
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,920
about Dan Oh
or about this world we are in.

245
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,095
Even if the story continues
to flow as the writer's storyboard,

246
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,204
I'll try my best for Dan Oh
to the end.

247
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,629
Do you want to vanish again?

248
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:53,804
I don't care.

249
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,845
You say that we are here
because the writer drew us.

250
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,444
For me, Dan Oh is my beginning.

251
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,755
So I'll be okay
if my role ends with Dan Oh.

252
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,425
To you, she may be a mere extra.

253
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,554
To me,

254
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,894
she's the main character.

255
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,245
Sorry, I'm late. I had
to stop by somewhere.

256
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,544
It's all right.

257
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,574
By the way,
what brings you to school?

258
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Just because.

259
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,515
Did something happen?

260
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,185
We can still hang out even
when nothing happened, can't we?

261
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,985
I just thought about you.

262
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,624
I don't play the violin anymore.

263
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,965
I didn't ask you to come,
so you could play the violin for me.

264
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,894
Right.

265
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,104
Here. Take this.

266
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,745
Open it.

267
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,215
I tried to guess your size by eye.

268
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,025
Hold on.

269
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,134
They fit perfectly.

270
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,005
Wait.

271
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,084
This might be gone
when the stage is over.

272
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,655
Do you know something called
a butterfly effect?

273
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:57,364
Something so small can change
a huge fate.

274
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:00,134
Dan Oh and I tried
to change our fate.

275
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:03,235
Dan Oh wanted to fix
her heart problem,

276
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,534
and I wanted us to like each other.

277
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,304
Now, that can't happen.

278
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,775
I have no choice
but to root for you and Nam Ju.

279
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,015
Do Hwa.

280
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,915
I don't want you to root for me.

281
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,225
Why?

282
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,294
I'm not allowed to say
something like this?

283
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,624
"Someone I truly like".

284
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,435
(Yeo Ju Da, Call)

285
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,259
Then tell everything
to the chairman!

286
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,675
Tell him about Ju Da
and your secret!

287
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,604
There cannot be...

288
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,844
a single mistake in my life.

289
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,114
You're Cha Ji Hyun's son,

290
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,344
Oh Nam Ju.

291
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,739
If you don't feel comfortable
with it, just let me handle it.

292
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,584
You didn't have to come here
by yourself.

293
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,329
I'll go to the next conference
in your place.

294
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,575
No, I'll go.

295
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:36,025
You weren't interested
in the business.

296
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:37,850
You should just graduate
from school,

297
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,690
go abroad to study,
and spend money like water.

298
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,394
What are you doing all of a sudden?

299
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,890
Why? Is there a reason
that I shouldn't be interested?

300
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,205
Do you think
this will change anything?

301
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,874
You've gone mad over a girl.

302
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,840
It looks like your mother
seemed pretty anxious.

303
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,278
She even went
to visit the girl herself.

304
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,415
She did what?

305
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:05,080
Please refrain from saying things
that others may misunderstand.

306
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,054
Thanks to your foundation,
I can attend our school.

307
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,294
I don't want to cause
any misunderstandings.

308
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,034
That was why.

309
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,965
Yes, she drives me insane.

310
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,374
That's why I must be the son
of Serinne Fashion's Oh Jae Beol...

311
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,874
not to make my woman cry.

312
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,580
("Oh Hee Ju and Oh Nam Ju
Compete to Be the Heir")

313
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,509
You all know
that Nam Ju participated...

314
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:38,950
in the conference
that was held in Paris, right?

315
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,979
Really?

316
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,854
My father went
to the conference too.

317
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,465
Nam Ju went there alone
on behalf of his father.

318
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:47,195
- What?
- That's so cool!

319
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,205
My gosh. Does it mean
he'll work at the company too?

320
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,860
I couldn't approach him
as he was too perfect.

321
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,005
Now, he's someone
from another world.

322
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,945
You should at least have some sense
if you're slow-witted.

323
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,685
Nam Ju is going through
a critical phase right now.

324
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,509
- I heard that he'll study abroad.
- What?

325
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,279
Study abroad? Who told you that?

326
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,784
I found out with
my crazy good intelligence skills.

327
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,794
Nam Ju's father is sick.

328
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,090
That's why they are fighting
for the seat of the heir.

329
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,160
Nam Ju's old brother feels
threatened by Nam Ju.

330
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,465
Rumor has it that he'll send Nam Ju
abroad for his studies.

331
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,235
You startled me.

332
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,074
Goodness, poor you.

333
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,499
Nam Ju isn't here
to protect you anymore.

334
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:36,044
Ju Da, we'll take care of you.

335
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:40,208
I think she's crying.

336
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,755
Why are you crying?
You're breaking my heart.

337
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,955
I feel bad for you.

338
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,380
You thought you were
like Cinderella, didn't you?

339
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,749
But do you know...

340
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:51,425
why Cinderella was able
to marry the prince?

341
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,965
Because she was pretty?
Because she was a good dancer?

342
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,705
That's not it.

343
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:01,804
Cinderella wasn't a peasant.
She was an aristocrat.

344
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,205
You know what I'm saying, right?

345
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,515
You...

346
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:13,985
- I can't believe this.
- Has she gone mad?

347
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,394
What?

348
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,195
Will you lock me up again?

349
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,265
Hey.

350
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,505
- Has she gone mad?
- She's gone mad, right?

351
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,675
Something is definitely off.

352
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,539
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

353
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,344
Ju Da is acting a bit odd.

354
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,309
Yes. She is.

355
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,110
I've seen her water
the flowers a lot.

356
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,784
But I have never seen her
attack the flowers like that.

357
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,394
Right. Are you all right?

358
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,925
- What do you mean?
- My bro said your heart...

359
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:59,890
- Hold on.
- What?

360
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,920
Your "bro"? Stop acting cute.

361
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,360
Darn it. That's
what I call him at home.

362
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,765
I mean, my brother. Ju Hwa.

363
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,499
We have a big age gap.

364
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,799
He still calls me baby at home.

365
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,104
Darn it.

366
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:13,445
- What's this?
- No need to explain it.

367
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,039
You're the super cute
youngest son at home, Do Hwa.

368
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,569
Stop teasing me.

369
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:19,539
- Do Hwa, you're such a cutie!
- What are you doing?

370
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:20,915
You pinched me again.

371
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:24,084
Ju Hwa is worried sick,
but I'm fine.

372
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,180
I've overcome my set-up,
the heart problem.

373
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,554
And I'm enjoying
the happiest moment of...

374
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,594
Let's get the surgery, Dan Oh.

375
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,634
Surgery?

376
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,959
Surgery? Already?

377
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,405
We've done a lot of
complicated surgeries so far.

378
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:44,675
Every time,
we always got through it.

379
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,344
You trust me, right?

380
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,775
Let's talk with your father...

381
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,884
and pick a date.

382
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,185
Hey, Kyung.
You must have waited for long.

383
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,019
Why did you call him?

384
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:04,394
He didn't call me. I came on my own.

385
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,959
Dan Oh,
I'll talk to Ju Hwa a bit more.

386
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,665
You should leave with Kyung.

387
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,134
You hate coming to the hospital,
but you always come for me.

388
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:18,604
I...

389
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,144
will not marry him.

390
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,685
What? All of a sudden?

391
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,945
You'll call off our engagement.

392
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,440
What do you suddenly mean?

393
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,180
You'll break off our marriage.

394
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,150
You'll tell Chairman Eun yourself.

395
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,925
That you won't marry me
because you hate me now.

396
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,150
Dan Oh, what's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

397
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,824
I hate him now.

398
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,559
So you should stop coming
to the hospital now.

399
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,765
Dan Oh.

400
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,200
Dan Oh is in bad condition today.

401
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,905
That's not the reason.

402
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,245
Dad.

403
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,015
I don't want to...

404
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,915
marry Kyung.

405
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,249
She must feel sorry for you...

406
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,019
because she had been
in the hospital all the time...

407
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,965
getting hospitalized and checked up.

408
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,864
- I know.
- Yes.

409
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,394
I'm sorry
you had to come so far today.

410
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:28,574
Dan Oh.

411
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,945
How did you know?

412
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,840
How did you know...

413
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,814
I'll tell my dad that I hate you
and won't marry you?

414
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:41,294
Can you also see the storyboard?

415
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,054
This is more decisive.

416
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:47,465
I know something
that will never change.

417
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,059
I'm asking how you found out.

418
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,765
You shouldn't be asking.
Give me an answer.

419
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:54,175
What will you do...

420
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,334
if I already know your fate?

421
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:59,675
I now have something
more important than my fate.

422
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:02,715
Are you talking about him?

423
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:04,884
Yes.

424
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,384
I get it,

425
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:11,854
but you'll have to wait and see
if your feelings won't change.

426
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,525
Go get some sleep, then.

427
00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:33,894
(Episode 24 will air shortly.)

428
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,084
(Episode 24)

429
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:48,339
Darn it.

430
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,700
Can't you see?

431
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,244
Ju Da, do you need some glasses?

432
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,529
Did I just see that right?

433
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,074
Yes, you definitely did.

434
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,830
You're the one who needs glasses.

435
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,905
What did you say?

436
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:02,529
I don't want to clean up anymore.

437
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,029
You're here on a scholarship.
You have to clean...

438
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,839
But you don't pay for that.

439
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,670
- Nam Ju's foundation gives...
- He didn't ask me to clean up.

440
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,485
How dare you mention him?

441
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,885
Why do you...

442
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,625
bully me so much?

443
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,595
Are girls who are poorer than you...

444
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,464
not allowed to be pretty and smart?

445
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,389
Or is it because Nam Ju likes me?

446
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:25,294
- Hey.
- Don't be so immature.

447
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,334
Things are already tough as it is.

448
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:44,979
What is this?

449
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:46,215
Why are there so many people?

450
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,050
She definitely had the sneakers
I got for her.

451
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,289
- It's Nam Ju.
- Nam Ju.

452
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:56,864
- Nam Ju.
- Hey, there's Nam Ju.

453
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:59,164
- Come on.
- Nam Ju.

454
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,235
- Get him on camera.
- Nam Ju!

455
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:04,330
My goodness, Nam Ju
must be a superstar now.

456
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,429
What is this?
Why are there so many reporters?

457
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,630
They're here to cover
the famous Nam Ju,

458
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,375
like how butterflies are
drawn to flowers.

459
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,875
That's cool.

460
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,345
He does look cool.

461
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,140
The Serinne collection in Paris
received great reviews.

462
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,580
I heard there was a muse
behind this collection.

463
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,979
Can you tell us?

464
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:23,850
Tell us who your muse is.

465
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,925
Yeo Ju Da.

466
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,319
- Yeo...
- Yeo Ju Da?

467
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,149
Ju Da? That Ju Da?

468
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:29,919
Ju Da? Who is Ju Da?

469
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:30,994
My girl.

470
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,990
- My gosh.
- "My girl"?

471
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,729
I can't change the stage
like Haru does,

472
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,765
and I'm not cool like Nam Ju either.

473
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:40,075
- What was that?
- Is she Ju Da?

474
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:41,605
Over there?

475
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,015
Ju Da, I'm back.

476
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,584
- What is that?
- Goodness.

477
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:50,985
Just take pictures for now.

478
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,710
Sae Mi, are you okay?

479
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,680
What are they doing in front of me?

480
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,180
- Just take the pictures.
- You're too heavy.

481
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,094
- Just take it.
- Sae Mi.

482
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,139
Haru worked so hard for that,

483
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,710
but it's all gone after a scene.

484
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,810
The biggest charm in sculpture is...

485
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,880
that the warmth of the creator...

486
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,180
goes right into the piece.

487
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,195
If the warmth goes in there,
then so is your heart in it.

488
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,425
Who is that ancient guy?

489
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,829
Above all,

490
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:51,714
you must have a good understanding
of what you're making.

491
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,940
Even if it continues
to spin the same way,

492
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,415
you can never make
the same piece of pottery.

493
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:02,124
What?

494
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,024
This one said,
"I don't want to grow bigger."

495
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,419
How do we know
what the pottery is saying?

496
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:12,964
It's your instinct.

497
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,165
Take a look.

498
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:17,460
If you just want to
make it bigger...

499
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,259
and do whatever you want with it...

500
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,075
- Goodness.
- Oh, gosh.

501
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,370
It'll ruin the pottery...

502
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,114
and the potter will be hurt too.

503
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,239
Now, get in teams of two.

504
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:31,180
- Yes.
- Who wants to do it with me?

505
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,810
- Who's with me?
- Let's do it together.

506
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,780
- Who's with me?
- Move, I'm going with her.

507
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,380
- I want to do it with her too.
- Who's with me?

508
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,150
Man, it's you again?

509
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,725
Who wants to do it with me?

510
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,650
Who wants to do it with me?

511
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,735
Let's do it together.

512
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,594
Sure.

513
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,564
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

514
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,434
Nam Ju.

515
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,369
You're such an artist,

516
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,169
so do you want to come up
and do it here?

517
00:31:58,169 --> 00:31:59,970
No, I want to do it with Ju Da.

518
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,309
Come on, Nam Ju.

519
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,210
I understand that
you want to work with your friend,

520
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,549
but I want to show other kids
the masterpiece you create.

521
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:10,749
What do you think, everyone?

522
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,119
- Yes!
- Sounds great!

523
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,725
- No, I...
- Nam Ju.

524
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,419
I'll work with Ban Jang.

525
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,864
- Ban Jang?
- Me?

526
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:18,564
All right.

527
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:26,475
Okay, Nam Ju's partner will be...

528
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,675
(Pottery Class)

529
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,895
Kyung, will you make it with me?

530
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,225
- Go.
- What?

531
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,725
You're a nuisance, so go.

532
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,295
Okay, fine.

533
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,804
This is really sad.

534
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,304
You worked on it so hard,
but it disappeared in a second.

535
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:05,475
But you still have
the wounds on your hand.

536
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,345
This isn't fair.

537
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,985
Are you that sad about it?

538
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,514
It won't disappear.

539
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,184
The times we spend together
will continue on...

540
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,155
even after the scene changes.

541
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,350
That again! You're saying...

542
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,835
such romantic things
like it's nothing.

543
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,434
Haru.

544
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,574
Do you want to be partners?

545
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,470
Things were going so well.

546
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,539
No, I'm partners with Dan Oh.

547
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:39,614
What?

548
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,045
I want to be Dan Oh's partner.

549
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,479
Hey, the sides won't be too smooth
if you keep doing that.

550
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,795
Whatever.

551
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,890
Hey, Su Chul.

552
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,350
You're actually good at something.

553
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,564
Of course, I'll make it look pretty.

554
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,564
It's yours.

555
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,600
My gosh. Let me do it.

556
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,175
What's wrong?

557
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,114
I'll do it.

558
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,249
- Is that me?
- No.

559
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:28,395
- Roll it. Come on.
- What?

560
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,235
Is this Flirting 101 or what?

561
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,415
Knead it like this.

562
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,824
Done.

563
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,324
Please don't beat so fast.
Don't beep.

564
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,704
After we're done with this,
should we write our names on it?

565
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,954
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

566
00:35:30,749 --> 00:35:31,954
Oh, no.

567
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,454
Are you okay?

568
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,025
Yes.

569
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,465
Relax. Oh, dear.

570
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,330
This won't do. Sit on this chair
and rest.

571
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,330
No, I'm really fine.

572
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,760
My heart rate monitor is broken.

573
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,975
- That's why.
- Kyung, you don't have a partner.

574
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,155
What are you two doing? Hurry up.

575
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,665
Forget it. I'll turn it.

576
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,959
No. I'll do it.

577
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,834
Gosh. Seriously.

578
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,265
I've always wondered
why this thing bothered you.

579
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,165
Now, I know why.

580
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,734
You should think carefully
about it...

581
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,405
before something happens.

582
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:58,245
Yes. I'm at the school
because of her surgery date.

583
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,344
Hey, Dad.

584
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,515
Let me call you back.

585
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,180
What is it this time?

586
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,655
Why are you here?

587
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,080
I came to keep an eye on you.

588
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,810
Come on, I'm not a kid.

589
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,755
Of course.
To me, you're still a baby.

590
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,649
Don't say that.

591
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:16,824
Chairman Eun.

592
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,995
Oh, hey, Kyung.

593
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,234
You must've come
because you were worried about her.

594
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:26,104
I'm always by her side at school,
so don't worry.

595
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,745
Have you two reconciled?

596
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,330
Well...

597
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,369
I'm going to make sure...

598
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:35,645
she never cancels
our engagement again.

599
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,408
Don't be sorry about being sick.

600
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,580
How many times do I need
to call off this engagement?

601
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,854
I bet the readers hate my character.

602
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,194
She's all that I have.

603
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,964
I'm so grateful
that you're by her side.

604
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,175
Don't worry. I'll protect her.

605
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,795
I had a great time today.

606
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,304
I should have
given this to you sooner.

607
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,175
Do understand.

608
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,474
This scented sachet was...

609
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,915
given to me by my late mother.
It is very precious to me.

610
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,584
That is why...

611
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,155
I wanted to give this to you.

612
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,915
No one asked me to do this.

613
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:54,454
It is coming from my heart.

614
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,064
Do you really?

615
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,304
I am happy that you are my lover.

616
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,804
To me, you are...

617
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,275
my beginning.

618
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,925
My heart belongs to someone else,

619
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,135
so why can I not control
what I say or do?

620
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,474
Is it truly my fate
to get married to Prince Kyung?

621
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,304
Haru!

622
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,574
How long have you been out here?

623
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,775
Why would you risk doing
such a dangerous thing?

624
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,464
I feel like
the stars will fall soon.

625
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:37,495
Yes, my lady.

626
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,035
Since I will not be able to see
such things from inside the palace,

627
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,104
I must enjoy them while I still can.

628
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,245
Do you want to know
a secret of mine?

629
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,775
I do not want...

630
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,714
to marry Prince Kyung.

631
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,165
Why do you not ask me why
if you are his loyal follower?

632
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:14,090
I refuse to listen.

633
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,659
You know very well...

634
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:18,190
that we cannot stop ourselves...

635
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,804
from having these feelings.

636
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,844
I will not...

637
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,214
listen to you.

638
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:15,389
The past perfect is when you talk...

639
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:17,420
about something in the past
that happened...

640
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,090
much before.

641
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,765
It means it has already happened
and ended in the past.

642
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:23,790
Here's an example.

643
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,060
"When I arrived there,"

644
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,629
"the tragic stage had
already finished."

645
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,570
"When I arrived there,"

646
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,074
"the tragic stage had
already finished."

647
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:39,115
Kyung.

648
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:42,084
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

649
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,125
Answer me.

650
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,495
I'm honored that you're taking
an interest in me.

651
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,415
Seeing how the same thing
keeps repeating itself,

652
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,314
you and I have
a tenacious, ill-fated relationship.

(If there is no answer
to my beginning,)

654

655
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,330
Who hit me?

656
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,529
- Not me.
- Me neither.

657
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:32,029
Come on, it's you.

658
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:33,159
Do you have proof?

659
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,304
- Tell me the exact time.
- If it's not you, then who?

660
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,905
- It's not me.
- 1, 2, 3!

661
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,670
Hi. Those little...

662
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,145
Gosh.

663
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,425
This is all because
the writer has become strange.

664
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:52,350
"I'll protect her."

665
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,564
My gosh. Do you know that
you're talking like Nam Ju now?

666
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,334

I will declare it
on the honor of A3.

I wanted to give this to you.

672

It is coming from my heart.

00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:25,795
Hold on.
Isn't this from the storyboard?

674
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:28,194
Come on!

675
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,220
Why is the writer dying
to marry us off?

676
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,995
Aren't we in high school?

677
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:34,895
What did you see?

678
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,964
I think we might get married.

679
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:39,534
So what?

680
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,305
You were the one
who begged to marry you.

681
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,744
Right. And that's why you always
yelled and got mad at me.

682
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,139
You have to pretend
to like a girl...

683
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:49,514
that you hate for the sake
of your family business.

684
00:44:49,669 --> 00:44:51,040
I feel bad for Dan Oh...

685
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,909
who had been hurt
for the past 10 years.

686
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:55,010
She's holding onto the heart that
could stop beating any minute...

687
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,510
and onto a man...

688
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,454
who never loved her and never will.

689
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,395
That's why...

690
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:05,534
I'll try to change it
before my heart stops beating.

691
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,665
Change what?

692
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:11,204
It's enough that the writer can
boss me around with my illness.

693
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:13,974
Don't try so hard.

694
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,169
- What?
- No matter how hard you try,

695
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:18,244
it won't change.

696
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:21,244
You must stay by my side.
That's the story.

to propose to me.

What? He'll propose?

703

Yes. The storyboard I got to see
after all this time was...

The writer is really
going to marry us off.

how to feel about someone.

It's...

00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,444
Do you want to change it?

716
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,969
So Haru who follows Kyung's order
on the stage...

717
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:32,815
is the one who brings the ring?

718
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:35,909
So that's where the stage
will begin, right?

719
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:36,984
Yes. I'm sure of it.

720
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:38,949
A video of us
will play on the screen.

721
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,480
And he'll confess his feelings
with the ring...

722
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,820
in front of the whole school.

723
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,490
Kyung will do that? Not Nam Ju?

724
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,719
No one can tell
what the writer wants.

725
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,060
My gosh, I must change the stage
for the sake of Kyung too.

726
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,990
Do you think anyone would
buy this writer's books?

727
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,065
I know, right?

728
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:53,159
Wait. What was the line?

729
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,159
"Attention, everyone."

730
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,244
"I will declare it
on the honor of A3."

731
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:59,240
I don't think you are A3.
Shouldn't you be called D3?

732
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,199
Declare Three. The trio
who loves to make declarations.

733
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,340
The writer has gone insane.

734
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,345
This is lamer than the violin.

735
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,280
I always return the favor.

736
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,040
Since you changed
my stage that time,

737
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,679
I'll help you change your stage
the best I can.

738
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:11,754
We're all in this.

739
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:14,155
We can do this. Join us, Haru.

740
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,919
Okay, okay. Let's do this.

741
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:20,065
- 1, 2, 3. We can do this.
- We can do this.

742
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:38,784
Give it back.

743
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:41,454
Kyung. Did you read the whole book?

744
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,085
Did you?

745
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,060
I hope you meant what you said.

746
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,990
Dan Oh might be part of our family.

747
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,590
Can't we just live like this?

748
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,504
Please don't change anything.

749
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:03,905
I wonder what you meant
by "anything" here.

750
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,754
Whether you were in the story...

751
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,055
or you read it.

752
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,625
I don't care which one it is.
You're aware of yourself too.

753
00:48:22,419 --> 00:48:24,090
This repeating story
from the previous work...

754
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,290
and this ridiculous set-up
are enough to drive me insane.

755
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,494
This makes no sense.

756
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:29,605
You're aware of yourself?

757
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,635
How much of this world
must I accept?

758
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,805
It must've been fun for you.

759
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,675
The father who tries to sell off
his son for money.

760
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,399
A happy family
as long as I'm not in it.

761
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:43,014
I never thought about that.

762
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:44,915
If the story goes as planned,

763
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,909
I know for sure that
you'll be happy in this story.

764
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:48,984
"Happy"?

765
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,194
It's funny to hear that from you.

766
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:56,224
The writer drew your character
to torture me.

767
00:48:57,649 --> 00:48:59,694
You told me not to change anything.

768
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,895
I won't change anything.

769
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,264
I'll make sure no one does.

770
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:06,135
So pretend you don't know anything.

771
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:08,905
Like you've been doing so far.

772
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:18,044
(Seuli High School's
32nd Video Fair)

773
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:21,740
Transfer student. You're
in the broadcast club,

774
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,750
- right?
- Yes.

775
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,080
Make sure you play this.

776
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,310
I got the file from Kyung.

777
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,250
A3 knows what's best for A3.

778
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,694
Make sure you play this. Okay?

779
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,820
What are you doing?

780
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,034
Kyung, I'm trying
so hard to save you.

781
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,490
I know you. If you declare that
in front of the whole school...

782
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,699
on the honor of A3...

783
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:40,835
What are you talking about?

784
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,405
Dan Oh didn't tell you?

785
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:50,615
- Kyung. Here.
- Yes.

786
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,350
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

787
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,754
Your advice.

788
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:00,379
It helped a lot.

789
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:01,825
You told me that if you were Dan Oh,

790
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,365
you'd always want to be with me.

791
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:07,534
Dan Oh likes you very much.

792
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:22,115
I didn't to that today.

793
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,385
Someone is going
to confess his feelings to me.

794
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,510
Do Hwa and Haru
did their part, right?

795
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:32,254
Welcome to the 32nd Video Fair
of Seuli High School.

796
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,825
It's a segment within a segment.

797
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,764
- Confess...
- Your Love!

798
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:43,159
This is the highlight of Video
Fair that always gives birth...

799
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,090
to a new official couple
of the school.

800
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,500
Actually, most of the couples
who were matched...

801
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,474
through the Video Fair...

802
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,575
ended up getting married!

803
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,040
We have received a letter.

804
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,645
Let's check it...

805
00:50:56,669 --> 00:50:58,415
- with the video!
- With the video!

806
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,055
(Confess Your Love)

807
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,320
- They are not in our class.
- Yes, they are. They look familiar.

808
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
- It's him.
- Who is it?

809
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,520
Isn't that Nam Ju?

810
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,020
- No.
- Isn't that me?

811
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,865
- It's me.
- Nam Ju is handsome.

812
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,159
- My gosh.
- No way.

813
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,004
Dan Oh? Isn't that Dan Oh?

814
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:31,714
I'll take over.

815
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,355
- I have to do this.
- No, it's all right.

816
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,879
- I can't believe this.
- I have a good feeling about this.

817
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,119
Kyung and Dan Oh will get married.

818
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:42,194
Kyung must have prepared
this for you.

819
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,764
- You look great!
- Let's give it up for him!

820
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:48,835
- You look so handsome!
- Husband Baek!

821
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,565
I will declare it
on the honor of A3.

822
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,075
The writer has gone mad indeed.

823
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:58,105
Why is my body moving
against my will?

824
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:05,714
Oh, no. No. This isn't it.

825
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,385
What's that? Isn't that a ring?

826
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:12,954
It's my late mother's.

827
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,125
Dan Oh.

828
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,794
I wanted to give this to you.

829
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,434
No one asked me to do this.

830
00:52:23,189 --> 00:52:24,365
It is coming from my heart.

831
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:29,575
Kyung.

832
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,800
What's wrong? Why hasn't
the stage changed yet?

833
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,214
Did something go wrong?

834
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,444
Will you accept this ring?

835
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,240
This scented sachet was...

836
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,684
given to me by my late mother.
It is very precious to me.

837
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,184
I wanted to give this to you.

838
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,994
No one asked me to do this.

839
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:49,825
It is coming from my heart.

840
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:15,615
- Accept the ring!
- Accept the ring!

841
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,724
This time, I'll make sure I...

842
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,504
Did it work? Has it changed?

843
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:43,270
What? It's the same.

844
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,984
Welcome to the 32nd Video Fair
of Seuli High School.

845
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:47,514
It's a segment within a segment.

846
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,484
- Confess...
- Your Love!

847
00:53:50,909 --> 00:53:54,580
This is the highlight of Video
Fair that always gives birth...

848

to a new official couple
of the school.

849
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,919
Actually, most of the couples
who were matched...

850
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:01,964
through the Video Fair
ended up getting married!

851
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,030
This is exactly the same as before.

852
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,605
Let's check it with the video!

853
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,230
(Dear beautiful Il Jin...)

854
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:13,875
- What?
- What is this?

855
00:54:13,939 --> 00:54:15,300
Isn't that Il Jin?

856
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,310
- Isn't that Il Jin?
- Yes, it's Il Jin.

857
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,645
- My gosh.
- I can't believe this.

858
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:21,055
I have a good feeling about this.
They will get married.

859
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:22,780
- What is this?
- She looks great.

860
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,209
- This is huge.
- What a great couple.

861
00:54:24,209 --> 00:54:26,055
- That's amazing.
- My gosh.

862
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:35,959
I will declare it
on the honor of Y3.

863
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:37,165
Y3?

864
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:39,704
Yang Il, Yang Yi, and Yang Sam. Y3.

865
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,474
Did it change?

866
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,645
Il Jin.

867
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:46,570
Wait, is that a ring?

868
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,100
I wanted to give this to you.

869
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,944
No one asked me to do this.
It is coming from my heart.

870
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:53,555
Yang Il.

871
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,649
- That's amazing.
- Goodness.

872
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:57,754
What is it?

873
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:13,034
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

874
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:23,810
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

875
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,484
- Kiss!
- Dan Oh!

876
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,055
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

877
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:29,085
What's wrong?

878
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,555
Why did I end up here?

879
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,490
I don't have to wonder.
It's just an absurd story...

880
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,234
that a terminally ill extra
has to go through.

881
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,689
What happened?

882
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:43,734
I'm really curious.
Can this end already?

883
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,905
Gosh, it's over.

884
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,915
Man, my body aches.

885
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,740
My goodness.

886
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,944
What? Since when were you here?

887
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,085
You're up.

888
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:02,885
I knew it.

889
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,209
I stopped your weird proposal,

890
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:06,625
but I can't stop my illness,

891
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,449
because we ended up
in the nurse's office once again.

892
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:12,619
Anyway, I'm leaving
because the stage is over.

893
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,835
Where are you going?

894
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:17,504
To see Haru?

895
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:21,835
Did you want to change...

896
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,875
our story that desperately?

897
00:56:25,669 --> 00:56:27,345
I didn't want to change it.

898
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,184
I didn't want to change it.
I didn't.

899
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,655
Dan Oh.
I'm your beginning, am I not?

900
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,224
I always liked Haru from the start.

901
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:40,224
He's my beginning.

902
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,694
No.

903
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,764
You already know that...

904
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,434
we can never be apart.

905
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,165
Never.

906
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:08,585
(Characters)

907
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:26,504
It was easier
because he was an extra.

908
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,944
He can enter the stage
without the writer knowing.

909
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,744
Nothing goes back to the way it was
only because the stage begins.

910
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,810
What happens in the shadow...

911
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,080
Make sure you play this. Okay?

912
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,214
impacted the stage.

913
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,165
One last thing is...

914
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,934
a stand-in who will carry out...

915
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,165
the stage.

916
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:07,774
(Characters)

917
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,184
Dan Oh.

918
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,179
That past story I remember.

919
00:58:17,179 --> 00:58:19,754
Yes, the story where I'm
the princess and you're the prince?

920
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,294
I feel anxious.

921
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:29,434
About what?

922
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:35,075
Haru.

923
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,100
I don't care
what happened in the past.

924
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,944
That story is already over.

925
00:58:40,169 --> 00:58:42,169
Who cares what happened
in the previous work?

926
00:58:42,169 --> 00:58:44,944
We're here changing our fate
which the writer already decided.

927
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,825
I'm sure of this.
I knew it ever since I met you.

928
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,155
That you'll be able
to change my fate.

929
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:07,135
Dan Oh...

930
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,415
I'm going to die?

931
00:59:20,209 --> 00:59:21,514
Dan Oh, what's wrong?

932
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,714
One second.

933
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,325
I want to stay like this
for a second.

934
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:23,885
(Extra-ordinary You)

935
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:25,840
I don't have to be depressed
all the time...

936
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,810
just because I don't know
when my heart will stop.

937
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,280
I'm scared that I'll lose you.

938
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,149
I'm sorry for what happened
after changing the stage so much.

939
01:00:32,149 --> 01:00:34,550
Dan Oh has to get an operation
because you changed it.

940
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:35,550
An operation?

941
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,189
You know that this world is...

942
01:00:37,189 --> 01:00:39,149
moving according to the story
of that book, don't you?

943
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:40,290
It's repeating itself.

944
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,230
Dan Oh is someone
you can never protect.

945
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,830
This is the only thing I know.

946
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,990
If you die,

947
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,260
I'll be hurt beyond repair.

948
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,300
Let's get the operation.

949
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,600
You might die
if you get the operation.

950
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,139
I can feel that
I don't have much time left.

951
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:57,085
I have to change the stage.
