185
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,279
to keep me as a living toy

186
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,039
so I survived.

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,599
The children who grew up in the Ghost Valley

188
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,399
consider killing as natural as breathing.

189
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,359
Everyone thought

190
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,199
the law of the jungle was the rule.

191
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,239
But Master told me that was not the case.

192
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,159
There was a place outside called Human World.

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,799
I

194
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
was just a little kid
who entered the Ghost Valley by mistake.

195
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,519
He said one day,

196
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,839
he would send me back.

197
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,959
Not until I grew up did I realize that

198
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,239
Master had protected me so many times.

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,599
One day,

200
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,279
Master started a riot in the Ghost Valley.

201
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,159
He killed the old chief and took the throne.

202
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,079
In the following years,

203
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,039
Master killed all Ten Devils

204
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,399
and replace them.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
Then “Lunatic Wen” became his nickname.

206
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,599
Back then, I didn’t take it seriously.

207
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,039
Master became the new chief.

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,519
I was thrilled

209
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,599
because I could do whatever I want.

210
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,279
Until one day,

211
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,919
Master said he had finally completed his plan

212
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,079
and he would take me to the Human World.

213
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,559
He summoned 3,000 ghosts on Mount Qingya.

214
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,479
From now on, I request all of you to go out

215
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,039
and kill the traitors in the worse way possible.

216
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,479
Whoever gets me

217
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,399
the Glazed Armor back for me

218
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,279
will be appointed as
the head of the Ten Devils!

219
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,559
So you went out

220
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,079
to kill Hanged Ghost and get the Glazed Armor.

221
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,879
You idiot. This is just an excuse.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,199
Master only wanted to get revenge.

223
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,599
After the Zhen couple died,

224
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,279
Brother Wen was kidnapped
to the Ghost Valley, right?

225
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,759
No wonder when he met Chevalier Shen Shen,

226
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,759
he looked sad.

227
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,759
I’m sorry. You’ve been through alot.

228
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,959
Wait.

229
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,519
The ghosts killed his parents

230
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,319
and kept him around.

231
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,599
What is he grows up and take revenge on them?

232
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,759
Whoever enters the Valley

233
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,599
has to drink the Water of Lethe.

234
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,639
In that case,

235
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,199
they’ll forget the deep obsession of their life.

236
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,399
The old chief thought

237
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,599
Master had forgotten about his parents.

238
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,879
But he didn’t.

239
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,919
He has a strong mind.

240
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,599
He’s buried his hatred deep in his heart.

241
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,479
Martial Uncle.

242
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,719
Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle!

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,759
Finally, you’re awake!

244
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,679
When you were unconscious,

245
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,039
I was scared to death!

246
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,599
Yes.

247
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,759
Martial Uncle, this is...

248
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,519
Young Master Wen, I’m Jing Bei Yuan,
the seventh oldest of my generation in my family.

249
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,279
This is Grand Wizard from South Xinjiang.

250
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,559
You are so kind to come all the way here

251
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,679
to help us out.

252
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,239
Please accept my appreciation.

253
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,119
Young Master Wen,

254
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,679
no need for that.

255
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,199
Zi Shu saved my life.

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
Bei Yuan, we could catch up later.

257
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,239
Young Master Wen has been unconscious for days.

258
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,359
We have lost our advantages.

259
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,919
Perhaps Leader Zhou’s been sent to Jin now.

260
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,799
Our priority is to save him.

261
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,039
But the Window of Heaven is heavily guarded.

262
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,919
We may not be strong enough to make it.

263
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,679
This time to South Xinjiang,

264
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,719
we’ve only brought a few bodyguards along.

265
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,479
And it’s too late to call for backups.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,119
What happened to Ah Xu?

267
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,079
Young Master Zhou, please.

268
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,879
I’ve already taken the Muscle Relaxants.

269
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,439
This is unnecessary.

270
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,839
Please forgive us.

271
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,119
Let’s go.

272
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,660
[Moral Purity]

273
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,759
Prince.

274
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,679
Okay.

275
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,319
Peng Ju, you’ve worked hard.

276
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,839
Go get some rest.

277
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,959
Prince.

278
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,159
You may go.

279
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,319
Yes.

280
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,159
Let’s go.

281
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,999
Zi Shu, why don’t you come in?

282
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,990
[Moral Purity]

283
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,239
You are quite something.

284
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
I have to come to you, don’t I?

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,439
Prince.

286
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,599
The homeland has been destroyed.

287
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,439
You don’t have to keep me

288
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,439
or this sword.

289
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,359
Good sword.

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,959
It should be returned to its owner.

291
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,519
Follow me.

292
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,639
I’ve prepared you a jar of fine wine.

293
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,399
It’s the wine in the Qingluan Yard.

294
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,839
As years have gone by,

295
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,199
there is not much left.

296
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,639
We made a promise back then, right?

297
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,919
Ten years later,

298
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,159
the same people

299
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,239
in that same yard.

300
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,119
We open it and drink it up.

301
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,199
Same people?

302
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,479
They’ve all left.

303
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,479
Yun Xing went far away to the borderland.

304
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,999
Qing Luan committed suicide.

305
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,399
You poisoned Seventh Prince.

306
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,199
Jiu Xiao died in Lucheng in a battle.

307
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,439
Those who were in that yard,

308
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,439
now only you and I are here.

309
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,959
For hundred of times,

310
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,239
when I fell into dreams at midnight,

311
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,479
I went back to that flower-blooming yard.

312
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,119
Bei Yuan was playing his guqin (zither),

313
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,679
Jiu Xiao was playing his xiao (flute),

314
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,839
Yun Xing was brandishing his sword,

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,239
and Qing Luan was composing.

316
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,959
As I turned back,

317
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,719
you were by my side.

318
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,119
You were right.

319
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,679
Zi Shu,

320
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,519
our friends all left.

321
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,959
Now, there are you and me only.

322
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,439
The bond between us

323
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,599
is an entanglement of favor and resentment.

324
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,559
I don’t want to hold on to the past anymore.

325
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,439
Come back and help me.

326
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,119
Let’s wipe the slate clean

327
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,679
and start over.

328
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,679
What do you say?

329
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,959
Good wine.

330
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,959
Time is essential to wine

331
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,719
just as old friends to people.

332
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,239
I used to think

333
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,159
it’s better that you died.

334
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,239
If one wants to be a king,

335
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,879
he must suffer from loneliness.

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,599
But since I found out

337
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,759
that you appeared outside Yueyang City,

338
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,759
safe and sound
with your martial arts remaining the same,

339
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,319
I was so happy.

340
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,350
Come on.

341
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,439
Tell me.

342
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,759
What did you do

343
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,719
to the Nails of Seven Torments?

344
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,479
Even Peng Ju didn’t discern your tricks.

345
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,279
I didn’t get rid of them

346
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,559
but handle them in another way.

347
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,799
Pinning every one of the nails

348
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,119
into my body every three months.

349
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,999
This way, gradually

350
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,519
these nails would integrate
into my flesh and blood.

351
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,879
So it earned me time
surviving the meridians-broken pain.

352
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,239
Even if I finish the last nail right now,

353
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,079
I can still be alive,

354
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,519
along with the degraded martial arts.

355
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,759
Eighteen months.

356
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,919
You’ve suffered the terrible pain

357
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,479
for as long as 18 months.

358
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,959
For what?

359
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,559
If you wanted to turn your back on me,

360
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,319
you could just leave

361
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,359
without a sound.

362
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,439
Why?

363
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,399
Why did you torture yourself?

364
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,159
It was me who set this rule.

365
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,559
Those who risked their lives with me

366
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,639
did the same.

367
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,039
If I made an exception,

368
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,279
I’d be too shameful to meet them
in the netherworld.

369
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,719
Jiu Xiao’s death was an accident.

370
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,599
You think I’m not sorry for him?

371
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,959
What you did can’t bring him back.

372
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,359
If Jiu Xiao knew this,

373
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,159
he must be far more heartbroken than I am.

374
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,479
Jiu Xiao’s death was an accident?

375
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,039
Then how about my 79 brothers
of the Four Seasons Manor?

376
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,359
Did they also die in accidents?

377
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,999
A water-fetching jar
would eventually be broken against the wall.

378
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,079
A general is doomed to die
in fights against the enemy.

379
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,079
Wars are cruel.
Life and death are destined by fate.

380
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,159
It’s easy for you to say.

381
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,999
Zhou Zi Shu.

382
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,919
Don’t you forget.

383
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,639
It’s you who named it Window of Heaven.

384
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,599
You wanted to bring light into this dark world,

385
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,839
happiness to people,

386
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,359
and peace to the later generation.

387
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,199
Don’t you understand what they died for?

388
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,959
Now,

389
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,239
I’m about to destroy this decayed place

390
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,439
and build a new world.

391
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,319
How can you not be here?

392
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,479
What about Han Ying?

393
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,239
Han Ying?

394
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,279
I’m talking to you about all the people in this world

395
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,639
and the righteous path.

396
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,879
Yet you bring him up?

397
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,479
Who the hell is he?

398
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,519
A cheap orphan slave.

399
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,199
How dare he show before me?

400
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,559
Well,

401
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,199
thanks to this idiot,

402
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,119
I found you in no time.

403
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,359
But you questioned me about him?

404
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,479
Ridiculous.

405
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,919
He’s also one of the people!

406
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,359
He was only twenty-two.

407
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,679
Zi Shu.

408
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,759
You’re so ridiculous.

409
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,239
Your joke is killing me.

410
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,119
Over the past ten years,

411
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,079
countless people have died for
your so-called righteousness,

412
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,239
including those who should die

413
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,839
and those who shouldn’t.

414
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,439
Prince.

415
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,479
I’m no longer a sixteen-year-old teenager.

416
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,239
I know nothing about the peaceful world

417
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,399
that you told me.

418
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,919
I just know

419
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,079
many people died because of me.

420
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,039
Every day and night,

421
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,559
I am tortured by their death.

422
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,039
A peaceful world is built upon sacrifice.

423
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,319
They died for a great cause.

424
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,279
They died for a great cause

425
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,319
or for your ambition?

426
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,879
You ruined the wine.

427
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,079
Such a pity.

428
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,319
Zi Shu,

429
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,319
calm down.

430
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,039
You’ve taken the Muscle Relaxants for days.

431
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,439
You might die,

432
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,279
if you get too mad.

433
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,439
You destroyed the Four Seasons Manor.

434
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,839
I destroyed it

435
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,479
to offer you a chance.

436
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,399
Jin was your actual homeland.

437
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,599
You couldn’t make a decision.

438
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,079
So I made it for you.

439
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,439
I was thinking...

440
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,439
if you come back to me,

441
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,359
I would forgive all your misdeeds.

442
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,919
Ridiculous.

443
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,639
I always think

444
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,439
you are my soulmate.

445
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,999
But it turns out

446
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,719
that you’re no more than an ordinary person.

447
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,519
My soulmate?

448
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,199
You are not qualified.

449
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,039
What did you say?

450
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
Guards!

451
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,519
Prince.

452
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,519
Zhou Zi Shu, you...

453
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,759
You traitor!

454
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,439
If you dare to hurt me just a little,

455
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,519
you will die in Jin!

456
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,279
Freeze!

457
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,799
Prince.

458
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,039
I came

459
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,399
with no intention to leave here alive.

460
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,759
You pulled some tricks to the Muscle Relaxants.

461
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,479
You still have allies in the Window of Heaven.

462
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,999
Prince.

463
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,519
You are wrong.

464
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,599
I demand

465
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,679
if I die here today,

466
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,839
everyone of the Window of Heaven
must die with me.

467
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,959
Yes!

468
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,599
Prince.

469
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,599
So many years have passed,

470
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,359
yet you haven’t changed a bit.

471
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,479
What I want is

472
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,239
for Duan Peng Ju to take over.

473
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,839
If I still have allied in the Window of Heaven,

474
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,719
how could I just sit by and leave them here?

475
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,319
Didn’t I tell you

476
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,559
I just handled the Nail of Seven Torments

477
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,159
in another way.

478
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,239
I slowed down the process

479
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,239
but I couldn’t change the result.

480
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,959
I’ve lost my sense of taste and smell.

481
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,519
Any scent doesn’t work on me.

482
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,319
Absurd!

483
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,159
You knew I wouldn’t kill you.

484
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,959
You will.

485
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,759
But you would see me first.

486
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,359
As long as you are willing to see me,

487
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,799
as long as we’re in the same room,

488
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,239
I have a thousand ways to kill you.

489
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,719
Prince,

490
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,239
maybe you have forgotten

491
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,639
what our teach once said.

492
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,079
The emperor’s fury will spare no one.

493
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,399
Commoners won’t spare the emperor either,

494
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,279
yet the whole world mourn for him.

495
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,199
I...

496
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,119
I trusted you

497
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,919
even though you’re a traitor’s son.

498
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,799
You’ve been depressed after Jiu Xiao died,

499
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,399
then you left me.

500
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,319
I forgave you.

501
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,079
Even...

502
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,359
Even when you turned your back on me,

503
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,679
I still couldn’t bear to take your life.

504
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,519
What about you?

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,359
You ungrateful bastard!

506
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,519
Prince.

507
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,959
All favors and resentment between us

508
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,719
are too deeply entangled,

509
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,759
You deceived me and tried to kill me.

510
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,719
I don’t care anymore.

511
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,839
I failed the Four Seasons Manor.

512
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,639
I can’t fail the whole world anymore.

513
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,900
Ridiculous.

514
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,879
I never really understand you.

515
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,319
Zhou Zi Shu.

516
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,279
When did you become a Bodhisattva?

517
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,639
You used to...

518
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,839
Enough!

519
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,919
Kill me!

520
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,599
Kill me.

521
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,199
Others will inherit my ambition.

522
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,519
Prince!

523
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,119
Prince.

524
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,839
No.

525
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,999
Prince.

526
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,319
No.

527
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,519
No.

528
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,759
Don’t kill him.

529
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,879
Prince!

530
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,199
What’s that sound?

531
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,959
Quick!

532
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,439
Brother Cao.

533
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,479
Ah Xiang, aren’t you afraid?

534
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,279
What am I afraid of?

535
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,359
Don’t get angry with me

536
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,599
but actually on our way of escaping,

537
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,119
I was quite happy about it.

538
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,999
If we die here together,

539
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,039
you will never find out.

540
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,479
Am I the only one who smells this?

541
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,239
Someone’s roasting meat.

542
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,439
I smell it too.

543
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,559
This wind direction is not helping.

544
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,039
Guys, bring some big fans here.

545
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,559
Fan the scent.

546
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,119
Yes.

547
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,039
Little bastards.

548
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,919
Smell it.

549
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,759
You must be so hungry.

550
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,279
Scorpion King, bad news.

551
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,559
Mo Huai Yang is back.

552
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,279
He’s also brought someone with him.

553
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,679
Is he bringing along with him

554
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,279
the Jade Emperor or your dad?

555
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,079
Look at you. Coward.

556
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,559
Useless.

557
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,079
Where are my disciples?

558
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,839
Foster-Father.

559
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,799
What did you do?

560
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,039
You rascal!

561
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,079
Answer Sect Leader Mo.

562
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,039
Are you all deaf?

563
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,439
Answer Sect Leader Mo.

564
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,479
Open up. I’m back!

565
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,439
Brother Zhao.

566
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,159
See for yourself.

567
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,159
See for yourself.

568
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,719
That person...

569
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,159
Your son is so powerful, isn’t he?

570
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,079
He almost wiped out

571
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,079
our Gentle Wind Sword Sect

572
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,159
all by himself.

573
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,479
Don’t worry, Brother Mo.

574
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,639
I’ll give you a satisfying explanation.

575
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,919
You don’t fail me,

576
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,519
and I won’t fail you.

577
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,639
Today I finally understand.

578
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,479
Master.

579
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,479
Please.

580
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,719
This is not a place for you two to fight.

581
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,919
You can deal with your son later.

582
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,479
Can you ask him

583
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,719
to order those people out there to leave?

584
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,519
Did you hear what he said?

585
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,719
Make your disgusting monsters disappear now.

586
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,439
We’ll talk about this later.

587
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,199
You little barbarian!

588
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,239
Get lost!

589
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,639
Brother Cao.

590
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,399
Brother Cao.

591
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,639
Come here.

592
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,559
Brother Mo, please forgive me.

593
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,639
I, Zhao Jing, swear

594
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,999
I know nothing about it.

595
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,439
And I told my son

596
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,199
to leave you alone.

597
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,079
Blame me for not telling him

598
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,679
we had formed an alliance

599
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,159
because I didn’t want to cause any trouble.

600
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,879
But rest assured,

601
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,639
when things are done,

602
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,719
I’ll give him a severe punishment.

603
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,759
It’s unnecessary.

604
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,719
So you think some severe punishment

605
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,399
could bring back my 20 disciples back?

606
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,519
This is unacceptable.

607
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,639
Brother Mo is right.

608
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,879
I’m so sorry for what my son did to them.

609
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,839
Shame on me.

610
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,839
I’m also risking my reputation

611
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,359
to take these three pieces of Glazed Armor out.

612
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,359
I’ll be honest with you.

613
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,559
If you indeed value our deal,

614
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,999
you know what to do.

615
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,879
I know what you mean.

616
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,079
But Brother Mo,

617
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,079
my son means alot to me.

618
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,599
I’m counting on him to take care of many things.

619
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,999
How about this?

620
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,199
I always keep my promises.

621
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,479
I must double the compensation.

622
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,039
I will give you a satisfied explanation...

623
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,039
Today, because of your son,

624
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,359
everybody knows

625
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,799
I’m working with you, Scorpion King,

626
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,999
and the Ghost Valley.

627
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,959
How can I teach my disciples now?

628
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,839
I got it.

629
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,959
When things are done,

630
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,839
I’ll kill my son myself.

631
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,479
Traitor, what did you do to Prince?

632
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,439
Zhou Zi Shu.

633
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,399
The Prince treated you so well.

634
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,679
Even now, he didn’t want to kill you.

635
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,519
But you didn’t show any gratitude.

636
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,039
The internal injury he has

637
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,479
was caused by a unique skill of my sect,

638
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,999
which is called Freezing Aroma Palm.

639
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,559
His heart meridians got hurt badly.

640
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,439
He has to lie in bed from now on.

641
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,119
Only my sect’s martial arts can fix him.

642
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,079
But only one man knows

643
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,959
how to do it.

644
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,079
Guess who he is.

645
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,070
Cut the crap!

646
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,239
What do you want in exchange of saving the Prince?

647
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,030
Spit it out!

648
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,719
Peng Ju.

649
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,919
You thought

650
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,079
I only hit him with my palm

651
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,679
because I went easy on him?

652
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,599
I’m so sad

653
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,319
that you know nothing about me

654
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,359
even after you worked for me for so many years.

655
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,079
Zhou Zi Shu.

656
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,119
You can’t threaten the Prince.

657
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,679
If you do not cure him,

658
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,119
other highly-skilled doctors can.

659
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,679
I will risk my life

660
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,279
to beg him to cut you

661
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,799
into pieces.

662
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,199
Peng Ju.

663
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,679
You really scared me like this.

664
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,839
Kill me!

665
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,799
Kill me!

666
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,719
Then he will die as well.

667
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,879
At worst, I will die first

668
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,839
and wait for him in the netherworld.

669
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,559
You...

670
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,719
Shame on you!

671
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,159
You wouldn’t think

672
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,519
I ran the Window of Heaven

673
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,679
with my integrity, would you?

674
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,610
Great!

675
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Great!

676
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,039
Leader Zhou, we’ll see.

677
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,639
We’ll see!

678
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,479
Okay, let’s do that.

679
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,439
Fine by me.

680
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,679
