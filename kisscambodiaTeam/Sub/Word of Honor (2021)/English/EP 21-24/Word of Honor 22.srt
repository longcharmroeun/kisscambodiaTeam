to identify the collusion
between Gao Chong and the Ghost Valley

118

At first,

119

I thought he was just an ordinary disciple.

But unexpectedly,

121
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,760
he was engaged
to Gao Chong's only daughter.

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,440
So he will inherit Gao Chong's wealth
in the future,

123
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,720
and also the position of
martial artists world's chief.

124
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
I can't figure out

125
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
the one behind him

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,160
using what kind of bribes

127
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,560
to subvert him.

128
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,920
Maybe we are wrong.

129
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,000
He might tell the truth.

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
He really wants to
place righteousness above family loyalty.

131
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
No way.

132
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Now that Cheng Ling had handed over
the  Glazed Armor,

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,960
he is useless to Gao Chong.

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,720
He wouldn't use such a big chip
as his only daughter

135
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,520
to woo an orphan.

136
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,680
He has since announced this
at the Martial Arts Conference,

137
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,760
he can't go back on his words.

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,720
It's quite easy to go back.

139
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,560

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,840
Watch out, Ah Xiang.

187
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,640
Four for the left. Seven for the right.

188
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,160
Two and four for the shoulder.

189
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,480
Six and eight for the foot.

190
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,440
Idiot,

191
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
you've improved a lot.

192
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,760
Continue your Swift Moving Steps,

193
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,720
and don't get caught by them.

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,040
-Watch out.
-Watch out.

195
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,720
Are you stupid?
Why are you going inside?

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
It's not my intention.

197
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,520
Master told me so.

198
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,440
Who asked you to help?

199
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,640
You are not good. It's unhelpful.

200
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Leader Shen，

201
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,240
It's a scorpion's tail thorn. It's poisonous.

202
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,560
If you trust me,

203
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,320
take this medicine
internally and externally.

204
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,560
If you don't, it's ok.

205
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,080
Thank you.

206
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
At the Heroes Conference, you two

207
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,240
helped my big brother

208
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,720
and saved my nephew.

209
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,280
That's a lot to me.

210
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
And now I got your medicine.

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,840
I will definitely requite the favor one day.

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
It's rare.

213
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,200
You still remember
the big brother Gao Chong.

214
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,160
Lao Wen,

215
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,160
he was once my big brother,

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,480
he will always be my big brother.

217
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,720
Master Wen.

218
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,880
Master Zhou,
where is my nephew Cheng Ling?

219
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,560
He is around here.

220
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,720
The Scorpion Assassins are so ruthless

221
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,960
that they might be in danger, too.

222
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Let's have a look without further ado.

223
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,350
Murder!

224
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,680
Run!

225
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,910
[Penglai Inn]

226
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,440
Murderer!

227
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,520
Elderly, move.

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,480
Please don't kill me. Please.

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,160
Please don't kill me. Please.

230
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,880
Help, young man.

231
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,880
Ah Xiang,

232
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
he is just an old beggar.

233
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,040
Why did you kill him?

234
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,960
So what?

235
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,840
Over there.

236
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,760
Let's go.

237
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,880
Go.

238
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,760
-Master.
-Master.

239
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
Here.

240
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,360
Master.

241
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,440
Lao Wen, don't kill all.

242
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,800
It's too late.

243
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,240
Cheng Ling.

244
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
Silly girl, I was the one to kill.

245
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,360
Why are you covered in blood?

246
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,760
It's someone else's.

247
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
Cheng Ling.

248
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,920
Uncle Shen, why are you here?

249
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,040
It's a long story.

250
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,640
Wei Ning,

251
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
how did you get together?

252
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,160
Master Shen,

253
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
it's also a long story.

254
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,920
Come on.

255
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,840
Don't be so sentimental.

256
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,800
Ah Xiang, why are you so angry?

257
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,440
Go. Just go.

258
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,080
Go. Go.

259
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,520
Answer my question.

260
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
Is it wrong of me to kill the beggar?

261
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,160
If I didn't kill him,

262
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,840
he would kill me.

263
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,760
But he may not.

264
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,080
He may not kill you.

265
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,600
But what if he does?

266
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,080
Chevalier Cao, I am not like you

267
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,520
always having masters

268
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,480
and senior

269
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
around you.

270
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Where I grew up,

271
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
people always kill each other.

272
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,000
Even if there's a one in 100 chance,

273
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,440
I'd better kill the wrong guy
than let him go.

274
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,880
If it is not so,

275
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,560
I wouldn't be alive today.

276
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
Ah Xiang, I'm not blaming you.

277
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
I don't think you did it wrong.

278
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
I am just afraid
that if that old beggar

279
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,000
is a normal person,

280
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,280
you will feel sorry
to kill the wrong guy.

281
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,000
Bullshit.

282
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm not hypocritical like you.

283
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,960
There is nothing for me to feel sorry for.

284
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,320
If he is the wrong guy, that's ok.

285
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,920
Ah Xiang, you will definitely be sorry.

286
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,200
You will.

287
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,800
You are a good person.

288
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,280
How can you not be sad, right?

289
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,360
How do you know that?

290
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,320
Ah Xiang, I know you best.

291
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
You never told me

292
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,360
about your childhood.

293
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,320
You mentioned where you grew up
just now.

294
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Ah Xiang, why is the place you grew up

295
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,960
so difficult?

296
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,800
You know nothing.

297
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Ah Xiang.

298
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,880
Cheng Ling, since you came to
the Five Lakes Alliance,

299
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,280
I haven't treated you well.

300
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,680
Are you mad at me?

301
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,800
No,

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,200
if you are mad at me,
I won't blame you.

303
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,520
It's useless for me to explain now.

304
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,520
But I still want you to know

305
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,880
that I don't hate you.

306
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
It's just that
when your brothers were young,

307
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
there was a deep friendship
between our five brothers.

308
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,400
I held and played with your brothers.

309
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
Every time I see you,

310
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
I always think about them.

311
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,960
I kinda wish

312
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,240
they were still alive.

313
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
There's nothing wrong with that.

314
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
If God would let me

315
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,840
die for my brothers,

316
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,190
I will be very grateful.

317
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,800
But I, the most useless one, survived.

318
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,960
Cheng Ling, sit down.

319
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
Do you know that

320
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,720
you look like your father the most?

321
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,320
Similar appearance and personality.

322
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,320
Your father is really pure and filial.

323
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,400
Among our five brothers,

324
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,920
he is the kindest and the most honest.

325
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,120
Really?

326
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,840
Dad is not as stupid as I am, right?

327
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
He is such a chevalier.

328
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,480
They say I'm weak

329
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,000
and will never make it big.

330
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,360
No, like father like son.

331
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,120
Master.

332
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,440
Cheng Ling,
when did you learn from Master Zhou?

333
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,520
Master Zhou,

334
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,240
thanks for helping my nephew
again and again.

335
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
You are a major benefactor
to the Five Lakes Alliance.

336
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,240
I really don't know how to thank you.

337
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,160
No need to thank me.

338
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,320
You just need to answer a few questions.

339
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
Why did you say this?

340
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,060
You have some questions.

341
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Of course I can tell you all I know.

342
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,180
Cheng Ling, you go first.

343
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,700
Okay.

344
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
Uncle Shen, let's make a deal first

345
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,660
you can choose
to answer the question or not.

346
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,140
But don't lie to me.

347
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,140
Among my father and you,

348
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
there seems to be some mistake.

349
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,580
Senior Deng Kuan said
Uncle Gao united the Ghost Valley

350
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,620
to murder my father.

351
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,580
What the hell is going on?

352
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,860
Kid, I swear to God.

353
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,620
Your Uncle Gao would die himself

354
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,220
rather than hurting your father.

355
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,020
No matter what kind of misunderstanding
is among us,

356
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,620
Uncle Gao loves your father the most.

357
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,420
You know.

358
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,340
He wants you to marry Xiao Lian，

359
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,500
so that you will be
a master of both martial arts,

360
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
revive the Mirror Lake Sword Sect，

361
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,020
and become a great chevalier.

362
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,660
Then naturally

363
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,300
you will be the chief
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

364
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,500
But I don't want these.

365
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,460
Leader Shen,

366
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,500
do you know Deng Kuan?

367
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,900
I know him since he was young.

368
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,740
At the Heroes Conference,

369
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,820
is Deng Kuan's accusation against
his master

370
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,940
true?

371
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,900
No, it's not.

372
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,180
Hearts lie between bellies.

373
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,540
How do you know that?

374
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,740
Twenty years ago,

375
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,180
my big brother suggested that
we should destroy the Glazed Armor

376
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,860
or expose everything to the public

377
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,460
to accept the sanction of the public.

378
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,380
The rest of us were up in arms.

379
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,540
What's more,

380
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,340
if my big brother wants
to rob my third brother Lu Tai Chong

381
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,380
and fourth brother
Zhang Yu Sen's Glazed Armor,

382
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,900
there is no need for him to endure
for so many years.

383
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
And I, if he asks,

384
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,540
I will give the Glazed Armor

385
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,860
to him.

386
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,580
As for my second brother, he is weak.

387
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,300
Leader Shen,

388
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,820
I have another question.

389
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,740
It's said that

390
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,220
the water from the Five Lakes
gathers around the World;

391
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,820
who else deserves the supremacy
in the martial arts world?

392
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,740
Everyone thought it was Chief Gao

393
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,820
who spread it

394
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,860
to seize the position
of the chief of the martial arts world,

395
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,660
My big brother didn't do it.

396
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,820
Although he is a man of few words,

397
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,420
he values brotherhood

398
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,020
more than anything.

399
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,620
The only thing
that transcends brotherhood

400
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,140
is the prestige of the Five Lakes Alliance.

401
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,820
Have you figured out that

402
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,340
for what reason Deng Kuan

403
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,620
had to frame his master?

404
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,980
These days

405
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,380
I am also confused.

406
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,380
For a person like Kuan,

407
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,100
he would die a thousand times himself

408
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,220
than hurt

409
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,020
and do harm to my big brother.

410
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,220
I really don't know
what he was influenced by

411
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,540
to hit his benefactor so badly.

412
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,180
Cheng Ling, stay with Lead Shen.

413
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,780
I'll go and see your Uncle Wen.

414
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,660
Master Zhou, I also have a question.

415
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,420
Can you answer it?

416
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,940
I found Master Wen looks like

417
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,740
an old friend of ours.

418
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,700
Master Wen.

419
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,180
Is his surname Zhen?

420
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,300
Leader Shen？

421
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,980
I don't think it's necessary for me
to answer your question.

422
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,300
That's right,

423
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,060
but that friend…

424
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,260
Leader Shen is still wounded.

425
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,620
Have a good rest first.

426
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,300
Don't try to scare me.

427
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,140
What's in your mind?

428
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,300
I've got it figured out.

429
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,340
What?

430
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,260
For Deng Kuan's actions,

431
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,220
there may be another possibility.

432
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,900
Do you remember

433
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,100
the weirdo
who regards disgusting drug men

434
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,180
as his kids?

435
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,980
The method to control drug men

436
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,020
might be related to
the legendary soul-hunting poison.

437
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,940
Yes, we've seen them in the Coffin Home,

438
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,820
the Scorpion Gang and the Longyuan Valley.

439
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,100
They are there.

440
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,740
The drug men in the Coffin Home
are also driven by Long-tongued Ghost.

441
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,500
Scorpion is often seen
in these strange things.

442
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,940
Ah Xu, during your stay
in the Window of Heaven,

443
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,940
have you ever seen the boss of Scorpion?

444
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,660
He is quite mysterious,

445
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,060
so he never shows up.

446
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,060
Shen Shen doesn't seem to be a fake,

447
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,420
then Zhao Xuan De, who pretends to
be stupid to kill more powerful opponents,

448
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,620
is the real boss.

449
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,900
This could happen.

450
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,300
But there are still a few tricks

451
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,660
that I can't figure out.

452
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,740
And there's another thing.

453
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,900
What is it?

454
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,260
Now it's not one thing.

455
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,340
There are two things.

456
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,100
The first one.

457
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,140
If the Scorpion boss is Zhao Jing,

458
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,740
then the one who used Sanshi poison
on Gao Chong's sword

459
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,900
to kill Rong Xuan and his wife indirectly

460
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,660
Was Zhao Jing.

461
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,580
So what is the second?

462
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,660
Who is Long-tongued Ghost？

463
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,060
Is it the man

464
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,060
who used the Soul Winding Box
to drive the drug men in the Coffin Home?

465
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,140
Long-tongued Ghost,

466
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,020
I only know that he is one of the Ten Devils.

467
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,420
Yes, he is the man of Hanged Ghost.

468
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,780
Hanged Ghost later advanced in martial arts,

469
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,060
and then gave him the Soul Winding Box.

470
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,100
The killing of the Mirror Lake Sect

471
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,540
was led by him.

472
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,540
I see.

473
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,060
You are really well-informed, Lao Wen.

474
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,980
Brother Wen,
call me if you need more water.

475
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,220
I can take care of my master.

476
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,140
It's none of your business.

477
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,660
I just wanna…

478
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,580
Don't flatter my master.

479
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,820
Go, go, go.

480
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,260
Ah Xiang.

481
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,060
Go. Fast.

482
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,860
Ah Xiang.

483
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,420
Master, hot water is ready.

484
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,500
Let me know if you need something.

485
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,900
[I almost spilled the beans just now.]

486
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,300
[The secret of my long acquaintance with
the Long-tongued Ghost is almost revealed.]

487
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,060
[Luckily, Ah Xu didn't seem to notice.]

488
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,980
[If he knows who I am,]

489
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,380
[we will not go the same way.]

490
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,060
Scorpion, I have good news and bad news.

491
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,140
Don't keep us guessing.

492
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,180
The good news is

493
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,300
that the spies I sent to the Longyuan Cabinet

494
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,140
found Zhang Cheng Ling by accident.

495
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,060
He was sure
with the master of the Window of Heaven

496
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,900
and the leader of evil ghosts.

497
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,620
But it's weird

498
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
that the descendant of the Sword Immortal was there, too.

499
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,020
What about the bad news?

500
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,260
Long Que and Long Xiao are dead.

501
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,300
I thought it would be
something important.

502
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,540
The reason why I kept Long Que alive

503
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,340
is some kind of preparation.

504
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,540
But now all the damned people are dead,

505
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,620
this shield is dispensable.

506
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,820
Long Xiao is dead.

507
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,500
This is such a great pleasure,

508
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,740
which saves a lot of my energy.

509
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,460
But once he died,
the key to the Armory would…

510
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,460
How can you believe my words of cheating Long Xiao?

511
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,940
In fact, for the last 20 years,

512
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,500
the key to the Armory

513
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,620
is kept somewhere dangerous

514
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,260
while safe.

515
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,180
It's in the Ghost Valley.

516
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,980
This is why Father

517
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,900
always wants to exterminate the Ghost Valley.

518
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,140
Scorpion, you know what is interlocking?

519
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,460
The Mirror Lake Sword Sect was exterminated,
the Sanbai Manor was stolen,

520
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,380
and Ao Lai Zi was murdered.

521
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,780
I arranged all these

522
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,140
to let people know

523
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,820
that the Ghost Valley
took the Glazed Armor away.

524
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,260
But plans can't keep up with changes.

525
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,780
The one who made the fake Glazed Armor

526
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,820
disrupted all your plans.

527
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,460
But luckily,

528
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,260
I don't need to frame Gao Chong
until it's done

529
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,420
to make him a born loser,

530
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,300
and die of a broken reputation.

531
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,740
Father,

532
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,060
why do you hate Gao Chong so much?

533
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,860
Scorpion, why do you ask me this?

534
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,580
Just curious.

535
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,380
Are you really just curious?

536
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,020
Yes.

537
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,820
Then why aren't you curious

538
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,020
that as sworn brothers,

539
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,380
some people are above others,

540
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,300
being domineers,

541
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,220
while some are underprivileged

542
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,620
and undignified?

543
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,540
Why aren't you curious

544
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,540
that some can be leaders,

545
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,540
controlling others,

546
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,900
while some can only work for them

547
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,620
and stoop to compromise.

548
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,500
Do you think I am

549
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,260
such a selfish guy?

550
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,260
I killed Gao Chong just for personal gain?

551
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,060
Listen,

552
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,660
only under my guidance

553
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,220
would the Five Lakes Alliance
carry forward

554
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,060
and be powerful.

555
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,500
Father, sorry,

556
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,380
I am wrong.

557
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,980
Don't be mad at me.

558
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,540
Is this the only thing you can do?

559
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,620
I heard

560
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,420
that Zhang Cheng Ling was found.

561
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,940
Then?

562
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,900
Those men are good at martial arts

563
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,340
and very mysterious.

564
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,660
Spies did not dare to follow too close.

565
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,060
But as he sent me the message by pigeons，

566
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,540
he drew near all the hidden spies.

567
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,540
They are following those men

568
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,540
for the further movements.

569
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,500
The three men are very excellent.

570
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,500
Common Scorpions

571
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,460
can't beat them.

572
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,500
If you say yes,

573
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,020
I'll set off at once.

574
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,220
Don't forget

575
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,220
that Wen and Zhou

576
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,020
both escaped unscathed from you.

577
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,420
I just held back.

578
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,940
Fine, I've got my plan.

579
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,780
Scorpion,

580
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,100
when are you gonna be smarter?

581
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,220
Grow up fast!

582
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,860
Zhou, Zhou, Zhou Xu,

583
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,260
it's the midnight,

584
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,700
what are you doing here?

585
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,300
You scared the hell out of me!

586
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
You have a guilty conscience.

587
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,580
What are you afraid of?

588
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,980
At night,

589
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,020
why are you awake again?

590
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,540
On such a starry night,

591
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,700
for whom do you stand here?

592
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,180
Don't be so bookish.

593
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,780
I really don't know

594
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,180
what's good about the liqueur.

595
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,620
Bitter and astringent.

596
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,140
Don't spoil the good stuff if you don't drink.

597
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,620
Master often drinks when he is unhappy.

598
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,740
I thought it was something amazing,

599
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,100
but there was nothing it could do.

600
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,380
Listen,

601
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,420
Liqueur is also called
the delighted medicine.

602
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
If a bottle of liqueur
can't relieve your sorrow,

603
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,220
two bottles can.

604
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,260
If that doesn't work either,
try three or four bottles.

605
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,580
It's a pity that we are in the wilderness,

606
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,820
this is the only one left.

607
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,180
What? You are unhappy again.

608
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,660
Did that Young Master Cao
piss you off again?

609
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,220
If he dares to, I'll castrate him.

610
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,740
A little girl

611
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,700
with a good appearance as you,

612
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,100
why do you always
speak vulgar language?

613
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,980
Lao Wen said he raised you up.

614
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,500
I can see that now.

615
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,900
Sick Dude, you are up at midnight.

616
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,860
What happened? You are sick again?

617
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,940
Yeah.

618
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,420
I heard from my master

619
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,500
that you are not gonna live for long.

620
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,860
You messed it up yourself.

621
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,420
Really?

622
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,260
Damn it!

623
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,900
Why don't you stay healthy?

624
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,460
If you die,

625
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,860
Master will be very sad.

626
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,060
I

627
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,020
have never seen him so sad as he was that day.

628
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,700
He has finally got himself a friend.

629
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
You have to live.

630
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,820
If you die suddenly

631
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,780
and leave my master to grieve alone,

632
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,420
I'll revive you

633
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,420
and then kill you again.

634
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,660
If you weren't a girl,

635
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,900
I would hit you eight times a day.

636
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,220
You're always bullshitting,

637
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,540
which reminds me of someone.

638
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,380
Who?

639
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,340
An eavesdropper.

640
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,740
Little girl,

641
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,700
What are you babbling?

642
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,460
Master, here.

643
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,140
What are you doing?

644
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Don't pull my ear. I've grown-up. Don't.

645
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,180
Grown up? How old are you?

646
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,980
Even if you are married

647
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,060
and become a mother,

648
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,700
I can pull your ears at my will.

649
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,140
Liqueur.

650
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,290
There isn't any more liqueur. Why did you give it to me?

651
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,940
This place looks like an old cellar.

652
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,500
Get me some liqueur.

653
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,020
Hurry up.

654
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,330
Go!

655
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,810
Master Wen.

656
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Brat, you told him.

657
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,260
No, I didn't.

658
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,140
He asked me if my surname was Zhen.

659
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,660
I just said I wouldn't tell you.

660
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,850
Uncle Shen guessed it right.

661
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,020
Idiot.

662
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,740
Calm down, Lao Wen.

663
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,900
Master Wen, are you Yan?

664
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,980
Yan, how are your parents?

665
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,940
A man with his hamstrings all torn,

666
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,380
without the protection of his master,

667
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,780
had to bear the oppression from the good
of the world of martial arts

668
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,220
but also to avoid the revenge from the evil.

669
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,940
Under the dual attack of the good and evil,

670
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,340
he still stuck to his brotherhood

671
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,300
and covered for his so-called brothers.

672
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,860
How well do you think he could be?

673
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,140
Sorry.

674
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,780
It's too late.

675
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,140
They can't hear your apologies anymore.

676
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,500
Lao Wen.

677
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,780
What?

678
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,380
Yan.

679
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,660
Don't call me. You don't deserve to talk to me.

680
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,140
Wen Ke Xing,

681
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,380
why are you helping him?

682
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,780
I am helping you.

683
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Too late.

684
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,660
They're all dead,

685
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,900
together with Zhen Yan.

686
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,980
Ah Xu.

687
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,740
Yan, how did your parents die?

688
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,700
Too late.

689
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,700
Too late.

690
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,140
Lao Wen.

691
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,700
Come.

692
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,820
Lao Wen.

693
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,420
Sorry.

694
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,250
[Li Mansion]

695
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,220
Master, how is Master Wen?

696
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,980
Don't wrong.
There is nothing abnormal in his pulse.

697
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,060
He is just unconscious for some reason.

698
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,140
Master Zhou,

699
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,700
you mean Yan is sick?

700
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,420
Leader Shen, my junior's name is Wen Ke Xing.

701
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,180
He chooses this name.

702
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,420
Please respect his choice.

703
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,260
Call him by this name.

704
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,700
When did he become your junior?

705
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,700
Your master is?

706
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,300
He is the leader of
the Four Seasons Manor.

707
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,900
His surname is Qin
and his name is Huai Zhang.

708
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,220
Brother Qin saved Yan.

709
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,300
Ke Xing.

710
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,620
Great, great.

711
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,340
God knows.

712
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,340
If Brother knew that Ke Xing

713
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,180
was raised up by Brother Qin
all these years,

714
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,980
he would be very happy.

715
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,220
So

716
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,140
you are friends of my master,

717
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,340
but why have I never heard of it before?

718
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,260
It's no wonder,

719
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,420
Since the battle in Mount Qingya,

720
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,500
Brother Qin has

721
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,540
terminated our contact.

722
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,980
So all these years,

723
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,140
we don't know Ru Yu's son

724
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,860
is in the Four Seasons Manor.

725
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,060
This is something weird.

726
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,860
Master always values friends.

727
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,340
How could he break off relations with you
for no reason?

728
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,060
Is there some misunderstanding?

729
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,940
It's not a misunderstanding
exactly speaking.

730
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,940
Your master hates us

731
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,500
for some reason.

732
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,260
But it's a long story.

733
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,220
If so,

734
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,140
I dare not hear the fault of my master.

735
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,500
Leader Shen, you don't need to say more.

736
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,740
He blamed us for before the big deal,

737
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,980
we didn't hold the bottom line

738
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,660
and committed disloyalty and injustice.

739
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,460
He is right.

740
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,620
He is right.

741
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,020
I am the coward.

742
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,900
I am the guy who did the wrong thing.

743
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,580
I have no stand to stand up for myself.

744
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,620
I, Shen Shen,

745
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,220
is an unfaithful, incompetent

746
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,780
and weak coward.

747
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,100
It's you.

748
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,700
You poisoned Uncle Rong.

749
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,660
What did you say?

750
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,740
My disciple asked

751
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,620
that is it true that Leader Shen used poison
on Gao Chong's sword

752
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
to murder Rong Xuan indirectly.

753
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,180
I just turned a blind eye to
Brother Rong's death and Ru Yu's suffer,

754
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,740
saying nothing about this. I am the worst.

755
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,860
It's true.

756
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,380
But if you accuse me of
slaying my brother,

757
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,860
it wouldn't happen definitely.

758
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,500
Besides, because of this grievance,

759
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,460
my big brother rued the day.

760
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,860
If I knew who did it,

761
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,500
I'd kill him even if it cost me my life.

762
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,780
You don't know it.

763
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,180
Who is the current leader
of the Five Lakes Alliance?

764
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,340
You said…

765
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,940
You said it's Chevalier Zhao.

766
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,740
Get this straight for me!

767
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,540
You said the one to poison
was my second brother.

768
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,540
Who told you?

769
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,340
It's Yan.

770
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,060
Does he have any evidence?

771
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,780
Wake him up and explain it to me.

772
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
No.

773
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,300
If my brother wakes up

774
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,660
and is willing to talk to you,

775
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,420
of course I won't stand in the way.

776
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,900
No, I have to make it clear to him.

777
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,700
Leader Shen, with all due respect,

778
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,980
you watched Rong Xuan die before.

779
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,260
Human nature is evil. I dare not to force you.

780
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,300
As long as
you five brothers keep a little kindness,

781
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,460
my junior wouldn't suffer
for the rest of his life.

782
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
He was even badly wounded
on Mount Qingya,

783
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,300
unable to spare any time for other things.

784
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,580
You don't need to explain to me.

785
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,740
At midnight

786
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,500
if you can convince your conscience…

787
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,540
Karma works every time.

788
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,660
You guys went to a bad end.

789
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,460
It's the past.

790
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Ashes to ashes.

791
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,700
I don't want my junior

792
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,980
to suffer from the past hatred.

793
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,540
Leader Shen, please leave here.

794
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,740
You can shut your eyes and ears
from now on

795
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,420
or do evil.

796
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,380
I just hope my junior won't trouble you.

797
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,940
Never see you again

798
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,460
Cheng Ling,

799
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,060
send him out.

800
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,540
