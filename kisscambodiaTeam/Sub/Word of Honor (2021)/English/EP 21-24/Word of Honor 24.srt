Chief Zhao won't even blame me

181
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
if I kill you.

182
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,910
Forget it!

183
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,110
Follow me.

184
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,880
Gao Chong is a demon who fooled the world 
and stole reputation,

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,110
and would never live another life!

186
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,080
And he would rot in hell forever and ever!

187
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,910
If you keep insulting my master,

188
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,280
I will have combat with you!

189
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,400
I'll kill you, little demon brat!

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,760
Stop!

191
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,440
Master Shen!

192
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,640
Master!

193
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,110
Master!

194
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,230
Who dare to hurt my Junior!

195
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,350
[My god!]

196
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,280
[Finally, this fool is useful for once!]

197
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,590
Ah Xiang, you're back.

198
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,110
Why are you still standing here?

199
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm waiting for you.

200
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,150
I'm worried that if you won't see me
 when you're back,

201
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,110
you'll worry.

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
Let's go. Let's go.

203
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,790
Don't waste any time in this town.

204
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,280
We're not eating something first?

205
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,550
First, let's continue our travel, shall we?

206
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,590
When we're back in Gentle Wind Sword Sect, 
I will cook myself.

207
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,230
You can eat as much as you can!

208
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,280
Okay. Okay.

209
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,550
Cao Wei Ning,

210
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,880
are you really going to marry me?

211
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,200
For certain!

212
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,320
Ah Xiang, why are you still
 asking this question?

213
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,440
I already took my oath
 with Brother Wen.

214
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,280
What if your master doesn't like me?

215
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,320
That's not gonna happen. 
Of course 
he will like you.

216
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,110
You are so nice.

217
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,470
If he dislikes me

218
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,030
because I am a wild orphan,

219
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,080
what should I do?

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,840
That's not gonna happen.
 Master Fan has the softest heart.

221
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,150
If Master doesn't agree,

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
I will beg Master Fan.

223
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,320
That's not what I'm talking about.

224
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,200
Cao Wei Ning,

225
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,030
what would you do

226
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,030
if neither your Master nor Master Fan 
allows you to marry me?

227
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,590
Then, you kidnap me. We'll elope.

228
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,840
Who wants to kidnap you?

229
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,350
I don't even care if you beg me.

230
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,280
I said it wrong.

231
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,030
I'll kidnap you. I'll abduct and traffic you.

232
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,080
Whatever you say,

233
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,230
I'll stay with you.

234
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,280
Ah Xiang, in life,

235
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,760
if I can't be with you,

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,080
I won't be happy anyway.

237
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,520
Nothing will stop me.

238
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,400
And let alone they won't stop me.

239
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,470
Master Fan will like you.

256
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,440
Uncle Wen, what's in the package?

257
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,550
It's so heavy.

258
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,320
It's the liquor for your master.

259
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,350
Give it to me.

260
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,350
It's ok, Uncle Wen.

261
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll treat it as practicing martial arts.

262
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,080
[Linger on and forget to return.]

263
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,790
Uncle Wen, Master said

264
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,280
that all of Four Seasons Manor died in his hands.

265
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,200
Nine divided by nine is one.

266
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,840
I told you to stop asking about this.

267
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,150
That's why I'm asking you!

268
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,030
Uncle Wen, just clarify this for me!

269
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,880
I feel uncomfortable

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,880
to see Master so sad.

271
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
Whatever happened during this,

272
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,760
it's his own privacy,

273
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,760
or his biggest pain.

274
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
He is either not ready to tell us,

275
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,230
or he doesn't want to bring this up forever.

276
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,670
I hope you don't push him.

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,910
I see.

278
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,710
Uncle Wen, you and Master are so tacit.

279
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,320
He told me the same thing.

280
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,230
He said that a gentleman
 doesn't pry on other people's weaknesses.

281
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,350
He told me never

282
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,200
to ask Chevalier Wen and his wife

283
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
about your parents.

284
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,110
I didn't mean to.

285
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,960
Master, no offense.

286
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,520
What are you calling me?

287
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,030
I am supposed to call you Master.

288
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,230
Why do we have to tell riddles

289
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,080
instead of clearing things up?

290
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,550
Master said this a long time ago,

291
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,760
no matter what you think,

292
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,150
he treats you as his junior.

293
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,030
But he also told me that

294
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,960
we will wait for you to
 confirm your mind,

295
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,080
and willingly return to us. 
Then we can change how we address you.

296
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,960
There shall be no reluctance.

297
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,920
See, you two are so tacit.

298
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,880
Why are you being so indirect?

299
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,830
Master.

300
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,860
[Linger on and forget to return.]

301
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,750
[Four Season Manor]

302
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,920
Chief, Wen Ru Yu bit his own tongue
 and committed suicide.

303
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
We lost the trace on the key again.

304
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,160
Dad.

305
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,590
Mom.

306
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,710
Kill him.

307
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,070
Kill me. I don't wanna live anymore.

308
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,710
Just kill me.

309
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,950
Why don't you kill me!

310
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Tell me obediently,

311
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,710
did you see your parents

312
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,400
with a key?

313
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,430
I don't wanna live.

314
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,950
Just kill me.

315
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,920
I, I will turn into the fiercest ghost,

316
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,680
and hunt all of you down!

317
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,760
Chief, this kid has
 such a weird personality

318
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,710
for such a young age.

319
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,400
He is born to be a little ghost.

320
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,680
What about giving him
 what he wants?

321
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,430
Sure. Let's grant his wishes.

322
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,950
Kid,

323
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,280
now that you're here 
in the Ghost Valley,

324
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,520
you have to accept your fate.

325
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,760
Your dad was a good doctor.

326
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,070
It's such a pity
 that I couldn't save him.

327
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,190
Luckily, I saved you.

328
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,470
Drink this,

329
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,640
and you'll forget everything.

330
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,640
[I can't forget. I can't forget.]

331
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,070
Junior.

332
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,590
Junior.

333
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,710
Sit straight.

334
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,640
That's enough, Lao Wen.

335
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,560
Don't move.

336
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,590
That's enough, Lao Wen.

337
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,230
Finally, we survived tonight.

338
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't consume your internal force.

339
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,640
We survived tonight.
 What about tomorrow night?

340
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,950
We'll discuss that tomorrow.

341
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,070
With these seven nails on me,

342
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,560
I am hurt every night.

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,110
It's just sometimes
 they are fiercer.

344
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,430
Sometimes they are milder.

345
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,160
What's wrong with Ye Bai Yi?

346
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,160
He's so slow,
 like a thousand-year-old turtle,

347
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,640
that crawls so slowly.

348
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,590
Why is there still no news?

349
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,000
Nice man Wen, he is kind enough
 to help us,

350
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,710
but you curse him
 behind his back.

351
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,110
I'll say the same thing in front of him.

352
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,470
This old monster is so unreliable.

353
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
You are the one without heart.

354
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,310
They say that those with thin lips
 have little feeling.

355
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,880
It's pretty accurate.

356
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,590
They say that

357
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,040
I am the soberest person
 with the least feeling in this world.

358
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,110
Ah Xu,

359
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,400
you called Junior continuously
 in your sleep.

360
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,590
What did you dream about?

361
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,590
If you won't tell me,
 then forget my question.

362
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,590
Lao Wen,

363
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,280
there's nothing between you and me

364
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,800
that we can't discuss.

365
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,230
Chief,

366
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,190
if you want Four Seasons Manor

367
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,800
to fight for justice,

368
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,000
I have nothing to argue about.

369
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,830
But if you want me to 
harm the loyal and the good,

370
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,950
I can't do that.

371
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,350
Senior, Officer Jiang resigned from his job
 and returned to his hometown.

372
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,190
Why won't Prince let him go?

373
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,280
He is such a nice man.

374
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,710
Senior, for the sake of Xiao Xue,

375
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,760
please plead with Prince!

376
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,760
You are the one
 who adores Xiao Xue the most!

377
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,470
Jiu Xiao,

378
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,350
as for the matter in the government,

379
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
it's not simply good or bad.

380
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
If Prince wants him to die,

381
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,070
he must die.

382
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,160
No reason is needed.

383
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,560
Officer Jiang helped us three greatly.

384
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,430
We don't know about the matter 
in the government.

385
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,830
We are not the material for that.

386
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,520
But people in the martial arts world

387
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,310
know how to return favors.

388
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,680
After we say goodbye to you,

389
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,350
we will catch up with Officer Jiang,

390
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,070
and escort him out the northwest.

391
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,710
If Duan Peng Ju still wants to
 hurt Officer Jiang,

392
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,070
he has to do that over our dead bodies.

393
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,710
It's like throwing a straw against the wind.

394
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,230
If we have to do that,

395
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,830
we will!

396
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,070
I, Luo Hao Ning, would die for
 returning the favor,

397
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,520
rather than living on the run!

398
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,560
Senior.

399
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,880
Alright,

400
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,040
I'll go with you.

401
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,830
Get up, all of you.

402
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,830
Let's drink up this liquor

403
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,110
and go for Officer Jiang together!

404
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,110
Yeah!

405
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,520
Chief, you're back finally.

406
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,800
He was going to save him with his life.

407
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,070
So I let him drink

408
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
the liquor with Drunk Like a Dream.

409
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,350
He was asleep for five days and nights.

410
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,350
When he woke up, there was nothing he could do.

411
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,950
He hated me so much

412
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,430
that he left without saying goodbye.

413
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,680
The last time I met him,

414
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,400
he was already in his coffin.

415
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,110
He mistakenly thought that 
I was trapped in a town alone

416
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,310
so he tried to save me with his life.

417
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,280
Eventually, he fought to his death in that town.

418
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,310
His loved one went through
 all kinds of difficulties

419
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,350
to deliver his body to me.

420
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,920
I didn't know the relationship between that girl

421
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,800
and Jiu Xiao.

422
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,070
When I finally found out,

423
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,040
I had already forced that girl

424
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,110
to take the poison 
that would kill her immediately.

425
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
If another world exists,

426
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,800
I'm sure they are gathering together

427
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,040
and cursing me, the evil senior, to death.

428
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,110
They won't curse you.

429
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,310
They...

430
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,760
they understand you.

431
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,760
You're wrong.

432
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,310
The reason why they died tragically

433
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,230
is that they didn't know me at all.

434
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,800
Jiu Xiao admired his senior
 ever since childhood.

435
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Master

436
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,830
also treated me like his own son.

437
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,520
Everyone in the Manor, old or young,

438
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,350
all regarded me as their family and senior.

439
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,350
They respected me and loved me.

440
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,920
That's why it blinded them.

441
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,830
They didn't know the real Zhou Zi Shu

442
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,040
is actually a coward, a deserter.

443
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,110
Ah Xu.

444
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,110
Sit down, please.

445
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,950
Master passed away because of an acute disease.

446
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,950
Before he passed away,

447
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,310
he trusted me with the Four Seasons Manor.

448
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,640
I, as the young chief,
 wasn't powerful enough to be a protector.

449
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,310
Everyone in the martial arts world, good or bad,

450
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,160
sought our trouble.

451
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,350
I struggled for two years

452
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,280
and kept watching one senior after another

453
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,520
die for protecting the Four Seasons Manor.

454
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,160
I couldn't do this anymore.

455
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,040
So I ran away.

456
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,950
Stop blaming yourself like this.

457
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,070
What happened next?

458
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,430
I did run away.

459
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,590
No,

460
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
you must have your reasons.

461
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,190
Difficulties

462
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,110
are no more than excuses in a nice disguise.

463
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,520
My father was the former Prince Jin's 
capable assistant.

464
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,830
The current Prince is my cousin.

465
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,230
He was worried that 
there was no one around he could trust.

466
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,350
So he wrote me a letter to ask me to help him.

467
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,230
Your Highness.

468
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,880
What's that about? 
Call me cousin!

469
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,190
Cousin. What's wrong with you?

470
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,950
You look bad.

471
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,590
How is Prince?

472
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,000
It's our teacher.

473
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,280
He's gone.

474
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,350
Our teacher was in his prime time.
 How could this happen?

475
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,000
My father listened to slanderous talks

476
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,760
and threw our teacher in jail
 and tortured him.

477
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,760
Our teacher wouldn't surrender

478
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,590
to things he didn't do.

479
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,640
So, he committed suicide in jail.

480
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,760
Do you know

481
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,760
what our teacher did
 before he killed himself?

482
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,520
He wrote poems all over the walls and the floors in desperation.

483
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,400
"The rivers flow.

484
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,110
The window leads to the underworld.

485
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,880
Rumors endanger justice.

486
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,400
The clouds hide the sun."

487
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,710
I looked at the blood letters
 all over the walls and the floors.

488
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,070
What world is this!

489
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Our teacher had such an open mind.
 He served his country and people.

490
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,160
Cousin, don't be too upset.

491
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,350
In the future, we will...

492
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,920
My father... He was so angry.

493
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,680
He even dumped our teacher's body 
in the wild,

494
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,190
and sent guards so that no one could collect
 his body to bury him properly.

495
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,560
He let stray dogs consume our teacher's body!

496
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,430
I am useless!

497
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,280
I am useless!

498
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I am!

499
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,880
I couldn't even let our teacher rest in peace.

500
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,280
Cousin. Please rest assured.

501
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,590
I will steal our teacher's body,

502
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,950
and bury him properly.

503
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,950
Good.

504
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,520
Zi Shu, when can you

505
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,280
come here and help me?
 That would be great.

506
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,680
So, I took all of our brothers

507
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,680
from the Four Season Manor,

508
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,920
and joined Prince Jin's ally.

509
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,350
I didn't foresee that

510
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,350
I was fooling myself.

511
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,190
Once we stood in the mud of power and desire,

512
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,520
it's not that simple to get away.

513
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,590
I watched my brothers

514
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,000
die in front of me one by one.

515
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,280
In the end,

516
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,830
even Jiu Xiao was dead!

517
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,920
After Jiu Xiao's death,

518
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
there was nothing for me to live for.

519
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,590
Then,

520
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,040
guess what,

521
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,830
I ran away, again.

522
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,430
In the end,

523
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,920
all I have left are these seven nails.

524
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,710
The ones I wanted to protect,

525
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,830
and the business I wanted to establish

526
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,160
were all difficult to preserve 
no matter how much I want to.

527
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,070
Just like sands in my hand.

528
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,040
Luckily, God was merciful.

529
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,040
He offered me a chance to start over.

530
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,310
The succession is not over yet.

531
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,280
I just don't know

532
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,160
if I can see this child grow up
 to be a useful asset.

533
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,760
Why can't you?

534
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,320
Ye Bai Yi promised me.

535
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,390
That old monster 
has a broad range of knowledge.

536
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,230
If he says you can be cured, 
you surely can!

537
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,760
Nothing is absolute in this world.

538
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,910
I don't care.

539
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,000
This thing must be settled!

540
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,520
No matter how this ends,

541
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,600
I want to tell you

542
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,470
that I'm really happy that 
you can come back and accompany me.

543
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,760
Junior,

544
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,630
it's almost dawn. You should rest.

545
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,950
I'm going out to get some fresh air first.

546
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,630
Lao Wen,

547
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,190
you and my master

548
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,600
are master-and-disciple in name only,

549
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,710
If you don't want to acknowledge
 that the Four Seasons Manor

550
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,870
is your school,

551
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm in no place to force you.

552
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
The child of the Wen couple comes back to 
the Four Seasons Manor.

553
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,230
If Master knows this in the after-world,

554
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,520
he will feel beyond happy.

555
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,750
[Four Seasons Manor]

556
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,190
Master, you are awake.

557
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,600
Did I wake you up when sweeping the floor?

558
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,120
Doesn't matter.

559
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,910
What time is it?

560
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,080
How could I sleep so deep?

561
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,670
It's almost noon.

562
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,840
Uncle Wen said that
 you didn't sleep well last night.

563
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,870
Told me to not wake you up,

564
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,000
and let you sleep longer.

565
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,190
Where is he?

566
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,760
Master.

567
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,600
-Ah Xu
 -You are awake.

568
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
I took a close look at it.

569
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,360
This painting is not damaged severely.

570
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,150
Simply re-mount it and it will be fine.

571
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,870
I'm almost done repairing it.

572
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,520
The only thing left is
 to repaint the colors.

573
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,000
The good news is that, 
after re-mounting,

574
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,910
[The flowers blossom in all four seasons, 
knowing everything in the world.]
 the paint won't be damaged from rolling.

575
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,950
When I'm outside,
 I'll find an expert in painting

576
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,190
to carefully fill it up 
following your master's intention.

577
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
It will be the same as before.

[Pingan Bank]

579
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,840
Master, take care.

580
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,910
When will my letter reach Kun?

581
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,910
Master, please rest assured.

582
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,560
You are the VIP with the token.

583
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,120
No one dares to delay your business.

584
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,120
The carrier pigeons in our bank are well-trained.

585
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
They will deliver your letter to Kun

586
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,190
within two days.

587
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,710
Good. Go.

588
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,390
Okay, take care.

589
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
This demon Wen.

590
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,320
He looks about the same age as ours.

591
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,040
How could he become
 the chief of the Ghost Valley?

592
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,520
You have no idea.

593
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,600
There are so many magic tricks
 in the Ghost Valley to stay young.

594
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,800
Though Wen Ke Xing looks young
 in the painting,

595
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,080
he may be an old man 
who is seventy years old!

596
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,320
-Yeah.
 -It all depends on magic tricks

597
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,150
to keep his young appearance!

598
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,120

Where does this kid come from?

601
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,280
Do you know how to speak properly?

602
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,950
Asking a question so straightforward.

603
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,800
Do you know the rules or not?

604
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,560
Where are you from?

605
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,870
What's your relationship
 with demon Wen?

606
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,150
Who told you to slander here?

607
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,080
We are not slandering.
