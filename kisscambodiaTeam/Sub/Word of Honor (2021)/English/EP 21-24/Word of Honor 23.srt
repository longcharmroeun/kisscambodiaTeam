Since Shen Shen had the nerve to ask me
where my parents were,

138
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,170
I should have sent him to heaven
to meet them.

Now you tell me that
no one can avoid suffering.

143
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,810
Didn't my parents have theirs?

144
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,940
The bad can be forgiven for those so-called reasons

145
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,060
while the good deserve to die?

146
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,690
If you want to be a bodhisattva,
then you be it.

147

fall into hell after death

if I kill Shen Shen in person,

157
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,770
it may give him a chance to
atone for his sin with his life.

158
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,210

However, the current chief of the alliance

175
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,010

killing them by myself.

180
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,010
Are you still feeling dizzy? Are you hungry?

181
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,420
Shall I cook for you?

182
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,180
I just feel that you're so noisy now.

183
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,860
You guys talk first.

184
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,890
I'll check
whether Cheng Ling has finished cooking.

185
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,570
Master, you…

186
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,650
It's because of the Water of Lethe.

187
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,940
You don't fail me.

188
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,500
I don't fail you.

189
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,060
Jing.

190
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,810
Master.

191
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,620
Jing.

192
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,770
Master.

193
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,540
Jing.

194
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,250
[There're so many people called Zhao Jing
in this world]

195
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,770
[Maybe this woman doesn't mean him.]

196
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,520
[Maybe it's just a coincidence]

197
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,580
I don't fail you.

198
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,330
[But if it's a misunderstanding,]

199
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,770
[why did Father rush to send Lovelace to]

200
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,940
[kill them all?]

201
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,570
Jing.

202
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,740
Jing.

203
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,330
You don't fail me. I don't fail you.

204
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,130
Jing.

205
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,100
What're you going to do?

206
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,620
Then what can you do?

207
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,740
I just want to examine her pulse.

208
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,210
Move away.

209
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,810
Do you want me to kill you, too?

210
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,420
Is it because of Water of Lethe

211
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,740
that she turns this?

212
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,810
No.

213
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,690
Water of Lethe can only
let the people forget

214
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,210
the things they are obsessed most.

215
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,300
But it does no harm to the mind.

216
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,770
My Master had illness before.

217
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,540
It's possible that someone has

218
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,380
provoked my Master's Soul-Dissociation,

219
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,860
so she becomes like this.

220
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,380
Forget the most obsessed things.

221
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,650
So the thing she wants to forget is

222
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,810
the person who failed her.

223
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,860
How to cure this?

224
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,330
Please forgive my offense,
Scorpion King.

225
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,980
I didn't drink Water of Lethe,

226
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,450
and take the initiative
in getting in the Valley.

227
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,570
It was Master who saved me

228
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,810
and took me to Mount Qingya

229
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,060
when I was driven into a corner

230
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,060
and wanted to kill myself.

231
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,890
So I'm begging your mercy
and an exception.

232
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,890
You're the one
who should drink Water of Lethe.

233
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,810
What is the exception for?

234
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,620
Because I think that I won't
make the same mistake

235
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,810
if I remember everything.

236
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,570
Since you remember it as your wish,

237
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,620
why do you go back to Yu Qiu Feng?

238
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,940
Have you seen the always losing gamblers?

239
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,540
The more they're losing
the more they want to gamble.

240
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,250
Handing your heart
to another person

241
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,940
is the biggest bet.

242
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,810
I backed the wrong thing.

243
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,210
I thought I could lose

244
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,650
my life to him outright.

245
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,300
However, with the help of Master,

246
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,620
I have lived some more years
in a half-ghostly way

247
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,380
Actually, in the moment
when Lovelace came to kill him,

248
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,060
I was thinking to take it for him.

249
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,770
It was a game over
when I lost everything.

250
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,180
But who could expect that

251
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,860
the God let me win that time?

252
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,300
Idiot,

253
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,570
how could the Ghost Valley
raise a person like you?

254
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,180
Manager of the Unfaithful.

255
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,770
Why do you call it like this?

256
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,130
Because my Master said,

257
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,860
men are unfaithful and
women are ill-fated since the old time.

258
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,650
She would redress the scales for

259
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,010
all the women who were failed

260
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,940
and kill every unfaithful man.

261
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,690
Being unfaithful is the nature of human.

262
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,250
It's the same for
both men and women.

263
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,420
Ridiculous.

264
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,010
Who doesn't fail anyone

265
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,380
and isn't failed by others?

266
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,250
Your fate is too bad,

267
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,980
and I don't want it anymore.

268
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,770
Now,

269
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,130
I give you an opportunity to choose.

270
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,420
If you're willing to pledge loyalty to me,

271
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,620
I'll satisfy your wish whatever it is,

272
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,130
even to kill Yu Qiu Feng.

273
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,540
I don't care what method you use.

274
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,810
Find the recipe of Water of Lethe

275
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,450
and hand it to me.

276
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,770
I'll let you free.

277
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,500
Master, you were seven or eight
years old when you joined the Valley.

278
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,620
Why did you need to
drink Water of Lethe?

279
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,180
There were some onenwho didn't
want me to recall something.

280
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,250
It's pity that I let them down.

281
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,860
But how could you remember it
if you drank Water of Lethe?

282
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,130
It's a blood feud
and I can never forget it.

283
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,500
Don't mention it was only a bowl of
Water of Lethe.

284
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,940
Even if I had been broken into pieces
and burnt to ashes,

285
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,330
climbing back from the hell
step by step,

286
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,020
I would have taken revenge on them.

287
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,410
When I was little,

288
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,780
I often had strong headaches,
vomited blood and fell into comas.

289
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,930
That's the price of using mind
to force against Water of Lethe.

290
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,410
This illness hasn't broken out
for a long time.

291
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,570
Recently, the old things are
mentioned frequently,

292
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,450
which might be affective.

293
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,980
One day,

294
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,810
I may be tortured to madness
by this headache.

295
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,740
But before that day,

296
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,170
the enemies of mine have to die

297
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,380
In front of me.

298
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,780
Don't be afraid.

299
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,500
Before the arrival of that day,

300
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,500
I'll make a proper arrangement for you.

301
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
What am I afraid of?
I'm just angry.

302
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,530
Master, I was brought up by you.

303
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,810
Why don't you tell me early

304
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,570
since you have these things in your mind?

305
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,290
I'll try my best to help you.

306
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,530
I don't need your help.

307
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,290
Let me ask you, Ah Xiang,

308
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,210
do you really love Cao Wei Ning?

309
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,380
Master, what're you talking about?

310
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,810
I'm talking it seriously.
Don't interrupt.

311
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,260
Answer me. If you say no,

312
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,690
I'll kill him.

313
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,980
Ma… Ma…

314
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,740
Then it's a yes.

315
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,530
If you love him,

316
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,210
return the Gentle Wind Sword Sect
with him tomorrow.

317
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,210
Mo Huai Yang is skilled in martial arts,

318
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,930
and he is a crafty old scoundrel.

319
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,500
He wouldn't let his sect
involve in fighting.

320
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,500
You'll be safe staying there.

321
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,290
Master, are you leaving me?

322
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,780
Silly girl, the way I chose is a way
to the hell.

323
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,330
It's was a mistake that

324
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,980
you were a lost soul
who entered the demon area.

325
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,860
Now you have the chance to
get back to the mortal world.

326
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,290
Why do you still go after me?

327
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,860
Cao Wei Ning,

328
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,210
although I don't like him
in many ways,

329
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,410
Fortunately, he is easy to control.

330
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,780
Just go back to the mortal world
with him.

331
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,210
Live a normal life.

332
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,860
I don't think
he can make any big wave.

333
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,170
Master,

334
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,620
there's one thing
I haven't told you yet.

335
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,450
The reason why
I'm with Cao Wei Ning is

336
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,620
that he said

337
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,780
it was probably
that Gao Chong handed

338
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,410
the Glazed Armor
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

339
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,330
I'm with Cao Wei Ning.

340
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,330
Actually, the purpose is to

341
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,410
inquire about the place of
the Glazed Armor

342
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,930
for you, Master.

343
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,930
But,

344
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,210
but, I,

345
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,290
I don't know why,

346
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,530
why did I,

347
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,690
I develop a relationship with him.

348
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,140
Please, Master.

349
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,810
Could you please

350
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,690
spare the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

351
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,570
Sorry, Master.

352
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,530
I know I shouldn't say this.

353
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,330
But,

354
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,260
but I don't want him to hate me.

355
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,980
He,

356
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,930
he has no relationship with me.

357
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,980
I,

358
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,170
I just don't want
anything happened to him.

359
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,410
It's okay.

360
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,410
This kind of little things doesn't
deserve your crying like this.

361
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,900
However, Master,

362
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,380
I'm afraid.

363
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,570
People are all saying that

364
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,900
the evil and justice can't
have a happy ending together.

365
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,930
I'm different with Brother Cao.

366
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,620
All I know is how to kill
and hurt people

367
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,140
and how to prevent others
from hurting me.

368
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,930
Even the purpose of
approaching him is

369
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,260
full of malicious intentions.

370
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,410
He is nice to me now,

371
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,210
but the reason is
that I'm hiding all the things.

372
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,020
One day, he knows about my identity.

373
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,900
If he doesn't pick a broadsword
to kill me,

374
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,100
it would prove
that he has affection and faith to me.

375
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,210
How dare him?

376
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,260
If he dares to fail you,

377
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,170
I'll kill his whole family.

378
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,020
Master,

379
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,740
I let him down.

380
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,330
He doesn't.

381
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,780
Master, I'm so afraid.

382
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,900
I think

383
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,260
the nicer he treats me,

384
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,860
the more visional I feel all things are.

385
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,930
It's like the snowman you made for me.

386
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,020
When the sun came out,

387
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,140
it, it melted.

388
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,780
Didn't I make some others
for you later?

389
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,500
Don't cry.

390
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,410
But I just like the first one.

391
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,930
No matter how big
and nice the snowmen

392
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,140
you made later are,

393
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,620
they still can't compare with

394
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,380
the one you made with me
the first time.

395
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,140
Master,

396
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,410
if one day,

397
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,450
Zhou Xu knows your identity,

398
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,290
will you kill him and

399
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,020
find another new friend?

400
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,380
That's enough, Gu Xiang.

401
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,290
Don't forget you're the
Heartless Amethyst Fiend.

402
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,050
It's only a little time that you've
got in touch with the mortal world.

403
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,930
How could you become
so sentimental?

404
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,170
Can I forget it? How could I?

405
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
The ugly wife still can
meet her parents in law.

406
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,570
But,

407
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,140
but the Heartless Amethyst Fiend of
the Ghost Valley can't expose to the light.

408
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,740
Alright,

409
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
I've decided.

410
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,570
Listen to me,

411
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,810
you've grown up in the Ghost Valley
since childhood

412
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,050
and have no experience
in martial arts world.

413
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,210
They have no reason
to know your identity.

414
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,530
You can hide it from him to the end.

415
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,450
I promise you that

416
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,020
I won't do anything
to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

417
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,930
Don't involve in

418
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,900
the business of
the Ghost Valley anymore.

419
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,530
If I don't contact you,

420
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,570
just stay in Mount Qingfeng.

421
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,980
Well, then,

422
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,410
You don't need
the Glazed Armor anymore?

423
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,290
No need.

424
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,900
The Glazed Armor

425
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,740
was just a cover originally.

426
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,210
You're awake, Master Wen.

427
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,140
Are you okay?

428
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,980
I'm fine.

429
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,050
Come here with me.

430
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,780
I have a word for you.

431
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,410
Uncle Wen, Brother Cao,
don't leave.

432
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,900
I, I don't know how to cook.

433
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,260
Master Wen,

434
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,740
why did you suddenly call me out?

435
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,810
I…

436
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,780
When I was still a kid,

437
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,050
I picked Ah Xiang back.

438
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,290
For the first time I fed her porridge,

439
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,380
I scalded her mouth.

440
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,570
When we were kids, we stayed in a

441
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,210
very inhuman place where

442
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,410
I couldn't even take care of myself.

443
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,780
I didn't want to
bring this encumbrance with me.

444
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,740
I thought about throwing
her away several times.

445
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,690
However, this little guy,

446
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,140
having no clear expression still,

447
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,980
was like a little creature
who struggled to survive and

448
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,620
followed me everywhere.

449
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,450
Even though her mouth was scalded,

450
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,900
she still smiled at me,

451
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,570
for fear of being left alone by me.

452
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,570
Ah Xiang told me about those.

453
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,810
I know.

454
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,810
She has suffered a lot
during the growth.

455
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,740
It's hard for her to be like this

456
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,140
when having a bad example like me.

457
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,140
Ah Xiang is not my servant actually.

458
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,170
It's because I saved her

459
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,210
so that she wants to be a servant to serve me

460
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,210
when she grows up.

461
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,810
That's the reason.

462
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
In fact,

463
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,930
[Li Mansion]

464
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,620
I didn't realize it until now that

465
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,690
I didn't save her,

466
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,690
but she did.

467
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,690
Without this little guy around me,,

468
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,930
warming my heart,

469
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,020
I…

470
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,140
After saying so many things,

471
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,170
all I want to tell you is that

472
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,570
Ah Xiang is like a little sister to me.

473
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,260
If I put my position
in an order generation,

474
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,660
she is kind of a daughter of me,

475
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,140
for I raised her up.

476
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,210
In my whole life,

477
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,570
few people are kind to me.

478
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,740
I'll use my life to pay

479
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,170
the few ones back.

480
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,570
And Ah Xiang is one of them.

481
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,780
There were some things

482
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,410
I couldn't

483
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,020
even dream of

484
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,740
back then.

485
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,410
But now,

486
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,020
it seems that they're not so difficult.

487
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,500
I want this little girl
to have a better life.

488
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,140
I hope she can live a

489
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,100
happy life like the normal people.

490
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,140
Cao Wei Ning,

491
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,140
can you bring it to her?

492
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,170
Yes, of course.

493
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
Although I can't
provide her great fortunes,

494
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,330
I can still…

495
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm not asking for great fortunes.

496
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,410
Just bring her back to
the Gentle Wind Sword Sec tomorrow.

497
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,170
But I need you promise me that

498
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,410
you'll live up to her heart to you.

499
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,050
Whenever what happens,

500
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,660
you'll protect and take care of her,

501
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,380
making her happy and safein her whole life.

502
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,530
Can you make it?

503
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,100
I know, Master Wen.

504
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,170
Don't worry anymore.

505
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,500
Today, I swear to God
in front of you.

506
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,660
Heaven and earth, please be my witnesses.

507
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,690
I, Cao Wei Ning, in my whole life,

508
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,810
from now to death,

509
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,500
counting every second,

510
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,170
will never do things failing Ah Xiang.

511
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,210
If I regret, I would accept the curse
from God and Evil.

512
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,330
Don't be so confident.

513
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,860
After all,
the time you two have met is short.

514
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,570
She might not be the person
you imagined.

515
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,500
I don't push you to swear.

516
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,290
But since you made this vow today,

517
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,210
don't think God
and Evil are only tales.

518
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,260
If you really fail Ah Xiang
in the future,

519
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,860
I'll be the first to
break you into pieces.

520
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,290
I understand.

521
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,780
I know her.

522
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,450
Figuring a person out

523
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,290
is not up to time.

524
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,100
When I first met her,

525
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,500
I would treat her well
in my entire life.

526
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,020
Since today I can realize my wish,

527
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,980
I'm more than happy.

528
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,780
If I really fail her later,

529
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,410
I'll kill myself

530
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,810
without your words.

531
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,210
Okay, this is your own words.

532
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,860
If you can't do it,

533
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,620
I won't let you go even when I become ghost.

534
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,980
Deal.

535
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,780
Deal.

536
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,620
There is no such bride relative talking
to the bridegroom like this.

537
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,620
Aren't you afraid of the bridegroom
sending the bride back?

538
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,500
You're eavesdropping us.

539
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,530
I'm not.

540
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,530
It's fair and square.

541
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,210
Wei Ning, if this elder

542
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,690
bullies you,

543
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,050
I'll take charge of him.

544
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,170
All you need to do
is to treat Ah Xiang well.

545
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,780
Okay, we're leaving tomorrow.

546
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,810
I'll make some preparation.

547
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,900
This bridegroom is nice,

548
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,450
but why do you so hurry to

549
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,620
send Ah Xiang away?

550
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,620
Don't you worry that the families
of the Cao's won't welcome her?

551
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,860
Who has the nerve?

552
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,170
Lao Wen,

553
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,050
why do you so hurry to

554
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,100
leave Ah Xiang to others?

555
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,500
Because I have someone caring me,

556
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,660
I begin to like matchmaking.

557
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,450
I want to arrange Ah Xiang properly.

558
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,660
And then,
quitting from the martial arts world,

559
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,660
I will live a tranquil life with you.

560
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,620
Then Philanthropist Wen,

561
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,260
please be kind
and be a matchmaker for me.

562
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,410
Uncle Wen,

563
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,210
Don't call Brother Cao away so long.

564
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,530
I don't know how to cook.

565
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,570
What should I do
if the pot seems to be burnt?

566
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,410
He went down the mountain
to buy food.

567
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,450
No need to cook.

568
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,210
See?

569
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,570
Still talking about the tranquil life.

570
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,260
With this little brat,

571
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,930
we'll only have the days of turmoil.

572
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,450
Ah Xu, is this liquor or vinegar?

573
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,100
How could you swallow it
as it tastes so bad?

574
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,660
Where can I get good liquor
in this backcountry?

575
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,050
Just make do with it.

576
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,660
When we get to the Four Season Manor,

577
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,740
I'll dig out the good liquor
I used to bury

578
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,260
in the plum forest
and let you have a taste.

579
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,210
Master, there is a plum forest
in our Manor?

580
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,900
Not only a plum forest.

581
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,980
The people of the Martial arts world
have a word to describe our Manor.

582
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,130
Full of flowers all the year round,
knowing everything in the world.

583
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,190
To get the Glazed Armor,
the Ghost Valley…
The valley
put the martial arts world into disorder…
People were killed by the Valley…
It was hated by both human and God…
In order to bring peace
back to the world,
we suggest that…
All the things bothered are…

584
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:28,900
Father.

585
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,780
Scorpion, you're at a right timing.

586
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,260
The Xianxia Sect coped with
this problem properly.

587
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,660
Those people set free deliberately
by Pretty Arhat

588
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,410
ran to Mount Song all the way.

589
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,980
They kneed in the front door of

590
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,620
Shaoling Temple
for three days and nights

591
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,050
to ask the big monk to come out and
uphold justice for them.

592
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,380
Guess what happened to that old guy,
Ci Mu?

593
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,500
He couldn't sit still.

594
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,900
He is calling on all sects jointly to
crusade against the Ghost Valley.

595
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,260
Leader Zhao, please join in
at that time.

596
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,410
Sincerely.

597
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,100
Father, what's your view?

598
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,570
I don't have any view.

599
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,140
These sects are all hypocrites.

600
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,170
Back then,

601
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,410
they were all looking on
at our trouble with aloofness

602
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,410
when the Ghost Valley was against us..

603
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
Now,

604
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,330
they have a taste of the trouble
and know the felling.

605
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,410
It's not that easy to

606
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
invite the Five Lakes Alliance
to take up an official post.

607
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,570
If they want me to participate,

608
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,740
they need to show their sincerity.

609
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,020
Father, I don't understand.

610
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,810
Son,

611
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,450
you're still so young
and lack of experience.

612
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,050
It was the same for Gao Chong

613
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,900
who didn't understand this all his life.

614
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,740
Think about it.

615
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,690
Among the bad things made
by the Ghost Valley,

616
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,450
the main of them is focused on us

617
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,980
except the little ones.

618
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,290
But why does Gao Chong choose to

619
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,330
hold a hell meeting of heroes
at this time?

620
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,020
The people attended are all nobody.

621
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,660
They were just to join in the fun.

622
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,530
None of the famous sects

623
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,140
came.

624
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,900
Right.

625
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,530
None of the biggest eight sects came.

626
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,860
Eventhe Changming Sword Immortal
only sent

627
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,860
one disciple to take part in it.

628
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,220
So, my son,

629
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,010
these famous and orthodox sects in
the martial arts world

630
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,330
are either blinded by gain and greed

631
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,140
or fishing for fame and credit.

632
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,730
Their plans are stingy and everyone
wants to get the most benefits.

633
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,010
If you want to let them fight against
the Ghost Valley together,

634
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,860
it is impossible with only Justice
but not benefit.

635
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,900
So is the opposite.

636
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,900
So you need to paint a big cake

637
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,010
and put justice and benefit into it

638
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,250
to attract these sects.

639
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,100
Good boy, if you're full,

640
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,620
take care of my Ah Xiang.

641
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,900
Behave yourself.

642
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,970
Who is yours?

643
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,360
[Li Mansion]

644
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,700
Xiao Hong and Da Hong.

645
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,380
Choose one to ride.

646
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,250
I've prepared the food and water
for you.

647
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
We can say goodbye here.

648
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,700
Ah Xiang, why are you still angry
at me?

649
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,250
I'm not.

650
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,010
I'm the servant of Master,

651
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,900
so of course I'll follow him.

652
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,810
Just go back to
your Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

653
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,730
Ah Xiang, I'm wrong.

654
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,100
Please don't be angry.

655
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,250
Who says you're wrong?

656
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,860
You're the young master
of the famous sect.

657
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,620
I'm just a country girl.

658
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,250
We're not the same kind of people.

659
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,180
Who says you're a country girl?

660
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,180
Brother Win.

661
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,050
Master.

662
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,770
Aren't you mine?

663
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,810
Does that mean I am a rustic?

664
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,810
Cao Wei Ning,
do you have your purse?

665
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,180
Yes, yes.

666
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,290
I don't want this servant anymore.

667
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,420
I can sell her to you at the price of
three silver coins.

668
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,810
If you want her,
just give me the money.

669
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,180
And you can't regret
after finishing the trade.

670
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,900
Master, you, you're a bastard.

671
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,810
See? This cunning servant is
bullying her master.

672
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,220
I…

673
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,140
How can I keep her anymore?

674
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,380
How about this?
I'll give you a 50% discount.

675
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,860
One and a half silver coins.
Don't think it's expensive.

676
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,180
My Ah Xu is so capable that

677
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,140
he is worth only three silver coins.

678
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,570
What are you laughing?

679
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,970
Zhou Xu, take control of him.

680
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,140
How could I take control of him?

681
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,900
If you don't, then who will do it?

682
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,050
So savage.

683
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
I can give her to you for free.
I don't need her anymore.

684
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,530
Take her.

685
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,900
Brother Wen.

686
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,380
With God witnessing,

687
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,940
I never think Ah Xiang is

688
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,660
a servant.

689
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,900
Thanks you for believing
and handing her to me.

690
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,420
After telling my master,

691
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,970
I'll take the formal procedures
to make an

692
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,330
offer of marriage
and provide the dowry

693
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,530
without any slight.

694
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,490
Dowry?

695
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,570
Is it prepared by the families of bride?

696
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
You know nothing about it.

697
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,470
Ah Xiang.

698
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,190
[Li Mansion]

699
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,090
Scorpion, help me
make a book of the ghosts.

700
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,500
Spread it to the martial arts world.

701
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,090
Now we have allied with each other.

702
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,410
Why do we regret it?

703
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,500
Father, if you spread this book to

704
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,540
the martial arts world,

705
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,570
it's cutting off the back ways of them.

706
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,540
Then,

707
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,780
how could I drive them
to do things later?

708
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,650
Scorpion,

709
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,740
Now Shaolin Temple
has come forward,

710
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,370
and this pot of soup is
in a perfect status.

711
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,500
Besides,

712
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,940
what is the use of
this gang of ghosts?

713
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,570
The traps are all set.

714
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,050
All we need to do is
driving the prey into them.

715
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,410
Still don't understand?

716
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,410
Since we want to
wipe out the Ghost Valley,

717
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,300
who are they going to kill

718
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,650
if the ghosts are outside?

719
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,260
Think that where they can go

720
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,540
if they lost the protection of me

721
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,650
and can't make any step in the world.

722
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,180
So your meaning is
leaving them no choice and

723
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,850
forcing them

724
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,180
back to the Ghost Valley.

725
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,460
But, Father,

726
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,610
what if they say something
when they get out?

727
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,780
Who will believe in them?

728
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,850
Besides,

729
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,330
the case that Gao Chong colluded
with the Ghost Valley

730
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,980
was an unsolved case.

731
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,650
And it's pending up to now.

732
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,850
Although it can be paused
and not mentioned,

733
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,780
it still has a bad influence to us

734
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,220
more or less.

735
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,130
So at this time,

736
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,980
I hope these bad guys can have
dogfights within them.

737
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,980
We'll take the opportunity
to find one of them

738
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,050
to testify for us.

739
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,370
The Ghost Valley framed
the Five Lakes Alliance was

740
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,410
to split the martial arts world.

741
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,300
We were suffering an injustice.

742
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,180
Once our sin is washed out,

743
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,610
Brother Gao Chong won't see it
at that time.

744
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,300
Then tell me if the sects

745
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,020
would be very embarrassed?

746
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,410
I'll lead all sects
to clear the Ghost Valley.

747
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,180
I'll get the power and reputation

748
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,020
with the apology from all sects.

749
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,740
Now if there's
an election of the chief,

750
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,090
who can be it except me.

751
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,980
Father,

752
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,460
how could you be so brilliant?

753
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,180
Even Zhu Ge Liang is brought
back to life,

754
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:31,610
he will be ashamed to
compare with your intelligence.

755
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,940
You little barbarian
really have a silken tongue

756
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,940
to make me happy.

757
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,740
How could this little trick of mine

758
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,410
compare to the ancient oracle?

759
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,090
[It's only that we hear nothing
from Lovelace until now.]

760
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,090
[Normally,]

761
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,850
[Yu Qiu Feng is no match for him.]

762
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,980
[He must hide]

763
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,500
[because he finds something wrong.]

764
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
[It doesn't matter.]

765
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,570
[Now, all the sects]

766
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,740
[are searching you for me.]

767
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,570
[Let's see where you can hide.]
