[Episode 21]

23
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,600
Greetings, Scorpion King.

24
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,910
Here we all are, Ghost brothers.

25
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,550
How come you are angry?

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,670
Get away!

27
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,750
Ghost brothers,

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,110
why so sissy and angry?

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,360
Whom are you scaring?

30
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,720
Enough!

31
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,960
Scorpion King,

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,600
the reason why we follow Chief Zhao

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,910
is we are tired of fighting and killing.

34
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,830
We wanna quit.

35
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,470
The Fairy Ray Sect has nothing to do
with our Ghost Valley.

36
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,270
Well,

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
leave it.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,960
What a coincidence!

39
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,600
What Chief Zhao likes

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,110
are all your skills of killing.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,670
Devils don’t kill?

42
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,800
Then live on farms and lease?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,880
Even Chief Zhao doesn’t dare to

44
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,830
talk to our leader this way!

45
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,630
You brat!

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,470
You brat!

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Here is some powder for deodorization.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,080
You wicked witch, how dare you to poison?

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,190
Bring me the antidote!

50
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,670
How dare you?

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,110
In my presence,

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,240
Should you be rude to our allies!

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,240
Please give him the antidote.

54
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,550
Yes.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Chief Zhao asked everyone here
to wipe out Fairy Ray Sect,

56
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,630
for his own purpose.

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,110
If all of you are not willing,

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,160
we could just quit the deal

59
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,910
in a kind manner.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,270
However, in the future,

61
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,440
allied or not, it all depends.

62
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,600
Brother Changing, am I right?

63
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,790
Scorpion King, not that worse.

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,720
The puny Fairy Ray Sect,

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,510
if Chief Zhao wants to wipe it out,

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,640
I will just follow your order.

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,070
If so, very good.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
By the way,

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,070
I will send my Pretty Arhat
to go with you,

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,070
just in case.

71
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,640
Brothers!

72
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,160
Let’s go.

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,720
Evil Bodhisattva,

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,200
tell Pretty Arhat,

75
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,350
leave some survivors

76
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,720
to send out the news.

77
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,070
Send out the news?

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,510
To whom?

79
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,720
To the entire world of martial arts.

80
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,390
Saying that
the century-long Fairy Ray Sect is vanished

81
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,600
by the Ghost Valley.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,000
I will see who could stay aloof.

83
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,070
Changing,

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,880
you rank first in the Top Ten Devils List,

85
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
but why quit your title as a master,

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,350
and go to serve these brats?

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,600
Happy!

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,270
Really happy!

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,480
Though the lunatic Wen is crazy,

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,640
for better or worse, he is in our boat.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,600
If we sank,

92
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,950
he won’t survive.

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
Since we’ve entered the Ghost Valley,

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,000
is going back a choice?

95
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,000
Is there a way to live if we don’t go back?

96
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,320
Wen Ke Xing aside first,

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,070
that crazy guy is mentally unstable.

98
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,200
Just the current crazy deeds of the Ghost Valley

99
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,920
are deliberately putting the entire world

100
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,350
in opposition against us,

101
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,950
while worrying the rest can’t hate us more.

102
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,550
If Gao Chong survives this catastrophe,

103
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
and brings back his gang
for another War of Mount Qingya ...

104
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,000
Nonsense!

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,440
Is what Zhao Jing does

106
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,950
different from the lunatic Wen’s deed?

107
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,320
What Zhao wants is no more than a war

108
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,510
between Ghost Valley and those righteous clans.

109
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,350
He wants both to die out.

110
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,000
Brother Changing.

111
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,830
You serve Zhao Jing as a flunkey,

112
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,950
and may earn a good ending.

113
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,270
But Brother Happy and I will not.

114
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,390
Both of us have purely bloody hands,

115
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,040
and can’t be well treated by justice.

116
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,760
We both serve Zhao Jing as his blade,

117
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,230
what kind of good ending we could expect?

118
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,270
Brother Lovelace,

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,480
does it make any sense to say so now?

120
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,440
It’s been accepted that
we had betrayed the lunatic Wen,

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,200
and converted to Zhao Jing’s power,

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,670
which at least left us one way out.

123
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,070
If you don’t reconcile to it,

124
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,790
you could just go back to the Valley,

125
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,040
and beg the lunatic Wen

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,350
for his mercy.

127
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,950
You,

128
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,230
are still young in the Valley.

129
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,270
You may not know

130
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,440
how the lunatic Wen
took the Throne of the Ghost Valley?

131
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,000
It was said

132
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,200
when he usurped the throne,

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,000
in everyone’s presence,
he ate the former chief of Valley

134
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,600
piece by piece,

135
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,720
which totally frightened everyone.

136
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,790
Fake!

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,350
He did it in front of everyone,

138
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,640
peeling off the skin of the former chief.

139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
The Valley Chief.

140
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,480
From today on,

141
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,670
I'm the supreme!

142
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,440
So,

143
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Uncle Wen met you when he was a kid,

144
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,710
but why the grand master didn’t take him back?

145
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,840
The grand master was occupied
by important affairs,

146
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,710
and couldn’t go with the seriously wounded.

147
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,710
So he promised that in three months,

148
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,760
he would take them back to Four Seasons Manor.

149
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,030
Yet things went out of expectation.

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,470
When they went back to that village,

151
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,840
the entire village was leveled off.

152
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,880
This issue,

153
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,590
has then become a hidden scar
of your grand master.

154
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,030
It was not until
my junior fellow Qin Jiu Xiao grew up,

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
and went through
the ceremony of inviting teaching,

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,470
the grand master said
my junior fellow ranked the third.

157
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I then know,

158
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,350
my grand master regretted it so much.

159
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
Actually he was already saved,

160
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,840
but couldn't make it to be with you.

161
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,550
That would be so sad for me.

162
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
It was so close

163
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,440
that master could have grown up with you.

164
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,910
So he had recognized you before you knew it.

165
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,840
But

166
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,440
why he didn’t admit he is Zhen Yan?

167
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,400
Zhen Ru Yu is the adopted son of Old Zhen
from Healer Valley.

168
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,790
We thought his original family name was “Wen”,

169
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,710
so not willing to hear the word of “Zhen”.

170
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,880
Why not willing?

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,520
Because the Former Valley Chief Zhen
expelled them out of his school.

172
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,440
So how was Chevalier Zhen later on?

173
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,230
Master.

174
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,200
Enough, kid.

175
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
Don’t touch the tender spot.

176
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,000
Look at Wen Ke Xing’s virtues,

177
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,910
did he get any family education?

178
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,880
My Senior.

179
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,030
You, you mean that

180
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,030
maybe Chevalier Zhen

181
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,110
maybe the couple of  Zhen has already died.

182
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,230
This must be your master’s hidden scar.

183
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,520
If he doesn’t mention it,

184
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,550
don’t mention it first, did you hear that?

185
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,320
Good kid.

186
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,400
No matter he accepts me as his senior,

187
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,110
I will always accept him as my junior fellow.

188
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
I am just sad that

189
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,790
such a good guy of Chevalier Zhen,

190
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,640
didn’t get a good ending.

191
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,710
Master.

192
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,200
why
good people always don’t live with good ending?

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,150
Neither did Dad,

194
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,440
Uncle Long,

195
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,230
and the Zhens.

196
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
Even Uncle Rong Xuan,

197
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,760
did nothing evil.

198
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,640
Destiny is hard to tell.

199
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,790
Life is hard to expect.

200
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,400
People in love all suffer.

201
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,960
Not just good guys.

202
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,520
Ah Xu, I noted your good deeds kind of paid off.

203
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,320
You almost...

204
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Uncle Wen

205
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,910
No, master,

206
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,440
can I call you master?

207
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,960
Old Monster, why are you still here?

208
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,760
You can be here,

209
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,110
why can’t I?

210
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,280
We are going to Four Seasons Manor?

211
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,150
Why do you follow us?

212
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,520
You take your way, I will take mine.

213
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,910
None of your business!

214
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,960
I can even go to the Devil’s castle,

215
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,910
let alone a Manor.

216
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,840
Fine.

217
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,350
The Leader of the Manor is here,

218
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,960
if he accepts your visit,

219
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,230
I will not interfere.

220
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,280
If Senior Ye is willing to stay
in Four Seasons Manor,

221
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,670
we will of course be pleased to welcome you.

222
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,910
We’ve long heard your great name
as a divine husband-wife match of doctors,

223
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,910
both of you are elites in elites,
what a divine couple you are!

224
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,200
But how come gave birth to such an annoying kid,

225
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,150
what a pity.

226
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,150
However, no matter what to say,

227
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,640
you are always their kid.

228
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,640
My bastard disciple betrayed your parents,

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,230
this debt,

230
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,590
I am supposed to pay back as his master.

231
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,230
You brat!

232
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,230
Tell me your wish,

233
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,960
Listen.

234
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,000
The dead can't come back to life.

235
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,030
This is the only thing I can't do.

236
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,030
I am afraid there aren't many things

237
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,230
beyond my reach.

238
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,280
Any wish, just tell me.

239
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,350
I will surely help you realize it.

240
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,840
listen,

241
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
I am not helping you,

242
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,880
this is what you deserve.

243
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,350
Wen Ke Xing.

244
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,000
Please tell me your wish,

245
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,230
otherwise,

246
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,550
I am afraid, in the end,

247
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,910
I won't die in peace in the end.

248
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,640
I actually don't wish anything,

249
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,110
only except if you could cure Ah Xu,

250
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,230
then all our previous debts are clear.

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,760
But please ensure his life span
and martial arts achievements are at no risk.

252
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,710
You brat!

253
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,550
Do you think I will get stuck?

254
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,960
Though I don't have the solution,

255
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,880
I know who does.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,880
You guys just stay in Four Seasons Manor,

257
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,400
and rest assured to wait for me.

258
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,470
My Senior.

259
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,350
Whom are you looking for?

260
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,640
and how long shall we wait for you?

261
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,590
If he can't save you,

262
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,110
I will...

263
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,550
Old Monster!

264
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,230
Ye Bai Yi!

265
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,200
How is he like a hundred-year-old man?

266
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,440
Being upset like a child.

267
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,400
Old Monster, you mean

268
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,470
his wound is curable?

269
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,230
He likes bragging that much,

270
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,080
how do I know he will finally say

271
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,590
I will cut off my head

272
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,400
or I will host your funeral?

273
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,030
You heard it?

274
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,550
Your master's wound can be cured.

275
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,000
What a great piece of news!

276
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,150
Senior Ye is so capable,

277
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
when he said so, so it surely is.

278
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,470
We can go home now.

279
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,000
We, go home.

280
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,470
Father,

281
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,150
Your calligraphy looks
more and more vigorous and integrated now.

282
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I like it so much.

283
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,710
Could you chop on it and send it to me?

284
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,280
You little barbarian.

285
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,590
Just good at flattery.

286
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,760
Will everything I have

287
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,080
not belong to you?

288
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,550
Here you are,  get it well packed.

289
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,760
Brother, Qiu Feng is coming.

290
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,280
Why even I am skipped?

291
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,280
Please invite Leader Yu to come in.

292
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,760
Brother.

293
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,710
I miss you so much.

294
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,910
Brother, it's been days since we met,

295
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,280
but you look better than ever.

296
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,520
How have you been Junior Fellow Yu.

297
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,880
Nowadays the Yueyang Sect is in good order,

298
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,230
and strictly guarded.

299
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,640
Compared to the late Gao...

300
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,350
When the late Gao Chong was in charge,
so different.

301
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,910
The tea is still as good as it was.

302
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,000
My brother,

303
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,150
I haven't heard from you for a long time.

304
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,160
You even didn't show up in the Heroes Conference.

305
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,520
Maybe,

306
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,760
you got stuck in some odds?

307
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,310
Brother?

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,350
On the day when the Heroes Conference was held,

309
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,470
repeated accidents.

310
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,760
Brother, I heard after you took charge of
the Five Lakes Alliance,

311
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,430
you got lots of things done,
so vigorously and speedily,

312
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,760
but why just leave this issue untouched?

313
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,830
Your esteemed Alliance
endured numerous hardships,

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,470
but only took back a tragicomic ghost,

315
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,230
then got it robbed away for no reason.

316
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,350
And you as the Chief,

317
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,310
why paid no attention to it?

318
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,760
What’s it?

319
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,230
Well, it helps nothing.

320
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,190
I just

321
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,310
heard some rumors,

322
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,110
saying that
the Tragicomic Ghost is called Luo Fu Meng,

323
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,400
your fiancee.

324
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,470
You broke the engagement on your wedding day,

325
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,710
and eloped with the daughter of the wealthy

326
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,470
Observer in West Zhejiang.

327
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,760
This newly-married bridegroom
felt greatly humiliated,

328
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,950
so angry that she got crazy.

329
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,280
Ever since,

330
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,110
a fair lady disappeared,

331
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,190
a She-Demon only kills unfaithful male emerged.

332
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,950
Brother.

333
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,190
I think it can't be true.

334
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,430
You are always honest and upright,

335
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,040
and in deep love with your late wife.

336
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,920
Eh...

337
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,950
How is it possible for you
to do such absurd things?

338
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,280
Tea, take some tea.

339
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,040
I've got the slanderer severely tortured.

340
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,400
And hurried to come and warn you brother.

341
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,280
Please be noted that
upon your taking charge of the Alliance,

342
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,710
great ambitions are to be realized,

343
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,800
you must take precautions against

344
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,000
those slanderers outside

345
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,470
who do harm to your reputation.

346
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,760
Good tea, please enjoy.

347
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,000
Good tea, good tea.

348
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,520
These bygones,

349
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,800
where did Yu Qiu Feng know them from?

350
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,040
My henchmen
I sent to transfer the Tragicomic Ghost,

351
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,190
did succeed at first,

352
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,350
but finally all died in Yueyang Sect.

353
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,950
Does it mean Fu Meng is kept by this guy?

354
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,070
This rat should dare to
make up such rumors for you!

355
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,520
I will wipe out his Mount Hua Sect.

356
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,950
Father, please don't get pissed off.

357
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,800
Anger harms your body.

358
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,560
What am I angry at?

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
Yu Qiu Feng is merely a clown.

360
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,680
If a dog bites you,

361
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,710
does it make sense to bite it in return?

362
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,000
A mad dog, beat it to death.

363
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,400
Aye, Father.

364
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,190
Let me go to pull out his tongue.

365
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,310
Hold!

366
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,230
Scorpion.

367
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,280
How many times have I told you?

368
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,070
You are always imprudent and rash.

369
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,070
Mount Hua Sect
is also a noble and official school,

370
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,350
their Leader just left our perimeter,

371
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,640
then died immediately,

372
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,590
are you not inviting gossips?

373
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,760
Forget it!

374
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,760
The less trouble, the better.

375
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
Let's wait until they leave Yueyang.

376
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,400
But Father,

377
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,160
This guy slandered you so seriously,

378
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,350
I can't take it anymore.

379
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,880
If those rumors are heard outside,

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,800
what am I afraid of?

381
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,430
A straight foot is not afraid of a crooked shoe.

382
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
Besides, if I want to take his life,

383
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,560
is it not with whenever or wherever ease?

384
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,710
Okay.

385
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,920
Qingcheng Sect is waiting for me,

386
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,880
to plot an attack against the Ghost Valley.

387
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,830
You can disband now.

388
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,760
Yes.

389
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,640
If Fu Meng is really kept by Yu Qiu Feng,

390
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,000
Doesn't matter!

391
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,350
Father, any order?

392
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,920
Help me send Ghosts a letter.

393
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,040
Father, most people in Ghost Valley

394
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,710
have been assigned to Fairy Ray Sect,

395
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,230
and now only Lovelace is defending the fort.

396
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,430
He is enough.

397
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,070
Yes.

398
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,950
Ah Xu,

399
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,640
you guys go further to look for inns.

400
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,590
My wine is drunk up,

401
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,470
buy me more,

402
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,950
so remember to fill up my wine bag.

403
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,640
I owe you.

404
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,710
Am I your home-born flunkey?

405
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,230
By the way, fill up my wine pot as well.

406
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,640
So you want Zhuyeqing or Nv'erhong?

407
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,040
As you please.

408
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,830
Uncle Wen

409
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,230
Fill it up with Kaoliang spirit.

410
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,110
OK, Sir.

411
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,280
Girls of the Division of the Unfaithful,

412
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,800
should found this place.

413
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,070
Was it because Ah Xiang guided them here?

414
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,280
Firstly we hid after Ghoul for several days.

415
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,350
Later on, except the lady Xiang,

416
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,350
no one came to meet us in private.

417
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,070
Once upset, Ghoul lost his control again,

418
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,110
crying for eating human flesh everyone,

419
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,590
and looking at us with hungry eyes.

420
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,710
Quite intimidating.

421
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,190
Then we got him drunk,

422
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,560
and ran away from him silently.

423
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,830
Later Sister Beauty Ghost's message
was sent to us,

424
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,880
saying she had saved the master,

425
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,280
and accompanied her for rehabilitation.

426
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,110
She warned us not to make a rash act.

427
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,710
So since then you have never met

428
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,110
anyone else from the Ghost Valley?

429
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,640
Yes.

430
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,760
Except Lady Xiang and Sister Beauty Ghost.

431
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,760
We, a group of girls, are weak in martial arts.

432
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,800
If there was no protection
from the Valley Chief and the Master,

433
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,230
I am afraid we would be everyone's prey.

434
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,070
We've been hiding for quite many days.

435
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,710
Later the storm gradually subsided.

436
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,230
Lady Xiang said you are in Shu.

437
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,590
We've been searching around
for the Valley Chief's trace.

438
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,470
Thank heaven, we were lucky enough to

439
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,920
encounter the Valley Chief.

440
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,040
The Valley Chief.

441
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,190
For our dozens of sisters
under the Manager of the unfaithful,

442
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,520
where should we go?

443
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,230
Please give your instruction.

444
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,470
Do you have any idea?

445
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,400
We...

446
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,760
We...

447
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
We all listen to you, My Chief.

448
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
I meant where do you want to go?

449
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,160
Well, if you don't have any other instruction,

450
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,830
then we will go back to Mount Qingya,

451
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,590
and wait for you to be back.

452
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,710
The world is so vast without any no-go area.

453
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,070
Is the damned Mount your only choice?

454
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,350
The Valley Chief.

455
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,920
We are all

456
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,640
ill-fated girls, driven into a corner.

457
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,520
Everyone of us was saved by the Master
at the end the rope.

458
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,760
We are all willing to
serve as bondmen and bondwomen in return.

459
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,520
The world is so vast,

460
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,760
but we would only reluctantly count

461
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,950
the Ghost Valley as our home.

462
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,590
Now that we've entered Ghost Valley,

463
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,470
either to hunt,

464
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,190
or being hunted.

465
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,430
Now that you can't even protect yourselves,

466
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,280
does it make any sense to go back there?

467
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,830
From now on, wherever you go,

468
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,350
no more step into Mount Qingya again.

469
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,470
Whoever disobedient will die.

470
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,880
Aye, aye.

471
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,350
Where did you go?

472
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,160
What happened?

473
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,560
Discipline my disciple for me.

474
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,070
He is so unruly!

475
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,400
Beat him, scold him, as you please.

476
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,470
It's your disciple,

477
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,110
now you know he should be in my charge.

478
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,710
It's almost midnight, I wanna sleep.

479
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,470
Little brat, what mess do you wanna make?

480
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,880
I begged my master for a bedtime story,

481
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,710
but it was a really poor one.

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,830
That story he told,

483
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,920
even more cut-and-dried than books teachers read.

484
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,760
How good you were!

485
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,590
And how come always turn up your noses,

486
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,310
and put forward such rude demands?

487
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,560
Kids really can't be spoiled.

488
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,430
Uncle Wen, tell me one more story, please.

489
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,590
Your story must be more amusing than my master's.

490
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,830
Sister Xiang once told me,

491
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,000
you have lots of rare and weird stories.

492
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,950
Such as the Red Kid split a mountain
to save a White Snake,

493
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,430
Jiang Ziya fought with White Bone Demon,

494
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,710
-and ... -Stop, stop, stop.

495
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,110
Why does this girl tell you everything?

496
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,880
Good master, I beg you.

497
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,830
Tell me one story.

498
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,710
I will never get that master angry anymore.

499
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,110
My good master,

500
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,160
Only women and villains are hard to feed.

501
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,470
Well, I am telling you one.

502
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,760
Once upon a time,

503
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,310
there was a monk wading in a desert,

504
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,710
unfortunately,
he encountered a throng of wolves,

505
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,560
and was driven desperate.

506
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,230
Suddenly he found a well ahead of him.

507
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,640
No way,

508
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,310
he could only crawl into the dry well
along the rope in it.

509
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,350
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

510
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,560
Unexpectedly, on his half way in the well,

511
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,350
he found a host of snakes,

512
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,430
hissing with their spitting tongues.

513
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,920
It was really touching
neither the sky nor the ground,

514
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,040
and no way ahead while being chased from behind.

515
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,230
At that very moment,

516
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,880
he found a honeycomb on the wall in the well.

517
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,880
Honey bees, buzzing and flying around,

518
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,430
and attacking him.

519
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,590
He was stung to unspeakable misery.

520
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,710
What was worse,

521
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,830
the rope he held in the well,

522
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,560
couldn't hold his weight,

523
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,110
and was slowly sliding down.

524
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,110
Suddenly,

525
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,160
he found that from the honeycomb in the well,

526
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,470
honey was oozing.

527
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,040
He put out his finger,

528
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,070
slightly scratched some honey off,

529
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,920
and put it his mouth

530
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,070
while whole-heartedly sucking it. Look at

531
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,280
my life, it is like a dream and a floating bubble.

532
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,920
What people desperately pursue,

533
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,590
is nothing more than pleasure like that honey.

534
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,400
Beauty Ghost,

535
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,590
you should help an outsider to block me!

536
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,430
Cut the cackle!

537
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,760
In so many years,

538
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,310
this is my very first time
to see your true feature.

539
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,040
Get away!

540
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,800
You don't fail me,

541
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,830
and I won't turn my back on you.

542
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,280
You don't fail me,

543
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,470
Master, run.

544
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,280
The mad lady has gone mad again,

545
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,800
Beauty Ghost, what do you think?

546
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,640
You would rather hide here,

547
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,830
and stay with this old dog Yu Qiu Feng,

548
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,880
rather than turn to me for help.

549
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,160
It's so good of you.

550
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
Not that worse than I thought.

551
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,070
If you dare to touch me,

552
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,040
the Valley Chief will surely cut you into pieces.

553
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,000
A woman like you,

554
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,400
really silly and stupid.

555
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,350
Jing.

556
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,830
Jing.

557
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,880
Jing.

558
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,160
Jing.

559
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,710
Scorpion King,

560
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,920
Scorpion King, what are you doing here?

561
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,040
Are you entitled to ask me this question?

562
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,950
Jing, where is Yu Qiu Feng?

563
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,350
Jing.

564
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,310
Who are these two women?

565
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,280
Well, she,

566
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
she is the well-known Beauty Ghost.

567
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,880
Her mistress the Leader abandoned her

568
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,590
and ran away alone.

569
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,310
Beauty Ghost,

570
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,680
Henchman of the tragicomic ghost,

571
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,880
ranks the last in Top Ten Ghosts.

572
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh dear,

573
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,640
so you are the Beauty Ghost.

574
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,590
I am confident with unmatchable beauty.

575
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,520
It is said the Beauty Ghost conquered
the martial arts world with the best beauty,

576
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,830
but regrettably blind and slow in the brain.

577
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,110
I've been looking forward to seeing her.

578
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,800
Lady Green Siren,

579
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,710
you are really known as to meet.

580
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,800
Look at this face,

581
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,110
which makes my heart restless,

582
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,680
while

583
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,830
my throat speechless.

584
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,640
With such a face, we would call her beauty?

585
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,280
You think everyone is a born beauty like me?

586
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,160
For her, she found a master.

587
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,000
Such little wound or scar,

588
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,560
it doesn't matter at all.

589
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,110
Even wearing the same make-up
of the moon goddess Chang'e,

590
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,830
it also works.

591
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,950
And this woman is her Master.

592
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,280
Owner of the List of the Unfaithful,
Tragicomic Ghost.

593
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,640
But what a pity, she's gone mad,

594
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,110
and out of her mind now.

595
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,280
Jing.

596
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,350
Jing, where are you?

597
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,710
Jing.

598
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
Jing.

599
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,950
Jing.

600
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,230
Jing, where are you?

601
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,230
What did you say?

602
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,110
Jing.

603
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,190
Jing.

604
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,110
I never thought that Scorpion King,
at such a young age...,

605
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,280
Jing, should have such an abnormal taste.

606
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,880
In front of such a madwoman,

607
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,640
you are such a lovelace.

608
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,830
What, Jing,

609
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,920
are you scared?

610
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,040
Jing.

611
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,160
Scorpion King and Lovelace deserve to die.

612
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,350
It was him who offended you.

613
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,880
We are sent here by Zhao Jing the Chief.

614
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,070
Jing.

615
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,040
Jing, you are here.

616
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,310
Jing.

617
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,000
Jing, where are you?

618
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,590
where are you?

619
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,710
Jing.

620
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,110
where are you?

621
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,710
My Master, Jing.

622
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,710
Jing, where are you?

623
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,710
I would beg you

624
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,560
for leaving her alone.

625
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,110
She has gone mad,

626
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,400
show your mercy and let her go.

627
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,590
Beg me one more time.

628
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,000
I would beg you

629
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,470
I would beg you

630
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,710
Let her go.

631
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,800
Let her go.

632
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,760
Stop.

633
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,160
Stop.

634
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
This crap brings himself here.

635
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,590
Let her go.

636
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,040
Why?

637
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,430
A piece of glazed armor.

638
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,000
Let her go first.

639
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,760
I’ll take you there for it.

640
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,280
Qian Qiao,

641
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,230
Qian Qiao,

642
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,670
Qian Qiao,

643
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,840
Qian Qiao, my apology.

644
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,190
I, Yu Qiu Feng, is...

645
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,040
a coward and despicable villain,

646
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,710
I should chose to flee in front of catastrophe.

647
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,150
Qian Qiao,

648
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,840
I’m home.

649
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,950
I won't leave anymore.

650
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,710
Enough, enough, stop singing.

651
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,910
No matter how well you sing,

652
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,760
you still can't wipe out

653
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,360
your evil reputation of the first cheater
in the world.

654
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,000
What do you mean by that?

655
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,230
Your Majesty may not know,

656
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,800
this lady was given the nickname of Green Siren,

657
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,430
and kind of well known for her beauty
in the martial arts world.

658
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,870
Only pitiful that her eyes are blind,

659
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,670
and then conquered and cheated by Yu Qiu Feng.

660
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,190
Who would know it that?

661
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,150
Yu Qiu Feng's wife,

662
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,630
is a well-known jealous woman.

663
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,800
Who once caught this lady,

664
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,390
peeled off her clothes,

665
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,630
and forced her to parade in the streets

666
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,430
naked along the way

667
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,320
from Hua Mountain till Chang'an.

668
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,950
This anecdote,

669
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,320
caused a great flutter then.

670
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
The funny thing is,

671
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,950
from the beginning to the end,

672
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,630
this lady's mistress

673
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,080
totally shut up.

674
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,670
So she can't stay in the martial arts world
any more.

675
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,560
It is said she went to the Ghost Valley.

676
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,230
And Yu Qiu Feng

677
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,870
found a new mistress, who should be

678
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,800
the lady's sister!!

679
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,190
Then I think not only her face is wounded,

680
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,470
so is her brain.

681
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,870
It was me who had mixed motives.

682
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,760
HIis Glazed Armor is fake.

683
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,230
Previously
I just wanted to take advantage of him

684
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,470
to save my Master.

685
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,430
Yet things went out of expectation.

686
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,760
It's still worthy that
I entangled with him half my life.

687
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,430
Feng,

688
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
you only allow yourself to cheat me,

689
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,360
while not allowing yourself to be cheated by me.

690
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,630
I beg you for letting my Master go.

691
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,120
Qian Qiao is willing to work as a bondwoman

692
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,950
to serve you with my life.

693
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,560
How come did this female Demon
who once rode the whirlwind

694
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,120
become an idiot now?

695
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,120
She developed a symptom of soul departure,

696
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,080
and once sipped Water of Lethe.

697
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,800
So clouded in mind, blurred in memory,

698
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,470
already paralyzed.

699
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,520
Water of Lethe

700
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,710
is the herb tea that everyone of us who was

701
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,390
willing to enter the Ghost Valley has to drink.

702
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,000
It enables you to
forget your strongest addiction.

703
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,040
Evil Bodhisattva,

704
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,520
bring these two women
back to Scorpion's branch fort.

705
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,390
You must play it by ear,

706
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,670
and by all means don't let anyone find out.

707
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,520
Wow,

708
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,630
You don't fail me,

709
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,950
and I won't turn my back on you.

710
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,670
Master.

711
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,000
The food is ready.

712
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,600
Cheng Ling,

713
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,000
you seem to have grown taller
than when you were in Tai Lake.

714
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,040
Thank you, Master.

715
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,190
For what?

716
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,840
Ever since we met,

717
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,080
You seem to have been bustling about for me.

718
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Needless to feel sorry for him.

719
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,520
Your Master, embodiment of the Bodhisattva,

720
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,910
being destined to help others,

721
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,670
no wonder bustling around
for helping people in need.

722
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,670
You already got drunk even in the day.

723
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,670
Waiter, come here.

724
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,630
Here here, bring my brothers some water.

725
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,560
Here it is, Young Master.

726
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
I will go get some more.

727
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,840
As long as I am alive,

728
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,710
waiter,

729
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,390
I'm not done with you.

730
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,710
Who are they in that gang?

731
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,710
Why are they wounded?

732
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,230
Sir, they are young Masters of Fairy Ray Sect.

733
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,710
Two days ago Fairy Ray Sect was set on fire,

734
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,040
and it is said Chevalier Bai the Leader died.

735
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,840
Damn!

736
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,390
[Water]
What Ghost Valley?

737
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,390
Sounds quite fearful.

738
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,800
What do you think, Bodhisattva Zhou?

739
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,190
Do you need the glaring temple door god
to vanquish demons and monsters?

740
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,840
How disgusting!

741
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,470
A smell of burnt food.

742
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,710
These deserters of the Fairy Ray Sect,

743
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,950
didn't even know to
bury the bodies of their brothers.

744
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,120
This Ghost Valley is too furious,

745
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,280
bullying official Sects
when they are a group without head.

746
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,520
Such a pity.

747
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,950
The Leader White has been Chivalric
for more than thirty years.

748
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,280
If we got there two days earlier,

749
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,950
maybe...

750
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,910
Maybe what?

751
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,000
Maybe just come to die
under the Ghost Valley's blades.

752
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,360
Though my martial arts are limited.

753
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,800
But Fairy Ray Sect and Gentle Wind Sword Sect
are best friends.

754
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,320
I should not be afraid to die.

755
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,710
Ah Xiang, safe journey.

756
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,320
Cheng Ling, are you all right?

757
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,800
I am fine, Master.

758
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,280
I am just not used to seeing dead bodies.

759
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,800
Bodhisattva Zhou,

760
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,910
are we not going back to Four Seasons Manor?

761
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,670
Does Fairy Ray Sect's devil day
have anything to do with us?

762
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,150
Cheng Ling,

763
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,320
Have some more water.

764
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,600
to smooth your swallowing.

765
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,230
Lao Wen, follow me.

766
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,710
Ah Xu,

767
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,630
You might become an immortal crow.

768
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,320
Wherever you go, there is death.

769
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,150
I feel you are full of bad luck.

770
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,800
Nope, nope.

771
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,560
I heard that

772
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,150
once there was an owl

773
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,670
that knocked over some red water
from a villager's hands.

774
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,950
Then dozens of villagers died.

775
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,950
Ah Xu, I found your bad-mouth power,

776
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,630
is not less than the owl's.

777
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,600
No interruption!

778
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,470
Those bodies of the Fairy Ray Sect,

779
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,470
they were either cut in the throats,

780
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,630
or died immediately.

781
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,280
Obviously
they were killed by professional assassins.

782
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,150
So,

783
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,710
suppose someone is shoveling the dissidents
in the name of Ghost Valley.

784
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,000
Then plants accusation on the Ghost Valley.

785
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,000
So what is their purpose?

786
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,280
Of course is benefiting themselves.

787
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,230
Before the Heroes Conference,

788
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,760
I firstly thought
Gao Chong was the guy who set up the frame.

789
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,560
But judging it now,

790
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,430
in the Five Lakes Alliance,

791
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,040
actually there is someone else behind the scene.

792
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,150
Shen and Zhao,
respectively pretends to be silly and weak.

793
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,390
I think none of them is innocent.

794
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,190
Gao Chong's torture was caused by this brother.

795
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,280
No matter who really set up the frame,
either Shen or Zhao,

796
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,040
the other guy is by no means better.

797
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,230
Both of them are treacherous,
faithless villains.

798
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,630
Either as a hunter or being hunted,
no one is innocent.

799
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,910
It doesn't matter
if Shen and Zhao are in conclusion,

800
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,710
but in case one of them is evil
while the other is loyal,

801
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,360
we will get the innocent in trouble.

802
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,910
Innocent,

803
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,800
your mercy shows up again.

804
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,230
Who is innocent?

805
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,470
Leave it.

806
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,150
Are we not going to Four Seasons Manor?

807
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,230
Why mention this irritating matter?

808
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,520
Let's go!

809
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,390
