00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,119
<i>Experiencing ten years of ups
and downs in the blood,</i>

371
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,479
<i>I thought an opened window</i>

372
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,719
<i>would bring a ray of sunshine.</i>

373
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,639
<i>I didn’t expect my sacrifice</i>

374
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,839
<i>would have turned benefits for the evil.</i>

375
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,679
<i>For so many years,</i>

376
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,479
<i>Zhou Zi Shu, what have you gotten?</i>

377
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,599
Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle!

378
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,319
Have a drink!

379
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,719
Martial Uncle, there is somebody inside.

380
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,839
It’s me. Open the door.

381
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,199
Wei Ning. It’s Wei Ning.

382
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,519
Hurry up and open the door.
Open the door.

383
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,279
Open the door.

384
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,999
Yes.

385
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,639
Martial Uncle, it’s a girl.

386
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,239
Martial Uncle! Master!

387
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,199
Senior Brother!

388
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,039
What is it?

389
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,839
Wei Lan, are you alright?

390
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,519
Martial Uncle, I’m fine.

391
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,999
Senior Brother has been wounded by the monsters.

392
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,319
The south intersection is
full of ghosts and monsters.

393
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,199
Alright, I know it now.

394
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,479
Go and bandage them now.

395
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,599
Come on.

396
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,319
Little Ah Xiang.

397
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,839
Are you alright?

398
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,479
Martial Uncle, I’m fine.

399
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,319
I’m not afraid.

400
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,279
Those monsters were so stupid that

401
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,119
once we climb up to the trees,

402
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,319
they had no way to catch us.

403
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,479
It’s alright as long as you’re fine.

404
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,119
Martial Uncle, this girl...

405
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,199
Enough.

406
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,639
I’m not that old to fail
in distinguishing girls from boys.

407
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,639
But it’s the forbidden area,
there are...

408
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,639
Forget about it. Emergency has the priority,
don’t you understand?

409
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,199
She’s your Senior Brother Cao’s fiancee.

410
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,999
She will be your sister-in-law in the future.

411
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,719
Let alone she is the one on our side,

412
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,279
even if she is a stranger,

413
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,479
in such a mountain side,

414
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,919
if you don’t allow her inside the cave,

415
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,879
do you have the heart
to let her be snatched by the monsters?

416
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,239
You’re such a nerd.

417
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,359
You... you...

418
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,639
I’ve brought you up in vain...

419
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,060
Martial Uncle.

420
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,070
Martial Uncle.

421
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,119
You’re poisoned?

422
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,279
It doesn’t matter.

423
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,599
It’s just a bite of the monster.

424
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,799
It’s alright.

425
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,719
Martial Uncle.

426
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,439
This is the powder refined
by a friend of my master

427
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,639
to overcome this ptomaine.

428
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,599
Just take it.

429
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,839
Although it’s not that noxious,

430
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,159
it’s hard to eradicate.

431
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,079
With this powder,

432
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,959
you’ll recover when your blood turns red.

433
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,399
Wei Xu, hurry up.
Take the medicine to cure your junior brothers.

434
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,599
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

435
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,039
Hurry up!

436
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,999
Martial Uncle, come.

437
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,679
Go.

438
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,039
Little Ah Xiang,

439
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,959
your master has dealt with these monsters, right?

440
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,559
Master has met them several times.

441
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,279
They used to be alive,

442
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,799
then they were poisoned by someone
with evil witchcraft

443
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,999
and turned into such lifeless monsters.

444
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,039
They’re great in strength and weak in perception,

445
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,519
but they’re clumsy in movement.

446
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,559
You must be careful of their toxic claws.

447
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,839
Practicing witchcraft on living people.

448
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,639
How could the Ghost Valley

449
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,759
do such a heartless thing?

450
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,799
Is it that...

451
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,359
they’re not afraid of being punished by God?

452
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,999
Ghost Valley?

453
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,999
Who said these monsters
were created by the Ghost Valley?

454
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,999
Last night, Four Devils of the Ghost Valley
conducted a sneak attack here

455
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,879
and had been repelled by our Chief.

456
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,759
We’re discussing the counter-measures

457
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,439
and didn’t expect such a batch of monsters
had rushed here.

458
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,359
This Ghost Valley has such owned such a huge army!

459
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,759
These evil demons named Ghosts

460
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,799
can’t be counted as human.

461
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,719
Little Ah Xiang, don’t be afraid.

462
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,439
Here is

463
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,759
the practicing place of ancestors
and predecessors of Mount Qingfeng.

464
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,199
It’s hidden deep into the mountain

465
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,199
and the monsters won’t make their way here.

466
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,479
Martial Uncle.

467
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,319
Where is my master?

468
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,399
Where did my master go?

469
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,399
Why didn’t I see my master?

470
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,359
Martial Uncle.

471
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,039
Master went up the mountain to save us.

472
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,919
I witnessed with my own eyes that

473
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,999
Master walked into the gang of Drug Men.

474
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,039
And then,

475
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,839
he just disappeared.

476
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,679
You’re a doomsayer.

477
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,959
Are you abusing words?

478
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,199
Impossible.

479
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,879
Wei Ning.

480
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,839
It’s impossible.

481
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,999
Wei Ning, don’t listen to his nonsense.

482
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,799
Chief is excellent in martial arts.

483
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,039
Such monsters and ghosts

484
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,519
wouldn’t be able to harm him.

485
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,079
Chief must have targeted at the leader

486
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,879
and went down the mountain for aid.

487
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,679
It’s fine.

488
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,639
Take the leader and collapse the gang.

489
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,519
Since the Four Devils of the Ghost Valley
had all come,

490
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,719
Chief of the Ghost Valley,
Wen Ke Xing must have arrived too.

491
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,319
As long as our Chief kills him...

492
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,319
Martial Uncle.

493
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,279
You just said

494
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,119
Chief of the Lord of Ghost Valley, Wen...?

495
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,479
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

496
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,799
Wen Ke Xing.

497
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,279
Grand Master, Young Martial Uncle.

498
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,959
Brother Han,

499
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,959
ancestors of Four Seasons Manor,
please bless us,

500
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,479
we definitely will get out, safe and sound.

501
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,039
Stop!

502
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,359
You’re going nowhere.

503
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,399
Don’t come over here.

504
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,679
Hold him.

505
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,759
Cute dog, run! Run back home and find Mom.

506
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,639
Zhen Yi Guo.

507
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,519
Release me!

508
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,599
Thank you.

509
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,399
Kid, is your family name Zhen?

510
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,919
It’s not. You are mistaken.

511
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,039
Kid, don’t be afraid!

512
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,839
I’m your Uncle Zhao.

513
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,479
Zhao Jing of Tai Lake Sect.

514
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,999
I’m your parents’ good friend.

515
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,359
Ru Yu and Miao Miao
definitely have mentioned it to you.

516
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,359
Right?

517
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,879
Mom, I’ve met Uncle Zhao Jing!

518
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,559
Mom, I’ve met Uncle Zhao Jing!

519
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,559
Uncle Zhao of the Five Lakes Alliance.

520
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,359
Mom, see?

521
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,359
This is the candied hawthorn
bought by Uncle Zhao.

522
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,479
It’s so delicious.

523
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,559
Ah Jing, why are you here?

524
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,479
Be careful!

525
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,559
Second Brother Zhao, take a seat.

526
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,559
Hurry up, take a seat first.

527
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,479
Yan’er, go and play outside.

528
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,839
We have something to discuss.

529
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,519
What happened to you?

530
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,879
Senior Brother, have a talk with
Second Brother Zhao.

531
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,359
I’ll make some tea for you.

532
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,839
Alright.

533
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,039
Wanna eat?

534
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,279
I won’t give it to you.

535
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,599
Zhao Jing!

536
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,759
You finally show your fox tail!

537
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,199
I knew it.

538
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,159
I knew it was you!

539
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,039
Sister-in-law.

540
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,959
You still have a short fuse.

541
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,599
Since Brother Rong and his wife are gone,

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,319
there is no inheritor of the Rong family.

543
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,279
If we can’t open the door of the Armory,

544
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,599
our painstaking efforts

545
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,039
will be in vain.

546
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,519
Don’t put on such an act!

547
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,159
How did Brother Rong die?

548
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,959
Why did Brother Gao Chong
suffer from the Triplex Corpses Poison?

549
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,759
Such an evil thing

550
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,999
can be done by a man like you.

551
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,919
Only such a rat like you will do it!

552
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,159
Yeah, I’m the rat and yellow dog.

553
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,639
And so what?

554
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,479
Now you’re both at my mercy.

555
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,719
Give me the key,

556
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,639
then I will leave immediately.

557
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,519
From now on
we won’t meet each other.

558
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,999
Otherwise...

559
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,799
Or what?

560
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,679
Otherwise...

561
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,719
Brute!

562
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,510
Zhao Jing!

563
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,319
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

564
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,439
What are you going to do?

565
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,279
Ru Yu, do think it over.

566
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,999
The Yin Yang Book is in the Armory.

567
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,999
Give me the key,

568
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,039
I can promise you that,

569
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,319
after we open the door of the Armory,

570
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,679
you can get the Yin Yang Book

571
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,199
to heal your wounds.

572
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,959
By then, you’ll still be the respectable healer.

573
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,199
You don’t have to live in the shadow

574
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,399
with your beloved wife and son.

575
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,839
Ru Yu, if you don’t think for yourself,

576
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,839
think for your child.

577
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,159
Second Brother Zhao, think for yourself first.

578
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,439
You’ve operated the genuine Qi just now,

579
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,959
don’t you feel anything strange?

580
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,199
Wicked Witch, you’ve poisoned the tea?

581
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,119
Since ancient times, medicine and poison
are considered a family,

582
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,519
you’ve looked down
upon our Healer Valley too much.

583
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,079
Ru Yu has lost his martial arts,

584
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,919
I’m just a frail woman,

585
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,839
I can’t relax vigilance against evildoers.

586
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,759
Give me the antidote.

587
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,519
We can negotiate.

588
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,439
Fine, Second Brother Zhao.

589
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,399
Second Brother Zhao,
hurry up and take it.

590
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,559
As soon as it shows the effect,

591
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,439
you’ll suffer from the pain
of being gnawed by worms

592
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,319
before dying from visceral organs breaking.

593
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,439
After all, we’ve been friends,

594
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,479
I’m not willing to witness you
suffering from this.

595
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,799
Inside the bottle is the antidote for three months...

596
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,919
I haven’t finished yet.

597
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,839
Once it shows the effect, it can’t be cured.

598
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,919
If the three of us are alive,

599
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,599
you can regularly

600
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,959
pay us a visit.

601
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,959
Otherwise...

602
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,399
You!

603
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,239
Second Brother, forgive me

604
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,199
for not seeing you off.

605
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,439
Dad.

606
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,159
Yan’er.

607
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,559
Mom, what’s wrong?

608
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,919
Is Uncle Zhao a bad guy?

609
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,919
I shouldn’t have taken him home, I’m sorry.

610
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,879
Mom, please hit me...

611
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,079
Martial Uncle? Martial Uncle!

612
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,879
It’s me.

613
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,639
Martial Uncle, what’s wrong with you?

614
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,359
It’s me.

615
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,999
Martial Uncle.

616
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,879
I’m going to kill him.

617
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,759
Martial Uncle.

618
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,079
I’m going to kill him!

619
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,959
Martial Uncle.

620
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,199
Wu Xi, how is the situation?

621
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,119
[Grand Wizard]
I’ve checked again and again,

622
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,079
inside the ruins is

623
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,900
[Seventh Prince, Jing Bei Yuan]

624
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,559
only a charred body.

625
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,399
Impossible.

626
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,559
I’m going inside to have a look.

627
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,519
Bei Yuan,

628
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,839
I’ve asked Ah Qin Lai to bury

629
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,719
that body...

630
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,879
Wu Xi, you don’t understand!

631
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,959
It’s impossible for Zi Shu to die like this.

632
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,679
Prince Jin won’t kill him.

633
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,679
Bei Yuan!

634
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,759
Who is the one that doesn’t understand?

635
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,759
Since he can send someone to kill you,

636
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,359
why couldn’t he send someone to kill Leader Zhou?

637
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,599
No.

638
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,559
Since Zi Shu has left the Window of Heaven,

639
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,479
he definitely has former subordinates
from Four Seasons Manor.

640
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,439
He also has his second junior brother and disciple.

641
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,879
How could you judge it’s his body?

642
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,719
Bei Yuan,

643
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,079
I didn’t tell you that

644
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,479
his former subordinates
from Four Seasons Manor

645
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,159
have all been persecuted by Prince Jin.

646
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,559
Because of this,

647
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,159
Leader Zhou left the Window of Heaven
and roamed about the world.

648
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,039
Don’t blame Ping An.

649
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,279
The decision was made by me.

650
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,599
Wu Xi, you...

651
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,719
- Let me go!
- Martial Uncle!

652
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,479
- Let me go!
- Martial Uncle!

653
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,479
Let me go!

654
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,759
- Let me go!
- Martial Uncle!

655
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,519
- Martial Uncle!
- I’m going to kill him!

656
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,159
Let me go!

657
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,279
Martial Uncle!

658
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,799
- Master Uncle!
- Let go of me!

659
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,719
Martial Uncle!

660
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,879
I’m going to kill him!

661
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,679
- Martial Uncle!
- I’m going to kill him!

662
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,759
Is... isn’t that the disciple of Leader Zhou?

663
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,839
I’m going to kill him!

664
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,599
I’ll kill you!

665
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,399
- Martial Uncle!
- I’ll kill you!

666
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,959
Martial Uncle!

667
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,519
Young Master Zhang.

668
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,639
Young Master Zhang.

669
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,279
Brother Ping An.

670
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,559
Here is Prince Jing and Grand Wizard.

671
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,839
Where is Leader Zhou?

672
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,879
Don’t be afraid, kid.
I am your master’s best friend.

673
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,599
You can tell me anything that’s bothering you,

674
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,599
we can work together to figure out ways.

675
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,159
Prince Jing, my master has been taken away
by the men of Window of Heaven.

676
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,239
Martial Uncle seems to have gone mad.

677
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,439
Please go and save him.

678
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,719
I’ll kill you!

679
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,639
Young Master, calm down,
you’ve gone mad.

680
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,759
I’ll kill you.

681
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,279
Young Master, we’re old friends of Zhou Zi Shu.

682
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,719
Ah Xu?

683
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,119
Where is he?

684
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,639
Martial Uncle!

685
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,999
What did you done to my martial uncle?

686
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,039
He’s fine.

687
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,279
He’s just exhausted.

688
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,639
Let him rest for a while.

689
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,919
You must be starving, right?

690
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,759
Come on, this is for you.
Just enjoy them.

Miss Xiang.

694
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,999
What’s the matter?

695
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,679
Nothing big.

696
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,119
At such a timing,

697
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,919

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,470

but we can’t get out either.

704
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,919

706
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,919
What plans does Martial Uncle have?

707
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,279
If we stay here for more days,

708
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,719
we’ll be too hungry

709
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,239
to lift up swords even if we want to fight.

710
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,839
In that’s the case,

711
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,879
why not just go outside and fight until we die?

712
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,319
We can try our best in killing them.

713
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,479
Wei Ning!

714
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,999
You must calm down.

715
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,959
Master is excellent in martial arts,

716
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,119
the demons outside won’t be able to trap him.

717
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,639
Since there isn’t any news,

718
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,519
he must have fought his way out to ask for aid.

719
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,919
Martial Uncle has said,

720
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,519
we can wait for one day,

721
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,879
if there isn’t any news yet,

722
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,119
we will fight at the price of our lives.

723
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,919
By then, please try your best to guard Ah Xiang

724
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,039
to get out of here.

725
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,959
Senior Brother.

726
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,959
This is the arrangement of Martial Uncle.

727
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,159
The one-century history
of Gentle Wind Sword Sect

728
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,639
definitely can’t be ruined by us.

729
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,759
What’s more,

730
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,639
we can’t drag Ah Xiang into trouble

731
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,359
and cause her death.

732
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,079
Since her master is a skilled master,

733
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,999
by then,

734
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,399
you can take the secret books and scripts

735

737
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,359
Brother Mo, don’t say anything.

738
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,879
I’m not going anywhere.

739
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,719
You can’t eat your words

740
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,799
to regard me as an outsider.

741
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,119
Since I’m already here,

742
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,519
I’m willing to fight with you until I die.

743
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,359
Brother Mo,

744
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,559
don’t underestimate me
just because I’m a girl.

745
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,999
