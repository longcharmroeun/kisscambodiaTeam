[Episode 26]

23
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,598
Why are you bullying Zhen Yi Guo?

24
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,758
This is your dog?

25
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,758
My senior brother left it to me.

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,000
Yi Guo,

27
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,318
what a good name.

28
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,678
Let me cook it

29
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,558
and see if it can fill a pot.

30
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:10,817
Give it to me.

31
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:12,217
No.

32
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,417
No? We’ll take it!

33
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,238
No way to escape now?

34
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:21,998
Stay back!

35
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,038
Give it to me.

36
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,198
Hold him.

37
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,518
Cute dog, run!

38
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,198
Run back home and find Mom.

39
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,598
Zhen Yi Guo?

40
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:33,918
Release me!

41
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,598
Go home.

42
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,878
Thank you.

43
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,360
My little friend,

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,000
is your family name Zhen?

45
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,360
It’s not.

46
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,760
You are mistaken.

47
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,478
<i>Why did Ah Xu’s Drunk-Like-A-Dream</i>

48
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,558
<i>lead me to such a weird dream?</i>

49
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,198
Little brat.

50
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,078
Uncle Wen,

51
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,478
you woke up so early.

52
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,198
What time is it now?

53
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,318
I’ve practiced Eight Trigram Palm
more than fifty times

54
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,238
It’s about seven in the morning.

55
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:43,798
Why did you wake up so early?

56
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,238
I woke up at the first crowing

57
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,838
and failed to get back to sleep.

58
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,598
So I decided to practice my martial arts.

59
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,678
What are you trying so hard?

60
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,158
I keep having dreams
and can’t sleep well.

61
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,358
Every time thinking of the evil deeds
the Ghost Valley has committed,

62
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,838
and the people lost their families like me,

63
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,358
I just can’t eat and sleep well.

64
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,358
I do hope that in one night,

65
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,918
I can have good skills like you
and my master.

66
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,078
to kill those bastards.

67
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,398
If there is no Ghost Valley in this world,

68
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,358
there won’t be so many

69
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,518
miserable happenings.

70
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,318
More haste, less speed.

71
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,758
No matter how hard you try,

72
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,798
martial arts skills can’t be acquired in one night.

73
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,358
Your master has some incenses
that can help you sleep.

74
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,118
I’ll get some for you tonight.

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,358
You are still growing now.

76
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,078
Sleeping is necessary for you.

77
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,798
You exert your strength wrongly

78
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,918
so your arms are not forceful.

79
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,638
Eight Trigram Palm emphasizes
the central waist and qi (energy).

80
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,958
This is also the key for most martial arts skills.

81
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,398
Little brat,

82
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,678
free your shoulders, lower your elbows,

83
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,038
and strengthen your belly.

84
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,598
Someone said he was an outsider,

85
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,758
and refused to teach my disciple, didn’t he?

86
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,718
None of your business.

87
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,358
Master, I’ll go answer the door.

88
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,718
Who are you?

89
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,318
I come from the Bank of Ping An.

90
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,118
Mr. Ye ordered me to

91
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,238
deliver a letter to Four Seasons Manor.

92
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,290
Scorpion King

93
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:39,398
on that Ghosts Book,

94
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,958
there are appearances of many of us,

95
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,638
from the Chief of the Valley
to the Ten Devils.

96
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,638
Even our skills, schools,

97
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,758
origins,

98
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,758
and all the things we’ve done are on it.

99
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,878
It’s just like ripping our pants off

100
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,958
and sowing them to everyone.

101
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,038
If it was spread to the martial arts world,

102
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,518
we could hardly do anything.

103
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,238
What... what Ghosts Book?

104
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,358
The Five Lakes Alliance is distributing
Ghosts Books to each sect.

105
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,958
What is this?

106
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,838
If this is the case,

107
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,638
how could we

108
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,278
work for Chief Zhao?

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,958
I have recalled,

110
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,398
there is such a thing.

111
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,198
But what’s wrong with this?

112
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,478
Just find someone

113
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,558
who is good at making disguise

114
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,838
and ask him to disguise you.

115
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,278
Perhaps,

116
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,798
you’ll look much better.

117
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,798
Happy!

118
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,798
Besides,

119
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,158
as a bad-ass,

120
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,038
you want to be as notorious as possible.

121
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,678
Foster-Father has helped you to be more famous.

122
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,878
Isn’t it good?

123
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,558
You!

124
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,798
The alliance of two powers,

125
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,078
if they work well, it sustains.

126
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,638
If not, it breaks.

127
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,438
If Chief Zhao is trying to
use this kind of despicable means

128
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,438
to force us to the corner,

129
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,518
isn’t it too nasty?

130
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,718
Today, I

131
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:23,198
have heard something so ridiculous.

132
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,158
You evil ghosts

133
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,998
say someone else is despicable?

134
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,478
This is so funny.

135
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,118
Fine.

136
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:37,838
If this is the case,

137
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,718
we’ll leave now.

138
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,878
The world is large,

139
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,558
we’ll have our place.

140
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,478
How dare you!

141
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,198
What not?

142
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,598
I think it makes sense.

143
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,198
If they work well, it sustains.

144
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,998
If not, it breaks.

145
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,158
If you guys don’t want to stay,

146
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:00,838
then

147
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,120
why should I keep you?

148
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,890
Let’s go!

149
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:10,638
See you.

150
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,238
Your Majesty.

151
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,958
What are you planning with the king?

152
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,038
Be respectful.

153
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,118
Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,758
By the way, Your Majesty,

155
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,198
Liu Qian Qiao’s letter has arrived.

156
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,598
It’s about how to make the Water of Lethe.

157
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,158
Please read it, Your Majesty.

158
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,558
Brother.

159
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,998
The server of your bank told me

160
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,598
I have a letter at your place.

161
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,558
Just a moment, please.

162
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,398
Greeting from Ping An, Leader Zhou.

163
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,558
Ping An, why are you here in Kun Province?

164
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,718
Are you running this bank?

165
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,158
That’s beyond what I’m capable of.

166
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,318
Please have a seat, Leader Zhou.

167
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,478
I’m just overwatching the 56 sub-branches

168
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,118
in the Central Plain for Prince Jin.

169
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,278
There are four or five more branches
in South Xinjiang,

170
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,638
overwatched by Ru Yi.

171
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,278
The Bank of Ping An is
all over the world.

172
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,358
I’d never expected that
your master owns it.

173
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,198
How could a man like him

174
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,478
do business related to money?

175
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,398
That’s what you don’t know.

176
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,038
Although our bank
deals with financial businesses,

177
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,678
it mainly focuses on gathering information
of the Central Plain for the Grand Wizard.

178
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,598
We are using the mechanical birds

179
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,438
that you taught us to make in the past.

180
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,958
Thanks to this precious gift,

181
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,198
I’m able to immediately know

182
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,918
that Prince Jin is coming to Kun Province.

183
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,998
in advance.

184
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,518
Prince Jin is coming to Kun Province?

185
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:53,958
Leader Zhou,

186
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,918
didn’t you send Mr. Ye
to visit the Grand Wizard?

187
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,038
Prince Jin was told
that you had been in poor health.

188
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,198
So he decided to come to Kun Province,
along with the Grand Wizard at once.

189
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:03,998
Nonsense.

190
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,998
how could he come to the Central Plain?

191
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,398
It’s fine.

192
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,358
Leader Zhou,

193
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,198
Prince Jin is coming
with the Grand Wizard and many bodyguards.

194
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,038
Moreover,

195
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,278
Kun Province is a remote place,

196
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:16,118
far beyond the reach of Prince Jin.

197
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,798
What does it mean?

198
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:19,678
Ah Xu, are you familiar with

199
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,278
the person invited by Ye Bai Yi?

200
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,878
More than familiar,

201
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,518
it’s a friendship of life.

202
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,398
Leader Zhou, honestly

203
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,598
all these years,

204
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,758
you didn’t leave any messages to my master.

205
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,158
Now you need help.

206
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,838
Why did you ask someone else
to deliver the message?

207
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,878
You should go to South Xinjiang yourself.

208
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,318
My master misses you all these years.

209
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,478
By the way,

210
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,118
this is the letter from Mr. Ye.

211
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,518
What is Senior Ye intending to do?

212
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,678
Why did he write a letter to scold you?

213
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,638
<i>[See you in the winter solstice.]</i>

214
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:03,078
<i>[I want to eat dumplings,]</i>

215
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,478
<i>[stuffed with cabbage and pork.]</i>

216
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,078
This letter...

217
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,918
What does it mean?

218
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,638
Prince Jin and the Grand Wizard

219
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,798
are collecting some precious medicine
in South Xinjiang.

220
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,518
Mr. Ye can’t wait that long,

221
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:16,998
so he decided to come back earlier

222
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,158
and sent this letter through
the sub-branches in the south.

223
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,478
Thanks for what you’ve done, Ping An.

224
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:34,918
Master,

225
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,398
who is the Grand Wizard?

226
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,798
And who is Prince Jin?

227
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,158
Did Senior Ye

228
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,918
invite these two to heal you?

229
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:41,998
He invited?!

230
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,878
If I knew that his old friend

231
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:45,798
is the Grand Wizard,

232
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,118
I’ll spare him a trip here.

233
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,198
You haven’t explained

234
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,398
who these two people are.

235
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,318
These two are my old friends in Jin Province.

236
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,598
Both of them used to work for Prince Jin.

237
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,158
But later, they were so disappointed
at Prince Jin,

238
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,718
so they decided to go to South Xinjiang

239
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,358
and never come back.

240
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,878
So these two can heal your wounds?

241
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,238
The Grand Wizard is good at medicine,

242
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:15,198
and knows many secret venom practice.

243
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,238
Prince Jin usually think several times
before he acts.

244
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,958
If they decide to come to Central Plain,

245
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,278
then there must be a chance?

246
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:24,478
Isn’t this a good thing?

247
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,158
If you are old friends,

248
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,598
then why don’t we go find them sooner?

249
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,118
Earlier,

250
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,838
I didn’t want to try for my life.

251
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,438
Master,

252
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,718
why did Senior Ye blame you
in the letter?

253
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:41,958
Silly brat,

254
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,198
don’t you see?

255
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,158
That old monster

256
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,358
went thousands of miles away to the south
to look for doctors.

257
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,918
After seeing the Grand Wizard,

258
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,398
he found out that

259
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,918
the legend that he barely invited

260
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,078
still owes your master a favor.

261
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,918
The gorgeous Sword Immortal of Mount Changming

262
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,398
eventually became an errand messenger.

263
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,878
A man like him

264
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,638
would feel so ashamed.

265
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,958
Getting scold is already a kind of mercy.

266
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,398
What’s the matter?

267
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,838
In the end, Senior Ye is

268
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,038
the one manage to invite the Grand Wizard here.

269
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,398
No matter whose favor it is,

270
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,758
as long as Master can be healed,

271
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,878
it’s perfect.

272
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,838
Right, Uncle Wen?

273
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,158
Madam,

274
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:20,318
do you have any other colors
for this cloth?

275
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:21,958
Come.

276
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,438
Look at this.

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,598
It’s pretty good.

278
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,878
Ah Xu, it’s rare to go down the mountain.

279
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,278
I have to look around

280
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,198
and see if there’s a painter
that’s good at repairing.

281
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,998
Can you take Cheng Ling back first?

282
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,878
Sure, come back early.

283
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,318
Otherwise, we won’t have dinner.

284
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,478
Bullshit.

285
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,918
Am I your servant?

286
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:42,918
Aren’t you?

287
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,078
Cheng Ling,

288
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,478
rest a while longer and we’ll leave soon.

289
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,878
Valley Chief is coming.

290
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:06,998
Valley Chief is coming.

291
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,558
I’ve found the Valley Chief.

292
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,558
Valley Chief is coming.

293
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,158
I’ve found the Valley Chief.

294
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,558
I’ve found the Valley Chief.

295
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,118
Valley Chief.

296
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,198
Valley Chief.

297
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,718
Chief Valley, I’ve finally found you.

298
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:37,878
Do you know

299
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:38,918
how we spent these days recently?

300
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,998
It’s like rats on the street,

301
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,078
chased by everyone.

302
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,198
Show me the Ghosts Book.

303
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,798
At the moment,

304
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,438
almost everyone

305
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,278
in every sect has a copy of this book.

306
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,118
The whole martial arts world is investigated.

307
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,238
Ghosts hiding everywhere

308
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,478
are revealed.

309
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,318
I’m so lucky

310
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,558
to save these brats,

311
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,718
hiding in this wilderness,

312
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,638
and looking for the whereabouts of Valley Chief.

313
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,798
I’m getting skinny due to starvation.

314
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,958
If Miss Gu didn’t take in Yun Zai,

315
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,078
who is pretty clean

316
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,718
and can get around,

317
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,478
Old Ghoul won’t be able to
see you again.

318
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,918
Ten Devils, how many are left?

319
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,358
What?

320
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,438
Valley Chief, don’t you know?

321
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:53,038
I heard that this sect is killing that one,

322
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,478
that sect is killing another one.

323
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,798
This is all done by the Ghost Valley.

324
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,118
I, I thought it was done by you,

325
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,158
with the Ten Devils.

326
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,638
So it wasn’t you?

327
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,318
Do you know where
the Owner of the List of the Unfaithful is?

328
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,038
No, no.

329
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,118
Not since

330
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,558
Tragicomic Ghost was abducted

331
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,158
before the Heroes Conference started.

332
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,678
I haven’t heard about her
or Beauty Ghost.

333
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,118
That’s right, Valley Chief

334
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,398
I heard that those famous dogs

335
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,038
are trying to re-host

336
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,678
that shitty Heroes Conference.

337
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,198
They really don’t know their places,

338
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,278
like monkeys
claiming the throne of wilderness.

339
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,878
Thank goodness that you appeared in time.

340
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,038
Let’s return to the Ghost Valley now

341
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,318
to prepare the defense

342
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,878
and give those suckers a lesson.

343
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,798
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

344
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,530
Martial Uncle.

345
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,278
What is it?

346
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,318
Martial Uncle, you’ve finally returned.

347
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,078
I’m almost starved to death.

348
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,758
You just wait when I’m not back?

349
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,678
Can’t you just get yourself some noodles first?

350
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,038
No.

351
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,078
How did it go?
Did you find a painter?

352
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,238
Not at the foot of the hill.

353
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,958
I heard that a painter has just returned
from Chang’An to Qingshui Town.

354
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,878
I’ll visit him with the painting in a few days.

355
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,878
Ah Xu.

356
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,198
do you want to learn how to cook?

357
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,638
In case I can’t prepare the meal for you that day.

358
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,918
No, thanks.

359
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,198
A saint once said a nobleman should stay away from the kitchen.
(Lit: Mencius’s words)

360
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,838
Don’t worry.

361
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,558
Us two won’t be starved.

362
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,798
If there’s no choice,

363
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,518
I’ll take Cheng Ling
to the town for food.

364
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,438
Fine.

365
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:51,158
Call me when dinner is ready.

366
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,878
Okay, Master Zhou.

367
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,038
Take your time.

368
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,358
Martial Uncle, what is it?

369
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:17,958
Nothing.

370
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,078
It’s getting dark.

371
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,958
“The sunset is so sublime

372
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,398
yet sadly it’s in its demise.”
(Lit: From Li Shang Yin’s <i>Ascending to Mount Leyo</i>)

373
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:27,878
Cheng Ling,

374
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,518
what do you want for dinner tonight?

375
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,718
Uncle Wen will cook for you.

376
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,078
Greetings, Scorpion King.

377
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,158
Didn’t I send someone

378
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:53,638
to tell you the solution to the venom?

379
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,638
Why do you come back?

380
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,438
I have changed my mind.

381
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,598
Scorpion King is ingenious.

382
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,598
It’s an honor to serve you.

383
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,918
I am willing to be your servant,

384
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:07,878
as long as....

385
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,478
As long as you are willing to release
my master, Tragicomic Ghost

386
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:18,838
and...

387
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,958
And Yu Qiu Feng.

388
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,598
Scorpion King, I’m begging you.

389
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,438
Stop.

390
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,198
I don’t want to hear empty words.

391
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,118
No merit, no reward.

392
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,998
I can promise you not to kill them,

393
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:46,238
but I can’t release them

394
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,838
just because of your words.

395
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,318
Of course,

396
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,958
if you can prove your loyalty,

397
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,718
I will not treat loyal people badly.

398
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,998
Rise now.

399
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,358
Thank you.

400
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,158
However,

401
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,318
if it weren’t for your recipe,

402
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,278
I wouldn’t have found out that

403
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,078
the Water of Lethe is made up of Nepenthes.

404
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,158
Scorpion King, what do you mean?

405
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,078
Have you heard of

406
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,358
something called Drunk-Like-A-Dream?

407
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,398
There’s a plant in Kun Province named Nepenthes.

408
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,118
Add seven kind of venoms into it,

409
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,038
then the Water of Lethe is made.

410
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,878
It will make you forget
your most infatuated things.

411
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,798
If you add seven kinds of flowers to it,

412
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,438
Drunk-Like-A-Dream is made.

413
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,958
These two are two sides of one secret,

414
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,238
mutually enhancing and opposing.

415
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,998
A large dose of Drunk-Like-A-Dream

416
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,478
may counteract the effect of Water of Lethe

417
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:04,158
to reveal sealed memories.

418
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,598
Scorpion King, are you going to...

419
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,758
Tragicomic Ghost doesn’t
have a complete psyche now.

420
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,838
To avoid using large doses

421
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,278
which might damage her brain,

422
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,718
I decided to use incense

423
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:22,518
so the medicine can be absorbed gradually

424
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,198
and reach the level we need.

425
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,038
You are here about time.

426
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,998
She’s been in the medical room
for seven days.

427
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:33,518
I think she’ll be awake soon.

428
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,438
Then I’ll know the truth soon.

429
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,798
<i>All those sayings are rumors.</i>

430
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,598
<i>Foster-Father will not deceive me.</i>

431
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:48,078
<i>Right.</i>

432
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,598
<i>After Tragicomic Ghost tells the truth,</i>

433
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,798
<i>his name will be cleared.</i>

434
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,638
<i>What I’ve done</i>

435
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,838
<i>is just to clear my father’s name.</i>

436
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,958
Your Gentle Wind Sword Sect

437
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,878
stays in a desolate place like this.

438
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,718
How smart of you!

439
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,118
If I was a thief,

440
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,998
I wouldn’t bother to come here to steal.

441
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,958
Ah Xiang, don’t talk nonsense.

442
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,558
Who is the one saying

443
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,118
that Mount Qingfeng is desolate?

444
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,758
Little brat bunny.

445
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:34,958
Martial Uncle.

446
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:41,718
Brat.

447
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,558
Martial Uncle.

448
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,878
Martial Uncle, Senior Brother,
you guys are all here.

449
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,078
I finally get to meet you!

450
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:46,958
I really miss you.

451
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,558
You’ve finally returned,

452
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,358
just in time for the New Year.

453
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,278
Is everyone fine there?

454
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,158
How is Master’s health condition?

455
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,438
Did everyone miss me?

456
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,838
I’m asking you.

457
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,038
Be honest.

458
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:03,038
How did you trick this little girl?

459
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:03,998
I...

460
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,078
My name is Gu Xiang.

461
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:05,998
Nice to meet you.

462
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,478
Ah Xiang.

463
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:09,758
Nice to meet you.

464
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:10,718
My name is Mo Wei Xu,

465
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,278
Cao Wei Ning’s senior brother.

466
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,678
This is the Elder of our sect,
Fan Huai Kong.

467
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:17,038
You may call him Martial Uncle Fan
as Wei Ning does.

468
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,678
Martial Uncle Fan.

469
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,558
Martial Uncle Fan, nice to meet you.

470
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,198
Senior Brother Mo, nice to meet you.

471
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,118
Everyone, nice to meet you.

472
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,678
Nice to meet you, Miss Xiang.

473
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,358
I’m asking you,

474
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,318
where did you find her?

475
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,438
So naive.

476
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,638
I’m not naive.

477
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,798
If you’re not naive,

478
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,958
why would you be abducted

479
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,158
by my naive nephew?

480
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,958
He’s calling you naive.

481
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:49,718
- Me?
- You’re naive!

482
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,158
Senior Brother Cao,

483
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,358
This this your fiancee that you mentioned
in the letter?

484
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,558
Great, good for you!

485
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,318
I am not.

486
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,198
Cao Wei Ning,
what did you tell them?

487
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:59,638
Nothing.

488
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,878
A fierce fiancee.

489
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,238
Wei Ning.

490
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,558
You will be suffering in the future.

491
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,238
Stop it, Martial Uncle
Don’t make fun of her.

492
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:08,438
She’s timid.

493
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:10,878
Miss Xiang, don’t mind it.

494
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,518
We make jokes like this all the time.

495
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,318
Girl,

496
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:18,278
Martial Uncle was just teasing you.

497
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,518
Wei Ning said you are really nice
in his letter.

498
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:23,678
We knew that you are coming this morning,

499
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,678
and cleaned a small courtyard for you

500
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,918
at the hillside.

501
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:29,638
Martial Uncle,

502
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,318
can’t Ah Xiang live with us
in the mountain?

503
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,198
Sorry for this, Miss.

504
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,358
Our leader just gave an order of solitude.

505
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,478
So we can’t receive guests.

506
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,078
We can go down the mountain to pick you up.

507
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,118
Solitude?

508
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,958
Martial Uncle, is it because of...?

509
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,758
Miss, come and check the courtyard

510
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,118
to see if you like it.

511
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:49,918
Let’s go.

512
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,678
- Go.
- Go.

513
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,238
- Come.
- Go.

514
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,318
- Go.
- Go.

515
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,478
The problem with the Eagle Claw Clan
and the Mount Hua Sect

516
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,358
is on your shoulder this time, Old Sha.

517
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:02,958
Fine.

518
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,838
If the Water Transport Gang this time...

519
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:15,518
Leaders, we’ll call it a day.

520
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:16,758
Thanks for your work.

521
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,758
- Bye.
- Bye.

522
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,598
How many times have I told you,

523
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,678
not to come to the front hall?

524
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,518
Why?

525
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:40,198
Those running dogs

526
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,958
knows my existence anyway.

527
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,798
Are you afraid of them barking?

528
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,198
Never get yourself more business to attend to.

529
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,078
Foster-Father,

530
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,118
when your status was insecure,

531
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,238
you had to cover your connection with the Scorpion.

532
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:53,398
I understand that.

533
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,038
But now you are in power,

534
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:59,798
why can’t I stand by you now?

535
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,398
It’s not settled,

536
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,878
there still are variables.

537
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,198
Then when will it be settled?

538
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:06,798
Such bullshit

539
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:10,158
maybe enough to fool
those idiots of the Ghost Valley.

540
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,478
But now you evade me with that cliche.

541
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,558
Are you insulting me?

542
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,718
Scorpion,

543
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,398
what’s wrong with you today?

544
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:29,558
Did you hear something?

545
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:32,598
Or did I make a mistake?

546
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,518
Scorpion,

547
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,558
I know that

548
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,038
the situation requires

549
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:51,598
you to support me in the dark.

550
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,638
I have wronged you.

551
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,678
But I didn’t expect

552
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,158
you are so capable

553
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,078
that you manage to make the Scorpion

554
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,798
an assassin guild as influential
as the Window of Heaven.

555
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,198
I’m so glad.

556
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,318
And,

557
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,838
I feel that I’m in your debt.

558
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,438
I’ve worked hard,

559
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,278
with caution and conscience,

560
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,358
for our cause.

561
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:30,638
I have no children,

562
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,758
and you are my closest kin.

563
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,598
All of my businesses,

564
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,278
if not for you,

565
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,078
whom could I entrust with?

566
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,958
In the future,

567
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,958
if you are angry,

568
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,398
just tell me, I can take it.

569
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,118
But just don’t

570
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,638
hurt my heart with those cold words.

571
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,638
Okay?

572
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,118
Foster-Father,

573
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,558
why did you lie to me?

574
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,598
How did I lie to you?

575
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:32,118
What is if you don’t disappoint me,

576
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,798
I won’t disappoint you?

577
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,678
How did you get this?

578
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,478
Yu Qiu Feng sent it to me.

579
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,838
Foster-Father,

580
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:57,318
is this your writing?

581
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:02,238
Yu Qiu Feng,

582
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,158
is cornering me.

583
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:14,438
Come and eat more.

584
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,438
- Thank you, Senior Brother.
- Thank you

585
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,198
Here.

586
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,038
Thank you.

587
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:19,958
Have more.

588
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,198
You must be tired on the way.

589
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,398
Don’t be nervous.

590
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,318
Make yourself at home.

591
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,398
Right, make yourself at home.

592
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,438
Girl,

593
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,998
I think you have some martial skills,

594
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,518
just like one of us.

595
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:37,438
Which sect do you belong to?

596
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,078
I don’t have a sect.

597
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,998
I’m a servant.

598
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,918
Just that my master

599
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,118
taught me some basics.

600
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:48,038
Ah Xiang, don’t be so humble.

601
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:50,118
Martial Uncle, her master is...

602
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,118
Have more.

603
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,998
Fine, I’ll eat.

604
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,358
Forgive me for this, Martial Uncle.

605
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,318
My master is a reclusive senior

606
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,558
with a strange temper.

607
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,598
I am not allowed to say his name.

608
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,198
Martial Uncle,

609
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,478
there are all kinds of people
in the world.

610
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,318
Not so strange, right?

611
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,278
Right.

612
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,958
Is there anyone else in your family?

613
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:16,838
No.

614
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,598
I am an orphan,

615
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,878
adopted by my master.

616
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,598
But,

617
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,598
he doesn’t need me now.

618
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,598
It doesn’t matter, doesn’t matter.

619
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:27,758
You are an orphan

620
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,518
just like our Wei Ning.

621
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,718
You both had a miserable life.

622
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,678
Although you don’t have a family,

623
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,638
but in the future,

624
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,998
you both will be dedicated to be one mind.

625
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,118
It’s just a bad timing.

626
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,838
If there’s no order of solitude,

627
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,118
I’ll choose a day

628
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,238
for you to get married

629
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,118
after the New Year.

630
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,398
Martial Uncle, why did we seal off the mountain?

631
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,838
Finish dinner first.

632
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,078
Ah Xiang, have some more.

633
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,638
Right, eat.

634
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,998
I did have an affair

635
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,478
with Tragicomic Ghost, Luo Fu Meng.

636
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:17,678
At that time,
she was the Princess of Neon Palace.

637
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,318
Yet I was just a poor boy
from Zhao family’s side branch,

638
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:25,838
Her family naturally refused to
let her marry me,

639
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,158
and locked her up.

640
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,958
This blood letter

641
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,838
was sent by her at that time

642
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,878
to show her will.

643
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:43,358
You two

644
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,798
once loved each other.

645
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,678
Then why did you fail her?

646
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,318
It was all because of that vicious Li Yao.

647
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,278
Foster-Mother?

648
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,158
I’ve said you are not allowed
to call her that.

649
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,358
She’s just a bitch.

650
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,758
You don’t know what she has done.

651
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,438
Back then, she was from a noble family
and loved me deeply.

652
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,398
I really appreciated that.

653
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,518
I must be blamed for

654
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,878
not refusing her in time.

655
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,358
So when

656
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,598
Fu Meng and I were about to
overcome all the difficulties

657
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,158
and get married,

658
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,158
she threatened me with my involvement

659
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,798
in stealing in the Armory.

660
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,118
She demanded that I must go with her

661
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,438
and break up with Fu Meng.

662
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,318
Scorpion,

663
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:49,838
if I was the only one behind that,

664
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,918
I would not have compromise.

665
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,118
But it involved so many people

666
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,558
that I couldn’t get my friends in trouble.

667
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,998
So I endured this humiliation

668
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,478
and married into her family.

669
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,798
Do you know that

670
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,398
on the day of your wedding,

671
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,358
Luo Fu Meng went crazy
and carried out a massacre in the Neon Palace?

672
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,678
Do you know why

673
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,798
no one heard from her since then?

674
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,238
It was because I tried my best

675
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,078
to find her crazy

676
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,278
and sent her to the Heal Valley secretly.

677
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,518
But when I was trying to subdue her,

678
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,598
I was badly hurt by her unique martial arts.

679
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,158
I have been unable to make
any progress in martial arts since then.

680
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,838
I have ruined her life.

681
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,638
If it wasn’t me,

682
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,438
she wouldn’t end up in

683
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,958
such a poor condition like this.

684
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,358
Scorpion,

685
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,918
this is the most painful memory

686
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,558
and the biggest shame of my life.

687
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,918
I planned to take this to the grave.

688
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,198
But since you want to know,

689
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,838
I’ll tell you now.

690
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:24,358
There’s another reason

691
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,078
for my hesitation.

692
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,318
I killed Li Yao as well.

693
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:36,798
I figured.

694
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,918
I was obsequious and genuine.

695
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,718
But not anymore.

696
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,158
The Zhao Jing in front of you

697
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,798
is someone who killed his wife,

698
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,958
murdered his brothers,

699
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:54,958
and scourged the martial arts world,

700
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,038
who will not be forgiven.

701
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,918
The world fails me,

702
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,158
I will do the same to the world.

703
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,438
But to you,

704
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,038
my son...

705
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,718
The old me has mostly died.

706
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,198
But if I maintain a little kindness

707
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,838
and a little affection for my family,

708
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,758
they are for you.

709
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:34,918
This is the last piece of pure land in my life.

710
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:37,998
Promise me

711
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,358
that you will guard it well.

712
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:46,038
Do not abandon it.

713
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:48,798
Foster-Father.

714
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,398
it’s my fault.

715
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,238
I shouldn’t have asked you this.

716
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,718
I won’t ask again.

717
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:58,678
Scorpion,

718
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,438
you should know that

719
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,198
you are the only one I have,

720
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,718
and I’m the only one you have.

721
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:19,438
If you don’t disappoint me,

722
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,678
I will not disappoint you.

723
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:23,958
If you don’t fail me,

724
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,158
I will not fail you.

725
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:38,998
Master.

726
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:44,878
Don’t call me that.

727
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,598
Don’t you have a new master already?

728
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:54,878
How did it go?

729
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,238
Did you find an answer?

730
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,278
He said

731
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,198
it was his wife Li Yao

732
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:05,798
who threatened him with the secret of the Armory.

733
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:13,278
I can’t believe that

734
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:16,278
his ability to make up stories

735
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,838
i still so good.

736
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,118
It was my dad who threatened him first.

737
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:23,398
Why did he frame Li Yao?

738
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,038
Because he killed Li Yao later.

739
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,918
Li Yao was just a stupid girl.

740
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,438
Although we were rivals in love,

741
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,838
I didn’t hate her.

742
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:46,438
If I was the one

743
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,518
who married Zhao Jing,

744
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,438
I would be the skeleton

745
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,518
buried in the ground instead.

746
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,518
“He dallied with me

747
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:04,478
and he forsake me in the end.”
(Lit.: A saying from <i>Yingying’s Biography</i>)

748
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,558
I have given up everything for Zhao Jing.

749
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,478
But I couldn’t believe

750
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:15,638
that he went for Li Yao, a high-born girl.

751
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,078
My dad saw me cry all day

752
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,278
and he couldn’t bear it.

753
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,558
So he used the secret of the Armory

754
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,598
and the leadership of the Neon Palace

755
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:34,118
to make him marry me.

756
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,318
But I never expected

757
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,878
he could be that ruthless.

758
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,678
He conspired with the traitors of our palace

759
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,558
and massacred the Neon Palace

760
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,278
on the day of our wedding.

761
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,878
Master, it wasn’t you?

762
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,158
The past cannot be retrieved.

763
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,518
Both of you have no evidence.

764
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,358
If he is indeed cold-blooded

765
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,598
as you said,

766
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,118
why would he spare your life?

767
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,278
And why would he

768
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,518
keep and value your blood letter?

769
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,238
You really...

770
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,958
You really have

771
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,358
little understanding of Zhao Jing.

772
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:18,158
Do you know that all his life,

773
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,918
he is most proud of

774
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:23,918
his ability to fool everyone around.

775
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:27,078
He keeps one trophy

776
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,638
for each of his plots.

777
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,158
I assume

778
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,478
he has the ring of his master’s

779
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,038
and the sword that poisoned Rong Xuan.

780
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:39,438
If you don’t believe me,

781
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:41,918
go and check for yourself.

782
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,678
There should be something left

783
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,318
by that stupid girl, Li Yao.

784
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,518
It’s very likely to be their love token.

785
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,478
If I’m not wrong,

786
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,678
Zhao Jing has also given

787
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,318
a very special token to you

788
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:07,518
to prove his sincerity,

789
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,798
right?

790
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,598
Martial Uncle, tomorrow is the winter solstice.

791
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,958
Will Senior Ye be here on time?

792
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:32,358
Yes, tomorrow is the winter solstice.

793
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:34,238
Are we going to make dumplings?

794
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,598
Senior Ye said

795
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:36,918
he wanted dumplings
with cabbage and pork stuffing?

796
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:40,038
What else do you know besides eating?

797
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:42,118
Senior Ye requested it in his letter.

798
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,038
Besides,

799
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,598
I’ve worked so hard every day.

800
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:45,918
Why can’t I eat?

801
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,998
Little brat, shut up.

802
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,678
Now you’re talking back!

803
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,758
Fine, fine.

804
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:53,798
I’ll buy some ingredients tomorrow.

805
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,638
What else do you want?

806
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,678
You’re not going against his will this time?

807
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,158
Old Monster is in his late years.

808
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,958
He’s gone through this tough journey for us.

809
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,598
I’ll just fulfill

810
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:06,958
his appetite.

811
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,118
It’s reasonable.

812
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:10,518
But for him to have such a good appetite,

813
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,438
we should double the ingredients.

814
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:16,518
The wine being sold down the hill is not good.

815
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,078
How about this, Lao Wen?

816
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,398
You hire a carriage to Qingshui Town,

817
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,998
and buy some dishes.

818
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:23,958
Great.

819
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,278
Uncle Wen, I’ll go with you.

820
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,198
No.

821
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,398
One round trip takes a whole day.

822
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,278
Don’t even think about it.

823
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:30,558
Stay and practice.

824
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:31,918
That’s not it.

825
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,878
I have never slacked off.

826
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:34,998
Shut up.

827
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,278
Go to bed now.

828
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,638
Lao Wen,

829
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:40,278
get some rest.

830
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,718
Do you want to talk?

831
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,358
And some drinks?

832
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,558
No drinking.

833
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,158
We have a big fight in two days.

834
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:54,038
We need to have a good rest.

835
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,278
That’s right.

836
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,238
Then go ahead.

837
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,638
Go, Cheng Ling.

838
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:07,638
Go.
