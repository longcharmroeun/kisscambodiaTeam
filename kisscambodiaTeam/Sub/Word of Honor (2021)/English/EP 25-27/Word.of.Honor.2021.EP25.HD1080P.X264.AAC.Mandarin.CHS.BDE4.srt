[Episode 25]

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,999
Why can’t you sleep well?

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,039
I had a bad dream,
and I couldn’t fall asleep again.

25
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,679
So I decided to take a walk.

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,079
It’s raining.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,799
That’s why I had a cold dream.

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,359
Yes.

29
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,919
Winter comes after the First Frost,

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,239
The Year is after Laba.

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,639
Ah Xu,

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,559
it would be great

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,999
if we could live
in Four Seasons Manor forever.

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,759
Why can’t we?

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,119
I do it.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,279
You don’t know where the coal is placed.

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,439
How about having some wine
since we can’t sleep?

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,799
Sure.

39
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,239
Wait.

40
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,359
Tricky.

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,839
Don’t you know

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,319
these things go well with wine.

43
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
You eat it.

44
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,270
I’m good with wine.

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Drinking without snacks
will hurt your stomach.

46
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,520
This tin has six kinds of nuts,

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,519
each of which has a special effect
and is good for health.

48
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,839
This is Wolong’s

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,919

50
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,639
You should get some every day.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,919
Lao Wen, don’t let
the world of martial arts hamper you.

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,519
Someone like you with this eloquence

53
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,679
should be rich by doing business.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,239
Come and have a try.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,999
No, I don’t want it.

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,039
Ah Xu, you

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,599
are already old enough

58
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,919
but you are still a picky eater and a night owl.

59
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,159
How could you set an example
for your disciple?

60
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,599
Is it me who wants to stay up?

61
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,359
Go get some nails on your chest.

62
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,479
Didn’t you sleep well these days?

63
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,479
That’s because of

64
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,079
the Drunk-Like-A-Dream I found
in the Manor.

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,839
I remember the night

66
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,519
you got the Drunk-Like-A-Dream

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,959
and shouted the name Zhou Zi Shu
for the first time.

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,039
Can you tell me now

69
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,719
what did you see?

70
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,999
I dreamed of

71
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,199
me being seven years old.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,839
Our family of three
came to the Four Seasons Manor,

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,159
Mom and Dad started a small clinic
at the foot of the hill.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,559
I practiced martial arts with Master
at the Manor for the day,

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,999
and went home for dinner at night.

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,079
Those drug men in my dream

77
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,679
were like wild dogs,

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,159
chasing and biting me
without any reason.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,399
You, sometimes as Zhou Zi Shu,

80
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,439
sometimes as Zhen Yi Guo,

81
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,679
stood in front of me
and protect me

82
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,599
Zhen Yi Guo?

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,559
You forgot that

84
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,679
there was a little dog following you?

85
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,679
<i>What’s its name?</i>

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,079
<i>It’s Yi Guo.</i>

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,070
<i>Yi Guo?</i>

88
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,359
<i>Wait for me.</i>

89
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,919
<i>Let me see it.</i>

90
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,759
I kept it.

91
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,919
Chevalier Qin said that

92
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,479
he was gonna cook it in a pot.

93
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,839
So my parents just gave it this name.

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,799
I knew that

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,479
you have a connection
with the Four Seasons Manor,

96
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,839
I just didn’t expect that...

97
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,399
The Four Seasons Manor has vanished
for a long time.

98
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,359
I saw someone using
the Swift Moving Steps

99
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,919
and I just took it as a clue.

100
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,599
So I followed until I saw...

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,759
you draw the White Clothes Sword out.

102
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,319
I was not quite sure.

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,679
At last,

104
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,079
you said your family name was Zhou.

105
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,679
I guess...

106
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,759
Take a lover’s hand
seeing the cloud unfold.

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,039
What a good name!

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,439
Lao Wen
your name, Wen Ke Xing...

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,679
My dad’s family name was Wen,

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,239
but he was an orphan

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,199
and adopted the family name of the Healer Valley’s old chief.

112
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,959
Since the old chief decided to

113
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,519
banish my dad,

114
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,119
there would be no more

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,959
reasons to adopt his family name, right?

116
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,679
I’m a bird of passage
a traveler of no root,

117
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,599
this new name

118
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,359
suits my condition.

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,559
But now you...

120
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,999
Before meeting you and Cheng Ling

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,719
I was going to wander around the world,

122
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,359
die from drinking and end my life.

123
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,159
I thought I was homeless,

124
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,999
but now it’s good that

125
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,359
we are back.

126
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,479
Come,

127
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,399
this is for you.

128
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,439
I’m a bird of passage
a traveler of no root,

129
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,559
Take a lover’s hand
seeing the cloud unfold.

130
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,079
I’m going stay here forever,

131
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,639
as long as Senior Ye can heal me.

132
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,599
Cheng Ling and I

133
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
will live here forever.

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,999
Lao Wen,
you are welcomed any time.

135
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,519
Traveling is fun
but home is sweeter.

136
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,919
Ah Xiang.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,719
What took you so long from getting water?

138
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,719
Hurry up!

139
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,279
Ah Xiang,
I think I saw Tao Hong Lǜ Liu.

140
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,159
What Tao Hong Lǜ Liu?

141
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
The attackers at Yueyang Sect.

142
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,039
The grandma and grandpa couple
who abducted Sister Xiao Lian.

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,719
Are you sure that

144
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,839
it was them?

145
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,959
I’m sure.

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,319
I’m sure that the girl

147
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,879
was Sister Xiao Lian in disguise.

148
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,359
When I was getting water,

149
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,799
I heard Sister Xiao Lian’s voice.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,279
I guess she was restrained
by acupuncture points,

151
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,639
so she couldn’t speak
except to eat and drink.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,039
And that Tao Hong Lǜ Liu,

153
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,479
their arms were broken
by Hanged Ghost’s Soul Winding Box.

154
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,959
You were too far away to see it clearly,

155
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,039
that grandma and grandpa both
had one of their arms broken,

156
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,359
covering them with their sleeves.

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,799
If it’s them...

158
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,559
Ah Xiang, I’m sure it’s them.

159
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,879
We found them by luck,

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,879
and should not lose them.

161
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,879
Let’s think of a solution.

162
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,799
Ah Xiang, what’s wrong with you?

163
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,479
Ah Xiang, don’t be afraid.

164
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,359
No matter how strong they are,

165
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,359
I will use my life

166
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,439
to protect you and Sister Xiao Lian.

167
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,439
You can’t do that much
with your ability.

168
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,759
Brother Cao,
how about just letting it go?

169
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,039
You almost lost your life last time.

170
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,359
Ah Xiang, how could you say that?

171
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,479
How could I leave
Sister Xiao Lian like that?

172
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,719
If you’re afraid, just stay here.
I’ll go.

173
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,439
It’s not a big deal
to get beaten to death,

174
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,799
which is better than being a coward.

175
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,639
Go then.

176
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,919
Look who you would save
at the expense of your life.

177
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,399
Stop.

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,399
Cao Wei Ning.

179
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,319
You... how dare you treat me like this?

180
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,519
You... you promised my master

181
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,679
that you would never abandon me.

182
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,759
Ah Xiang, I will never abandon you.

183
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,799
But loyalty could be more important than love.

184
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,999
How could I

185
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,319
let go of my good friend?

186
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,439
How could a person like that
deserve your goodness?

187
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,719
Did I say I will not let you go?

188
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,439
I just forbid you
from wasting your life.

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
If we can’t beat them by force
we need to beat them by wit.

190
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
Ah Xiang, sorry for

191
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,039
my misunderstanding.

192
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,519
Stop talking nonsense with me here,

193
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,879
save her first.

194
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,399
You have to follow them,

195
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,759
tail them and leave marks.

196
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,359
It’s not far
from Broken Sword Manor here.

197
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,559
They are a part of the Five Lakes Alliance.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,719
I’ll call for help

199
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,239
and stop them later.

200
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,999
Ah Xiang, this method is good.

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,879
You are really smart.

202
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,319
Don’t waste your words here,

203
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,319
I have memorized this grudge,

204
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,359
and we’ll talk about it later.

205
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,279
Hurry up!

206
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,399
This fool is really a big fool!

207
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,759
How could he live alone
after I leave?

208
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,039
Thinking of him getting bullied

209
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,639
makes me angry.

210
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,599
Elder Huang,

211
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,879
haven’t we agreed

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,159
to meet at the ruined temple
in Great Stone Town?

213
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,119
Why did you come in advance?

214
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,719
I got exposed
in Great Stone Town

215
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,239
and was chased by the Scorpion.

216
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,719
I just got rid of them.

217
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,719
We were tricked
by Zhao Jing that bastard.

218
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,639
Two sides are hunting me.

219
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,399
The white side is chasing me,
the black side want to kill me.

220
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,519
Miss Gao,

221
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,999
do you know the relationship\
between Zhao Jing and the Scorpion?

222
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,919
I told you before

223
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,239
that Uncle Zhao will definitely
come to save me.

224
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,319
That’s impossible.

225
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,079
I messaged him
to exchange hostage

226
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,959
but he didn’t care.

227
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,559
I guess he wants us
to kill you earnestly

228
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,679
to  eliminate the witness.

229
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,759
Perhaps the trap to kill Cao Chong

230
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,719
was also set by him.

231
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,799
Huang He,

232
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,239
as you said,

233
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,639
we couple tried our best for years

234
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,479
to abduct this girl for you,

235
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,279
toiling and moiling
ad hiding our tails,

236
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,079
but it turns out to be a waste!

237
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,959
One cannot predict fate.

238
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,079
How could someone predict
the death of Gao Chong?

239
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,759
How could someone predict
that his brothers

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,119
do not care about his only daughter after all?

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,959
What is done is done.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,999
Zhao Jing will not exchange
the Glazed Armor for her

243
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,359
Hey girl,

244
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,479
if you can’t find a buyer,

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,639
then you are a worthless rubbish.

246
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,639
Believe it or not,

247
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,079
I’ll sell you to the lowest brothel.

248
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,279
Huang He,

249
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,679
you are as old as her grandpa,

250
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,039
don’t you feel ashamed

251
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,999
saying dirty words like this?

252
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,319
Grandma Tao Hong,

253
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,599
if not so,
how could the vengeance be taken

254
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,399
for those valiant who died
at Mount Qingya?

255
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,799
The Five Lakes Alliance had made
so many people died,

256
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,879
merely the Devil Gao’s death
is far from enough.

257
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,959
We can’t let

258
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,719
the devil’s daughter get away from it.

259
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,199
My dad is not a devil.

260
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,999
My dad didn’t kill them.

261
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,919
Shut up!

262
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,799
You know nothing.

263
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,559
You don’t know anything?

264
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,879
Then I’ll let you know.

265
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,279
Twenty years ago,

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,479
the battle of Mount Qingya caused
numerous people to lose their lives,

267
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,719
heroes of the world were deceived
by the Five Lakes Alliance.

268
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,639
The siege laid to Rong Xuan

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,359
was only because of their pursuit
of the Glazed Armor.

270
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,439
But in the name of slaying the devil,

271
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,119
countless people were cheated
to sacrifice their lives for the battle.

272
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,919
The only child of Tao and Lǜ Liu

273
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,119
died from sever injuries in this battle.

274
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,199
The rise of the Five Lakes Alliance should

275
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,999
thank those righteous ones

276
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,479
who died miserably in this battle.

277
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,119
What a tragedy!

278
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,599
Those under the field
of Mount Qingya

279
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,079
are still confused at the moment.

280
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,959
You... you are talking nonsense.

281
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,839
Huang He, we are all smart foxes.

282
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,479
Why are you trying to trick me?

283
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,599
Since she is worthless,

284
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,199
then good.

285
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,119
Why don’t we stop
torturing this innocent girl

286
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,919
and just kill her?

287
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,719
No!

288
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,599
Stop!

289
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,799
Sister Xiao Lian.

290
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,239
Cao Wei Ning.

291
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,279
Elder Huang,

292
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,598
I have respected you as an elder,

293
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,359
but I can’t believe
you are doing this.

294
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,639
Is your master here?

295
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,159
Better late than never.

296
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,639
Come to the right side now.

297
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,959
Help me kill them

298
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,119
and save Miss Gao.

299
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,039
Where did this idiot come from?

300
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,919
Old man, did you hear that?

301
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,839
He’s asking Huang
to come to the right side.

302
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,879
Stop laughing.

303
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,799
Young man, are you her lover?

304
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,359
Trying to save her like this
don’t you fear death?

305
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,279
No.

306
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,919
I’m not afraid of dying,
for I’m doing the right thing.

307
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,239
Let go of her now

308
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,839
and you would be forgiven.

309
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,039
Otherwise,

310
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,559
all righteous clans are
trying to find her.

311
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,479
What?

312
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,999
Huang He, spill your beans now.

313
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,039
You were trying to trick us

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,359
to leave her to you,

315
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,519
so you could take all the benefits alone.

316
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,239
We’ve done all dirty works,

317
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,039
then you wanna get rid of us?

318
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,759
Not so easy!

319
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,999
Let’s see just see who’s capable.

320
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,319
Sister Xiao Lian, let’s go!

321
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,959
Quickly!

322
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,159
Where are you going?

323
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,319
Elder Huang has failed.

324
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,559
Girl, come with me.

325
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,119
Sister Xiao Lian, run.

326
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,919
I’ll stop them.

327
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,839
Let’s go together.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,879
Run!

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,799
Wei Ning!

330
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,199
Tao Hong, Lǜ Liu.
How dare you!

331
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,159
Uncle Shen.

332
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,919
I have warned you,

333
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,599
don’t ever think of my niece.

334
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,719
Scram!

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,799
Ah Xiang.

336
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,879
Brother Cao.

337
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,039
Brother Cao, are you okay?

338
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,479
Are you okay?

339
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,839
Shen Shen, don’t be wordy.

340
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,159
We are taking this girl today.

341
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,119
Old man.

342
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,759
Uncle Shen.

343
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,079
Old man.

344
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,399
Old woman.

345
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,159
Old man.

346
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,479
Leave me alone.

347
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,919
A couple just like birds in the woods,

348
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,879
they will leave each other
when the time comes.

349
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,799
Run away.

350
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,079
Shut up!

351
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,639
Shen Shen, do it now.

352
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,519
Shen Shen,
please let go of my wife.

353
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,599
I... I...

354
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,999
Don’t waste your words.

355
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,159
Old man.

356
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,079
Isn’t it good for us to die together?

357
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,479
I’ll be your husband in our next life,

358
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,559
to let you bully me.

359
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,919
Fine, I’ll help you make it come true.

360
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,239
Uncle Shen, wait.

361
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,839
Grandpa, Grandma.

362
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,559
Elder Huang said

363
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,239
at that time

364
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,679
it was the battle of Mount Qingya
by the Five Lakes Alliance

365
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,079
that caused the death of your child.

366
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,039
Is that true?

367
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,399
Why ask us?

368
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,999
Ask Chevalier Shen.

369
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,159
The Five Lakes Alliance

370
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,439
made us lost our child,

371
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,599
hurting us both mentally
and physically.

372
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,799
I will not live with no vengeance.

373
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,279
If I can’t take my vengeance alive,

374
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,879
I’ll be a ghost haunting Gao Chong.

375
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,719
They were telling the truth.

376
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,599
That’s why my dad these years...

377
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,039
Uncle Shen.

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,199
Please let them go.

379
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,199
Xiao Lian,
you were kidnapped for so long.

380
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,079
It was Elder Huang’s conspiracy.

381
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,079
Grandpa and Grandma were used by him.

382
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,639
Though Grandma has kidnapped me,

383
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,279
she has a good nature.

384
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,119
Every time Elder Huang tried
to abuse me,

385
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,959
Grandma would refute him.

386
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,639
Uncle Shen.

387
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,359
When could the circle
of revenge be stopped?

388
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,519
Our Five Lakes Alliance

389
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,879
owe a life to them.

390
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,599
We should return it today.

391
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,119
Girl, we don’t need your pity.

392
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,079
Is that the right way
to make it even?

393
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,679
My son had died at a young age.

394
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,119
Shut up!

395
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,959
Leader Shen.

396
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,839
We have been in the world
or martial arts for twenty years.

397
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,999
Although we are not good people,

398
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,359
we keep our words.

399
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,959
Today,

400
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,639
if you spare us,

401
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,159
we will

402
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,999
quit this martial arts world.

403
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,239
Shut up, you can’t decide for me.

404
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,719
Shen Shen.

405
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,279
He’s afraid.

406
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,599
But I’ll never stop taking
my vengeance with the Alliance.

407
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,839
Kill me if you dare.

408
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,479
At the battle of Mount Qingya,

409
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,719
my niece was not born yet.

410
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,359
The resentment of the elders

411
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,359
will not involve the kids.

412
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,959
For shielding my niece,

413
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,119
I will let you go today.

414
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,119
If you still want to take revenge
on the Five Lakes Alliance,

415
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,359
just come for me.

416
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,559
I’ll wait.

417
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,450
Get lost!

418
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,519
You!

419
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,399
Wait.

420
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,879
Grandpa.

421
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,399
Grandma.

422
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,999
Take care.

423
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,079
Is Wei Ning okay?

424
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,039
You are always together.

425
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,919
You found Uncle Shen, right?

426
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,199
Right.

427
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,199
I’m relieve as they are safe.

428
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,239
Chevalier Shen,
just kill me as you want.

429
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,359
Ah Xiang, what are you talking about?

430
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,639
Why would Uncle Shen kill you?

431
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,959
Where is Wen Ke Xing?

432
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,279
I said I don’t know.

433
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,919
I still don’t know if you keep asking.

434
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,519
One would not lie in front of death.

435
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,879
I am not lying to you.

436
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,759
Ah Xiang, what are you talking about?!

437
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,399
Sister Xiao Lian,
for the sake of

438
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,359
good deeds,

439
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,159
please promise me that

440
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,559
don’t tell Brother Cao, I am...

441
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,559
Tell what? What are you talking about,
Ah Xiang?

442
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,719
Xiao Lian, come here.

443
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,239
Don’t stand with her.

444
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,919
Uncle

445
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,519
there must be
some misunderstanding

446
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,199
and we should solve it.

447
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,559
What misunderstanding?

448
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,959
She’s a henchman
of Ghost Valley’s Chief.

449
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,799
Just ask her.

450
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,759
Is Ah Xiang her real name?

451
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,639
This is true.

452
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,399
I’m not changing my name.

453
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,719
Amethyst Fiend, Gu Xiang is here.

454
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,679
That Ghosts Book

455
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,479
records small Ghosts like me?

456
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,239
I feel respected.

457
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,759
Why did you leave Wen Ke Xing

458
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,039
and stay with Nephew Cao?

459
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,479
Just tell the truth.

460
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,519
Even if I said it,

461
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,999
you would not believe.

462
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,359
I don’t want to be alone anymore.

463
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,439
I want to find a way back to life

464
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,639
and spend my life with him.

465
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,759
Do you believe it?

466
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,279
Since you know
that you are exposed,

467
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,719
why did you come to me?

468
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,759
Aren’t you afraid of me killing you?

469
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,519
I have no choice.

470
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,999
As the saying goes,
couple follow each other.

471
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,119
Who would accused me of

472
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,279
finding a man of righteousness?

473
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,999
I have to conform.

474
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,839
Leader Shen,

475
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,119
Please for the sake of my good deeds,

476
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,199
tell me,

477
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,359
am I on the Ghosts Book?

478
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,559
No.

479
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
That’s fine.

480
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,639
Brother Cao will never know.

481
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,399
Leader Shen, Sister Xiao Lian,

482
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,359
I have a request.

483
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,519
After you kill me,

484
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,599
can you help me hide it
from Brother Cao?

485
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,919
Just say I was killed
by Huang He

486
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,159
so that he won’t know
I lied to him.

487
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,239
Can you do that for me?

488
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,079
No, you are not!

489
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,599
Uncle Shen, Ah Xiang is a good girl.

490
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,239
Don’t kill her.

491
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,759
Don’t kill her, please.

492
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,599
Silly girl,

493
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,159
don’t be such a fool like me

494
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,559
who has spent half of my life

495
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,759
but still couldn’t tell man from ghost.

496
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,839
Come with me.

497
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,399
Master, are you going to
teach me boxing?

498
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,799
Since I finished my learning,

499
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,359
I hadn’t spent much time on boxing.

500
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,559
If your uncle is willing to teach you something,

501
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,799
you will be the one benefiting.

502
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,279
Nonsense.

503
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,639
Is it right to not teach your disciple

504
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,479
and let someone else do it?

505
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,599
Are you someone else?

506
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,679
Of course not.

507
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,079
Uncle Wen, can I call you Martial Uncle?

508
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,159
If you don’t answer,
I’ll take it as yes.

509
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,639
Brat,

510
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,359
you were a simple-minded cutie.

511
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,799
But now is cunning like a monkey
after acquaintance.

512
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,999
Good Martial Uncle.

513
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,399
Where did you learn you skills?

514
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,679
Brat, stop!

515
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,759
He becomes so naughty thanks to you.

516
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,239
Cheng Ling,

517
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,279
you have just begun to learn,

518
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,959
advanced ones are too hard for you.

519
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,039
Today I’m teaching you
the most basic one,

520
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,999
the Eight Trigram Palm.

521
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,559
Your grand master

522
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,959
introduced martial arts to me
with this one.

523
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,639
Master, speaking of which,

524
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,439
we’ve been here for days

525
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,999
and the rooms are cleared up...

526
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,239
I haven’t pay respect
to Grand Master.

527
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,199
Before you teach me today,

528
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,999
how about paying him a visit?

529
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,239
You have to tell him that

530
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,959
you have accepted a disciple like me

531
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,599
and that you found Martial Uncle Wen.

532
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,559
He will be relieved in Heaven.

533
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,919
Cheng Ling, I...

534
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,279
I’ve been in Leader Qin’s grace

535
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,399
and I should have paid my respect to him.

536
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,039
Fine, we’ll go together.

537
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,639
<i>[Tombs Qing Jiu Xiao, Qing Huai Zhang and Yao]</i>
Grand Master and Martial Uncle,

538
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,439
disciple Zhang Cheng Ling
is finally here.

539
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,439
Please be assured that

540
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,319
I will try my best

541
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,119
to bring glory
to Four Seasons Manor.

542
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,479
Grand Master,

543
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,919
you should

544
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,279
have already seen my dad
and Master Long.

545
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,919
The seniority is a little bit messed up.

546
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,519
But it doesn’t matter.
We are a family.

547
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,559
Please tell them that

548
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,479
Cheng Ling is good now

549
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,719
and making progress every day.

550
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,559
I am learning

551
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,839
the Arcane of Longyuna Cabinet
taught by Master Long with efforts,

552
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,959
although it is hard.

553
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,159
Brat,

554
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,599
you’re so wordy
like this since childhood.

555
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,599
How would it be when you grow up?

556
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,719
I have a lot of words

557
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,559
to say with Grand Master
and Martial Uncle.

558
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,239
Dad told me that

559
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,039
the spirits of the dead persist in

560
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,359
watching over those he loves.

561
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,039
No,

562
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,599
they will not.

563
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,239
They will.

564
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,879
Uncle Wen,
say something to Grand Master.

565
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,919
Cheng Ling,

566
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,199
if their spirits persist,

567
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,359
then one doesn’t have to speak out.

568
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,879
Sometimes,

569
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,439
it’s better to keep it in your heart.

570
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,239
Right.

571
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,759
Fine, I’ll say it in my mind.

572
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,759
Cheng Ling,

573
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,599
stop talking.

574
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,879
If you continue,

575
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,559
your grand master will be bothered.

576
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,599
if you have any other thing to say,

577
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,599
keep it until next time.

578
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,839
We will come to visit very often.

579
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,519
Lao Wen.

580
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,679
Ah Xu.

581
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,879
Can you leave first?

582
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,439
I need some time alone.

583
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,599
Fine.

584
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,839
Cheng Ling.

585
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,799
In the world,

586
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,879
is there really the netherworld?

587
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:25,999
Master,

588
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,678
no, Uncle Qin,

589
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,239
<i>[Tomb of Qing Huai Zhang and wife Yao]</i>
Senior Qin,

590
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,399
if you are in Heaven,

591
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,799
have you seen my parents?

592
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,399
I hope that
there are spirits after death.

593
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,158
But I fear that if you see....

594
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,159
see the path

595
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,519
I have taken,

596
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,719
will you find me disgracing the name
of Four Seasons Manor.

597
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,159
In the beginning,

598
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,559
when I couldn’t take it,

599
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,199
I would pretend

600
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,999
that I was not the suffering one,

601
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,999
but a nightmare of Zhen Yan.

602
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,719
When I woke up,

603
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,799
I found myself in the yard.

604
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,199
Time...

605
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,599
stops at the moment
when you recruited me.

606
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,279
May it never goes.

607
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,759
But I found out later that

608
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,959
it wasn’t Zhen Yan in a nightmare,

609
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,999
but me

610
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,959
in the sweet dream of Zhen Yan.

611
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,119
Fortune has failed

612
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,639
and Karma isn’t paid.

613
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,519
If this is the case,

614
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,039
I’d rather be a devil

615
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,759
and find my justice against fate.

616
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,239
It wasn’t blood in my veins
for the twenty years,

617
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,839
but the hatred.

618
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,799
The thought of vengeance

619
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,639
supported me to side from hell

620
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,839
and become the leader of ghosts,

621
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,359
and the king of venom

622
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,519
That Old Ghost didn’t expect this at all.

623
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,959
Twenty years later,

624
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,919
I could fulfill the curse of Zhen Yan
before his death

625
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:58,150
one by one

626
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,439
Kill them all.

627
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,359
Take the lived of them all.

628
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,519
All of them.

629
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,319
But after killing all of them,

630
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,359
my hatred hasn’t been alleviated.

631
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,439
All those who betrayed,

632
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,999
abandoned

633
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,239
and abused us

634
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,359
are covered with the blood of my parents.

635
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,479
They are demons
under human skins.

636
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,439
I will not spare any one of them.

637
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,159
The world has abandoned me

638
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,639
and I will kill them all.

639
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,759
When I left the valley,

640
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,679
I swore to myself

641
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,239
that I would end this world
of hypocrisy in fire

642
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,119
and drive them back to hell.

643
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,079
If this is sin,

644
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,679
be it the countless deaths
or flagrant crime,

645
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,359
it will be born by me alone.

646
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,959
If I am to be buried as well,

647
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,759
I am willing to do so.

648
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,999
But...

649
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,039
But...

650
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,199
since I am put into hell,

651
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,879
why do you give me a way

652
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,399
back to earth?

653
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,559
My life as Wen Kexing is ruined,

654
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,839
and I am not qualified
to call you Master.

655
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,479
If there is a next life,

656
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,479
I would do anything to repay this grace.

657
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,479
If there is no next life,

658
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,319
even if I were destined to hell,

659
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,839
I would still thank you for giving me

660
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,759
moments of brightness.

661
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,679
Ah Xiang.

662
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,479
You are awake, fool.

663
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,839
Ah Xiang,
where is Sister Xiao Lian?

664
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,439
Don’t worry.

665
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,479
Have some water first.

666
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,719
You fool.

667
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,839
I’ve told you just watch
and don’t show yourself.

668
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,479
Luckily I brought people
from the Broken Sword Manor

669
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,479
and arrived in time.

670
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,919
Or you would lose your life.

671
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,239
Since you’ve saved her,

672
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,519
where did they go?

673
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,799
Sister Xiao Lian was overwhelmed and fainted

674
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,599
and taken back to the Five Lakes Alliance
by Leader Mu.

675
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,599
Good, good.

676
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,759
Nothing has been delayed.

677
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,479
<i>It’s better not to tell him anything.</i>

678
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,959
Ah Xiang, you’re so smart.

679
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,199
Smart?

680
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,079
No so much.

681
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,519
Someone said I was a coward.

682
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,319
No, Ah Xiang.

683
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,599
Sorry for that.

684
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,639
I was confused.

685
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,079
And I was impatient and stupid.

686
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,399
How about giving me a beating?

687
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,479
Don’t be angry.

688
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,719
You...

689
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,959
fool.

690
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,599
Just stay where you are.

691
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,879
No one wants to beat you.

692
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,759
I’ll keep my hands clean.

693
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,999
Ah Xiang.

694
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,439
Is it that

695
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,479
we have conflicting fates?

696
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,719
Since you met me,

697
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,479
you’ve gotten injured very often.

698
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,759
It’s not your fault.

699
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,599
It’s because of my bad fighting

700
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,319
yet keep failing.

701
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,479
But don’t worry.

702
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,719
After returning to Mount Qingfeng,

703
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,079
I must practice martial arts well.

704
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,079
Then, I’ll protect you.

705
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,519
I will not let anyone bully you.

706
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,759
Who dares to bully me, only you.

707
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,319
No, I’m not. How dare I?

708
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,919
Besides, Martial Uncle
takes good care of girls.

709
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,119
Sisters from other sects

710
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,919
who come to us,

711
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,159
are treated as treasures.

712
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,239
If Martial Uncle knows I’m teasing you,

713
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,359
he will surely break my legs.

714
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,319
And Brother Wen...

715
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,599
Wait, Ah Xiang.

716
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,799
How could I tease you?

717
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,399
You are distracting me.

718
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,359
What if we really have
conflicting fates,

719
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,279
what shall we do?

720
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,239
What are you talking about, Ah Xiang?

721
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,999
It’s impossible.

722
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,839
I’m serious about it.

723
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,039
What if we really have conflicting fates?

724
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,079
Then I would give my life to you.

725
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,079
Ah Xiang.

726
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,319
But before that,

727
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,479
can you give me something to eat?

728
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,759
I’m starving to death.

729
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,439
Sure, here you go.

730
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,439
Be careful! It’s hot.

731
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,319
Here, you first.

732
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,319
I’ll just watch you.

733
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,799
The bigger one is for you.

734
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,359
The bun roasted by Ah Xiang taste so good.

735
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,759
It’s the best food in the world.

736
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,920
♪ The sky was gray
as I crossed the cold river ♪

737
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,550
♪ The moon in my cup at night
reflects the sadness in my smile ♪

738
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,200
♪ Who allowed me to roam
around the world on horseback? ♪

739
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:38,280
♪ Who is drunk in their dreams
