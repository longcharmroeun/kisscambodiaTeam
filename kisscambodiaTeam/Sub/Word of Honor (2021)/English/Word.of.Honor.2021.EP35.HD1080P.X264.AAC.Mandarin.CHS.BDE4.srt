[Episode 35]

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,079
Master, you are here.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,350
Mas...

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,359
So she’s the siren
who lured you to elope with her?

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,239
I...

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,719
<i>Try to bear it! Try to bear it!</i>

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,039
For the sake of Martial Uncle and Brother Cao.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,639
I thought it’s an exceeding beauty.

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,559
It turns out to be so-so.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,839
Master, Ah Xiang is not a siren.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,399
Although she comes from Ghost Valley,

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,439
in fact,

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,959
she’s quite pure and kind in personality.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,239
She has been through a lot together
with us in Mount Qingfeng.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,519
Master, you didn’t know it for
not getting along with her, but...

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,119
Martial Uncle knows.

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,639
Hold your tongue!

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,919
Siren, how daring you are!

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,959
You’ve even deluded my junior brother!

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,559
Huai Kong knew I would come,

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,079
and intended to help you two.

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,199
Cao Wei Ning, have a second thought about it.

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,960
Do you really want to fall into the diabolism
just for this siren?

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,760
Master, I’ve made up my mind.

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,320
I’ve even sworn that

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,560
throughout my whole life

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,039
until my death,

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,559
there is no moment

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,479
that I’ll betray Ah Xiang.

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,279
Master, you’ve told me since my childhood that

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,959
we must honor a promise with good faith.

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,239
I won’t break my promise to my girl.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,359
Enough!

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,599
You...

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,439
You’re not willing to fail the siren

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,119
but willing to witness
the Gentle Wind Sect

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,679
turn into a joke of the whole martial arts world.

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,879
Great! Great!

60

I’ve made tireless efforts to bring you up,

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,559
but you’ve paid me in such a way.

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,559
I know my sins.

63

the body falling from White Deer Cliff

120
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,879
must be a fake one.

The key found on the body

122
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,359
must also be a fake one.

The real key

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,799
has been taken by Wen Ke Xing

125
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,719
and exchanged for my cooperation with him.

126
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,879
All are here.

127
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,919
This is

128
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,679
the Glazed Armor that you gave to me.

129
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,039
This used to be

130
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,239
owned by the Window of Heaven.

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,959
Now Mo Huai Yang
has delivered himself into my hands,

132
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,399
he’ll give me

133
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,039
the remaining three pieces of the Glazed Armor...

135
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,839
You’ve desired for these

136
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,479
for more than 20 years.

137
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,359
But just in a flash...

138
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,479
They’re all in my hands.

139
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,319

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,639
deep in my heart

141
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,759
can be called ambition.

142
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,159
While in others,

143
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,359
it’s called illusion.

144
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,039
When it comes to you,

145
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
it’s called....

146
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,559
Oh, I almost forgot

147
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,959
it’s empty here.

148
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,919
Stop!

149
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,079
Wen Ke Xing, one more extra move

150
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,759
will cause her death.

151
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,119
If you want to save her,

152
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,479
hand over the Glazed Armor
and the key of the Armory.

153
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,919
I can give anything to you

154
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,119
as long as you let her go.

155
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,319
She’s just a little girl.

156
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,239
Little girl?

157
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,239
This siren is so amazing in deceiving others

158
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,559
that both my disciple and junior brother
have been bewitched.

159
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,999
I must eliminate the evil of our sect!

160
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,399
You killed them?

161
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,070
Shut up!

162
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,839
This is the true

163
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,039
last scene.

164
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,879
This is so-called coveting gains ahead

165
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,079
without being aware of danger behind.

166
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,919
But none of them knows

I...

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,759
am the real hunter.

169
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,879
Just run!

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,239
Where are the required things?

171
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,959
Hand them over.

172
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,399
Fine, I’ll give them to you.

173
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,959
What’s that sound?

174
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,079
What trick are you playing with me?

175
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,519
It’s the Drug Men Army.

176
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,679
It’s the Drug Men Army!

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,279
I’m going to kill him!

186
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,399
I am not your master.

187
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
I am your brother.

188
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,759
Brother.

189
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,599
Kill him for me.

190
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,719
I’ve never begged you for anything,

191
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,239
but kill him for me.

192
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,919
I’ll killed him for you.

193
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,839
I’ll killed him for you.

194
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,719
Thanks.

195
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,079
Thank you, Brother.

196
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,719
Please take good care of yourself.

197
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,799
From now on,
I can’t take care of you anymore.

198
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,519
I’m going to meet with my idiot, Brother Cao.

199
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,359
Ah Xiang.

200
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,239
Ah Xiang.

201
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,999
Ah Xiang!

202
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,839
<i>Master!</i>

203
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,959

204
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,439
<i>Do you feel dizzy? Are you hungry?</i>

205
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,639
<i>Do you want to eat?</i>

206
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,319
<i>My kind master!</i>

207
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,119
<i>I’m fine. I just need a rest.</i>

208
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,639
<i>Master. You... bastard!</i>

209
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,839
<i>See?</i>

210
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,839
<i>The unruly maid even dares to bully her master!</i>

211
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,319
<i>Master, you’re abandoning me?</i>

Scorpion King.

225
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,959
it turns out to be a trap of Scorpion King.

226
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,879
Leader Mo, I come for the entrustment

227
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,119
to see you off.

228
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,879
Damn brat.

229
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,279
I’m sorry, Ah Xiang.

230
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,839
I’ve made his death too easy.

231
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,679
Wait a moment,

232
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,439
I’m coming to you.

233
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,359
Chief of the Ghost Valley,
long time no see.

234
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,439
My ally.

235
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,359
You were high-spirited when we last met,

236
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,199
but now,

237
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,359
you turn to be so miserable.

238
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,399
So I’m taking these three pieces
of the Glazed Armor

239
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,879
sent by Mo Huai Yang,

240
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,519
if you don’t mind.

241
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,799
Just take that and get lost!

242
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,559
Don’t get in my way to enjoy the sunshine.

243
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,959
King.

244
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,679
I’ve admired Chief Wen for long,

245
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,079
why not allow me to send him off?

246
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,959
Such a figure like Chief of the Ghost Valley

247
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,359
deserves my dealing personally.

248
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,639
Any help from others

249
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,319
would be a kind of insult.

250
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,399
You even dare to hurt
the man of my Four Seasons Manor?

251
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,919
Leader Zhou,

252
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,919
how come your martial arts

253
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,399
made such a great progress?

254
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,479
Idiot, why are you here?

255
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,759
To die with a lunatic like you!

256
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,119
Leader Zhou. Chief Wen.

257
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,879
There is no need.

258
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,359
Today no one could leave Ghost Valley alive.

259
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,159
All of them are my children.

260
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,719
Today even I have to die here,

261
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,319
you must be my companion.

262
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,239
You could die together,

263
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,199
but why are you taking me?

264
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,559
The way to death is so boring,

265
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,839
both of us are clever,

266
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,359
isn’t there a second choice?

267
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,239
Great!

268
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,439
You can take the Glazed Armor,

269
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,359
but I must take him.

270
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,399
Then just go.

271
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,159
Boring.

272
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,759
So boring.

On your body,

286
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,319
there is light,

287
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,639
I will catch it and see.

00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,839
Leader,

292
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,519
We’ve found all of the bodies
of Ten Devils of the Ghost Valley,

293
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,639
no one has been missed.

294
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,399
The three betrayers among them
had been detained in the Chilly Lake Jail.

295
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,359
I’ve killed them.

296
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,519
Tragicomic Ghost,
Ghoul and Beauty Ghost have all died.

297
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,839
Beauty Ghost, Liu Qian Qiao?

298
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,519
Yes.

299
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,039
Scorpion King, have any questions?

300
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,770
No.

301
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,039
Nothing.

302
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,559
Leader.

303
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,799
We’re still making an inventory of
the bodies of those sect leaders,

304
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,559
but we haven’t found the bodies of Mo Huai Yang,

305
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,319
Fan Huai Kong and Mo Wei Xu.

306
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,279
I’ve damaged the body of Mo Huai Yang.

307
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,359
His body is out of the Valley.

308
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,319
Fan Huai Kong was killed by Mo Huai Yang.

309
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,719
and Mo Wei Xu is still missing.

310
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,959
There is no need to bother.

311
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,439
Did you hear what Scorpion King said?

312
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,999
Just go.

313
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,090
Yes.

314
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,999
It turns out that the first try
of the Drug Men Army

315
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,279
bears such power.

316
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,759
With such amazing troops,

317
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,439
High Highness will find no difficulty
in forging ahead.

318
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,759
Opening the Armory is a kind of great merit.

319
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,999
But the attack on Mount Qingya

320
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,599
has brought great damage to the martial arts world.

321
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,119
So many people have died.

322
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,439
It will take 20 to 30 years to recover.

323
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,999
It’s a great merit, too.

324
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,119
Scorpion King.

325
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,319
You match so well with me in obtaining wealth.

326
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,399
Since Lady Evil Bodhisattva’s introduction,

327
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,079
I’ve enjoyed rapid advances in my career.

328
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,959
It’s so weird.

329
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,439
So many people have died.

330
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,679
But it’s none of your business.

331
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,559
Old Duan.

332
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,999
You’ve harmed others
without benefiting yourself.

333
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,279
You feel happy for nothing.

334
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,839
Lady,

335
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,679
you’re limited in experience.

336
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,279
Since ancient times, the chevaliers have
intended to violate the bans.

337
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,679
These martial artists always fish
for fame and credit.

338
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,439
His Highness is going to raise the army,

339
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,319
sooner or later these bandits will be cleared up.

340
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
It’s an act of killing two birds

341
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,919
with one stone, isn’t it?

342
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,279
But you’ve cooperated with Zhao Jing before.

343
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,239
War allows deceit.

344
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,159
I don’t believe it.

345
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,279
You bad guys

346
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,679
who desire to cheat on each other

347
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,079
and set up traps for others.

348
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,359
Aren’t you tired?

349
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,119
Master!

350
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,959
It’s me, Ah Xiang.

351
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,679
I’ve seen Mom and Dad.

352
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,359
They want to thank you.

353
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,839
There are words for you.

354
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,319
I’m not feeling well now.

355
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,599
Come in another day.

356
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,199
Then have a cup of tea.

357
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,439
I’m so tired.

358
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,799
Get out.

359
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,719
Okay.

360
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,759
I’m leaving now.

361
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,799
Brother.

362
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,759
Please take good care of yourself.

363
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,399
Ah Xiang!

364
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,799
Ah Xiang!

365
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,239
Ah Xiang!

366
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,319
Prince Qi.

367
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,039
Grand Wizard.

368
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,519
Zi Shu.

369
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,719
Thank you for your help

370
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,319
to take them out.

371
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,319
You’re thoughtful. It’s so beautiful here.

372
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,639
Master, just now Prince Qi asked me

373
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,039
how to write the tombstones
for Brother Cao and Sister Xiang.

374
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,079
Yes,

375
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,639
since they haven’t held
the official wedding party,

376
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,599
Miss Xiang is still a girl,

377
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,319
I don’t know whether to write her name

378
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,399
or write as Madam Cao.

379
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,039
Just write Madam Cao.

380
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,759
Ah Xiang would love it.

381
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,039
Master, has Martial Uncle waken up yet?

382
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,079
I’ve made him Drunk-Like-A-Dream,

383
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,799
for I don’t know how to face him.

384
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,319
Cheng Ling, I hope you

385
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,919
take good care of your martial uncle.

386
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,639
Deal?

387
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,279
Master, where are you going?

388
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,359
I thought I could settle down,

389
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,879
or maybe roaming all over the world

390
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,999
is my destiny.

391
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,359
Leader Zhou,

392
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,839
you pulled out all those nails on your body?

393
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,599
Zi Shu, why did you do that to yourself?

394
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,679
You...

395
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,039
When did it happen?

396
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,759
Before the Heroes Conference.

397
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,999
I had to recover with all my power

398
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,799
to avenge him.

399
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,879
I must achieve one more thing,

400
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,319
which is to stop Prince Jin
from opening the Armory.

401
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,999
Not many days left.

402
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,959
What few days?

403
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,799
Master, do you...

404
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,999
Wu Xi, is there any other way?

405
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,759
Look at Zi Shu,

406
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,239
he is high-spirited.

407
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,999
Will it do to treat him right now?

408
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,559
Master Wen...

409
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,199
Master Wen has been hurt,
and we could go find Immortal Ye.

410
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,559
He is a peerless master.

411
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,199
With his help and Wu Xi’s divination...

412
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,319
It’s too late.

413
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,759
I’ve taken the elixir from South Xinjiang.

414
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,999
We could refine another one.

415
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,559
I will give all I have

416
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,959
to find the rare and valuable materials.

417
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,479
Zi Shu.

418
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,759
There must be a way out.

419
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,239
Bei Yuan,

420
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,119
it’s really too late.

421
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,359
Even if the Chief of the Healer is alive,

422
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,279
I’ve done all I could.

423
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,039
Now that I’m destined to die,

424
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,319
I have no more desires.

425
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,199
The Healer Valley

426
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,359
and the Yin Yang Book.

427
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,959
Master, there must be ways.

428
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,079
It’s nothing but a life for a life.

429
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,959
I can exchange my life with you.

430
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,839
Master, let’s go find the Yin Yang Book.

431
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,279
Idiot.

432
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,199
With your love and care,

433
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,879
I’ve already been satisfied.

434
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,839
