[Episode 33]

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,799
He also said

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,559
even if it was not for the alliance
with the Window of Heaven,

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,159
he would do it for the reputation
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,879
leaving no mistake.

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,959
He asked me to rest assured.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,759
He...

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,639
did he say this without any hesitation

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,319
or after struggles?

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,879
Since it has ended like this,

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,039
do you still...

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,919
Do you still need to ask such a question?

34
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,079
I’m bold to say something more.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,319
Your trial is

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,719
indeed a thorough move
of bringing owls to Athens.

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,279
Fanatic!

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,159
So wanton!

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,319
I’m sorry for my impudence.

57
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,239
This is the recipe for the once-a-month antidote.

58

Don’t you understand?

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,079
Haven’t you always begged me

60
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,079
to spare Yu Qiu Feng before?

61

However, both of us suffer from
the Slave Voodoo of Scorpion King,

00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,639
have you forgotten?

If we don’t get the antidote within one month,

97

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,639
I know exactly how dangerous the Ghost Valley is.

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,119
Scorpion King wants us to be the pawns,

103
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,319
and it’s filled with grim possibilities this time.

104
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,159
Why don’t we just escape?

105
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,359

107

that’s not it.

108

Although fighting against the Ghost Valley
is definitely dangerous,

109
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,879
we might escape the danger by a hair’s breath....

110
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,279
However, once we escape...

111
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,239
I’ve made up my mind,

112
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,519
I’m leaving tonight,

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,239

Today heroes across the country
all gather together,

151
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,999
since we differ in martial arts

152

and don’t know each other well,

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,999
we must elect a leader

154
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,479
to guide us in conquering the Ghost Valley.

155
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,759
Judging from virtue,

156
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,839
Grandmaster Ci Mu deserves high prestige.

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,079
From the angle of martial arts,

158
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,719
as Chief of Bodhidharma Hall,

159
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,159
he is well up in technique.

160
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,399
In terms of reputation,

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,319
Shaolin Sect has long been the supreme
in the martial arts world.

162
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,839
Therefore, I recommend Grandmaster Ci Mu

163
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,639
to guide us to conquer the Ghost Valley.

164
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,719
Amitabha, thank you for your appreciation.

165
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,879
But as a Buddhist,

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,919
I’m not suitable to lead such an action.

167
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,359
I have someone suitable to recommend.

168
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,239
Mo Huai Yang, Leader of the Gentle Wind Sect.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
He was the champion of the Heroes Conference
20 years ago.

170
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,599
In the past 20 years,
he has secluded himself to practice.

171
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,519
His martial arts skills
must have reached a high level.

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,239
Since we’re martial artists,

173
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,999
and we’re voting for the supreme leader
of the martial arts world,

174
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,439
who should be supreme in martial arts.

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,999
Therefore, I vote for Leader Mo.

176
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,799
Everybody,

177
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,879
today we are voting for a leader

178
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,999
that not only has virtue and reputation,

179
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
but also the strong leadership.

180
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,119
Currently, the Ghost Valley is rudderless,

181
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,159
but it bears the geographical advantage

182
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,399
and strict fortification.

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,359
Therefore, in my opinion,

184
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,399
this leader must be good at
plotting and deciding.

185
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,999
What’s more, he must be equipped with

186
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,559
experience in battle commanding.

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,079
Considered from this angle,

188
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,159
Chief of the Five Lakes Alliance
is the most suitable one,

189
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,479
right?

190
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,399
Yes, exactly.

191
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,719
Yes, you’re right.

192
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,599
Leader Mo, that’s fair enough.

193
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,079
On any other aspects,
you all might be outstanding enough to win,

194
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,159
however in these three points,

195
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,799
no one could bear comparison with our Chief Zhao.

196
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,919
He’s the perfect one.

197
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,199
Right?

198
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,799
Yes, you’re right.

199
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,559
Yes. Yes. Yes.

200
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,999
Vote for Chief Zhao.

201
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,439
Just now Chief Zhao has

202
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,359
made a good point.

203
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,239
When the martial artists vote for a leader,

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,719
the voted one definitely,
should be supreme in martial arts.

205
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,519
Why not ask the candidates
to combat in public?

206
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,319
The final winner will be the supreme leader
of the martial arts world.

207
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,199
Isn’t that easy and simple?

208
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,999
That’s true.

209
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,479
Great, combat with martial arts.

210
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,759
Combat with martial arts!
Combat with martial arts!

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,919
Right, combat with martial arts.

212
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,079
It’s fair to combat with martial arts.

213
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,159
It makes sense.

214
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,759
Chief Zhao.

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,919
Please.

216
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,959
It’s my honor to learn from Leader Mo.

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,919
Please.

218
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,039
Everybody,

219
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,239
since the very beginning,

220
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,039
it’s always said that Chief Zhao
is noble in morality

221
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,359
and excellent in strategy,

222
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,039
but not that well

223
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,159
in martial arts.

224
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,519
However, the demonstration today has shown...

225
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,359
Amitabha...

226
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,399
He indeed is awesome.

227
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,599
Unexpectedly, Chief Zhao’s martial arts

228
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,079
have reached such a high level.

229
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,079
Leader Mo is amazing in martial arts,

230
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,839
but Chief Zhao has succeeded in
dog-fighting with him for quite awhile

231
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,679
without a hint of loss.

232
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,439
There are indeed numerous talents
emerging in that martial arts world.

233
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,959
Ridiculous.

234
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,879
Since ancient times, the leader of martial arts must be of intelligence and virtue.

235
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,399
Zhao Jing, how dare you stand on the stage.

236
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,399
Zhao Jing, you were a son of a servant.

237
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,119
Due to the odd death of the only son of the former leader of Tai Lake Sect,

238
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,439
you willingly became the foster son of Chief Zhao,

239
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,359
that’s why you were among the five sons
in the Five Lakes Alliance.

240
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,519
Later the five sons of Five Lakes Alliance
and Rong Xuan became cronies

241
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,079
and jointly built the Armory.

242
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,319
Shut up.

243
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,999
How dare you!

244
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,999
How dare you stand here

245
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,639
and frame our Chief Zhao!

246
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,839
Someone! Catch him!

247
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,239
After the Armory was built,

248
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,599
you applied poison on Gao Chong’s sword

249
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,199
when the five sons fought with Rong Xuan,

250
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,319
who thought he had hurt Rong Xuan by mistake.

251
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,679
Rong Xuan went crazy because of this

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,719
and went mad.

253
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,479
Gao Chong failed to explain for himself
and passed away with regrets.

254
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,839
The five sons collapsed and had been depressed

255
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,679
for the rest of their lives.

256
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,959
You’re the chief culprit in all these crimes.

257
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,879
If such a man of no loyalty and morality

258
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,679
sweeps all with his martial arts
and becomes the supreme leader

259
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,119
of the martial arts world,

260
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,119
will you be convinced?

261
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,599
- Master, Master!
- Senior Brother!

262
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,079
Master!

263
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,519
- Master, Master!
- Senior Brother!

264
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,439
Master, are you okay?

265
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,359
Bastard!

266
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,799
Sneak attack! Vile!

267
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,039
Zhao Jing, what’s your excuse?

268
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,159
What explanation?

269
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,759
This bastard

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,439
kept gabbling on and on

271
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,439
when I was combating with Leader Mo,

272
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,599
setting me up.

273
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,399
Come and look,

274
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,039
he’s the accomplice of the Chief of Ghost Valley!

275
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,239
When we surrounded and killed Wen Ke Xing,

276
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,239
he had risked his life to save him.

277
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,119
You witnessed it with your own eyes.

278
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,599
So,

279
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,399
he was the one to set me up with hidden weapons.

280
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,999
Since you’re the winner,

281
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,479
I, Zhou Zi Shu, the Leader
of the Four Seasons Manor

282
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,039
am willing to challenge
and learn from Chief Zhao.

283
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,559
Who said the Four Seasons Manor was doomed?

284
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,679
Who?

285
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,359
Why is he here? It’s Wen Ke Xing.

286
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,239
Hasn’t he died?

287
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,919
Why didn’t he die?

288
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,079
Didn’t he fell down from the cliff?

289
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,279
What’s going on now?

290
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,359
Senior Brother, please let me handle this.

291
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,199
Isn’t he Wen Ke Xing,
Chief of the Ghost Valley?

292
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,359
Indeed, my name is Wen Ke Xing,

293
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,039
but I’m from the Four Seasons Manor.

294
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,319
We’re just sharing the same name.

295
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,999
Are you all making a mistake?

296
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,159
Wen Ke Xing.

297
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,119
Are you fooling us?

298
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,559
How could you say such nonsense words?

299
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,279
All heroes, please don’t buy his words.

300
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,439
He’s truly the Chief of the Ghost Valley.

301
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,479
Right.

302
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,359
We’ve all witnessed it with our own eyes.

303
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,599
He is Chief of the Ghost Valley
on the Ghost Book.

304
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,079
The Ghost Book was compiled by Zhao Jing,

305
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,199
who is unfaithful and unjust.

306
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,719
Couldn’t he just set me up?

307
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,639
Ridiculous!

308
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,959
That’s beyond dispute.

309
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,679
The three ghosts that betrayed
the Ghost Valley are here.

310
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,199
To know whether he is
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

311
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,119
just ask them directly.

312
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,639
Bring them up.

313
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,199
They’re Changing Ghost,

314
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,839
Black Grim Reaper and Happy Ghost.

315
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,719
Do you recognize this person on stage?

316
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,679
Is he your former master?

317
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,719
We don’t know him.

318
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,279
As we know,

319
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,959
Wen Ke Xing, Chief of the Ghost Valley,
had been killed in White Deer Cliff.

320
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,319
His body is still in

321
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,999
the stronghold of the Five Lakes Alliance.

322
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,159
Does Chevalier Zhao

323
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,239
intentionally finagle all the heroes?

324
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,319
Scorpion,

325
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,810
you...

326
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,199
I’m a disciple of the Four Seasons Manor,

327
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,519
my master is Chevalier Qin, Qin Huai Zhang.

328
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,479
This is my Eldest Senior.

329
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,559
As for my parents...

330
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,879
Ah Xu, please lend me your sword

331
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,399
I’ll explain to you later.

332
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,999
I have a question.

333
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,879
Do you still remember Eighteen Moves of Qiuming?

334
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,439
Zhen Ru Yu?

335
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,319
Zhen Ru Yu of the Healer Valley.

336
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,679
Eighteen Moves of Qiuming.

337
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,959
Eighteen Moves of Qiuming
of the Divine Healer, Zhen Ru Yu.

338
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,439
What’s your relationship with Benefactor Zhen?

339
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,039
It turns out that you haven;t forgotten him.

340
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,919
When he sacrificed himself in Mount Qingya,

341
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,719
when he was threatened in Healer Valley,

342
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,119
when he lost all his martial arts skills,

343
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,319
when he was slaughtered to death
by the evil ghosts,

344
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,959
where were you all?

345
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,359
Answer me!

346
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,679
What’s your relationship
with Zhen Ru Yu, the Divine Healer?

347
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,199
He is my father.

348
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,279
Nonsense!

349
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,039
Just now you said your surname was Wen.

350
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,319
My father’s original surname was Wen.

351
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,919
Later on, Chief Zhen of the Healer Valley
gave him another surname,

352
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,039
which is Zhen.

353
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,239
However, since my later father
had been expelled by his sect,

354
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,039
I, as his son,

355
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,839
would follow his wish

356
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,039
to change the surname back to Wen.

357
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,879
That’s why I’m called Wen Ke Xing.

358
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,879
Nonsense!

359
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,839
How dare you ruin
the later Chevalier Zhen’s reputation?

360
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,759
You must be the Leader of
the Mount Emei Sect, right?

361
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,719
When I was a month old,

362
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,319
Chevaliers of the Mount Emei Sect
had jointly sewed a patchwork

363
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,279
to send to the Healer Valley as a gift.

364
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,559
It’s my fault

365
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,399
that I haven’t come to thank you

366
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,639
for your kindness and benevolent affections...

367
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,039
You’re really...

368
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,759
Elderly Nun Zhi Yin,

369
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,199
don’t be fooled by him!

370
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,839
Brother Zhen has been upright
and aboveboard for his whole life,

371
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,559
how could he have such a vile son!

372
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,119
Wen Ke Xing.

373
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,759
The three ghosts just now

374
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,359
are obviously your lackeys.

375
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,719
You asked them to surrender to me

376
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,239
and turn against me now.

377
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,079
This is what you’ve arranged, right?

378
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,759
Listen,

379
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,079
such a clown trick

380
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,199
wouldn’t fool all the heroes around here.

381
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,279
Heroes, please listen to me.

382
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,039
The Ghost Valley are use to making mischief.

383
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,999
My Big Brother Gao Chong had been set up

384
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,359
by them and died unjustly.

385
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,079
There’s five pieces of the Glazed Armor
in our Five Lakes Alliance

386
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,799
and you have taken four pieces of them,

387
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,759
now you’re targeting mine.

388
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,959
Heroes, don’t fall for it!

389
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,919
Shut up!

390
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,799
You don’t deserve to call Big Brother
by his name.

391
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,999
You don’t deserve it!

392
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,439
Fifth Brother.

393
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,799
I understand now.

394
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,599
Shen Shen.

395
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,759
It’s you who colluded with the Ghost Valley
and murdered Big Brother.

396
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,399
I’ve suspected there is a mole
in Five Lakes Alliance for long,

397
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,239
but I didn’t expect it was you.

398
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,079
You leaked the secret of the Glazed Armor!

399
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,439
You murdered the Leader of Mount Tai Sect.

400
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,479
You coordinated to kidnapped Gao Xiao Lian

401
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,319
and threatened Big Brother with her life.

402
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,839
That’s why he endured all the humiliation

403
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
and eventually committed suicide in public.

404
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,759
It turns out that you’re the evil ghost.

405
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,279
Nonsense.

406
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,479
Thirty years ago,

407
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,999
Zhao Wen Da, Leader of the Tai Lake Sect,

408
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,559
was confined to his bed
for the pain of losing his son.

409
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,839
Zhao Jing had served and taken good care of him,

410
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,799
Chief Zhao was touched to adopt him as a foster son

411
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,439
and helped him to make rapid advances.

412
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,119
Bad girl,

413
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,679
how dare you come here to spread fallacies!

414
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,799
Why did I mention such old stories

415
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,639
in front of all heroes?

416
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
I just want to ask you, Chief Zhao,

417
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,799
why did you hate my dad so much?

418
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,679
You not only murdered my dad

419
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,879
and took away his throne,

420
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,839
but also utterly discredited him,

421
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,439
making him regret for a lifetime

422
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,279
and die with no hope of vengeance.

423
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,879
Is it because my dad had ever witnessed

424
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,879
how miserable you used to be thirty years ago?

425
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,799
All the eye-witnesses to your tough time
had all died distressingly.

426
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,839
Are these all coincidences?

427
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,719
Didn’t you have witnessed?

428
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,399
Can’t they be coincidences?

429
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,399
I’m Zhang Cheng Ling,

430
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,199
the son of Zhang Yu Sen,
Leader of the Mirror Lake Sect.

431
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,599
This is the letter given by
my father before he died

432
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,319
and he asked me to send it to Senior Ye.

433
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,119
It said that twenty years ago,

434
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,919
Senior Rong’s going mad was due

435
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,919
to the setting of Zhao Jing.

436
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,359
He knew exactly that the combat
of the five brothers

437
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,879
[To Senior Ye in Mount Changming]
would result in wounds and hurt.

438
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,399
So he applied poison of the sword of Chief Gao

439
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,479
in secrecy.

440
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,719
Eventually, he had things his way

441
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,079
and Senior Rong was poisoned and went mad,

442
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,759
which resulted in a series of tragedies later.

443
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,919
In a word,

444
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,559
thousands of casualties
in the Battle of Mount Qingya

445
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,719
were all caused by Zhao Jing.

446
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,679
Cheng Ling, oh Cheng Ling.

447
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,319
You’ve wasted my love and favor!

448
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,519
How dare you talk nonsense here?

449
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,879
Nonsense!

450
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,319
Zhao Jing.

451
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,959
Failing to speak in self-defense
is miserable, right?

452
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,199
In the past, you slandered my father

453
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,959
just by a one-sided story, didn’t you?

454
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,879
All of you, please have a look!

455
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,359
Isn’t he the eldest disciple of the Yueyang Sect?

456
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,639
Didn’t he commit suicide?

457
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,639
Yes, he’s first disciple of our Yueyang Sect

458
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,199
and my Eldest Senior, Deng Kuan.

459
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,319
As we know,

460
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,399
at the Heroes Conference in Mount Jun,

461
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,799
Eldest Senior accused my father

462
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,599
who was beyond self-defense

463
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,679
and claimed his innocence with his death.

464
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,559
Eldest Senior disappeared from then on.

465
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,159
Didn’t you feel strange?

466
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,350
Missing?

467
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,119
Zhao Jing.

468
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,599
Zhao Jing set me up.

469
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,399
Master.

470
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,759
I failed my master.

471
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,319
Eldest Senior.

472
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,559
All of you have heard it.

473
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,519
Eldest Senior was captured by
Zhao Jing back then

474
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,359
and compelled by him with occult tricks.

475
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,999
That’s why he accused my father
at the Heroes Conference.

476
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,919
We’ve tried every means to get him out.

477
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,119
Although we’ve conducted
recuperative medical care on him,

478
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,359
he hasn’t recovered completely.

479
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,799
Zhao Jing is the evil backstage manipulator!

480
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,439
Zhao Jing is the shame of the martial arts world.

481
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,359
If one

482
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,719
can’t vindicate for his parents,

483
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,599
what’s the difference between him and a beast?

484
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,319
I’m just a girl with no power.

485
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,959
Today I unmasked Zhao Jing by risking my life,

486
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,839
just hope that all of you heroes
can uphold justice for me.

487
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:55,559
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

488
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,199
Amitabha...

489
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:09,239
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

490
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,319
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

491
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,359
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

492
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,359
Kill this shame of the martial arts world!
Bastard!

493
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,239
Fluff!

494
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,919
Wen Ke Xing, if you’re capable,
just kill me.

495
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,279
Unable to confess,

496
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,079
betrayed by all,

497
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,879
isolated and alone.

498
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,439
Traitor Zhao Jing!

499
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,759
Do you admit your guilt?

500
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,870
Wen Ke Xing, you’ve deployed well and perfectly

501
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,119
to frame me.

502
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,119
I’ll just accept it.

503
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,199
If you want, just kill me.

504
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,239
However, if you desire to

505
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,159
force me to plead guilty,

506
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,919
you must be out of your mind.

507
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,919
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

508
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,399
you called white and black.

509
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,199
I didn’t.

510
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,239
I’ve just tried to

511
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,559
correct the mistake.

512
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,719
So stubborn!

513
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,479
Just as what Miss Gao has said,

514
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,719
if one

515
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,759
can’t vindicate for his parents,

516
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,319
he will be just the same as the beast.

517
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,199
Here comes the question,

518
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,679
an eye for an eye

519
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,199
is perfectly justified, right?

520
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,439
Yes, it is.

521
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,359
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

522
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,719
My parents had spend their whole life in saving and curing people, and thousands of people

523
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,759
we under the obligation to them.

524
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,879
But Zhao Jing betrayed them,

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,959
resulting in them being tortured to death.

526
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,119
I swear to Heaven that,

527
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,719
I, as the son of my parents,

528
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,319
will let Zhao Jing suffer

529
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,159
all the tribulations

530
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,199
that he had brought to my parents.

531
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,919
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

532
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,959
I’ve made a wrong move,

533
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,639
But I didn’t lose.

534
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,999
You’re the one who failed in this case.

535
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,479
You’ve been fooled by me for more than 20 years.

536
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,239
The whole martial arts world
has been turned upside down by me.

537
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,079
I feel content.

538
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,519
I live at will and freedom,

539
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,439
and I die with vigor and vitality.

540
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,599
This is not the end of the story.

541
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,519
If you kill me,

542
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,799
you’ll all live under my shadow.

543
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,719
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

544
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,719
Great!

545
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,319
I’ll make you wish you were dead.

546
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,079
<i>Father, Mother!</i>

547
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,119
<i>Master.</i>

548
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,319
<i>Chief Gao.</i>

549
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,479
<i>Ah Xu.</i>

550
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,559
<i>This is the path
that you’d hope me to choose, right?</i>

551
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,279
You deserve it.

552
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,679
Foster-Father.

553
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,559
Take this.

554
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,079
It’s good for you.

555
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,239
Foster-Father.

556
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,319
I know you’re good at talking.

557
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,399
As long as you talk,

558
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,439
you will convince me.

559
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,679
Therefore, from now on,

560
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,279
don’t ever try to speak.

561
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,679
Just have a rest. Have a rest.

562
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,639
Ah Xu.

563
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,119
Give it back to you. Let’s go back home!

564
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,719
Go back home first, okay?

565
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,239
I’ll tell you everything after we get home.

566
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,399
By then,

567
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,839
whether to beat or punish me,

568
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,079
it’s all up to you.

569
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,599
Ah Xu.

570
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,879
This is the best day of

571
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,239
my whole life.

572
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,999
Don’t you beat me here.

573
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,479
Deal.

574
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,159
Mark it on the book first.

575
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,439
- Master. Martial Uncle.
- Great.

576
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,279
Little idiot, let’s go back home.

577
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,079
What do you want to eat for dinner?

578
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,279
Chief of the Ghost Valley,

579
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,519
where are you going?

580
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,439
What do you call my junior brother?

581
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,119
Zhao Jing faced retribution for a life of crimes

582
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,159
and had only himself to blame.

583
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,079
Today, our gathering here

584
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,879
is not to judge Zhao Jing

585
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,799
but to crusade
against this Chief of the Ghost Valley.

586
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,919
Wen Ke Xing, you’ve revenged for yourself,

587
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,679
it’s time for public indignation.

588
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,319
Mo Huai Yang, are you insane?

589
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,639
This kid is the descendant of Chevalier Zhen,

590
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,919
not Chief of the Ghost Valley.

591
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,359
Leave alone the chance,

592
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,559
even if it’s true,

593
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,759
Zhen Ru Yu had done a favor for your sect,

594
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,359
but what about Gentle Wind Sect?

595
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,359
It’s none of our business.

596
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,759
Wen Ke Xing.

597
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,239
What did you do on White Deer Cliff?

598
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,719
You’re the Chief of the Ghost Valley,

599
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,639
why don’t you dare to admit it?

600
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,439
Don’t you feel ashamed?

601
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,639
Fine, I admit it.

602
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,239
I’m the Chief of the Ghost Valley.

603
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,959
Just now I was just kidding.

604
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,839
Wen Ke Xing, how dare you cheat me?

605
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,839
Please forgive me.

606
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,399
If I didn’t lie to you,

607
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,239
I wouldn’t have gotten the chance
to judge Zhao Jing,

608
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,999
right?

609
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,999
Are you a descendant of the Zhen family or not?

610
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,959
Why did you join the Ghost Valley?

611
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,279
It’s due to all of you.

612
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,239
Nonsense!

613
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,279
Benefactor Zhen...

614
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,439
Enough, Elderly Nun Zhi Yin.

615
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,199
Your calling him Benefactor

616
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,359
is a kind of sarcasm, isn’t it?

617
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,359
When your benefactor was utterly discredited

618
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,719
and turned into a waste,

619
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,919
where were you Mount Emei Sect?

620
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,319
I could never figure it out

621
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,399
my father had so many bosom friends,

622
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,559
relative and friends back then,

623
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,719
but when darkness crept into our family,

624
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,319
where were you all?

625
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,479
Your parents ending

626
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,479
was not for the persecution of others

627
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,519
but your father’s protection for Rong Xuan

628
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,159
to hide the secret of the Armory.

629
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,319
This is the reason why I came here.

630
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,199
Anyone desiring to clear with my junior brother

631
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,599
must come at me first.

632
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,679
It’s not your turn.

633
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,279
Immortal Ye. Immortal Ye.

634
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,759
Immortal Ye. Immortal Ye.

635
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,759
Senior Ye.

636
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,359
Senior Ye, you come at the right moment.

637
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,959
Please lead all heroes
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

638
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,919
That’s right.

639
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,519
I will definitely destroy Ghost Valley.

640
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,119
Everyone in the Ghost Valley is doomed to die.
