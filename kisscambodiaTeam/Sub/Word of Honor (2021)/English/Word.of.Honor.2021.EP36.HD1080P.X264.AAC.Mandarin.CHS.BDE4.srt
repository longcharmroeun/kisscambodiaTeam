23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,159
Master.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,679
Since Prince Jin is so evil,

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,119
why don’t you kill him?

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,839
Cheng Ling,

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,719
in private,

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,839
there’s too much entanglement
between the Prince and me.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,519
For righteousness,

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,839
killing him is absolutely not a choice.

31
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,440
[Heaven and Earth]

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,719
Prince Jin rules over the Northwest.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,519
Yet the people around him are eyeing covetously.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,599
If I kill him,

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,399
they definitely will rise in revolt.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,399
All I can do is to injure him,

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,439
which keeps him to his bed

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,439
and prevent others from seizing power.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,519
This is the perfect balance
in the battle dragon and tiger.

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,519
I don’t understand.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,039
Cheng Ling,

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,519
the rebel of Jin troop is an irreversible tide.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,519
If your master kills Prince Jin,

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,600
there’ll be someone else taking over the power.

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,360
The flames of war
will spread to other places.

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,640
There is no power balance.

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
Only when Prince Jin and others

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,879
are busy fighting with each other
for internal power struggle,

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,279
people around the country
can enjoy peace and happiness temporarily.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,599
Prince Qi, don’t ever try to explain to me.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,999
I’m an idiot. I don’t understand

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,119
and I won’t.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,999
I just want to save my master.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,199
Childish!

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,679
Cheng Ling, you must understand,

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,119
in front of righteousness and justice,

57
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,039
my life doesn’t matter at all.

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,239
It’s my fault to bring up the Jin Army.

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,399
Wars take away numerous lives.

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,599
By then, what’s on my shoulder

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,919
won’t only be the regret about
the Four Seasons Manor.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,719
but also the souls
that die in all battlefields.

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,479
Yes.

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,479
I’m sorry, Master.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,639
Since Prince Jin has obtained the Glazed Armor,

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,119
he will definitely rush for the Yin Yang Book.

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,519
Even though Yin Yang Book
cannot necessarily cure him,

68
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,399
I can’t take the risk.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,559
What if he recovers?

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,359
If he does, all my effort will be in vain.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,759
Cheng Ling,

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,359
you wouldn’t like that I die

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,919
with such a regret, right?

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,359
Cheng Ling.

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,279
The master-disciple relationship
between us lasts too short.

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,199
I didn’t get too much time to teach you.

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,679
However, if you remember one sentence,

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,199
you’ll be my good disciple.

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,279
It’s told by your grand master to me that

80
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,439
a great chevalier will be the one

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,199
contributing to the country and the people.

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,959
If a useless body could achieve useful things,

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,839
it’s great fortune.

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,839
It’s great fortune.

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,079
No need to be sad.

please take good care of them.

Zi Shu, I know.

90
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,279
What the Prince wants is not the Yin Yang Book.

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,679
Tracing back,

92
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,079
he and I are both descendants of Shatuo.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,319
Our ancestors succeeded in putting down a riot,

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,999
so they were granted with the national surname

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,279
and appointed as Jiedushi*.
(*Governor in charge of civil/military affairs)

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,599
That’s how we’ve got what we have today.

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,639
Zi Shu, you know this too.

98
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,159
If we go further back,

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,799
this branch of our clan
was a subordinate of Toujie imperial kinsmen.

100
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,439
There is an immemorial saying in the clan that

101
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,239
our ancestor had established a treasure vault

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,279
before he made achievements
in the wars of the Central Plain.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,319
Once found the secret
for a long-lasting country.

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,999
As long as we find the secret,

105
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,599
the people of our clan
could enjoy a rich and peaceful life,

106
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,319
not roaming about.

107
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,439
There are six keys in the treasure vault

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,759
in the hands of the leaders of six clans
of different surnames.

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,130
Kept by six clans leaders of different surnames...

110
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,039
Yes.

111
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,279
Does it sound like the Glazed Armor

112
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,759
and the key alot?

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,919
In fact, my ancestors

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,199
have alot of stories similar to this.

115
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,679
Actually, they’re just enchanting fantasies.

116
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,959
You won’t take them seriously
for hearing them too often.

117
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,639
But I remember you once said

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,759
the former prince had your father killed in secrecy.

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,799
I can’t help thinking of one thing.
When I was quite young,

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,759
The former prince told us that

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,399
he was going to find

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,839
the secret to the long-lasting country soon.

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,319
However, nothing happened after that.

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,919
In that period,

125
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,879
The former prince was so distressed.

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,279
He always sighed after getting drunk and said

127
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,359
years of pursuing had again been in vain.

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,439
The turncoats had interrupted my plan.
Things like that.

129
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,359
It’s in that same period

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,399
that I heard your father was dead.

131
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,959
Master collected the Glazed Armor and the key

132
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,919
on his journey of roaming about nationwide
in his earlier years.

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,279
Is the friend of Master

134
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,359
my father?

135
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,439
<i>The Glazed Armor and the key</i>

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,999
<i>were collected by your master
when he was roaming about in the earlier years.</i>

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,639
<i>Both are made with ingenuity.</i>

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,359
<i>It’s said to be critical for opening</i>

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,879
<i>the treasure vault of
Songmo or Toujie imperial kinsmen.</i>

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,759
<i>The five pieces of Glazed Armor</i>

141
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,559
<i>differ in forms and shapes.</i>

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,199
<i>Back then, your father, Master Zhou,
passed away suddenly.</i>

143
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,399
<i>Your father was killed secretly for</i>

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,239
<i>the charge of treason by the former Prince Jin.</i>

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,159
Turns out

146
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,319
fate has arranged all.

147
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,079
A sending-off of thousands of li

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,999
ends with departure eventually.

149
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,639
Let’s stop here.

150
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,639
Zi Shu,

151
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,319
you and I both know clearly

152
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,239
that the secret for the long-lasting country is

153
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,439
just a groundless rumor.

154
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,119
Nothing like that exists in this world.

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,119
Why do you insist...

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,599
Bei Yuan, don’t try to persuade me.

157
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,759
If this legend is true,

158
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,919
I definitely have to go there.

159
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,679
Even if it’s nothing,

160
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,799
I still have to go.

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,090
Think about it.

162
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,479
One one side are the people around the world,

163
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,640
on the other,

164
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,239
it’s my life with only a few days left.

165
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,359
If I succeed, I will have no regret.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,879
If not, I will have sacrificed for justice.

167
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,679
Anyway, it’s worth it.

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,050
What should I be afraid of?

169
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,839
Great!

170
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,919
You will travel day and night on the way.

171
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,719
In case that you need anything,

172
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,839
just contact the Ping An shops.

173
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,639
Zi Shu, don’t worry about the things here.

174
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,919
With you being here,

175
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,519
I can rest assured.

176
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,910
Cheng Ling,

177
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,639
do you know what worries me the most?

178
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,159
Repeat

179
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,679
what I have told you.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,919
You have been seriously wounded.

181
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,679
Prince Qi and Grand Wu

182
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,679
have taken you to
the overseas fairy mountains for treatment.

183
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,719
You asked my martial uncle and me to come back
to rebuild Four Seasons Manor

184
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,430
and wait for your returning.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,999
You brat!

186
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,890
Why do you look so distressed?

187
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,279
How could your martial uncle believe you with that look?

188
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,279
You know what?

189
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,639
If you look like that,

190
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,079
with your martial uncle’s character,

191
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,519
he would go insane.

192
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,039
If you’re not afraid that

193
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,759
I will be so painful and tortured
in the netherworld...

194
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,759
I could do nothing about it.

195
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,919
I... I will practice.

196
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,870

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,750

<i>The green mountains

202
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,319
<i>while the gurgling water won’t dry up.</i>

203
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,599
<i>The long way will eventually</i>

204
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,959
<i>bring us together.</i>

205
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,759
The secret for the long-lasting country,

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,879
the legend,

207
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,879
turns out to be true.

208
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,319
Such a privilege of opening the Armory

209
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,159
shall always be yours.

210
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,559
Officer Duan.

211
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,999
Please.

212
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,679
I really appreciate it, Scorpion King.

213
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,119
Someone.

214
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,119
Yes, sir!

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,759
Break the ice!

216
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,679
Foster-Father.

217
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,439
Revisiting the old place,

218
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,839
are you happy?

219
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,570
It can’t open the door.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,839
Fake?!

221
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,799
Weird, it’s not the right key.

222
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,439
Impossible!

223
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,039
This...

224
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,479
Fake?!

225
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,879
Zhou Zi Shu!

226
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,679
Who else?

227
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,839
I spared you as promised,

228
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,759
but why did the Chief of the Ghost Valley fail me?

229
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,879
This key is fake!

230
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,079
Why so surprised?

231
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,159
There are fake Glazed Armors,

232
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,439
so are fake keys, right?

233
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,439
Where is the Chief of the Ghost Valley?

234
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,399
Prince Jin is not here?

235
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,519
Zhou Zi Shu.

236
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,079
Even though you have the supreme skills,

237
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,119
today,

238
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,639
don’t even think to...

239
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,959
It seems that he didn’t come.

240
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,279
Alright, then.

241
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,359
Hurry up, retreat!

242
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,759
Retreat! Quickly!

243
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,159
Retreat! Go!

244
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,039
Retreat!

245
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,439
Go!

246
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,999
Go, go, go!

247
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,399
Why are you here?

248
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,679
How’s your injury?

249
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,239
Bastard!

250
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,479
Do you really care about me?!

251
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,639
What about the promise of
living and dying together?

252
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,239
How did you come here?

253
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,999
Crap.

254
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,479
I would’ve never find you
if I didn’t follow them.

255
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,519
I didn’t know the location of the Armory.

256
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,559
The hairpin...

257
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,119
Are you a fool?

258
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,759
I knew I was going to fake my death,

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,079
how could I take the hairpin with me?

260
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,519
You’re the only one who can hold it.

261
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,559
It turns out that the key to the Armory

262
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,199
has been on my head.

263
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,959
Yes.

264
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,639
My parents knew how important this is

265
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,119
so they disguised it.

266
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,439
So ridiculous.

267
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,439
those from the Ghost Valley
searched every corner of my home

268
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,710
but failed in finding any trace of it.

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,999
They don’t know it was on my head.

270
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,519
If I didn’t bring the hairpin,

271
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,319
you and I could only
stand in front of the door but do nothing.

272
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,599
If you’re here to die,

273
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,679
you definitely will take it with you.

274
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,679
Zhou Zi Shu, you evil brat.

275
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,639
If it weren’t for the righteousness sense
of Old Monster...

276
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,319
A bunch of idiots.

277
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,039
What have you done?

278
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,119
Hopelessly stupid!

279
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,399
Master Ye, please don’t...

280
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,159
Zi Shu, he said...

281
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,959
Quite your nonsense.

282
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,679
You’re hurting him.

283
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,199
They swear to live and die together.

284
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,479
As soon as Master Wen
knows Leader Zhou won’t live long,

285
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,200
he will...

286
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,119
Shut up!

287
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,519
No one dies.

288
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,239
I’m still alive.

289
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,119
No one could die before me.

290
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,079
Have you ever thought about

291
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,039
how I would be like
after I know the truth?

292
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,679
What, you’re not afraid of death, am I?

293
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,399
Don’t light it.

294
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,279
The oxygen is limited here.

295
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,199
Why not?

296
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,359
Since Rong Xuan and the others
practiced martial arts here,

297
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,799
there would be a specific air passage
in the underground palace.

298
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,079
Saint Zhou,

299
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,239
I thought you face death unflinchingly.

300
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,079
Why don’t you want to die now?

301
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,599
If a man can live,

302
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,399
he won’t desire death.

303
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,519
What’s more,

304
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,439
that’s the thought before I met you.

305
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,919
The Combined Six Cultivation Power is

306
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,479
more mysterious than the Yin Yang Book.

307
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,679
It does help to be disillusioned.

308
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,799
As long as people live, there is hope.

309
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,999
If you die, nothing will matter either.

310
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,159
It’s a perfect place for the floppy.

311
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,999
I don’t know how my mother
and my master’s sister

312
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,279
managed to bear it.

313
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,399
Here should be the place
for swordsmanship combat.

314
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,519
The library should be inside.

315
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,950
[Yin Yang Book]

316
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
[Yin Yang Book]

317
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,199
Yin Yang Book.

318
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,079
Look, I found a piece of treasure.

319
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,319
Ah Xu.

320
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,239
This is the unique book
of the Healer Valley.

321
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,479
Come on, keep it for me.

322
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,799
Maybe it’s useful after we get out.

323
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,359
Let alone the question of whether
this Combined Six Cultivation Power

324
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,879
could cure me.

325
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,799
The snow has blocked the entrances and exits.

326
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,879
We can’t get outside until
the snow melts in the summer.

327
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,599
We have no water and no food...

328
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,319
When I knew you asked
the Bank of Ping An

329
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,119
to purchase a big volume of gunpowder,

330
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,759
I’ve realized your intention.

331
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,799
Stop looking at it.

332
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,719
Go, go, go.

333
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,159
I just want to know

334
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,159
the secret for a long-lasting country.

335
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,439
Maybe there is an artifact to

336
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,399
summon an ancient demon god.

337
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,159
Then we’ll be saved.

338
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,399
Let’s go.

339
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,919
Thirteen Changeable Moves of Cloud and Fog.

340
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,199
The stunt of Mount Heng Sect.

341
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,359
Arts for the People.

342
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,199
What?

343
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,159
This is a book about
farming and planting.

344
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,239
Is it possible that Senior Rong

345
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,319
made a mistake while
stealing the martial art books?

346
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,199
It’s just a pick-up book, maybe?

347
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,079
It’s so weird.

348
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,279
Why in this stone chamber

349
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,919
full of books about farming and planting?

350
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,279
I found it.

351
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,679
Combined Six Cultivation Method.

352
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,559
That’s it!

353
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,599
All are grains.

354
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,319
Lao Wen,

355
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,119
are you sure

356
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,719
we’ve checked every secret chamber?

357
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,599
Why are they

358
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,199
all full with farming and utensils and books?

359
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,119
There’s not even a copper coin at all.

360
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,719
All are grains?

361
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,079
These were prepared by Rong Xuan?

362
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,399
Check the seals.

363
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,319
Are all written with Tuojie characters.

364
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,119
I thought we could live on these grains.

365
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,479
I was wrong about it.

366
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,879
How long have these grains
been stored here?

367
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,199
Twenty years of storage
wouldn’t result in such a status.

368
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,679
I understand now.

369
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,919
I understand it all.

370
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,959
These are the secrets to ensure
a long-lasting country.

371
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,079
It’s said that this secret

372
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,639
could help the people of Shatuo

373
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,319
enjoy a rich and peaceful life.

374
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,439
Look at these secret chambers!

375
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,599
There are so many farming tools and grain.

376
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,599
There are also farming books
translated into Tuojie language.

377
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,159
This is the secret that
the Tuojie ancestors

378
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
left to their descendants.

379
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,159
That accounts for it.

380
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,359
As long as the nomadic people learn
how to reclaim wasteland and plant,

381
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,439
they could be self-sufficient
by using farming tools.

382
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,719
Then the country could last longer.

383
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,479
Prince Jin has spent so many years of effort

384
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,999
only to get such a house of
food and farm tools.

385
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,159
The secret to achieving a long-last country

386
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,959
is to farm well!

387
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,759
It’s so ridiculous.

388
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,639
That’s why Uncle Long said

389
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,999
my master tried all means
to collect the Glazed Armor

390
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,759
but gained nothing

391
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,319
after opening the Armory.

392
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,079
He must be searching it for my father

393
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,879
and my father tried to reveal the secret

394
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,159
because he was entrusted by
the former Prince Jin with the task.

395
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,799
When my father found nothing
but a place of grain,

396
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,959
the former Prince Jin was furious

397
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,639
that he just killed my father.

398
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,959
No, no way.

399
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,239
My father understood the personality
of the former Prince Jin,

400
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,479
he knew that even if he confessed,

401
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,519
the former Prince Jin wouldn’t believe it.

402
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,439
He knew he wouldn’t be spared

403
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,559
and also drag my master into trouble.

404
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,719
Maybe your father didn’t tell Master at all

405
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,519
about what this treasure vault meant.

406
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,559
So later,

407
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,879
Master gave this place to Rong Xuan
and transformed it into an armory

408
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,119
because it was indeed nothing
but an empty warehouse.

409
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,039
Now what I desire the most
is to watch the expression of Prince Jin

410
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,559
when he knows the truth.

411
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,159
That’s be perfectly awesome.

412
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,519
Stop laughing.

413
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,279
Now the snow has sealed off the mountain,

414
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,439
even if we indeed find an exit,

415
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,399
even if we indeed get out...

416
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,719
Tell me,

417
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,399
how long a man could survive
with having ice and snow only?

418
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,119
Then guess how long Ye Bai Yi
have survived depending on having ice and snow.

419
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,719
Don’t you wonder

420
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,359
why that Old Monster acted like
a reincarnated ghost died from hunger

421
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,679
and ate things at full split?

422
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,719
That’s because

423
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,359
he hadn’t enjoyed normal food

424
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,039
for more than 100 years.

425
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,479
Changing the destiny costs a lot.

426
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,199
If you succeed,
you could transform your meridians,

427
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,399
never grow old

428
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,039
and live on like a god.

429
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,439
There are disadvantages, too.

430
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,199
Why did Ye Bai Yi
stayed on Mount Changming

431
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,919
for so long?

432
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,239
Because as soon as you step
into the world of gods,

433
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,559
you must live in the place
of extreme coldness,

434
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,079
braving the wind and dew,
and eating ice and snow.

435
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,319
If you eat the secular food,

436
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,759
you’ll start withering.

437
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,599
So,

438
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,639
ever since we knew Ye Bai Yi,

439
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,719
we witnessed his hair grow increasingly grey.

440
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,319
Old Monster is fed up
with being the living-dead

441
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,399
and enjoy the food as much as he can.

442
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,879
He’s rather give up immortality

443
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,679
than abandon the food enjoyment.

444
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,119
In other words,

445
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,079
even if you leave here alive,

446
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,879
you have to live in
an extremely cold place

447
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,079
and eat ice and snow.

448
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,079
That’s a hell of a way to live.

449
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,039
To live like that

450
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,079
or die like this,

451
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,679
I must think it thoroughly.

452
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,879
Combined Six Cultivation Power,

453
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,959
establish after the break.

454
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,999
only after a period of extremely painful torture

455
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,799
can you reshape your meridians

456
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,919
and achieve renascence.

457
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,919
However, different people
will go through various sufferings

458
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,119
because physique differs.

459
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,919
That’s why it takes
two people to practice it at the same time.

460
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,599
They could help each other.

461
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,799
When one is close to a breakdown,

462
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,119
the other could use genuine Qi to help.

463
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,359
I’m taking you advantage here.

464
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,959
To be honest,

465
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,039
I’m losing my gustation,
smell and tactile sense gradually.

466
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,959
I can’t feel pain.

467
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,079
I knew.

468
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,639
That’s why Senior Ye
and Grand Wizard had warned me.

469
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,559
In the meditation,

470
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,079
your vision or hearing

471
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,119
might both be gone.

472
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,279
If so,

473
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,559
don’t panic.

474
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,839
Focus on your internal operation.

475
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,759
As long as you make it through
all the levels,

476
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,359
your five senses will recover

477
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,359
However, for each level,

478
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,679
you have to repeat such a routine.

479
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,759
Okay.

480
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,919

He is dying.

508
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,199
What happened to him?

509
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,799
I have a method that you can save him.

510
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,119
However...

511
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,839
It’s at the cost of your life.

512
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,079
Are you willing?

513
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,679
More than one could wish for.

514
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,519
Good answer.

515
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,839
Wen Ke Xing, I’ve promised you

516
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,439
to bring back Zhou Zi Shu.

517
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,519
I haven’t failed anyone in my life.

518
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,279
I will transfer my
Cultivation Six Cultivation Power to you.

519
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,799
I’m sorry.

520
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,479
You intended to lie to me as well.

521
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,639
I’ve just lied to you this once.

522
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,919
It can’t be counted as a major demerit.

523
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,319
The one surviving

524
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,839
will be the most painful.

525
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,679
You’re my senior brother,

526
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,559
please allow me.

527
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,439
<i>Wait for me.</i>

528
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,359
<i>What’s wrong with you?</i>

529
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,079
<i>I thought you were acting crazy and dumb,</i>

530
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,959
<i>I didn’t realize that you’re actually crazy.</i>

531
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,679
<i>Wen Ke Xing, are you happy?</i>

532
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,639
<i>Do you feel comfortable inside your heart?</i>

533
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,559
<i>Is this what you ask for?</i>

534
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,199
<i>You’re not qualified.</i>

535
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,239
<i>If a villain can become a Buddha
after he puts down his broadsword,</i>

536
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,479
<i>why can’t a kind man get a start-over</i>

537
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,999
<i>after he does something wrong?</i>

538
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,479
<i>It doesn’t make sense.</i>

539
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,799
<i>I want to make a bet.</i>

540
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,919
<i>You are the one that I know.</i>

541
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,039
<i>Lao Wen.</i>

542
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,599
<i>Ah Xu.</i>

543
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,239
<i>Let’s drink!</i>

544
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,879
<i>You can’t have any if you don’t wash it.</i>

545
