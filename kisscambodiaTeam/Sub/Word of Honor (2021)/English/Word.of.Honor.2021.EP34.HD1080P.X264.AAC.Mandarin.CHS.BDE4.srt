[Episode 34]

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,079
- Senior Ye.
- Immortal Ye.

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,479
Senior Ye, you come at the right moment.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,399
Please lead all heroes
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,239
That’s right.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,839
I will definitely destroy Ghost Valley.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,799
Everyone in the Ghost Valley is doomed to die.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,359
Immortal Ye,

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,839
though those evil ghosts
do endanger the martial arts world,

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,239
as for Master Wen,
his doing is understandable.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,559
Understandable?

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,599
It should be unforgivable!

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,639
Wen Ke Xing.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,279
When you took charge of the Ghost King,

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,919
why did you break the rule of

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,079
“Once join the Ghost Valley, forever in hell,”

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,279
unleashing ghosts
to put the martial arts world in peril?

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,199
My humble apology.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,519
Great!

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
No guilt is tolerable.

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,400
You must shut down the Ghost Valley forever,

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
restraining all ghosts
from coming to the immortal world.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,990
Will you do that?

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,119
Yes, Immortal.

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,799
Great!

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,159
Then, leave here.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,719
Senior Ye.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,519
What does that mean?

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,079
What do you mean by “that”?

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,439
I’ve ordered Wen Ke Xing
to close Mount Qingya forever from now on,

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,719
allowing no entry or exit,

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,879
in the hope that in a century,
everything is changed

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,879
and all evil ghosts will have already started
their new immortal lives.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,839
By then, the Ghost Valley will no longer exist.

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,759
Terrific, terrific!

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,919
If the feud could be ended

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,759
in peace with no more bloody wars,

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,399
it is a great merit indeed.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,959
Great!

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,679
Abbot of Shaolin seems to take my side,

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,999
Then Nun, what’s your opinion?

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,399
If Chief Wen

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,799
can really restrain your ghosts
from committing more crimes,

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,199
make sure they spend
the rest of the says in Mount Qingya,

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,639
it’s surely better than endless acts of revenge

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,439
at the price if countless lives.

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,879
Is that all clear, Wen Ke Xing?

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,839
Why are you still here? Go.

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,879
Got it.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,679
Enough.

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,239
That’s it.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,279
This is the end of this Heroes Conference.

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,399
Dismiss.

75
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,039
Amitabha, Immortal Ye.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,679
Let’s go.

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,719
Let’s go.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,759
Master!

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,079
You are so cruel.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,879
Do you know I almost ran out of tears these days?

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,559
Are you guilty or not?

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,959
Guilty.

83
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,119
Bottoms up!

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,879
Master, I am still not quite clear of one thing.

85
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,519
That Sick Dude, he said you...

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,119
I mean Zhou Xu,

87
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,079
he claimed to have seen your body
in the Five Lakes Alliance.

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,599
That was someone else’s body
I prepared in advance.

89
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,239
I changed his face so it resembled mine,

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,359
and leaving it in the deep pool under the waterfall.

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,599
If I didn’t do it that way,

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,439
how can I win the trust of the old fox, Zhao Jing?

93
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,799
How crafty you are!

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,199
One more!

95
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,599
N problem.

96
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,879
Gu Xiang,

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,239
taking care of the evil with wits,

98
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,239
what’s wrong with that?

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,879
Leader Shen,

100
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,959
wasn’t it you who wanted
to wipe out the Ghost Valley?

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,359
When did you two get in touch?

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,919
Wen Ke Xing.

103
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,959
How dare you come here for Cheng Ling?

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,759
Your real identity has been widely known now.

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,879
You are the Chief of the Ghost Valley?!

106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,359
Yes, I am.

107
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,439
I came here today

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,639
to tell you everything.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,679
You may judge whether it’s true by yourself.

110
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,359
So you two have conspired to do this together
a long time ago!

111
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,559
Master, you only hid it from us.

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,439
One more!

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,559
Silly girl.

114
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,159
The fake body
is a necessary risk we should take in war.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,359
Without the help of Cheng Ling and Leader Shen,

116
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,359
how did I dare to take this step?

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,719
Leader Shen’s assistance from the inside

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,039
kept Zhao Jing and his gang from approaching

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,519
and found out anything suspicious...

120
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,399
So that Sword Immortal was also covering for you?

121
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,559
He...

122
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,519
he helped me a lot.

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,279
If not for Senior Ye’s generous help,

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,119
even if I managed
to expose Zhao Jing’s conspiracy,

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,319
with my identity,

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,119
how would I leave these safe and sound?

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,279
I once said

128
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,759
if you encounter me out there again,
I would...

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,519
I know.

130
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,039
Senior Ye.

131
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,919
I was born stubborn.
I misled myself halfway,

132
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,959
and was obsessed with hatred for half of my life.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,119
All I cared about were conspiracies
and destroying the world.

134
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,359
I almost betrayed my parents’ teachings.

135
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,199
But today,

136
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,759
I finally came to know who my real enemy is.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,399
All I want now is to charge him in a fair fight,

138
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,639
holding justice in the world.

139
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,879
I beg for your permission, Senior.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,119
You are right indeed.

141
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,839
Previously, I worried most about

142
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,839
how Ke Xing will end the chapter.

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,919
Later on, I gave it a thought

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,199
and found that I could hesitate no more.

145
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,199
As long as my Big Brother
could be proved innocent,

146
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,039
the biggest price will merely be
a life-and-death fight between Ke Xing and me.

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,199
If so, my obligation of brotherhood
can be solemnly fulfilled.

148
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,079
Uncle.

149
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,999
In one word,

150
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,879
thanks to Senior Ye, a true master,

151
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,679
this feud can be ended in peace

152
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,759
to the satisfaction of all.

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,199
Let’s toast to Senior Ye together.

154
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,279
- To Senior Ye!
- To Senior Ye!

155
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,959
Master.

156
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,679
Master Wen,

157
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,119
I always consider myself
resourceful and decisive,

158
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,319
but today I candidly admit defeat
to your strategy.

159
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,679
Zi Shu,

160
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,839
this junior brother of yours,

161
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,559
is really a capable disciple that excels his masters.

162
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,799
Master Wen, my toast to you!

163
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,799
Master Wen,

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,719
I still have one questions.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,559
Now that Zhao Jing is so evil,

166
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,919
why not take his life?

167
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,359
This is a deal between Scorpion King and me.

168
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,599
Miss Gao’s Senior Brother Deng Kuan
was still being kept by Zhao Jing

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,199
as an insensible Drug Man.

170
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,679
During the first Heroes Conference,

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,439
it was Deng Kuan’s frame-up that set the tone

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,079
and left Chief Gao being wronged.

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,199
In this case,

174
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,599
To reveal Zhao Jing’s conspiracy,

175
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,439
Deng Kuan’s testimony
was of great importance.

176
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,159
Scorpion King promised me
to bring Deng Kuan back to his consciousness

177
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,639
at the price of saving Zhao Jing’s life.

178
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,919
What is the relationship

179
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,399
between Scorpion King and Zhao Jing?

180
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,919
Was it not because
Scorpion King hated Zhao Jing

181
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,159
that he accepted the deal with you, Master?

182
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,599
Sick Dude, do you know that

183
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,479
the Ten Devils by then

184
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,559
were all under the control of the Scorpion King
with his overpowering drug?

185
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,479
Our Master agreed to deal with Scorpion King

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,039
for the purpose of burrowing his army to the Window of Heaven in time.

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,839
Ah Xiang.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,399
Scorpion King helped you like this

189
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,559
only to take Zhao Jing’s life?

190
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,759
Master Wen, what else did you promise him?

191
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,959
Nothing else.

192
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,839
To put it simply,

193
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,839
only mankind’s wit

194
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,359
can destroy evil deeds.

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,159
<i>Fate does like fooling people around.</i>

196
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,319
<i>My junior brother has finally been avenged.</i>

197
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,439
<i>I can enjoy an easy life now.</i>

198
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,719
<i>However, the end of my life is approaching...</i>

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,919
You may all leave.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,919
Foster-Father.

201
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,839
I told you

202
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,559
you can’t cheat me.

203
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,119
As long as you name it,

204
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
I will do everything for you.

205
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,119
You don’t need to cheat me.

206
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,599
For so many years,

207
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,639
countless lives have gone
because of your conspiracy,

208
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,239
including those who loved you whole-heartedly.

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,039
I once hoped every day that

210
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,839
I would also die like him one day?

211
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,399
But I just can’t wake a person
who pretends to be asleep.

212
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,879
It was just that I refused to think
and willingly fell for those lies,

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,559
which made us look like
father and son living in harmony.

214
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,479
I have been hiding from you that

215
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,959
I think your goal of life is ridiculous.

216
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,079
Supreme leader of the martial arts world?

217
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,919
What’s the big deal?

218
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,919
You’ve been saying

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,959
it’s an evil skill to study Drug Men

220
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,399
and will not be accepted by others.

221
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,359
I respected you as much as I could as a son, Foster-Father.

222
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,439
I am telling you today

223
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,359
what the real skill of Ten-Thousand-Kill is.

224
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,519
The Window of Heaven which is adored by you

225
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,599
has now become my ally.

226
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,079
Even Prince Jin has to show his courtesy to me.

227
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,079
And you

228
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,999
looked down on me, contempt me,

229
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,279
intending to kill me

230
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,559
just for several bandits
not qualified to serve me.

231
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,839
For what?

232
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,919
Just because I honored and loved you?

233
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,479
Just because I could be taken for granted?

234
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,639
Just because I was worthless?

235
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,599
Do you really think
the supreme leader of the martial arts world

236
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,679
can take charge of the whole world?

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,479
I agreed to make a deal with Wen Ke Xing

238
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,519
only for the purpose of stabbing in your back

239
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,839
at your proudest moment.

240
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,279
I’d like to prove to you

241
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,479
that I get to decide

242
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,119
whether to overthrow you or not,

243
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,599
and how!

244
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,439
Forget it.

245
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,039
You are still my foster-father.

246
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,439
Though you are so disreputable,

247
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,239
in the end,

248
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,679
you are my only loved one in this world.

249
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,079
I just feel so unsatisfied.

250
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,959
I could have established an empire

251
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,879
for your great joy as the Majesty.

252
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,119
But you

253
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,759
had to make the wrong choice.

254
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,239
I did give you chances

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,479
a lot of times.

256
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,479
But you

257
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,519
failed me.

258
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,519
Foster-Father.

259
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,479
You’ve conspired for half of your life.

260
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,679
How dreary it is!

261
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,639
From now on,

262
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,359
please enjoy a life of happiness.

263
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,519
And allow me, your son,

264
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,359
to take good care of you.

265
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,199
Foster-Father.

266
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,839
I’ll let you see

267
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,039
how I occupy a land and take the throne.

268
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,519
By then, if I’m in a good mood,

269
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,919
I will kill that Prince Jin,

270
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,639
and announce myself the new emperor.

271
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,559
And you, the retired emperor.

272
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,719
This is the real cause.

273
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,119
Master, I would humbly request

274
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,039
to toast to you in the name of punishment.

275
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,559
you knew Martial Uncle’s life
and hardship long ago,

276
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,799
but why didn’t you tell me directly?

277
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,399
Was it because you didn’t count on me

278
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,039
or the tie between Martial Uncle and me?

279
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,519
Same here,

280
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,759
I’ll drink with you.

281
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,719
Come on.

282
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,999
Ah Xu, Cheng Ling is so promising

283
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,519
that in such a short time,

284
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,559
he has roughly grasped the secret
of the mechanics of the Longyuan Cabinet!

285
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,799
Fortunately, he restructured the

286
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,199
piercing rain needles with the knowledge

287
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,199
which greatly weakened the power of the needles.

288
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,639
That’s how the fake death happened.

289
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,919
So this stratagem of yours

290
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,199
is to ask my disciple to “kill” you in my presence

291
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,759
with the self-defense weapon I gave him?

292
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,879
Why didn’t you tell me in advance?

293
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,719
You don’t trust me or...

294
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,919
Brother Zhou,

295
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,079
allow me to explain for him, please.

296
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,759
He set up this fake-death trap

297
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,959
to let Zhao Jing’s guard down.

298
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,199
Only in this way,

299
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,719
can he release his power
on the Heroes Conference

300
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,199
with all the witnesses and evidence together.

301
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,719
That’s how we revealed Zhao Jing’s conspiracy

302
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,159
in front of everyone

303
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,479
and proved the innocence of all those he killed.

304
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,279
I am also to blame.

305
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,879
I warned Master Wen

306
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,879
your wound is so tricky
that good rest is a must.

307
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,079
You can’t get involved in another fight.

308
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,439
Did I ask you?

309
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,119
Take a seat first, please.

310
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,639
I ask you only,

311
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,239
should you be punished?

312
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,319
Yes.

313
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,839
Ah Xu, how would you punish me?

314
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,639
Drink three pots of liquor in a row!

315
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,919
Ah Xu, Ah Xu.

316
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,119
Ah Xu, where are you?

317
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,159
Why is it this dark? Ah Xu.

318
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,639
Ah Xu.

319
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,199
Where are you?

320
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,159
Listen,

321
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,319
I got all of them drunk tonight.

322
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,199
How happy I am!

323
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,719
Why are you scratching for nothing?

324
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,839
Ah Xu.

325
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,719
I’m so happy tonight!

326
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,679
Let me tell you.

327
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,919
Last time when we had dinner with the Old Monster,

328
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,239
I was quite sad.

329
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,239
I was worried that you...

330
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,119
I was worried that you might die soon.

331
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,079
I was worried that you might not accept me.

332
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,599
I was worried
that I wasn’t for your brotherhood.

333
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,839
But now all my worries have gone.

334
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,039
Come here, have a toast with me, cheers!

335
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,119
Come on.

336
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,759
Drink it, Ah Xu.

337
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,159
I am so happy now.

338
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,679

342
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,079
How fortunately I met you,

343
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,079
and found that
to behave like a dignified and imposing man

344
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,039
can be so much ease and joy.

345
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,999
I have lived for so many years,

all wanted me to do this.

Now, once I close my eyes,

Greetings, Chief. Greetings, Uncle Zhou.

391
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,839
Back to your work, everyone.

392
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,119
Don’t miss the wedding schedule of Miss Xiang.

393
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,879
Yes.

394
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,319
Uncle Zhou,

395
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,639
are they calling me?

396
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,279
Master!

397
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,479
Uncle Zhou.

398
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,439
I was thinking the nickname of Uncle Zhou

399
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,119
must be given

400
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,319
by a quick-witted little girl.

401
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,999
It wasn’t me,

402
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,239
but Brother Cao.

403
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,479
Master ordered me
not to call you neither Sick Dude

404
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,039
nor Ah Xu.

405
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,479
What else can I do?

406
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,159
You are Chief’s senior brother.

407
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,639
So calling you Uncle is fine.

408
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,799
Why not “brother”?

409
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,719
Uncle Zhou, the addressing sounds like

410
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,079
I am fully whiskered.

411
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,079
I asked him for permission,
but he didn’t allow me.

412
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,759
When did I do that?

413
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,039
Well,

414
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,479
I will call you this way,

415
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,919
Brother Zi Shu.

416
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,079
You little stinky girl.

417
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,119
Still so naughty even on your wedding day.

418
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,039
Aunt Luo has been so busy with your dowry.

419
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,239
Why don’t you giver her a hand?

420
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,159
No bride is supposed to

421
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,559
prepare her own dowry!

422
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,399
What a shame!

423
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,919
What a surprise! I have not imagined

424
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,999
one day you would feel ashamed.

425
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,079
What a coincidence, same here.

426
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,679
I have never seen someone

427
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,879
both obedient and timid as he is now.

428
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,839
Master and Martial Uncle.

429
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,399
Would-be bride,

430
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,639
why are you still wandering around?

431
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,399
It’s not allowed for the couple to meet
before the end of the wedding ceremony?

432
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,879
None of your business.

433
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,319
How mad!

434
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,639
Brother Cao, you don’t disciple your wife?

435
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,239
I won’t.

436
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,399
She is beyond my discipline.

437
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,630
I understand.

438
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,639
Living under the same roof,
you have to take a step back.

439
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,359
Don’t panic. After the wedding,

440
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,439
Please come to the Four Seasons Manor.

441
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,439
I will back you up.

442
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,199
I...

443
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,959
You brat!

444
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,719
You’re getting bold recently, huh?

445
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,479
Well, excuse me,

446
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,959
it’s my first time being in the Ghost Valley.

447
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,879
I’d like to walk around here.

448
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,559
I’ll go with you.

449
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,319
See you later, Brother Zi Shu.

450
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,439
Master.

451
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,999
Do I really have to go to the Four Seasons Manor?

452
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,039
I want to accompany you.

453
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,919
No married girl is supposed
to stay with her parents.

454
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,439
Then, I won’t get married.

455
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,519
Go back to Kun yourself.

456
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,799
I’ll stay with my master.

457
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,719
Ah Xiang.

458
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,399
Nonsense!

459
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,079
Little Cao sacrificed all he had for you,

460
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,839
don’t be spoiled, will you?

461
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,559
After your wedding ceremony,

462
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,999
I will shut down the valley.

463
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,719
Did you spoil me? Am I spoiled?

464
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,039
Are you really going to shut down the valley?

465
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,639
I promised Senior Ye myself,

466
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,279
that I would do it on my own,

467
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,999
to suppress all those ghosts
until they vanish on Mount Qingya.

468
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,599
I can’t break my promise,

469
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,039
nor do I want to.

470
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,119
I was once ill-treated by God,

471
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,919
However, I’ve also been given priceless gifts.

472
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,519
I would reach a settlement with God

473
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,999
by bilateral compromise.

474
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,439
Ah Xiang.

475
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,160
Master.

476
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,039
Ah Xiang, what’s wrong?

477
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,159
If you are not feeling well,

478
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,599
how about I...

479
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,439
I...

480
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,359
Idiot.

481
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,679
I won’t let you do anything against your will.

482
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,679
I’m just...

483
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,319
I feel happy for my master.

484
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,519
Master, I’m really happy for you.

485
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,919
Silly girl.

486
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,519
I am supposed to stay here
and suppress those ghosts.

487
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,999
But the order didn’t require me
to stay here everyday.

488
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,799
I could sneak out to visit you.

489
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,919
Let’s wait until years later,

490
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,119
when the Ghost Valley is in real peace,

491
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,679
then everything will be good.

492
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,090
Cheng Ling,

493
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,399
Changing Ghost and his henchmen

494
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,119
have been locked in the jail
deep inside the Chill Lake.

495
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,919
These are your last enemies.

496
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,919
How would you treat them?

497
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,279
Martial Uncle, how did you plan to treat them?

498
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,839
I...

499
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,359
I don’t want to get my hands wet with blood.

500
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,999
So I chose to imprisoned them.

501
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,519
The Chill Lake Jail?

502
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,519
Sounds very afflictive, right?

503
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,999
Then lock them there,

504
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,999
and let them confess their sins.

505
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,799
Is that all?

506
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,999
Killing them

507
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,679
won’t change what has happened.

508
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,799
Master said,

509
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,639
eyes are at the front of our head,

510
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,759
so we are supposed to look ahead.

511
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,959
In addition, on Sister Xiang’s wedding day,

512
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,999
how could we allow killings to happen?

513
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,319
No wonder

514
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,199
previously Master
called Brother Zi Shu Saint Zhou,

515
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,199
look at him,

516
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,839
he’s totally a little Saint,

517
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,959
talking all about those theories.

518
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,039
Senior Ye once said,

519
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,159
the original intention
of the creation of the Ghost Valley

520
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,679
was to erect a bridge to salvation

521
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,839
over the river of endless miseries.

522
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,799
For that those fallen and lost spirits

523
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,599
could find a chance to amend their wrongdoings.

524
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,759
By the way,

525
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,999
where is Old Monster...

526
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,679
Where is Senior Ye?

527
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,839
Senior Ye once said,

528
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,559
he will bring the remains of Senior Rong Xuan

529
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,759
back to Mount Changming,

530
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,239
and bury it together with his parents.

531
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,719
Good soup!

532
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,240
Waiter!

533
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,199
Sir, do you want to pay the bill

534
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,439
or do you want one more bowl of noodles?

535
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,439
Two more bowls.

536
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,279
Two bowls.

537
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,919
Aye, aye, in one minute.

538
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,799
The scents of death appear,

539
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,399
this day is finally comes.

540
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,359
What immortal?

541
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,319
Nothing but a living death.

542
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
I’ve lived for so long,

543
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,639
only in these days when I live freely
without the burden of decaying

544
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,799
do I feel joyful.

545
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,559
Here are your noodles.

546
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,919
Please enjoy.

547
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,639
These noodles are good.

548
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,439
Chang Qing, Xuan,

549
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,119
let me eat two more bowls for you.

550
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,519
Miss Xiang is so pretty,

551
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,279
the bridegroom is so fortunate.

552
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,999
Am I really pretty?

553
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,759
Yes, as pretty as a goddess.

554
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,439
I didn’t expect that there would be a wedding

555
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,319
someday in our valley!

556
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,319
Looking at Miss Xiang today,

557
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,639
I also want to get married.

558
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,079
- So do I!
- So do I!

559
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,039
Don’t make fun of me.

560
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,319
[Happiness]
Miss  Xiang, Miss Xiang.

561
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,159
What’s more delightful is still on the way.

562
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,999
Let’s go have a look at the dowry
we prepared for you.

563
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,239
Great!

564
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,639
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

565
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,439
What a great dowry.

566
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,519
Remember what I said?

567
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,559
Your dowry would be enough
to array along three streets.

568
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,919
This is still far from it.

569
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,639
I will make up for you later.

570
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,199
We did hurry to get your dowry ready,

571
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,199
and we made it at last.

572
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,879
I haven’t heard before

573
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,239
that there are so many etiquette for marriage.

574
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,399
Such as the buckets, bowls,
all in pairs for children,

575
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,959
as well as trousseau and home appliances.

576
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,919
Ah Xiang, thanks to you,

577
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,839
I have seen such a big event today.

578
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,279
That’s far from enough.

579
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,919
For real demanding girls,

580
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,879
her dowry

581
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,359
is supposed to include

582
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,999
everything usable from her birth to death.

583
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,959
For a real decent dowry,

584
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,399
even the shroud and coffin

585
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,479
should be ready.

586
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,759
However, Master Wen

587
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,479
I don’t know what’s happened to you.

588
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,759
Girls only get married once

589
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,319
in their lifetime.

590
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,559
I really can’t understand

591
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,279
why you prepared the dowry in such a rush.

592
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,399
Aunt Luo, Sister Qian Qiao,

593
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,519
I can;t be more happy

594
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,399
to have you there at my wedding.

595
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,919
What, you’re not happy when I’m present?

596
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,199
Happy.

597
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,839
Ungrateful.

598
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,959
Wait, I have one more gift for you.

599
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,839
Great!

600
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,999
Xiang’er,

601
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,879
after I got your dowry ready,

602
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,079
I’ll walk around to the back of the mountains.

603
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,519
I will not attend your wedding then.

604
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,799
Sister Qian Qiao will be in charge of everything.

605
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,959
I prepared a dowry gift for you.

606
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,239
This pair of hairpins

607
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,039
was given by my master when I got married.

608
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,199
Now I will transfer it to you,

609
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,799
but rest assured,

610
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,559
it won’t bring you any bad luck.

611
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,919
I have never worn this hairpin before.

612
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,359
It belonged to my master,

613
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,959
who had a harmonious marriage

614
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,759
and lived a happy life with his whole family.

615
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,679
I won’t take it.

616
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,919
I don’t care about it.

617
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,879
Aunt Luo,

618
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,679
I need your escort at my wedding.

619
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,559
It’s not allowed by the etiquette,

620
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,839
and it’s concerning your marital happiness.

621
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,319
and all your life.

622
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,519
The importance of prudence and taboo

623
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,719
cannot be more emphasized.

624
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,679
Xiang’er,

625
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,959
stay obedient.

626
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,639
After the valley is closed,

627
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,559
I really don’t know

628
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,839
when I could see you again.

629
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,279
I don’t care.

630
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,359
Aunt Luo.

631
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,119
Please clasp my hair with it for me.

632
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,719
I should be married under your witness.

633
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,999
It’s not allowed.

634
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,119
Will you do what I said?

635
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,719
Dear Ah Xiang, be obedient.

636
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,439
We did all this for your good.

637
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,639
You just need to get married with ease.

638
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,039
I will still be with your Aunt Luo.

639
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,639
I will stay with my master,

640
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,639
for my lifetime.

641
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,039
Stay obedient.

642
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,319
So beautiful.

643
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,039
Sister Qian Qiao,
are you staying in the valley as well?

644
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,559
Do you want to live alone
without Yu Qiu Feng?

645
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,879
Who is Yu Qiu Feng?

646
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,239
Ah Xiang.

647
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,799
Master.

648
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,639
This is a wedding gift from Da Wu.

649
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,999
There is only one pair of the red thread
in this world.

650
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,559
It’s a divine gift blessed by prayers.

651
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,679
It is said

652
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,639
if the lovers are tied with it,

653
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,759
they will always meet
in all their next lives.

654
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
Little Cao has worn the one for him.

655
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,879
There, let me help you wear this one.

656
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,839
We will always meet?

657
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,399
What is in this life of mine,

658
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,679
I broke up with Cao Wei Ning,

659
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,239
and wanted to marry a new guy?

660
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,879
Who knows?

661
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,959
If you’re not willing to wear it,

662
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,999
I will just return it to Da Wu.

663
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,719
No, I want it, I want it.

664
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,359
Tie it on my hand for me.

665
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,279
Is it good?

666
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,239
Looks good.

667
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,479
Look at Little Cao, he’s so nervous.

668
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,519
Cheng Ling,

669
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,039
don’t follow his step when you grow up.

670
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,199
When the late Chief Gao was alive,

671
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,679
didn’t he promise to marry Gao Xiao Lian to you?

672
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,839
Well, do you like her?

673
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,399
I will propose a marriage for you,
if you like her.

674
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,079
Master, what are you talking about?

675
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,079
I only take Xiao Lian as my elder sister.

676
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,439
Why are you trying so hard to

677
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,439
almost get everyone dismissed?

678
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,199
Brother Cao, how do you feel
to be a bridegroom?

679
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,159
Ner... nervous.

680
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,839
So what are you think about now?

681
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,079
I am thinking...

682
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,479
I’ve been thing that

683
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,359
on my wedding day,

684
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,799
Master Uncle and Master would be the hosts,

685
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,319
and my senior and junior brothers
would stand beside me,

686
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,620
I...

687
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,599
I never imagined, even in my dreams

688
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,319
that one day in Ghost Valley, I would marry

689
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,119
someone close to Chief of the Ghost Valley.

690
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,199
Brother Cao, I almost forgot that

691
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,639
Leader Shen met your martial uncle,

692
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,919
and told him you were going to get married.

693
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,240
He...

694
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,119
What did he say?

695
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,039
It’s all my fault, I was too busy

696
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,119
to transfer his words to you.

697
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,879
Your martial uncle said,

698
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,079
“You, the unfilial little brat,

699
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,799
do remember that before telling right and wrong,

700
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,879
you should tell good and evil.

701
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,719
Since it has ended like this,

702
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,559
I only hope you could do good things
with you wife.

703
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,959
If so, you are a worthy disciple of mine.

704
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,879
I will gradually persuade your master.

705
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,719
If you give birth to a robust boy someday,

706
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,399
do come back to meet me with my grand disciple.”

707
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,999
I won’t be able to return your generous kindness

708
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,519
even with my life, Martial Uncle.

709
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,679
I was so unfilial and ungrateful.

710
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,599
Brother Cao, please stand up.

711
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,559
I wondered how Mo Huai Yang, the old fox,

712
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,839
could nurture such a good innocent.

713
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,359
Turns out your martial uncle had already seen it through.

714
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,679
Wei Ning, since you have dissolved
all you hatred,

715
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,439
the shadows will finally fade away.

716
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,639
Son-in-law.

717
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,439
What’s going on?

718
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,959
There is a group of people waiting outside,

719
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,279
saying they are your fellow apprentices,

720
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,239
and they are coming for the wedding celebration.

721
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,439
Do you want to have a look?

722
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,159
What?

723
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,239
Miss Xiang.

724
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,039
The blessed hour is approaching,

725
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,239
the bride and bridegroom should not meet.

726
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,719
You knew it, right?

727
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,079
Did they... did they figure it out?

728
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,039
It’s Martial Uncle.

729
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,079
It must be because Martial Uncle

730
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,399
managed to persuade Master to change his mind.

731
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,079
My master always treated me so well.

732
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,199
He must know that without their presence
on my wedding,

733
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,679
I will surely regret it for my whole life.

734
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,039
Master!

735
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,759
Master. Master. Master.

736
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,799
Master!

737
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,279
Can I allow them to come in
and witness the wedding?

738
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,599
When I was staying with
the Gentle Wind Sect,

739
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,039
Martial Uncle Fan and the others treated me so well.

740
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,119
They once spared me from punishment

741
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,359
and covered me from accusation.

742
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,399
They are really good people.

743
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,159
Uncle Zhou.

744
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,999
What did you call me?

745
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,759
Brother.

746
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,279
It’s a pity that I’m not the Chief of the Ghost Valley,

747
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,079
I am not in charge.

748
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,959
Lao Wen,

749
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,799
they are condescending to come here
for congratulations,

750
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,559
previously Cheng Ling also transferred to us

751
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,359
the words from this Martial Uncle Fan
and Leader Shen,

752
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,119
they are really kind.

753
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,359
Why not fulfill the wish of these two kids?

754
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,359
Whatever you like.

755
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,159
Hurry up!

756
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,279
Miss Amethyst Fiend.

757
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,799
Those people outside call themselves
the fellow apprentices of Master Cao.

758
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,479
Open the gate, they are indeed fellow apprentices.

759
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,999
Yes.

760
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,639
Open the gate, receive the guests.

761
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,919
Do come in please, Leader Mo.

762
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,719
Follow me, let me show you around.

763
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,239
Great, thank you.

764
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,279
This way, please.

765
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,279
So you are also here.

766
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,759
Come on over here.

767
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,359
Senior Brother, congrats.

768
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,199
Thanks a lot.

769
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,039
Senior Brother, Senior Brother, congrats.

770
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,879
Come in, please come in.

771
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,679
Well, let’s go.

772
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,719
- Congrats, Senior Brother.

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,159
