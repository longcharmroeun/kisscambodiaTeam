Looking back, I was drinking
joyfully with my friends

00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,239
but now everything has changed.

The things in front of me
are still the same as before,

but the ones doing it are different.

Your injuries are so rare and odd

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,400
that even if your body
is already in the best condition,

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,880
I’m not completely sure I can cure you.

46

So stop thinking of it.

47

if he knew that Master Wen Ke Xing

to maintain your life.

No, thanks.

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,319
I’m going to solve

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,999
the misunderstanding between Lao Wen
and Cheng Ling.

108
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,679
Lao Wen promised me that

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,439
he will no longer manage the Ghost Valley.

110
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,679
He is back to pick up one thing,

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,159
and then he’ll live a cloistered live with me.

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,119
Just in case, please keep it.

Don’t curse him.

117
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,199

Just surrender.

If you listen to my words,

How dare you!

142

Even if your martial arts skills are excellent,

143
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,879
can you compete with so many of our masters?

144

We don’t have to

145

As I said before, I’ll kill anyone
who comes near me.

It’s true that I can’t kill all of you.

151
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,959
It just depends on which one of you wants to die,

or to live.

This is the key to the World’s Armory that you want.

instead of the Glazed Armor.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,919
Do you want it?

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,879
Kill me,

160
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,639
and it would be yours.

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,279
Great. Kill him now.

162
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,279
Don’t be fooled by him.

163
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,919
We can kill the Valley Chief,

164
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,799
and share the World’s Armory together.

165
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,039
Well, Scorpion,

166
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,679
I’ve undergone ups and downs all this life,

167
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,599
but I never thought

168
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,479
I’d fall under the treacherous plan
of you bastard!

169
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,199
Chief Wen, all is fair in war.

170
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,999
You can cheat others,

171
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,999
but you won’t allow them to cheat you?

172
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,359
Scorpion, you don’t need to talk too much.

173
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,919
Brother Wen, did you hear that?

174
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,199
It’s not me who wants to kill you,

175
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,359
but God.

176
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,879
I only regret that I was soft-hearted

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,999
and didn’t kill you to avenge my father.

178
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,279
Zhen Ru Yu lived an honorable and clean life,

179
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,119
but he has a devilish son like you!

180
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,359
If they could know this,

181
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,399
they must be ashamed of you.

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,399
As one of his brothers,

183
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,519
it’s my duty to kill you today.

184
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,279
I will erase the shame for Brother Zhen.

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,719
Cheng Ling, I...

186
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,759
Stop!

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,079
I’ll never forgive you for destroying my family!

188
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,879
Cheng Ling!

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,839
Fine.

190
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,439
I...

191
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,519
I shouldn’t have destroyed the Zhang family.

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,479
Zhang Yu Sen did nothing wrong to my father.

193
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,759
Cheng Ling.

194
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,799
Kill me to avenge your family!

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,479
I’m tired.

196
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,879
I won’t fight back

197
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,679
if you kill me.

198
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,799
Let me go!

199
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,839
Cheng Ling, you can’t go.

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,359
You can’t trust a devil’s words.

201
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,239
He’s going to die today no matter what.

202
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,519
I can’t let you go.

203
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,039
I won’t lie to you.

204
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,599
Cheng Ling, kill me

205
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,119
and I won’t fight back.

206
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,239
You liar!

207
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,399
All of your words are lies.

208
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,439
Wen Ke Xing, you deceived my master for so long!

209
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,879
I, I...

210
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,879
He didn’t lie to me.

211
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,999
Cheng Ling, do you believe in me?

212
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,559
Zhou Zi Shu.

213
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,199
Stop deluding Cheng Ling.

214
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,839
Brother Qin was such a righteous man.

215
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,519
How can he have such a wicked disciple like you?

216
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,759
Zhou Zi Shu,

217
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,639
I cheated all of you.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,159
Good and evil can never exist together.

219
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,999
As the Chief of the Ghost Valley,

220
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,599
I’m baleful for this world.

221
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,679
Stop it.

222
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,399
Leader Zhou, you belong to a famous sect,

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,879
and your master and I were old friends.

224
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,359
It’s not too late for you

225
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,919
to stand on the right side.

226
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,359
Wen Ke Xing must die today!

227
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,479
This bastard is very cunning

228
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,759
and even cheated me.

229
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,359
Don’t fall for his tricks.

230
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,919
Stop your nonsense.

231
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,719
Do you want to fight one by one,

232
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,239
or attack together?

233
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,439
Shame on you.

234
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,959
A couple of vicious demons!

235
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,079
Kill them both!

236
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,319
Kill them! Kill them!

237
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,239
Bastard.

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,799
Wen Ke Xing, I once said

239
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,279
that I will kill you

240
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,199
when I see you again in the martial arts world.

241
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,279
Alright.

242
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,359
Come and have a try.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,239
Who is this man in white?

244
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,359
He is the Changming Sword Immortal,

245
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,359
the master of Rong Xuan.

246
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,879
It’s said that he is the only person in the world

247
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,479
who has completely mastered
the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

248
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,279
He has completely masted it to a poised level.

249
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,719
I didn’t expect
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

250
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,799
can be so powerful.

251
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,439
Senior Ye, watch out!

252
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,559
Let me help you.

253
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,519
Cheng Ling.

254
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,239
Cheng Ling!

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,479
It’s dangerous!
Don’t get closer, Cheng Ling.

256
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,279
Get out of here.

257
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,279
Lao Wen!

258
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,479
Lao Wen!

259
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,319
<i>Why?</i>

260
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,519
Master!

261
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,279
Cheng Ling!

262
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,119

we should find the key.

274
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,959
The key is on Wen Ke Xing’s body.

275
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,519
Let’s find the key.

Master,

280
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,839
you’re awake.

281
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,159
Where is this place?

282
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,599
This is Ping An Inn.

283
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,319
Ping An In?

284
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,479
Is it a dream?

285
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,039
Turned out to be a dream.

286
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,359
What can I do for you?

287
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,119
The Master who brought you here

288
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,799
is our guest of honor here.

289
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,639
He instructed us

290
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,119
to put all your expenses on his account.

291
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,839
We’ve been oppressed by the Ghost Valley

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,359
for so long and suffered so much.

293
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,119
No we’re finally relieved.

294
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,199
It’s the greatest thing.

295
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,599
But that demon

296
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,879
died so easily.

297
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,959
What luck!

298
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,479
This evil bastard

299
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,199
actually managed to get a whole body.

300
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,159
It’s unfair.

301
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,399
Don’t you guys think so?

302
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,318
Yes. Absolutely.

303
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,239
Chief Zhao should parade

304
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,919
this bastard’s corpse as a warning.

305
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,719
You’re right!

306
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,879
Come on. Let’s have a drink.

307
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:24,520
Yes, cheers!

308
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,199
Sorry for this.

309
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,919
For the past half month,

310
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,719
it seems that many master of
the martial arts world have come here.

311
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,319
Something big seems to have happened today.

312
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,479
They’ve been messing around all night.

313
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,559
It’s kinda noisy.

314
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,479
Master?

315
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,599
Master, are you okay?

316
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,799
Master?

317
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,519
Immortal Ye, feel free.

318
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,519
Everyone.

319
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,679
Today we can achieve such success

320
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,199
thanks to Immortal Ye.

321
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,639
If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes,

322
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,879
I wouldn’t have know that

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,919
there was such a high level of martial arts
in this world.

324
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,199
Do you think so?

325
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,599
Yes, right.

326
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,519
Yes, absolutely.

327
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,359
I’m flattered.

328
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,759
We should give credit

329
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,159
to this good godchild of Chief Zhao.

330
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,239
If he hadn’t lured the
Chief of the Ghost Valley out first,

331
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,919
with the strong defense of the Ghost Valley,

332
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,799
even if I was powerful,

333
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,239
it wouldn’t have helped.

334
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,479
Immortal Ye, you overpraised him.

335
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,759
He is still a child

336
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
and he did what he should do.

337
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,559
You really flattered him.

338
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,839
Son, what are you waiting for?

339
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,519
Hurry up and toast to Immortal Ye.

340
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,639
Immortal Ye.

341
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,399
I don’t like a bustling place.

342
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,439
Hope you could enjoy this celebration.

343
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,919
Farewell.

344
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,359
Immortal.

345
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,999
Immortal, take care.

346
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,679
Everyone, let’s continue.

347
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,479
Pour another cup after this one.

348
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,959
just drink as much as you want.

349
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,159
Scorpion,

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,399
come here.

351
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,399
Sit down.

352
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,279
Haven’t you always wanted to sit beside me?

353
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,039
I’ve promised you.

354
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,519
Chief, allow me to toast to Master Zhao.

355
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,679
He offered a good idea

356
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,319
to capture the chief of all the demons first.

357
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,599
Right, let me toast to him.

358
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,879
Toast to Master Zhao and Chief.

359
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,479
Both of them are absolute heroes,

360
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,319
right?

361
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,439
If I hadn’t been there today,

362
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,399
I would never know

363
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,399
that the famous leader of the Scorpion....

364
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,399
Well,

365
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,399
I would like to take this opportunity

366
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,679
to formally introduce to you

367
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,999
this excellent young man beside me.

368
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,679
He is my son,

369
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,999
Zhao Xie Er*.
(*Lit: Xie means Scorpion)

370
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,839
Toast to Master Zhao. Cheers.

371
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,199
Toast to Master Zhao.

372
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,759
Cheers.

373
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,959
Ok, cheers.

374
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,039
Thank you, Foster-Father.

375
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,879
Cheers.

376
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,039

377
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,399

378
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,919

379
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,839
Martial Uncle.

380
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,559
Shut up.

381
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,839
Amethyst Fiend, you siren.

382
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,199
Where did you take Cao Wei Ning to?

383
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,639
Martial Uncle, no.

384
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,879
Bastard.

385
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,559
Do you know who she is?

386
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,359
She is my fiancee.

387
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,839
Martial Uncle, I would never fight against you.

388
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,439
But if you want to hurt Ah Xiang,

389
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,159
please kill me first.

390
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,839
Well, well.

391
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,839
I’ve brought you up in vain.

392
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,039
Martial Uncle.

393
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,479
Please tell me,

394
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,839
is it true that my master, Wen Ke Xing,

395
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,759
is dead?

396
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,999
Liu Qian Qiao?

397
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,519
Is Wen Ke Xing inside?

398
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,639

Have you seen the assassin?

407
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,359
Seems to be heading to the Gentle Wind Sect.

Martial Uncle.

410

Martial Uncle, have you seen the assassin?

411
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,239
What does he look like?

412
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,279
He was carrying a soft sword
and has a good anti-gravity skill.

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,559
Zhou Xu.

414
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,959
This way.

415
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,959
Let’s go.

416
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,199
- Martial Uncle.
- Zhou Xu.

417
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,439
Martial Uncle.

418
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,559
Let’s go, you stupid.

419
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,119
The spy is here!

420
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,439
Ah Xiang, run!

421
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,079
Ah Xiang.

422
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,399
Put out the fire! Put out the fire!

423
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,119
Put out the fire!

424
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,959
Sick Dude, where’s my master?

425
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,559
Stop playing tricks on me.

426
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,159
Didn’t you save my master?

427
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,479
Really?

428
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,679
No.

429
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,439
Zhou Xu.

430
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,999
Zhou Xu, where is my master?

431
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,839
You asked me to stay here,

432
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,239
and said you would save him.

433
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,439
But where is he now?

434
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,919
Just tell me where my master is.

435
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,999
He is so powerful. He would never die!

436
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,959
Just tell me where my master is!

437
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,279
Brother Zhou, what happened?

438
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,519
As soon as we arrived at White Deer Town,

439
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
we heard that the Chief of the Ghost Valley
was killed.

440
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,959
Is that true?

441
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,519
Were you seeking for him?

442
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,599
Please tell us where he is.

443
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,879
I didn’t make it,

444
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,879
and I can only set a fire

445
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,359
to let him...

446
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,839
I don’t believe it.

447
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,519
You liar!

448
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,759
I’m going to find my master.

449
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,839
Ah Xiang.

450
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,919
Brother Zhou.

451
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,679
Didn’t Lord Seven and Grand Wizard come with you?

452
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,599
Ah Xiang was impatient,

453
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,319
so we went here first.

454
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,799
They are still on the way.

455
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,839
Alright.

456
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,239
Wei Ning,

457
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,999
take Ah Xiang someplace else.

458
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,599
If you can’t find a place around,

459
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,639
go back to South Xinjiang with Lord Seven.

460
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,759
Bring my 18 disciples.

461
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,639
Lord Seven will keep you safe always.

462

<i>once the nails are pulled out of your body,</i>

508
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,639
<i>the surging internal force</i>

509
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,479
<i>will immediately rush through your meridians.</i>

510
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,519
<i>This elixir can temporarily protect your meridians</i>

511
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,439
<i>and help you withstand
the circulation of the internal force</i>

512
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,639
The world is not important,

513
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,919
but my soulmate is.

514
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,279
Since my soulmate is gone,

515
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,399
what do I have to care about?

516
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,599
Tomorrow is the Insects Awaken*,
(* Lit.: A Chinese solar term)

517
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,479
 also the restart of the Heroes Conference.

518
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,119
My first toast is

519
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,959
to me dead brothers.

520
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,439
I hope their spirit in heaven

521
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,359
can bless us the Five Lakes Alliance

522
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,479
to elect a highly respected chief

523
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,679
who could lead us

524
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,359
to wipe out the Ghost Valley.

525
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,759
Come on.

526
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,039
Toast to them.

527
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,740
Cheers.

528
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,479
My second toast is

529
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,879
to all of you

530
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,599
to encourage you to fight.

531
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,159
Nowadays,

532
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,159
all heroes are gathered at White Deer Town.

533
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,719
Whether the Five Lakes Alliance can take revenge

534
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,919
and create glory again

535
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,039
depends on this battle.

536
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,519
The Ghost Valley has been there for many years,

537
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,159
occupying a geographical advantage,
which is difficult for us to attack.

538
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,359
It must be a hard fight.

539
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,359
All I want is

540
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,359
for you all to come back safely.

541
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,399
Then we will drink again
for three days and three nights.

542
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,679
Ok, cheers.

543
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,439
Cheers.

544
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,919
Brothers, it’s getting late.

545
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,959
Have one more cup,

546
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,879
and we’ll go back to sleep.

547
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,999
We should have a rest

548
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,719
to recover our strength.

549
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,159
Chief, you are too cautious.

550
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,759
Everyone, in my opinion,

551
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,159
the Chief of the Ghost Valley died.

552
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,639
The Ten Devils of the Ghost Valley

553
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,959
are almost in our camp.

554
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,479
So the Ghost Valley

555
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,479
means nothing now.

556
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,679
we don’t need to be afraid at all.

557
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,279
Even if there are some remnants of Ghost Valley,

558
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,999
they won’t bother.

559
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,079
Don’t worry.

560
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,639
Come on, everyone. Raise your cups.

561
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,159
But we should never take it lightly.

562
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,599
Second Brother,

563
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,079
my third toast is to you.

564
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,759
I hope you could get everything you want

565
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,919
and complete unfinished business

566
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,439
for Big Brother.

567
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,479
Uncle Zhao.

568
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,919
I wish you could get what you want.

569
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,319
And I wish my dad, Uncle Gao

570
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,399
and Uncle Lu’s spirits

571
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,639
could bless us.

572
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,639
Everyone,

573
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,919
let’s toast Chief Zhao together.

574
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,319
I wish Foster-Father

575
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,279
could be the supreme leader
of the martial arts world!

576
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,638
Scorpion, we should take the long view.

577
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,638
What we want is to do justice

578
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,919
and eliminate the demons.

579
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,599
As for being the leader,

580
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,319
actually it’s not so important for me.

581
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,638
Whatever.

582
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,479
Over the past hundred years,

583
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,159
Shaolin Sect, Wudang Sect,
Five Mount and Sword Sects and the Beggar Gangs,

584
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,319
we all helpless
to fight against the Ghost Valley.

585
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,638
Thanks to the wise counsel of our Chief Zhao
and the Young Chief,

586
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,199
the Chief of the Ghost Valley was killed first.

587
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,239
With such a great merit,

588
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,079
only our chief

589
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,799
can be the supreme leader
in the martial arts world.

590
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,519
Right.

591
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,159
Yes.

592
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,638
Everyone, with the leading of Chief Zhao,

593
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,679
no matter what demons and monsters,

594
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,239
it’s a piece of cake for us.

595
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,079
Let’s toast to Chief Zhao.

596
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,199
To Chief Zhao.

597
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,879
Congratulations Chief Zhao!

598
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,719
Toast to Chief Zhao.

599
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,239
Thank you, everyone.

600
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,230
Cheers.

601
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,279
Cheers.

602
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,759
Chang Qing,

603
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,199
we’ve been in the mountains all the time.

604
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,199
We face only each other every day,

605
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,599
not knowing what’s happening
in the outside world,

606
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,319
and not feeling how old we are.

607
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,439
Only when we went out and saw the young people,

608
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,359
we realized that

609
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,039
we have become so old.

610
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,479
Chang Qing.

611
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,479
You’re just an idiot.

612
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,359
You established the Ghost Valley
and made the Water of Lethe.

613
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,519
You wanted to give all the evildoers

614
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,039
a chance to change their ways.

615
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,119
But who gave you a chance to survive?

616
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,839
If it weren’t for this damn Ghost Valley,

617
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,159
you would not be practicing
the Combined Six Cultivation Power.

618
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,359
Were you trying to make yourself
a long-lived throne

619
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,039
and hold down the demons forever?

620
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,519
Do you think you were a Bodhisattva?

621
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,479
Ridiculous.

622
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,639
As a mortal,

623
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,079
why did you worry about those matters for God?

624
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,079
Did God treat you well?

625
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,759
I promised you to help you,

626
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,359
and to destroy the whole Ghost Valley.

627
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,799
Until you die I didn’t tell you that

628
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,399
our child

629
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,119
died outside Mount Qingya.

630
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,999
There was a young man

631
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,559
who died for Rong Xuan.

632
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,039
But unexpectedly,

633
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,719
he became the Chief of the Ghost Valley.

634
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,479
This is fate.

635
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,399
Chang Qing,

636
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,919
if it was you who survived,

637
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,279
not me,

638
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,439
what would you do?

639
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,439
Officer Duan, please.

640
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,519
Officer Duan, any problem?

641
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,999
Chief Zhao.

642
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,199
Officer Duan, I’m as blind as a bat.

643
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,959
I didn’t expect you can play both sides
against the middle.

644
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,039
You’re not only the Chief of the Five Lakes Alliance,

645
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,959
but also the leader of Scorpion.

646
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,919
I should have sent my respect.

647
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,039
Officer Duan, it’s my fault.

648
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,799
But this is not the time

649
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,719
to explain in detail.

650
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,439
But if you want to know,

651
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,359
I won’t lie to you.

652
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,719
Me?

653
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,279
What qualifies us, the Window of Heaven,
to be allies with you?

654
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,919
How many identities you have

655
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,119
has nothing to do with me.

656
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,279
But Scorpion

657
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,359
hurt and pillage everywhere.

658
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,559
They buy people to make Drug Men.

659
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,519
They’re harmful to this world.

660
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,119
If we blatantly support

661
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,759
someone like you

662
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,279
to become the supreme leader
and eliminate Ghost Valley

663
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,159
once the matter is revealed,

664
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,839
I will be the first one

665
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,919
to be killed by the Prince.

666
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,239
Officer Duan.

667
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,079
I’m here

668
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,999
to tell you that

669
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,079
we’re enemies, not friends anymore.

670
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,439
Next time when we meet,

671
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,119
I will not show you any mercy.

672
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,119
Farewell.

673
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,639
Officer Duan, please wait.

674
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,759
There must be some misunderstanding.

675
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,759
I’m not the Scorpion King,

676
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,239
the Scorpion is.

677
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,239
He is my ally.

678
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,719
Ally?

679
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,159
Isn’t he your adopted son?

680
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,959
Yes.

681
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,639
But I didn’t know

682
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,479
he had done so many bad things.

683
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,799
Officer Duan, could you please tell me

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,319
what the Drug Men are?

685
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,199
How was it?

686
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,759
It’s hard to fathom a person’s mind.

687
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,919
Zhao Jing said

688
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,839
he’s about to restart the Heroes Conference,

689
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,239
and fight with the Ghost Valley to the end.

690
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,959
Using demons to destroy demons

691
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,919
is not against the will of God.

692
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,559
After the fight,

693
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,519
he’ll kill you

694
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,159
to gather the power of the Scorpion.
