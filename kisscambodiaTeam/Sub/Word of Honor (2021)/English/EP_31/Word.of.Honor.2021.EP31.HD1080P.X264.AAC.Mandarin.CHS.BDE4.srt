King.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,199
The two ghosts have waited
for a long time outside.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,039
Should I bring them in?

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,119
Scorpion King.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,039
How many casualties are there?

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,759
We lost 47 people this time.

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,839
There were 3...

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,639
Enough!

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,559
Though we got nothing from this trip,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,759
we contributed a lot to it.

Qian Qiao.

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,519
Grant them the antidotes of this month.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,079
Yes.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,199
Thank you for your kindness, King.

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,519
Thank you, King.

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,039

Hurry up!

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,279
Hurry up!

Xiang’er is just a tiny servant in in the Ghost Valley.

the Lunatic Wen’s whereabouts from here.

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,239
Why the rush?

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,199
- Qian Qiao.
- Yes.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,479
Hurry and untie Miss Amethyst Fiend.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,319
I want to have a good talk with her personally.

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,439
Leader.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,679
Do you still remember the motto of
our ancestor of the Gentle Wind Sect?

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,639
“A man lives when his sword is intact.

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,839
A man dies when his sword breaks.

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,679
Be righteous

63
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,159
and demolish demons.”

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,919
You still remember.

65
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,039
Then do you remember
that one of the rules of our sect?

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,839
“A disciple of the Gentle Wind Sect
will not associate with the demons.”

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,319
Today, you will explain yourself in front of

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,639
the portrait of our master.

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,039
Why did you do that today?

70
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,839
I associate with the Chief of
the Five Lakes Alliance.

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,159
He is not a demon.

72
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,519
He choose to ask a tiger for its skin*,
(*Ask a man to act against his interest)

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,919
bribe Scorpion and

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,759
tame the evil ghosts of the Ghost Valley.

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,599
I can’t control what they do.

76
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,279
Leader.

77
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,119
Do you want me to explain

78
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,159
to our disciples with these excuses?

79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
Chief Gao’s death was a mystery.

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,359
It’s very suspicious.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,039
It must be Zhao Jing!

82
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,159
Chief Gao handed you the Glazed Armor,
which he cherished

83
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,079
more than his life.

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,759
But you...

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,039
Firstly...

86
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,879
I didn’t hand the Glazed Armor to anyone.

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,439
Secondly...

88
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,359
in such a dangerous situation today,

89
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,959
could you resolve it

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,039
without my association with Zhao Jing?

91
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,399
As the Leader,

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,039
mt priority is to

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,879
maintain the legacy of our Gentle Wind Sect.

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,919
I’m not guilty of anything.

95
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,079
But if one day,
we are forced to a corner

96
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,199
and that’s the way to rescue the whole sect,

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,959
I don’t mind

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,519
losing my reputation.

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,399
I would rather die
than act against the principles.

100
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,279
Back then,

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,079
everyone accused Chief Gao of associating
with the Ghost Valley

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,279
and killing his brothers.

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,199
Looking at it now,

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,439
Zhao Jing is the one who’s working
with the Ghost Valley!

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,239
Enough!

106
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,719
Do you think I’m too stupid or too cruel?

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,719
I’m acting along with Zhao Jing.

108
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,639
I have my own plans.

109
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,079
Senior Brother, what are you planning to do?

110
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,999
Only if I become the supreme leader
of the martial arts world

111
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,279
in the upcoming Heroes Conference

112
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,519
and lead all heroes
to exterminate the Ghost Valley,

113
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,399
I will then have the rights to take control.

114
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,599
Brother Gao died tragically.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,559
I must carry his burden.

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,039
But what can these stones do?

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,279
You must trust me.

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,399
Follow my lead.

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,999
I trust you, Senior Brother.

120
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,199
I know you didn’t do it.

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,919
I misunderstood you.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,159
Open the door.

123
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,799
I’m sorry.

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,759
Leader, we are late.

125
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,879
Xing Ming?

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,359
Be careful! Protect our Leader!

127
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,039
You were the leader of
the Window of Heaven.

128
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,559
You were once powerful

129
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,839
and ruled over people’s lives.

130
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,159
But in the end, you’re saved
by your juniors

131
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,439
and are fleeing for life.

132
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,079
Without the Prince’s favor,

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,679
who do you think you are?

134
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,079
You!

135
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,399
What’s your name again?

136
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,199
You’re a disciple of Old Bi, right?

137
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,599
I’m Bi Xing Ming.

138
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,079
Old Bi is stupid enough.

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,279
I didn’t expect that his disciple

140
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,199
would be more foolish.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,079
Do you think you can snatch
a culprit out of prison

142
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,079
just by your coordination
with your people outside?

143
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,999
Absolutely idiotic!

144
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,439
You’re the disciples of the old subordinates of
the Window of Heaven.

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,679
A few spies are keeping an eye
on each of you.

146
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,479
I found out since the moment

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,999
you planned to break into the jail to rescue him.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,759
But you sensed nothing.

149
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,599
Did your dead masters

150
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,439
know how stupid you are?

151
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,199
But, thanks to you

152
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,279
for bringing out Leader Zhou.

153
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,039
Anything could happen in combat.

154
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,159
When I was chasing after the fugitive,

155
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,879
I killed Leader Zhou by accident.

156
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,639
I’m not violating the Prince’s order, right?

157
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,239
I am not stupid!

158
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,839
Leader, I, the disciple of Cheng Xiu,
Cheng Zi Chen

159
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,079
am willing to sacrifice myself
today to protect you!

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,119

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,519
Chief Wen, you’re here at the right time.

186
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,399
Even if you’re not here,

187
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,119
I will visit the Ghost Valley

188
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
to ask you for a thing.

189
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,599
Did I mishear you?

190
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,239
I didn’t kill you

191
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,959
yet you’re asking me something from me?

192
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,119
Chief Wen, stop pretending to be a god.

193
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,879
You’ve been too self-centered for too long,

194
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,799
not knowing any better about this world.

195
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,199
How dare you snatch this criminal
from Jin all by yourself!

196
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,999
You’ve underestimated the Window of Heaven!

197
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,799
You’ve revealed yourself.

198
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,839
The army will be here in no time.

199
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,639
Even if you’re excellent at martial arts,

200
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,039
you’re all alone.

201
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,679
Who said that he’s alone?

202
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,079
Where’s Cheng Ling?

203
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,399
I’ve escorted him to a safe place, rest assured.

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,959
In this case,

205
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,439
us brothers can give it a go.

206
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,799
Wen Ke Xing, what are you trying to do?

207
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,679
You’ve called me Chief of the Ghost Valley.

208
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,559
As the Chief of 3,000 ghosts,

209
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,359
would I come alone to

210
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,959
save him?

211
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,839
- Retreat!
- Hurry up!

212
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,639
Retreat!

213
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,039
Valley Chief!

214
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,359
Greetings, Leader. I’m Bi Xing Ming!

215
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,759
Greetings, Leader. I’m Cheng Zi Chen!

216
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,399
Greetings, Leader!

217
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,439
Senior Brother.

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,639
Before Brother Han died,

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,959
he handed me these children.

220
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,359
I decided by myself and accepted them.

221
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,159
It was Brother Han’s wish

222
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,479
to include them into
the Four Seasons Manor.

223
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,679
It’s my wish too.

224
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,319
I’m the unworthy Second Disciple of
the Four Seasons Manor, Wen Ke Xing.

225
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,839
Greetings, Leader.

226
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,039
Ah Xiang, they are back!

227
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,759
Master!

228
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,279
We are here.

229
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,279
Master!

230
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,399
Sick Dude! This is great!

231
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,559
Master, are you injured?

232
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,039
Who can hurt me?

233
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,879
Why are you here?

234
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,559
It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later.

235
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,519
Sick Dude.

236
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,199
How did the dog prince hurt you like this?

237
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,719
Master and I will
take revenge for you later!

238
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,519
Just with your martial arts?

239
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,399
Bei Yuan?

240
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,759
Zi Shu.

241
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,439
It’s been many years.
How have you been?

242
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,359
Master Wen, don’t be restless.

243
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,679
Though the Nails of Seven Torments are
hard to deal with,

244
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,519
it’s not hopeless.

245
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,639
Zi Shu has overcome many difficulties.

246
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,599
He will overcome this one too.

247
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,639
Lord Seven, as long as you can heal
Ah Xu’s injury,

248
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,879
I will...

249
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,079
I will try my best to repay you.

250
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,839
You don’t have to say this.

251
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,799
Zi Shu and I have known each other since young.

252
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,359
It’s just that he became colder as he grew up.

253
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,919
He never asks for help even if he needs it.

254
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,879
He never treats me as his friend.

255
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,839
Lord Seven, you knew Ah Xu?

256
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,239
Yes.

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,039
Looking at it now,

258
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,239
it’s been a long time ago,
as if it was something from my past life.

259
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,879
Master Wen.

260
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,399
The brothers are all here.

261
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,879
Master Wen.

262
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,519
Lord Seven.

263
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,199
These children

264
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,799
are the disciples of our
Four Seasons Manor.

265
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,679
Before the Manor is rebuilt,

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,199
I might need to keep them at your place.

267
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,079
Master Wen.

268
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,159
Wu Xi and I are who we are today

269
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,879
thanks to Zi Shu.

270
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,639
I’ll be offended

271
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,159
if you keep being so polite.

272
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,879
Bi Xing Ming greets Lord Seven.

273
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,039
What’s your relationship with Bi Chang Feng?

274
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,839
He’s my master.

275
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,959
I was fortunate to inherit
my master’s surname.

276
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,919
Very good.

277
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,480
Oh, right.

278
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,079
Talking about this.

279
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,159
I received a piece of news
from my warrior, Qin Lai.

280
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,679
He has escorted Cheng Ling
to Leader Shen Shen

281
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,959
of the Mount Dagu Sect safely.

282
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,199
Since Zi Shu is rescued,

283
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,639
should we bring him back?

284
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,799
Grand Wizard, how was it?
Can you save him?

285
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,799
Please allow me.
I’m used to serving my master.

286
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,199
It’s fine. I’ll do it.

287
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,199
Let me do it instead.

288
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,519
Well, why does he do as you say?

289
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,199
By the way, Leader.

290
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,359
I forgot to inform you.

291
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,279
It was all thanks to Master Wen.

292
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,719
He contacted me with a mark left
by Brother Han.

293
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,519
He made a good plan and led us.

294
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,839
What did you call me?

295
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,159
You should call us Master and Martial Uncle.

296
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,079
Greetings...

297
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,599
No rush.

298
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,439
You can acknowledge us formally

299
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,199
along with your senior brother.

300
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,199
Lao Wen.

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,959
I have 19 young men in my sect now.

302
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,799
Aren’t you gonna share some of my burdens?

303
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,719
No problem, Leader Zhou.

304
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,599
You may leave first.

305
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,239
Yes.

306
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,799
Let’s go.

307
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,159
Ah Xu.

308
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,959
Why weren’t you shocked

309
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,959
when you saw me out of the jail?

310
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,879
I was looking forward to your expression.

311
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,159
What’s so surprising?

312
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,199
I didn’t know when and how you would come.

313
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,039
But I did know

314
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,519
you would definitely come.

315
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,439
No wonder.

316
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,199
So you wanted to run away with your lover?

317
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,479
Yes.

318
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,079
Little girl.

319
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,359
Why aren’t you feeling shameful
but proud?

320
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,279
Of course.

321
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,439
If Brother Cao is willing to come along with me,

322
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,319
it means that I’m more important to Brother Cao

323
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,959
compared to all the stupid rules
in the martial arts world.

324
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,079
Of course I am happy!

325
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,159
You’re right!

326
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,919
Miss Ah Xiang, you dare to love and hate.

327
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,879
You are the girls in South Xinjiang.

328
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,679
Yes, she’s like the people from South Xinjiang,

329
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,039
who’s good at taking away
children from decent families.

330
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,279
By the way, Little Ah Xiang.

331
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,719
Tell me how you two ran away.

332
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,119
It’s a wonderful story.

333
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,879
Ah Xiang! Ah Xiang!

334
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,839
Ah Xiang.

335
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,599
Why aren’t you lighting up your room?

336
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,039
I forgot.

337
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,359
How was it? What’s happening?

338
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,959
I still don’t get it now.

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,319
I feel like I’ve had a nightmare.

340
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,959
Master has formed an alliance
with the Five Lakes Alliance.

341
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,399
No.

342
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,479
Then what’s with the Drug Men?

343
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,559
If they were allies,

344
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,759
why did the Drug Men surround Mount Qingfeng?

345
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,879
Did you see the man in the black robe?

346
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,999
He’s the Black Grim Reaper.

347
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,159
Why was the subordinate of
the Ghost Valley there?

348
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,479
Chief Zhao has convinced the seven sects.

349
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,439
They will hold the Heroes Conference again.

350
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,759
Those evil ghosts

351
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,439
have already surrendered to Chief Zhao.

352
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,919
Impossible.

353
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,799
It’s not strange that the Black Grim Reaper
would turn his back.

354
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,559
Bu Sister Qian Qiao would never betray Master.

355
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,159
You don’t know.

356
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,959
Sister Qian Qiao is the Beauty Ghost.

357
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,999
Don’t listen to Zhao Jing’s nonsense.

358
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,839
He is not a decent man.

359
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,639
Ah Xiang.

360
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,479
Martial Uncle told me these.

361
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,399
I can only listen to him.

362
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,519
Ah Xiang, I don’t understand.

363
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,559
I don’t want to look into it either.

364
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,039
Martial Uncle said that Master
was planning to pursue more.

365
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,439
He asked me not to look into it.

366
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,439
But...

367
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,959
But I understand even if I don’t ask.

368
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,719
This is not right.

369
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,999
Not right.

370
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,319
Brother Cao, what’s wrong?

371
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,399
I’m just...

372
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,319
Ah Xiang.

373
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,439
We promised each other.

374
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,479
If Master and Martial Uncle don’t agree to our marriage,

375
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,439
we will run away.

376
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,359
Are you being serious?

377
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,159
Let’s run away.

378
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,959
I don’t care about being a righteous man.

379
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,639
You’re not evil.

380
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,879
We should leave.

381
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,439
I don’t understand.
And I don’t want to.

382
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,759
We should leave this martial arts world.

383
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,639
We can open a dessert shop
or a cosmetic shop.

384
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,559
We can raise cows and farm.

385
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,559
We can do anything.

386
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,719
What do you say?

387
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,239
Yes.

388
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,559
Just like that we ran away.

389
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,439
Isn’t it great?

390
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,279
That is quite wonderful.

391
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,759
Brother Cao can distinguish right from wrong.

392
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,199
He’s a real man.

393
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,519
You’ve married the right man.

394
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,519
Wait a minute.

395
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,959
I still don’t understand.

396
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,719
Zhao Jing allied with Mo Huai Yang
from the Gentle Wind Sect

397
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,999
since the beginning?

398
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,999
Yes, but he hid it.

399
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,719
He didn’t tell his son, Scorpion King.

400
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,959
Scorpion King fought for nothing.

401
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,359
He’s extremely angry.

402
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,079
This is not right, Ah Xiang.

403
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,759
Since you’ve decided to run away,

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,999
how did you meet the people
from the Ghost Valley?

405
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,519
How did you find us?

406
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,559
What’s wrong?

407
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,439
I’m sorry, Lord Seven.

408
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,679
Master Wen doesn’t allow Ah Xiang to say this.

409
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,279
He will cut her tongue off
if she does.

410
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,959
Alright, then.

411
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,599
It’s fine, you don’t have to.

412
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,399
Luckily, you found Master Wen in time.

413
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,479
Otherwise, we had to

414
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,439
throw our lives in.

415
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,839
But Ah Xiang.

416
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,999
Does Brother Wen have to return
to the Ghost Valley?

417
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,919
He finally reunited with Brother Zhou.

418
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,719
He will come back after stepping down
from the chief position

419
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,399
and help Aunt Luo
and her subordinates settle down.

420
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,959
But the Exorcism Assembly is starting soon.

421
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,639
All the heroes will go to Mount Qingya.

422
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,399
They can do whatever they want.

423
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,239
I only care about my sisters
from the Department of the Unfaithful.

424
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,839
I don’t miss anyone there in the Ghost Valley.

425
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,919
Who cares if they’re dying?

426
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,479
Okay, I hope everything goes well.

427
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,359
How does this silly girl
fold the clothes normally?

428
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,199
You’re here in time.

429
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,159
What’s wrong?
Why do you look so gloomy?

430
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,359
Master, I’m still a little uneasy.

431
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,599
Can you not return to the Ghost Valley?

432
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,279
We just have to take care of the girls

433
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,279
of the Department of the Unfaithful.

434
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,959
Let the other ghosts find their own homes.

435
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,119
They are all betrayers anyway.

436
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,359
Who cares if they are dying?

437
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,479
You sound like a kid.

438
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,239
Don’t worry.

439
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,079
I’ll come back right away.

440
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,039
You just have to take care of Ah Xu for me.

441
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,999
Master, you can’t hide from me.

442
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,799
I’m not stupid.

443
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,359
I brought Scorpion King to you

444
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,479
because I thought you could

445
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,759
make him surrender.

446
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,359
But if you get hurt from this,

447
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,199
I...

448
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,879
I will never forgive myself
for the rest of my life.

449
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,719
And I saw it with my own eyes.

450
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,839
Those silly ghosts were controlled by
Scorpion King’s secret medicine.

451
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,719
They listened to him like pugs.

452
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,159
Why do they come back and serve you

453
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,479
after your secret talk with Scorpion King?

454
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,399
Although Scorpion King hates Zhao Jing,

455
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,479
that’s not a reason for him to help his enemy.

456
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,519
You even know that he’s helping his enemy.

457
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,999
Seems like you’ve gotten smarter

458
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,599
after being with Little Cao.

459
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,279
Master, don’t you change the topic!

460
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,719
Brother Cao has said

461
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,279
you’re asking a tiger...

462
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,519
Asking a tiger for what?

463
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,959
Asking a tiger for its skin!*
(*Asking a man to act against his interest)

464
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,479
I know

465
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,599
you can do anything

466
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,919
to save Zhou Xu.

467
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,119
But Master,

468
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
you should tell me
what you have promised him.

469
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,959
I’ve told you previously.

470
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,359
Never mention my plot

471
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,319
with Scorpion King to anyone else,

472
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,719
especially Ah Xu.

473
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,639
I didn’t.

474
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,679
I just think that I should know
what’s happening too.

475
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,919
Master, I’m really worried about you.

476
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,959
Silly girl.

477
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,799
Scorpion King acts along with me

478
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,719
because it benefits him too.

479
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,999
I’ll explain this to you sometime.

480
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,439
The priority now

481
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,399
is for Ah Xu to heal as soon as possible.

482
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,559
Don’t worry.

483
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,919
Grand Wizard said

484
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,159
once Ah Xu’s condition improves to his best,

485
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,359
we need another master to be here

486
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,359
to remove the nails.

487
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,079
I’ll come back before then.

488
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,439
Now that you say this,

489
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,479
you should go then.

490
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,879
Right, you have left me behind a hundred times,

491
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,439
but not even once when it comes to that Sick Dude.

492
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,879
You’re jealous of a man?

493
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,759
No.

494
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,559
Why are you jealous because of me?

495
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,199
Why aren’t you jealous because of
your Brother Cao?

496
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,439
He won’t make me jealous.

497
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,759
Master, you must come back safely.

498
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,759
Have a little confidence in me, okay?

499
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,319
Even if I’m asking a tiger for its skin,

500
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,879
can’t I defeat Scorpion King?

501
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,959
Who’s the tiger? Who’s the hunter?

502
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,359
We still don’t know yet.

503
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,839
Valley Chief is back.

504
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,839
All evils retreat!

505
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,479
All ghosts return!

506
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,959
Welcome back, Valley Chief.

507
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,079
My apologies.

508
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,199
But there’s only one chair

509
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,439
in your hall.

510
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,359
If you like it,

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,039
I can let you be the Chief of the Ghost Valley.

512
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,719
How about that?

513
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,919
No, thanks.

514
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,639
I don’t think

515
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,719
I can handle a critical situation.

516
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,999
You should keep

517
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,319
the position instead, Chief Wen.

518
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,759
Brother Cheng Ling, enough.
Stop practicing!

519
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,159
Brother Cheng Ling!

520
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,279
You can’t learn martial arts overnight.

521
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,799
I know you’re annoyed at yourself.

522
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,439
But you can’t push yourself too hard.

523
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,119
Training days and nights

524
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,719
might not benefit you.

525
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,159
Cheng Ling.

526
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,500
Uncle Shen.

527
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,839
Can you talk some sense into Cheng Ling?

528
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,839
Uncle Shen.

529
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,340
[To the Leader of Mount Dagu Sect, Shen Shen]

530
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
<i>[Dear Chevalier Shen of Mount Dagu Sect]</i>

531
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,719
<i>[Demolish the ghosts and cleanse the world]
[It’s held on the 15th this month at White Deer Town]</i>

532
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,959
The Exorcism Assembly is confirmed?

533
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,919
We finally have the chance to carry out

534
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,999
what Big Brother couldn’t.

535
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,239
White Deer Town?

536
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,839
The name sounds familiar.

537
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,639
White Deer Town is right outside Mount Qingya.

538
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,279
The first chief of the Ghost Valley,
Rong Chang Qing,

539
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,839
is buried in White Deer Town.

540
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,399
We chose that place

541
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,159
so that we can exterminate the Ghost Valley

542
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,879
at once with this opportunity.

543
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,359
Uncle Shen, are you going to the assembly too?

544
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,759
I want to ask you about it.

545
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,679
If I was the only one here,
I wouldn’t bother to be there.

546
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,679
I just want to fulfill the wishes of
Big Brother and Fourth Brother.

547
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,439
Watching you grow up into adults
and form your own families.

548
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,599

to the Ghost Valley.

What do you think?

553
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,639
Valley Chief, I deserve to die.

555
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,319

Yes... Serving...
Being able to serve Valley Chief...

Why are you going back to this place of misery?

615
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,639
Aunt Luo, I’ve remembered everything.

616
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,759
I thought I succeeded in resisting

617
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,279
the effect of the Water of Lethe

618
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,919
and remembered

619
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,959
all the murderers who killed my parents.

620
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,959
These years,

621
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,239
you watched me killed them one by one.

622
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,319
You must know it clearly.

623
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,359
But I was wrong.

624
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,399
The moment I drank the Water of Lethe,

625
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
my obsession was

626
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,999
that I led an evil person into my family.

627
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,239
I killed my parents indirectly.

628
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,199
Everything might end differently.

629
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,999
But it’s a different story now.

630
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,439
I’ve been the Chief of the Ghost Valley
for eight years.

631
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,999
I’m alert in case anyone wants to kill me.

632
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,359
I have to come up with plans
to kill others too.

633
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,199
Even after killing all the murderers,

634
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,599
I didn’t feel happy
because I’ve finally taken my revenge,

635
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,719
but anxious and tortured.

636
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,119
I thought that was hatred too

637
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,399
because I didn’t take revenge on all the people

638
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,919
who pushed my parents down the cliff.

639
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,759
So I put all my effort to set up a trap.

640
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,999
An interlocking murder game.

641
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,599
Aunt Luo.

642
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,279
Do you know my initial plan?

643
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,119
Hanged Ghost didn’t steal my Glazed Armor.

644
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,399
I don’t have the Glazed Armor either.

645
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,559
I’ve killed him secretly long ago.

646
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,319
That was just an excuse.

647
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,079
Valley Chief!

648
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,759
My plan was to re-enact
the Battle of Mount Qingya.

649
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,079
No.

650
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,199
I wanted to light a bigger fire

651
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,599
to burn up all the filthiness in this world!

652
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,959
Those so-called righteous sects
in the martial arts world

653
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,079
are just greedy ghosts
covered with human skin!

654
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,839
They should die together
with the demons and monsters

655
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,239
of Mount Qingya!

656
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,799
I let you out to the martial arts world

657
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,479
and released the news of the Glazed Armor

658
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,919
all for this plan.

659
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,959
Once you enter the Ghost Valley,
you’re isolated from the man’s world.

660
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,319
Whoever comes to Mount Qingya

661
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,959
for their desire of the Glazed Armor

662
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,439
will die here!

663
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,759
Ah Xing, what do you mean?

664
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,759
Are you...

665
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,439
Are you planning to die with them?

666
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,679
Since I set up such an evil trap,

667
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,599
I didn’t worry about too many things.

668
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,079
I didn’t consider

669
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,879
the number of innocent people
who would die from this.

670
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,759
Because at that time, I thought

671
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,599
the world had turned its back on me,

672
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,039
so I wouldn’t mind killing everyone in the world.

673
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,079
Until later,

674
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,039
a man taught me something.

675
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,279
Hatred is the same as greed.

676
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,359
They are caging ourselves.

677
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,399
My parents

678
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,359
and even you, Aunt Luo.

679
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,479
You tried so hard to save me,

680
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,999
not to bury yourself in the past.

681
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,279
Aunt Luo.

682
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,639

Tomorrow onward,

684
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,879
I’ll ask him to

685
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,759
remove the poison in you and Qian Qiao.

686
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,799
Bring the girls from the Department of
the Unfaithful out of this valley.

As long as we let go of our hatred,

688

we are in the human’s world.

689
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,159
Why should we cage ourselves up?
