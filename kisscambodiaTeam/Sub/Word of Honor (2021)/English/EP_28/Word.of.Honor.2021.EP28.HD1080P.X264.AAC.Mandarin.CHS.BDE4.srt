[Episode 28]

23
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,798
Your Highness,

24
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,038
Commander Han is here to see you.

25
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,838
Han Ying?

26
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,278
Let him in.

27
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:19,878
Yes.

28
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:31,838
Han Ying.

29
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,558
Greetings, Your Highness.

30
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,998
It’s okay, just lie down.

31
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,158
I can’t forget the formality.

32
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,558
Lie down.

33
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,318
What happened?

34
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,838
Why did you lose contact for so long?

35
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,918
Your Highness,

36
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,798
please forgive me.

37
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,518
My team was tracked

38
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,038
and attacked.

39
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,078
All my men died at their posts.

40
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,798
I’m the only one survived

41
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,198
from all kinds of hardships and dangers.

42
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:01,718
If it were not for my loyalty to Your Highness,

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,240
I wouldn’t have made it until now.

44
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,040
What!

45
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,960
Do you know who did this?

46
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,000
It’s the Scorpion.

47
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,438
It’s a gang that are specialized

48
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:20,598
in assassinating people for money.

49
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,718
Although they were masked,

50
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:26,678
this Scorpion tail thorn was
pulled out from my wound.

51
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,038
I’ve asked someone.

52
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,278
It belongs to the Scorpion.

53
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,558
Unbelievable!

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,620
Good.

55
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,518
Fairly well.

56
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,638
Your Highness,

57
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,358
my men are always very careful.

58
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,158
How did others know our whereabouts?

59
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,318
There must be a catch in it.

60
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,558
I’m afraid that there are spies
in the Window of Heaven.

61
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,998
And they might bring troubles
to your plan, Your Highness.

62
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,238
So I was so nervous

63
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,758
that I came back as soon as I can move.

64
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,278
But Leader Duan is not in the city now.

65
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,438
Peng Ju is on the way to Jiangnan.

66
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,078
He hadn’t heard from you for a long time,

67
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,718
so he went there by himself.

68
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,718
It’s my fault.

69
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,838
Please punish me, Your Highness.

70
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,598
But you brought me
a piece of the Glazed Armor back,

71
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,558
which is not easy.

72
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,878
Good job. It’s almost the end of the year.

73
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,878
Please go home and have a good rest.

74
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,958
I’ll award you later.

75
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,278
If you hadn’t told me the truth,

76
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,198
I wouldn’t have know the key is hidden

77
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,358
in the Ghost Valley all these years

78
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,478
even though I’ve searched
every corner of the world.

79
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,798
Although I’m not very sure about it,

80
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,718
[Great Ambitions]
I’ve thought over it carefully that

81
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,358
if Gao Chong did collude
with the Ghost Valley,

82
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,318
then the three pieces of Glazed Armor he owns

83
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,278
were probably in the Ghost Valley.

84
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,198
And the one I lost
must have been stolen

85
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,798
by the Ghost Valley in the chaos.

86
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,958
If that’s the case,

87
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,198
once I take down the Ghost Valley,

88
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,638
I can pay His Highness back.

89
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,798
Well, very good.

90
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,798
The Glazed Armor has long been hidden
in the martial arts world.

91
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,798
The heroes in the martial arts world
are much more well-informed.

92
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:49,798
Then,

93
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:55,198
I’ll wait for your good news.

94
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,118
I won’t let you down, Officer Duan.

95
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,678
By the way,

96
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,358
I have a request for you, Officer Duan.

97
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,798
Gao Chong was headstrong enough

98
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,398
and cut one’s own throat.

99
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,598
But could High Highness please
show some mercy

100
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,838
and don’t blame the whole Five Lakes Alliance

101
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,318
because of the fault of Gao Chong?

102
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,718
Of course.

103
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,598
Let’s write off the past.

104
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,318
There are a lot of things in the future,

105
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:31,118
to count on your help in
the martial arts world.

106
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,318
Or, if His Highness appreciates you,

107
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,238
maybe we will have a chance to

108
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,798
become colleagues in the court.

109
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,078
Don’t flatter me.

110
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,438
Officer Duan,

111
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,358
you’re one of the outstanding talents

112
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,758
and have a promising future.

113
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,918
I’m just a humble boor.

114
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,398
I dare not share the same footing with you.

115
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,438
Prince Jin is seeking genius now.

116
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,558
If you can show your talent,

117
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,118
not only Chief of the martial arts world,

118
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,558
but the title of Marquis or Grand Tutor

119
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,078
are all at your choice.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,900
[To Prince Jin]

121
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,718
Scorpion,

122
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,558
you came at the right timing.

123
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,918
Have a drink with me.

124
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,158
Go and make a pot of tea for
my foster-father to sober up.

125
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,238
Yes.

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,998
Scorpion,

127
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,638
guess

128
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:04,038
who has the piece of Glazed Armor
of Long-tongued Ghost?

129
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,758
It’s in the Window of Heaven.

130
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:13,278
What a great coincidence!

131
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:18,598
The Window of Heaven and Prince Jin
are going to collaborate with me.

132
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,878
Isn’t that a bonus?

133
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,198
Prince Jin now has the power
in the Northwest

134
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,678
where he owns mighty armies
and excellent equipment.

135
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,438
That will be a big advantage

136
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,398
when I wipe out the Ghost Valley.

137
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,158
Scorpion,

138
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:42,518
are you still angry at me now?

139
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,638
You’re so stubborn.

140
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,038
Alright,

141
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,638
I’ll apologize.

142
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,998
I was wrong.

143
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,478
Let me pour a cup of tea for you.

144
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,558
Foster-Father, you saved me
and educated me.

145
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,638
You can either hit

146
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,198
or even kill me.

147
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,598
I won’t have any complaints.

148
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,758
I just want to know that

149
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,518
last time, you said

150
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,678
is I did something wrong,

151
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,238
you wouldn’t consider
our father-son relationship.

152
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,878
Those were just angry words.

153
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,798
You know what,

154
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,358
the closer people are,

155
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,718
like father and son, wife and husband,

156
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,038
the more likely they would
say such words to hurt each other.

157
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,478
Those words are not true.

158
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,518
I just want to know

159
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,878
that is one day,

160
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,318
I really made a mistake
and got you in trouble,

161
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,638
what would you do, Foster-Father?

162
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,278
Come here,

163
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,038
you little barbarian.

164
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,038
Since I picked you up back then,

165
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,918
we have depended on each other.

166
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,718
We have stuck together as one.

167
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,998
So,

168
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,278
whatever you meet in the future,

169
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,718
I’ll face it with you

170
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,438
and handle it with you.

171
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,118
Foster-Father,

172
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,678
are you serious and not lying?

173
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,038
Of course.

174
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,958
You got me.

175
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,278
Don’t worry.

176
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,478
By the way, Foster-Father,

177
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,438
you just said

178
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,838
Prince Jin would collaborate with you.

179
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,158
This is a good thing.

180
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,278
All you want is to change your fate,

181
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,318
and this is a perfect opportunity.

182
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,550
It’s a high-stake gamble.

183
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,678
There’s not much chance of winning so far.

184
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:14,598
We should keep negotiating with
Duan Peng Ju first.

185
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,878
As for the collaboration,

186
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,838
we’ll have a further discussion.

187
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,358
But Duan Peng Ju said 

188
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,158
that is we choose the right side,

189
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,318
you can be the Grand Tutor in the future.

190
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,478
But what if we back the wrong horse?

191
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,518
Prince Jin is plotting a treason.

192
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,678
Once it’s revealed,

193
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,078
the entire family of those involved
will be exterminated.

194
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,238
It’s unlike the fights in the martial arts world.

195
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,278
But I’m not afraid of that.

196
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,970
Foster-Father,

197
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,198
fortune comes from the danger.

198
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,198
If one day you become a prince

199
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:58,318
or the Grand Master,

200
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,598
no one in the martial arts world

201
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,758
would dare to say anything about us.

202
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,438
You’re so like me, Scorpion.

203
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,838
I...

204
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,518
If I am still a poor and ignorant youngster,

205
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,638
I’ll bet with him.

206
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,518
But I’m one step to the top.

207
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,358
Isn’t this bet too big?

208
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:33,198
Don’t act rashly.

209
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,638
Now all I want is stability.

210
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,838
I’m gonna maintain the current state
of the Window of Heaven first,

211
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,118
and then take action at the right time.

212
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:44,478
If Prince Jin is really going to succeed,

213
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,638
it’s not late for us to join him.

214
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,318
But at that time,

215
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,438
Prince Jin won’t lack people
who run to him.

216
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,638
Foster-Father,

217
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,198
I know you don’t want to
take the consequences,

218
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,918
and fear that this
will destroy your lifetime career.

219
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,438
But I’m not afraid.

220
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,118
I have nothing to lose.

221
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,438
I’d like to provide a plan

222
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,958
to make sure no worries bother you.

223
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,318
Say it.

224
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,038
You’ve never told the public

225
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,638
your relationship with the Scorpion.

226
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,038
People in the martial arts world think

227
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,398
we’re strangers to each other.

228
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,878
How about I pledge my loyalty to Prince Jin,

229
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,318
and gathering all pieces of Glazed Armor?

230
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,078
If we make it,

231
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,558
all the rewards will be yours, Foster-Father.

232
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,038
If not,

233
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,878
no matter what kind of penalty it is,

234
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,078
I’ll bear it alone.

235
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,358
And I won’t get you in trouble.

236
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,878
Your Highness, you really
have wonderful foresight.

237
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,838
[Noble Line]
Han Ying has the intention to betray you.

238
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,638
He sneaked into
your study room last night

239
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,918
and left after a long time of searching.

240
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,958
I sent someone to follow him secretly

241
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,318
as you order,

242
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,518
and found that he went to
the place of former leader, Zhou Zi Shu.

243
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,358
And he hasn’t come back yet.

244
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,078
Very good.

245
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,838
Your Highness,

246
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,358
should I arrest this traitor?

247
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,300
No,

248
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,758
keep following him closely.

249
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,678
With such a good fish bait,

250
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,598
there will be a lot of big fishes
rising to the bait.

251
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,238
You can leave now.

252
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,310
Yes.

253
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,758
Zi Shu, that’s the way you are.

254
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,918
Although you have left for so long,

255
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,558
there are still people working for you.

256
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,518
I’d like to see

257
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,878
how many alternative plans
you’ve prepared against me.

258
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:16,998
Leader.

259
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,358
I know why His Highness wants the Glazed Armor.

260
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,878
[Knowing everything in the world]
Your wound can be cured.

261
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,558
I’ll find all the Glazed Armors for you,

262
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,918
even risking my own life.

263
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,918
Old Duan,

264
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,438
you really deserve a spanking.

265
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,638
Coming to Jiangnan,

266
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,718
you didn’t come to meet me first,

267
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,558
but drunk with the Chief of
the Five Lakes Alliance instead.

268
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,158
Tell me.

269
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,038
How should I punish you?

270
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,318
My Bodhisattva,

271
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,478
I really didn’t know that
you had come to Yueyang as well.

272
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,558
I was thinking about going to Hu Prefecture

273
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,478
to visit you and Scorpion King
after finishing my work.

274
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:19,518
Prince Jin heard that Scorpion King’s
thaumaturgy has a new development.

275
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,518
He cares about that very much.

276
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,518
What your master really cares about is

277
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,718
that the Drug Men can help him to fight.

278
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,118
Yes, yes.

279
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,878
But my only concern is

280
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,438
the beautiful and charming

281
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,638
Bodhisattva.

282
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,558
Don’t think about it.

283
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,358
You haven’t been punished yet.

284
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,678
I deserve it.

285
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,078
How would you like to punish me,
 Bodhisattva?

286
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,878
I heard

287
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,918
that you’re getting along quite well with
Chief of the Five Lakes Alliance lately.

288
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,678
Old Duan, pardon me.

289
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,878
I’d like to have just a few words.

290
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,878
I won’t interrupt you two old lovers
catching up.

291
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,198
Scorpion King, this...

292
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,158
His Highness wants to find the Glazed Armor.

293
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,078
Why didn’t he ask me for help,

294
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,478
but turn to others instead?

295
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,870
[Easy and Breezy]

296
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,278
To the left a little bit.

297
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,598
To the left a little bit.

298
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,158
A little slanting.

299
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,878
To the right a little bit.

300
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,598
Yes, yes.

301
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,718
Yes, that’s okay.

302
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:56,438
Don’t listen to him.

303
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,758
He has poor sight.

304
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,478
If so,

305
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,838
I wouldn’t have been here now.

306
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,278
Paste it just like this.

307
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,718
It’s done, Master.

308
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,678
Master,

309
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,318
it’s more like a home now.

310
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,798
Little idiot, look at your happy face.

311
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,878
If you like doing it,
just paste it slowly.

312
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,438
There is a full tub of paste.

313
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,838
They should be pasted in every room.

314
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,078
Your martial uncle found

315
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:31,518
that the girl who sold the window
paper-cut was a beauty,

316
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,998
so he almost bought all the
paper-cuts from her.

317
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,158
Master, so many?

318
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:37,998
Cheng Ling,

319
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,718
it’s not that I don’t want to help you.

320
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,678
But there’s nothing I can do.

321
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,118
Cheng Ling,

322
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,678
don’t be gluttonous and lazy

323
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,238
like your master.

324
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:50,998
The beginning of a new year,

325
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,278
we need to do a thorough cleaning

326
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,278
to embrace the new year.

327
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,078
Okay.

328
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,118
Just eat your melon seeds.

329
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,758
You are so wordy.

330
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,878
I just can’t have a carefree life
like someone.

331
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,278
Cheng Ling.

332
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,770
[Five Lakes World Alliance]

333
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:30,638
Good, good.

334
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,678
Little brat, come here.

335
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,918
Get a knife and kill this chicken.

336
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,758
Martial Uncle, you want me to kill it?

337
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,038
Or you want it to kill you?

338
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:19,438
Hurry up.

339
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,198
The chicken needs longer time to be cooked.

340
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:22,518
Martial Uncle,

341
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,318
please give me another task.

342
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,478
I don’t dare to do it.

343
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,918
You don’t even dare to kill a chicken?

344
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,998
Both of you two are just slackers,

345
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,838
being gluttonous and lazy every day.

346
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,878
So you tricked me here to be your servant?

347
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:38,638
I don’t care.

348
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,278
This is New Year’s Eve dinner,
and you must participate in cooking.

349
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,958
I can’t move my hands.

350
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,438
My disciple will have to do it for me.

351
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,478
If you can’t, just don’t eat.

352
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,838
Master.

353
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,238
Believe in yourself.

354
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,238
Don’t move.

355
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,278
Don’t come here.

356
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,798
Master, help.

357
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,158
Ah Xu.

358
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,838
What a good disciple you’ve got!
He has never killed a chicken!

359
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,318
It’s real that everyone has his own fate.

360
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,158
That is luck.

361
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,678
His master takes all advantages
in this world,

362
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,358
but only without luck,

363
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,078
which is complementary.

364
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,398
Humans are very strange.

365
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,638
They wouldn’t live their lives normally
day by day.

366
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:26,238
Why did they set all those festivals?

367

Just showing they’re boring

368
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,838

around Master now.

Of course we should.

It’s the Chinese New Year.

377

How could we leave a young girl like you

alone here?

379

- Okay.

I don’t know the eating custom
of your hometown,

387
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,518
so I brought many kinds of food here.

388
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,238
There are jujube cakes and pumpkin pie,

389
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,518

which is fresh and hot.

I’ll cook them for you later.

394
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,478
There is so much food already.
There’s no need to cook the dumplings.

395

Do you think I am a glutton?

396
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,678
Sorry, Martial Uncle.

I thought there was no need to celebrate

and being the most powerful person
in the world

536
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,838
doesn’t mean anything.

and without anyone
to reassure the worries in the mind.

00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:04,958
Cheers.

551
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:05,958
Cheers.

552
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,558
Happy New Year!

553
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,050
[Qiyang Teahouse]

554
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,478
Three of the three points, four of the four points, six of the six points.

555
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,398
You lose.

556
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:39,918
Look how flustered you are.

557
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,238
You’re just thinking about
the fireworks.

558
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,278
You’re distracted so much.

559
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,478
Go and play.

560
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,038
Martial Uncle.

561
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,078
Breaking things make the next year auspicious.*
(* Lit: A Chinese homophonic pun)

562
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,318
Your master and I will take care of this.

563
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,198
Just go.

564
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,198
Out of the depth of misfortune
comes bliss.

565
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,798
This year must be a good year.

566
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,798
Drink the liquor you owed me first.

567
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,838
I’ll drink with you.

568
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,130
Cheers.

569
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,398
I don’t want to
leave all the liquor to you.

570
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:25,598
Here.

571
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:28,558
Master!

572
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:30,958
Master!

573
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,278
Master!

574
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,198
Master!

575
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:40,078
Cheng Ling, what’s wrong?

576
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,398
Master.

577
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,038
This man just jumped in
across the wall.

578
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:49,918
Han Ying.

579
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,358
Han Ying!

580
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,478
Martial Uncle, here.

581
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,598
Here, Brother Han.

582
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,798
Cheng Ling,
go and bring more braziers.

583
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:15,518
Ah Xu, come and help me.

584
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,198
Leader.

585
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,798
I’ve taken

586
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,078
the Glazed Armor back.

587
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,438
What do I need this for?

588
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,638
Didn’t I tell you

589
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,518
don’t take risks to do anything?

590
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:47,798
I’ve investigated that

591
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,398
the Yin Yang Book of the Healer Valley

592
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,478
can cure all the intractable diseases
in the world

593
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:55,518
by changing life with life
and converting Yin and Yang.

594
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,758
Forget it.

595
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,798
How did you find  this place?

596
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,958
What happened
since we separated in Yueyang?

597
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,358
In the Window of Heaven,

598
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,958
someone recognized you
at the Heroes Conference in Yueyang.

599
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:10,238
And I intercepted this.

600
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,398
After that,

601
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,038
at the moment
it was about to be disclosed,

602
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:15,918
I killed them all and

603
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,318
framed it to the Scorpion.

604
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,158
It was a pity that it could only

605
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,318
be hidden from Prince Jin temporarily.

606
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,918
And I was thinking
to find something useful

607
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,598
for you before my escape.

608
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,798
Then, I sneaked into
the study of Prince Jin

609
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:36,918
and found the secret
of the Glazed Armor.

610
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,358
It’s a pity that

611
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,638
I only found one piece
with all my efforts

612
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:46,918
when I was discovered
by the Window of Heaven.

613
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:50,918
It was lucky
that Xing Ming covered me,

614
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:53,438
so that I could escape from Jin Province.

615
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,438
Leader,

616
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,758
though we didn’t have the luck
to join Four Seasons Manor,

617
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:00,078
I’m willing to risk my life
to do anything for you

618
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,878
like all the seniors.

619
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,438
Who needs you to do that?

620
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:06,558
I just need you to live well.

621
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,398
The loyal servant wouldn’t
have two master in his life.

622
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,478
I’m your loyalist.

623
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,318
I ought to serve you when alive

624
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,318
and die for you when you die.

625
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,318
If you’re gone one day, Leader,

626
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:19,438
how could I live alone?

627
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,980
Leader,

628
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,438
there’s another thing
I need to tell you.

629
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,758
In Prince Jin’s study,

630
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,878
I found a secret letter.

631
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,158
Your father was killed secretly for

632
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:39,398
the charge of treason by

633
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,278
the former Prince Jin.

634
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,038
That’s impossible.

635
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,398
My father died of illness.

636
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,878
But that’s what it said in the letter.

637
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:53,558
Impossible.

638
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:56,238
My father was the best friend
of the former Prince Jin

639
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,678
and the trusted subordinate as well.

640
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,318
Where did you find that letter?

641
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,318
It was just on the desk of Prince Jin.

642
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,598
Ah Xu,

643
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,998
we can discuss this further.

644
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,758
Leader,

645
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,158
Young Master Wen,

646
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,878
if we find all the five pieces
of the Glazed Armor,

647
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,078
we can open the World’s Armory

648
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,038
and find the Yin Yang Book

649
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:28,398
of the Healer Valley.

650
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,038
Han Ying! Han Ying!

651
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,638
Hold on.

652
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,078
Let’s find all the Glazed Armor together,

653
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,398
so that we can open the Armory

654
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,798
and find the Yin Yang Book.

655
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:39,478
Hold on.

656
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,558
I didn’t expect

657
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:45,598
the first scene I see

658
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,678
when I come to Four Seasons Manor
is this.

659
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,358
Leader,

660
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:52,878
there is no regret for me that

661
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,598
I can die for you.

662
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:00,278
Leader,

663
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:02,318
take this.

664
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,278
It’s all my fault.

665
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,518
If I knew the Glazed Armor could
heal your earlier,

666
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,518
I’m willing to take whatever
to collect them all.

667
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,238
It’s a pity...

668
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,198
Han Ying!

669
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,638
Ah Xu, have you forgotten that

670
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,318
the Grand Wizard of South Xinjiang is coming?

671
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,078
Wu Xi is on the way
with Bei Yuan now.

672
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,398
Han Ying, hold on longer.

673
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:34,078
They will heal you definitely
when they arrive.

674
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,558
Lao Wen,

675
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,118
I’ll go down the mountain
and find Ping An,

676
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:38,838
and try to bring the Grand Wizard
back at the earliest.

677
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:40,158
Take care of Han Ying.

678
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:43,318
I’ll try my best
to keep Brother Han alive.

679
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:52,718
Brother Han, don’t worry.

680
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,118
No one can take your life away,

681
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,358
even if
the Guardians of the Netherworld come.
