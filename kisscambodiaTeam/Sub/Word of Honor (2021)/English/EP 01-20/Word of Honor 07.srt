was still alive,

00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:43,083
Our two nephews from the Zhang family

175
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,861

go through all this trouble

the Glazed Armor?

180
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,750
They must've tortured them

181
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:57,916
because they weren't able to find it,

182
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,750

and the children!

185
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,028
I just don't know what got into him

186
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,805
that made him so distant and quiet.

187

Alright, stop talking.

188
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,194
My heart aches.

189

What for?

213
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,583
I'll get straight to the point.

214
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,361
I came to the South

215
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,583
to investigate the Glazed Armor.

216
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,361
As the chief of the Five Lakes Alliance,
Chevalier Gao,

217
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,639
please tell me what you know.

218
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:26,750
The Glazed Armor is just a rumor

219
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,639
in the martial arts world.

220
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:30,750
Officer Han, don't believe
everything you hear.

221
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:33,639
An honest man does not lie.

222
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,916
Don't dodge my question.

223
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:40,416
If you tell me all that you know

224
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,639
about the Glazed Armor,

225
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,361
then the Window of Heaven
will owe you a favor.

00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:47,361
We will have many opportunities

227
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,639
to work together in the future.

229
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:54,194
I've heard about the reputation
of the Window of Heaven.

Now that I've met Commander Han,
I understand why.

233
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,361
Since the Window of Heaven
knows everything,

234
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,361
then why did you come to see me

235
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,528
for the Glazed Armor?

236
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,194
Doesn't that mean your reputation is fake?

237
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,028
I heard that the Five Lakes Alliance
is searching for

238

please leave then.

will treat you as our guest.

find out about the Glazed Armor?

552
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:30,416
It's great.

553
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,916
I like to fight too.

554
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:36,250
Then fight with me!

555
00:32:36,694 --> 00:32:38,194
How could I do that?

556
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:39,583
I can't fight you.

557
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:41,194
I never fight girls.

558
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:42,194
What do you mean?

559
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:43,194
Are you looking down upon me?

560
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,805
Don't think that I can't beat you!

561
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:45,972
That's not what I meant!

562
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:48,083
It's just that you're very beautiful,

563
00:32:48,194 --> 00:32:49,750
which makes me want to protect you.

564
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:52,028
How would I try to hurt you?

565
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,305
Don't eat that.

566
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:00,639
All the dishes are cold.

567
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,972
I'll ask them to make some new ones.

568

Miss...

569
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:03,805
That's all because you were too slow!

570
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:05,639
Then put in a new order.

571
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,139
Ah Xu, you want to drink again?

572
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,305
Are you addicted now?

573
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:28,472
This is where the martial artists gather.

574
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,028
If anything happens,

575
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,194
you can hear about it here.

576
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:34,694
Hear about it*? How?

579
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:09,471
Sir, what would you like?

580
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,361
Do you have fresh tea leaves
from this spring?

581
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:13,639
Sir, you must be joking.

582

With so many martial artists and heroes
here recently,

583
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,749
we serve all kinds of tea.

584
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,805
Which region's tea would you like?

585
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,528
Do you have that kind roasted with raw rice?

586
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:24,360
Not in the city.

587
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,472

imported by the government.

Philanthropist Wen.

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,193
Don't you know the commonly used code phrases

No, that's not it.

603
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,028

00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:06,694
Really?

620
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:09,250
Of course. He loves eating

00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:11,250
and talking like a literatus too!

622
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:12,472

00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,916
What, you look down upon maids?

631
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:43,750
No no, maids are great.

632
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:45,639
I thought that you were

00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,583
a disciple of a martial arts master,

634
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:50,916
or a daughter of a noble family.

635
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,750
I was afraid...

636
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,194
Afraid of what?

637
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,861
I... nothing.

638
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:59,028
I don't care if it's the Gentle Wind Sword Sect
or the Wind Stroke Sect.

I'm so sorry, so sorry.

647
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:21,916
So sorry.

648
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:32,472
Master, what does conveniently leave mean?

649
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:35,250
It's a nice way of saying scram.

650
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:37,139
Xiang.

651
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:38,583
Where did you meet

652
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,861
such a crafty and shallow person?

653
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:43,028
He mixed up Jiu Ge
and the Ode to Goddess of Luo River.

Qu Yuan is rolling in his grave.
(* Lit.: An ancient Chinese poet)

Who is Qu Yuan?
What does this have to do with him?

656
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:55,916
Come closer.

657
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:00,361
Either way, don't interact

658

659
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:02,916
do you hear me?

660
00:38:05,194 --> 00:38:06,694
I think he seems very cultured!

661
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:08,361
More so than me.

662
00:38:08,528 --> 00:38:09,305
Compared to you?

663
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,639
How come Sick Dude isn't here?

664
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,583
Where did he go?

665
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:20,028
Why are you asking about him?

666
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,583
What? Do you want him to marry you?

667
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,305
I don't dare.

668
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:28,916
He looks like he's nice,

669
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:31,472
but when no one's looking at him,

670
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,361
his glance is even scarier than a ghost's.

671
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,750
Really? Then why ask about him?

672
00:38:38,305 --> 00:38:40,028
I feel like when he's around,

673
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,083
you feel more like a person.

674
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,028
You look and sound like a decent person.

675
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,750
How could you dine and dash?

676
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,861
You're trying to pay with calligraphy?

677
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:57,583
Which famous scholar are you?

678
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,916
Waiter, please be quiet.

679
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:02,694
What happened? You don't have money?

680
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:03,639
No.

681
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:07,028
Young Master, you invited her to a meal
but have no money?

682
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,916
That's not right.

683
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:10,583
Don't worry, I have money!

684
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,472
How could you let a girl pay?

685
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,916
I will pay his bill.

686
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:20,194
Ah Xu, your wallet.

687
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,361
Where is your wallet?

688
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,416
One will often make careless mistakes.

689
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,861
When we were on the street,

690
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:35,916
I saw a handsome scholar.

691
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,750
He passed by me and even smiled at me.

692
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:43,361
Who knew that he could've been a friend,
but had to be a thief?

693
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:46,750
Was it a scholar in green

694
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,861
with long eyes and fair skin?

695
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,861
I saw him
in front of the calligraphy and paintings stand,

696
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:52,472
and we chatted for a bit.

697
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:53,639
It must be him!

698
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,305
He must have stolen my wallet.

699
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,472
Even you fell into Fang Bu Zhi's trap?

700
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,694
Fang...Fang Bu Zhi?

701
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:02,194
Fang Bu Zhi the Thief Master?

702
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,750
I got it. He stole my wallet!

703
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,639
A kind and weak scholar like me

704
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:13,139
always takes a beating
out in the martial arts world.

705
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,416
It's alright.

706
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,750
Ah Xu, give me your wallet.

707
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:19,972
No.

708
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,472
Why should I pay for you? We are not close.

709
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:28,472
Master, who is that? Just leave him.

710
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,472
I have money.

711
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:34,250
Xiang, don't get involved in matters

712
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,194
you shouldn't.

713
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,639
You... you...

714
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,472
You are...

715
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,583
You are...!

716
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,639
How about that?
Your master has good taste, right?

717
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,528
I told you, he's no ordinary treasure.

718
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:58,472
Sick Dude!

719
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,805
Your face is real?

720
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:07,194
Master, this is the first time
you're right!

721
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:09,805
Take your hands off.

722
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,416
Ah Xu.

723
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,250
How come you always attack me
when I touch you,

724
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:17,361
but you just let her touch you?

725
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:20,361
If you were a cute girl,

726
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:21,639
you could touch me too.

727
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:27,028
Masters.

728
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:28,639
Can you all pay first?

729
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,139
Then you can touch whomever you want,

730
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,694
however you want, okay?

731
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:35,194
Ah Xu, wallet.

732
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:46,916
I didn't expect our Ah Xu is a little millionaire.

733
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,194
Borrowing money comes with interest.

734
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:50,805
One percent every day.

735
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,972
Master, we don't need his money.
We have our own.

736
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,583
If you don't pay me back,
then I'll take the girl.

737
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:01,916
Xiang. If you stick your hands out again,

738
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:05,639
I promise that you won't just have money,
you'll also have trouble.

739
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:12,750
Thank you so much, Master!

740
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,361
I'll get your change right away.

741
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,639
No need.

742
00:42:16,028 --> 00:42:17,639
Bring me a full set

743
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,916
of your best banquet.

744
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:21,194
This master is very rich.

745
00:42:21,361 --> 00:42:24,305
He definitely won't try
to pay with calligraphy.

746
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,972
Okay! This way to the private room!
