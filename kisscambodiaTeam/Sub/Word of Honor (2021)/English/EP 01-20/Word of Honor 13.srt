00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,253
Long-tongued Ghost didn't lie to me.

184
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:46,253
Just you? Mount Hua Sect?

185
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,893
How dare you touch the Glazed Armor?

186
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:52,373
You have no proof.

187
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:54,733
The witness had died.

188
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:56,813
And you lost your evidence.

189
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,573
Just by your words

190
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:01,493
and its connection
with the Soul Winding Spell...

191
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,133
Even if the Mount Tai Sect
makes an accusation,

192
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,933
it's still hard to overthrow the chief of

193
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,933
the Five Lakes Alliance.

194
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:15,453
Elder Huang, I know another big secret.

195
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,813
It's enough to ruin the reputation of
Gao Chong and the Five Lakes Alliance.

196
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:21,133
Say it.

197
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:22,693
Twenty years ago,

198
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,133
the Five Lakes Alliance
with heroes around the world

199
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:26,933
had a crusade
against Rong Xuan, who had become a demon.

200
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:28,373
After Rong Xuan died,

201
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,373
the Five Lakes Alliance split the five pieces
of Glazed Armor among themselves secretly.

202
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:32,573
Each of them hid a piece.

203
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,053
Those heroes

204
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:37,373
didn't even know that
their sacrifices

205
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:39,173
were a waste of effort to fulfill the greed

206
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:40,373
of those people!

207
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:45,253
Elder Huang, many died
in the Beggar Gangs

208
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,333
not because of us, the Five Mount and
Sword Sects.

209
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,933
Once this is exposed,

210
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,493
the Five Lakes Alliance might not
collapse right away,

211
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,693
but they must lose the right to rule

212
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,333
the rest of the Glazed Armor.

213
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,253
In terms of morality and ability,

214
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,693
the Beggar Gangs are
most suitable

215
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:05,373
to lead the martial arts world.

216
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:09,053
By then, we shall force the Five Lakes Alliance
to hand over their Glazed Armor

217
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:12,933
and let the Beggar Gangs lead the heroes
to initiate a crusade against the Ghost Valley.

218
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:17,053
Even a coward

219
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,013
is turning his back on
the Five Lakes Alliance now.

220
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,373
The trend has changed.

221
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:25,373
Gao Chong is coming to an end.

222
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:32,893
[Good Luck Inn]

223
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:41,173
Ah Xu.

224
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:53,453
What are you doing?

225
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,133
Holy cow!

226
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,333
Why are you disguising yourself
suddenly?

227
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:03,253
Remove it.

228
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,493
Don't touch me.

229
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:07,453
Don't you talk to me with this face,

230
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:08,813
but in Ah Xu's voice.

231
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:09,613
It's so horrifying.

232
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,671
I'll have nightmares!

233
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,271
How manly I am.

234
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:15,751
How about...

235
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:17,791
I disguise myself like back then?

236
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:18,871
No.

237
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,071
This looks better.

238
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,831
I shall make myself handsome then.

239
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:26,991
You look the best as yourself.
Stop disguising yourself.

240
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:28,711
This is for you.

241
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,311
I don't need it.

242
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,631
My face

243
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,631
is the masterpiece of God.

244
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,111
You're ruining a treasure
if you stain it.

245
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,511
You'll be punished by God.

246
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,591
Jokes aside.

247
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,351
The Heroes Conference is being held soon.

248
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:50,431
Although Cheng Ling has handed in
his Glazed Armor,

249
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:53,351
Gao Chong hasn't announced it publicly.

250
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,351
So, many people might still

251
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:57,191
have their eyes on the orphan of
Zhang Family.

252
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:59,671
We were revealed.

253
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:01,831
The enemy are hiding themselves,
but we're exposed.

254
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,791
It's necessary to disguise ourselves.

255
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:06,191
Your face...

256
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,391
is too outstanding.

257
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:11,071
I don't need it.

258
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,151
Did I mishear you just now?

259
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:19,551
Ah Xu.

260
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:24,631
Finally,

261
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,671
you've admitted that I'm good-looking.

262
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:29,351
Don't worry.

263
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:32,031
I, Wen, am a troublesome forefather.

264
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,831
Every trouble will

265
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:35,751
avoid me.

266
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,031
Don't worry.

267
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,311
So, you're not pretending as
Philanthropist Wen now,

268
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:42,191
but a troublesome forefather?

269
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:43,911
Since when was I pretending?

270
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,391
I am a kindhearted man.

271
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,271
What is this for?

272
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,711
You applied this on your face?

273
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,031
This can change the structure of
a person's face.

274
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,631
For example, a person's nose or
cheekbones.

275
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:07,791
What about this?

276
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:09,511
Stop touching!

277
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:10,951
I want to know.

278
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,151
It's a hip pad.

279
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:17,991
What about this red one?

280
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,871
If you want to know everything,

281
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:24,711
why don't you kneel down

282
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,311
and pay your respect now?

283
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,631
Call me Master

284
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,391
and I'll teach you everything.

285
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,871
It's just an insignificant skill,

286
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:36,591
why be so cautious to pass it on?

287
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,631
So are you learning or not?

288
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:41,671
Let me ask you.

289
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:44,911
Can you really

290
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:47,991
transform yourself into anyone with this skill?

291
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,191
It's not hard to imitate

292
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:53,311
a person's appearance and voice.

293
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,271
But everyone has
their own speaking habits

294
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:58,591
and unique posture.

295
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,471
Everyone is different.

296
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:05,431
So, either you're very familiar
with the one who you're imitating,

297
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:08,551
or others are unfamiliar with the one

298
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:09,791
who you're imitating.

299
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:12,591
Otherwise, you'll be exposed easily.

300
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:14,911
I guess that if I imitate you,

301
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:17,671
your silly disciple will surely fall for it.

302
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:19,071
Just you?

303
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:22,151
How dare you imitate
my incomparable elegance?

304
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:55,951
The sea turned into a plain land.

305
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:01,231
The snow on the mountains
disappeared among the clouds.

306
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:07,751
Thousands of years in my eyes fading like dust,

307
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:16,631
yet my heart is still as before.

308
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,311
Why?

309
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:40,671
Make others do the dirty work.

310
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,991
Let those righteous men bite on each other.

311
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,431
Isn't that good?

312
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,031
I mean...

313
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:52,391
Why do you want me to do this?

314
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:55,711
Since you got out of the valley,

315
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,231
you often spied on this man.

316
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,231
Don't you think I don't know it.

317
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,791
Chief.

318
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:03,751
In this case,

319
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,271
you shall have a good look at him.

320
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:08,111
Die early and revive early.

321
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,031
I thought I have forgotten everything.

322
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,551
But I forget nothing.

323
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:27,671
I remember everything about you clearly

324
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,111
as if it was yesterday.

325
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:40,231

326
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,711

am here to welcome you, Sword Immortal.

331
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:18,831
Greetings, Sword Immortal.

How dare you?

Big Brother is here to welcome
Mount Changming Sword Immortal.

336
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,951
How dare you simply accept
my big brother's greetings?

337
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:39,511

338
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:42,551
He's... He's this young master.

You're Gao Chong?

340
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:50,440
So you're Shen Shen then.

341
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
How dare you brat call
my big brother's name?

Mount Changming Sword Immortal

351
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,320
swore with the first generation owner of
the Token of Honor

352
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,440
that once the Ghost Valley is bringing harm
to the martial arts world,

353
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,760
the person with the token can invite
the Sword Immortal out of his mountain

354
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,240
to demolish the ghosts and
wipe out the Ghost Valley.

355
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,960
Am I not here?

356
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,840
Young Master, the Heroes Conference is
being held soon.

357
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,160
Righteous men from the martial arts world
have gathered here

358
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,600
and discuss the ways to demolish
the Ghost Valley.

359
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,480
The Sword Immortal is a celestial master
and a famous senior.

360
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
It's good that you're here on behalf of
the Sword Immortal.

361

But...

362
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
But none of us promised to attend

363
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,000
the conference or anything, whatever.

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,960
is the end of Mount Qingya.

366
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
When you're done with your nonsense,

367
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,840
the Sword Immortal will keep his promise
and help the person with the token

368
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,680
to wipe out the Ghost Valley
at Mount Qingya.

369
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
Stop troubling me with other matters.

370
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
This man is young,

371
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,160
but why does he have such great power?

372
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,640
He looks unordinary

373
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,240
and firm.

374
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,960
Men of the Sword Immortal are indeed
unfathomable.

375
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,120
Sister Xiang.

376
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,560
You are...

377
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,960
Who are you?

378
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,160
Master?

379
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,720
I missed you very much.

380
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,760
Let me have a look at you.

381
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,520
It's been just a few days,
but you look exhausted.

382
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
Did you not rest well?

383
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
I can't sleep every day.

384
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,680
The Heroes Conference will
be held a few days later.

385
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
I am anxious.

386
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,040
A kid shouldn't be worried about this.

387
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,720
By then, you just have to show up,

388
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,840
prove that the Mirror Lake Sect
has not been put to an end yet

389
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
and demonstrate your devotion.

390
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
After that, I'll bring you away.

391
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,200
It's not too late to worry about the disputes

392
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,400
in this martial arts world
when you've grown up.

393
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,320
Master.

394
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,720
I don't know.

395
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,000
Uncle Gao came to me suddenly.

396
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,160
He was determined to
betroth Sister Xiao Lian to me,

397
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,240
so that she can help me support
the Mirror Lake Sword Sect in the future.

398
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,760
During the Heroes Conference,

399
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,360
he will announce this news.

400
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,320
When I'm older two years later,

401
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,880
we will have our wedding.

402
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,960
Master.

403
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,440
I've handed them the Glazed Armor.

404
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
Why is Uncle Gao still treating me well?

405
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
Actually, Sister Xiao Lian treats me well too.

406
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,520
If Uncle Gao really announces this news,

407
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,960
won't they be in an awkward situation

408
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,600
after I leave with you?

409
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,760
I didn't dare to refuse, either.

410
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,560
[Cheng Ling has handed over the Glazed Armor.]

411
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,400
[What's his worth to Gao Chong?]

412
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,760
So, I couldn't sleep the whole night.

413
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,840
Don't think too much for now.

414
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,280
We shall keep an eye on them.

415
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
No matter what,

416
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,480
I'll protect you secretly.

417
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,040
Master Zhang, are you done with your dinner?

418
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,680
Do you need anything else?

419
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,840
No... It's fine.

420
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,760
I'll go in and clean them up then.

421
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,800
I can clean them up by myself.

422
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,920
Alright.

423
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:55,448
[Gao Chong does not have a son.]

424
00:23:55,928 --> 00:23:57,808
[Gao Xiao Lian is his only daughter.]

425
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:01,608
[No matter what's his reason of
befriending Cheng Ling,]

426
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:03,728
[he doesn't have to do this.]

427
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:08,248
[Is Gao Chong converting himself?]

428
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,888
[He wants to make up for the mistakes
he had done to Rong Xuan?]

429
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:16,128
[Chongwu Palace]
[If I'm not mistaken,]

430
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,688
[Lao Wen is Rong Xuan's son.]

431
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:20,848
[I must find a chance]

432
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:22,768
[to resolve their grudges.]

433
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:30,848
[Luo Mansion]

434
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,408
[Frosted Dew]

435
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:34,088
So annoying.

436
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:35,648
They said that we are sisters forever,

437
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,248
but nobody's accompanying me to the toilet.

438
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,128
Kill them!

439
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:50,928
Yes!

440
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:01,648
[Luo Mansion]

441
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,488
Master.

442
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:23,808
I've searched through them.

443
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,128
None of them is alive.

444
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:25,888
[I'd say fall days excel the spring morns]
Good.

445
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:27,808
A total of 47 devils were killed.

446
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:28,968
Nice!

447
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,088
We finally released our anger!

448
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:31,888
Very good.

449
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:34,888
Everyone in the martial arts world
says that

450
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:37,128
the Ghost Valley is like a scourge.

451
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:38,288
Now I see

452
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,728
they are just a motley crowd.

453
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:41,888
How many casualties are there?

454
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:44,208
Unfortunately, four juniors died.

455
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,928
There are five with severe injuries
and four with minor injuries.

456
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:49,528
Big Brother.

457
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:57,368
All casualties were caused
by this demonic woman.

458
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:04,848
Owner of the List of the Unfaithful.
White hair and a red dress.

459
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,408
Are you Tragicomic Ghost?

460
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:09,888
Stop your rubbish.

461
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,408
Kill me if you have the capability!

462
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:14,408
How dare you?

463
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:17,208
Bring her back to the Five Lakes Alliance!

464
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:18,328
Watch her closely!

465
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:21,768
This demon's skull will be the sacrifice
of the Heroes Conference!

466
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:22,728
Yes.

467

[Upright and Auspicious Ethos]

468
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:02,688
Waiter.

469
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,408
Who is this man?

470
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:07,648
Sir, this guy is amazing.

471
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:08,848
He's so thin

472
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,968
seems he has an abyss in his stomach.

473
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:13,288
I wonder where have all the food gone.

474
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:16,088
He's really an incomparable foodie.

475
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:17,968
He has been eating for almost six hours.

476
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:19,088
Yes.

477
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:20,248
My legs are already numb.

478
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:22,648
Sir, aren't you tired of chewing?

479
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:24,488
No.

480
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:28,448
This man's appetite

481
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:31,448
can beat ours.

482
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:37,968
[This man looks young.]

483
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:41,288
[Why does he feel like
some peerless master?]

484
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,648
[Like a supreme master under the surface]

485
00:27:49,488 --> 00:27:50,448
I'm done.

486
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,648
Sir, you're finally done.

487
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:54,688
This... Can you pay now?

Who's treating me?

489
00:27:59,008 --> 00:27:59,808
What?

490
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,248
What did you say? Who's treating you?

491
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:09,768
I'll offer my help to whoever treats me.

492
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:11,808
I'll treat you!

493
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:12,568
Alright.

494
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:13,768
Alright.

Go.

Let's go.

502
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,937
Ye Bai Yi. Thank you for the meal.

Give me money.

505
00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:34,497
Wait a minute.

00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:36,857
Who's treating me the meal?

507
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,097
You can treat me.

508
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:40,977
But not you.

509
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:44,097
Brother, sorry for not knowing it.

510
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,057
Do we have to be qualified

511
00:28:46,337 --> 00:28:48,457
to treat you?

512
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:49,377
Of course not.

513
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:52,737
But I can't help you.

514
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:54,457
I haven't say it yet.

515
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:57,857
You're indeed dying because of yourself.

516
00:28:58,857 --> 00:29:01,577
But even a saint would have five symptoms
before his death.

517
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:02,737
It's miserable.

518
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,857
How can you, being a dying person,

519
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,337
wander around here?

520
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:11,457
The young excel the old.

521
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,097
There are more interesting people
in the Central Plain's martial arts world.

522
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:16,977
How about this?

523
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:18,857
I'll go back and think about it.

524
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,737
Why don't you treat me
some wine next time?

525
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:24,137
I might think of a solution.

530
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:14,737
Are you going to harm me?

You didn't die?

534
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,297
Of course I'm dead.

535
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:29,297
Your wife was superb in martial arts.

536
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,497
She hit me twice and stabbed me once.

537
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,857
How could I not die?

538
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:36,017
But the injuries weren't fatal.

539
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:39,257
Then your wife stripped and disfigured me,

540
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:41,857
and forced me in a parade
for three days.

541
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,017
She let everyone
in the martial arts world know that

542

I, Liu Qian Qiao the Green Siren,
was not only licentious and shameless,

543
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:48,897
but also a disfigured ugly woman.

544
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:54,377
Which woman in this world

545
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:56,497
can endure such embarrassment

546
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,257
and live secretively?

547
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,017
Qian Qiao, stop it.

548
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:02,977
I'm begging you. Can you stop?

549
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:05,137
Why?

550
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,417
I just mentioned it,

551
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:09,097
but you couldn't bear to hear it.

552
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:13,777
Then, what about the pain I've suffered

553
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,657
personally?

554
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:18,777
Feng.

555
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:20,177
Although I'm

556
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:22,497
a woman who doesn't deserve pity,

557
00:31:24,377 --> 00:31:26,017
why should I take all the blames

558
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,897
for both of our mistakes?

559
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:29,977
Qian Qiao.

560
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:34,257
I know that you hate and resent me.

561
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:35,897
I have nothing to say.

562
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:37,537
Even if you kill me,

563
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,737
my sin can't be offset.

564
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,737
But I'm begging you.
Can you stop saying it?

565
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,377
These years,

566
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,017
am I not suffering too?

567
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:55,497
I wanted to kill the evil woman and
take revenge for you.

568
00:31:55,777 --> 00:31:58,017
But after all, she gave birth to Tian Jie.

569
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:01,537
I wanted to commit suicide
and accompany you.

570
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,537
-But, I...
-Yes. You should have died.

571
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:04,177
Didn't you promise

572
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,897
to die together?

573
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:08,297
Look.

574
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:11,377
I'm already a ghost. What about you?

575
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:17,417
Qian Qiao.

576
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:21,977
But I think that I don't deserve to die.

577
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,857
I'd made you suffer so much.

578
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:28,377
I shall yearn for you ever day.

579
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:30,657
I shall suffer every day.

580
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:34,657
Qian Qiao. Since I've seen you today,

581
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,617
I have no resentment

582
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:40,497
even if I die now.

583
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:48,177
[The sea turned into a plain land.]

584
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:53,187
[The snow on the mountains
disappeared among the clouds.]

585
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,907
[Thousands of years in my eyes fading like dust,]

586
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:04,707
[yet my heart is still as before.]

587
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,147
[A sinful fate.]

588
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:11,787
Forget it, Feng.

589
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,627
You can't harm me. I knew it.

590
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,227
You know it too.

591
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:32,667
Leader Yu.

592
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:34,827
There will be a disaster

593
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,027
if you see a ghost during the daytime.

594
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:40,587
I, the Beauty Ghost, am here to
give an obituary notice.

595
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:43,667
Leader Yu.

596
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:45,627
You can never see

597
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:48,427
your wife's only son again.

598
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,147
How did my son die?

599
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,627
Did you kill him?

600
00:33:58,787 --> 00:33:59,707
I wanted to.

601
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:02,307
But I was too late.

602
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:07,507
The chief of the Ghost Valley saw your son

603
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:09,587
died of the Soul Winding Spell
personally.

604
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:10,866
Soul Winding Spell?

605
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:15,506
Do you mean the Hanged Ghost's
Soul Winding Spell?

606
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,507
It's the Ghost Valley.

607
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,707
Leader Yu, there's something you don't know.

608
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:23,347
Mount Qingya's Ghost Valley is back
in the martial arts world now

609
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:25,947
to capture the Hanged Ghost who defected.

610
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,506
Your son died of the Soul Winding Spell.

611
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:30,787
We have the same enemy.

612
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:34,306
That's why I'm here to
give an obituary notice.

613
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:37,946
It's better than making you suffer
for the rest of your life.

614
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:43,787
Qian Qiao.

615
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:47,187
I'm sorry.

616
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:49,827
I shouldn't have suspected you.

617
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:53,866
I know. No matter how is the world changing...

618
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:56,507
Even if everyone in this world
let me down,

619
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:58,707
you wouldn't harm me.

620
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,587
Qian Qiao.
I, Yu Qiu Feng, swear to God.

621
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:03,947
As long as you ask for it,

622
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,427
I'm willing to compensate you
with everything.

623
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:07,947
Qian Qiao.

624
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:13,067
Qian Qiao!

625
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:20,427
[Chief was right.]

626
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:23,067
[Die early and revive early.]

627
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:26,307
[I've died and cried,]

628
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,467
[but why can't I let this man go?]

629
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:31,907
[If this is the case,]

630
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:35,227
[I should have drunk the Water of Lethe.]

631
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:38,467
[Good Luck Inn]

632
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:39,707
Four! Four! Five!

633
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:40,707
Six! Six!

634
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,827
Ah Xu, you lost again.

635
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,427
It seems like you've lied about your

636
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:50,467
Invincible Hand of Jin.

637
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,387
If I knew that you're so lousy,

638
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,747
I wouldn't suggest to playing Truth or Dare.

639
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,187
It seems like I'm bullying you.

640
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:59,427
Say it. Truth or Dare?

641
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:01,427
Truth.

642
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:02,667
Alright.

643
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:04,787
I'll be serious then.

644
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,147
Let me ask you.

645
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:11,707
Today, the strange guy at the restaurant

646
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,467
said that you're dying because of yourself.

647
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:16,987
Is he talking about your old injuries?

648
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:21,227
Is this your question?

649
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,227
Of course not.

650
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:26,667
I want to ask, where did you get your injuries?

651
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,187
The promise you make when you drink is
just like a military command.

652
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:30,507
Don't you be a sore loser.

653
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:36,187
What if I say it was karma?

654
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:37,387
Will you believe me?

655
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:38,627
No.

656
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:41,867
I believe that we shall act
on behalf of Heaven.

657
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:44,547
If Heaven won't punish those criminals,
I will do it personally.

658
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,747
I've been alive for so long.

659
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:51,627
I've caused too many troubles.

660
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:54,427
Most probably I'll go to hell after I die.

661
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:55,827
So,

662
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:59,147
I shall atone for my sins
when I'm still alive.

663
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:02,147
I got my injuries because of my sins.

664
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,147
We must go through the Cauldron of Boiling Oil*.
(* Lit.: Punishment of hell)

665
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:07,067
Being fried for 80 years

666
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:09,627
is still better than being fried for 100 years.

667
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:14,027
Am I not there with you
in the Cauldron of Boiling Oil?

668
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,707
We shall get twisted into a Youtiao.

669
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,067
Won't that be nice and tasty?

670
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:22,236
Don't you get out of the topic.

671
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:23,956
This is not the answer.

672
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,516
I'm the one who caused my injuries.

673
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:32,596
Why?

674
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:35,956
That's another question.

675
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:37,316
If you want to know,

676
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,116
you shall win again.

677
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:42,436
Alright. I'm not afraid. Here we go!

678
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,596
-Eight! Eight!
-Five! Five!

679
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:45,716
-Six! Six!
-Six! Six!

680
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:46,916
-Four! Four!
-Three...

681
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,316
Don't you be a sore loser.

682
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:58,356
A sore loser?

683
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:01,356
I won't even mind paying you with my life.

684
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:03,476
Truth! Just ask.

685
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:05,836
Alright. I'll ask then.

686
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:07,716
You shall not lie to me.

687
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,396
Since when did I lie to you?

688
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:11,716
Lao Wen.

689
00:38:13,676 --> 00:38:15,156
Is your surname Rong?

690
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:19,916
You're Rong Xuan's son.

691
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:23,316
You blame the Five Lakes Alliance and
the whole martial arts world

692
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,716
on your father's death,

693
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,556
so you replicated many pieces of the Glazed Armor.

694
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:29,796
You wanted them to be punished

695
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:31,556
because of their greed.

696
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:34,276
I understand your feelings.

697
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:37,476
Lao Wen. But...

698
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:38,716
Is this your question?

699
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:39,716
No wonder.

700
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:42,316
So you play and drink with me

701
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:43,836
just because of this question.

702
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:46,356
Can't you just ask me?
Would I not give you an answer?

703
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:48,596
My surname is not Rong.

704
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:51,076
I'm angry that I didn't get a chance to see
the guy with the surname, Rong.

705
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:53,676
Otherwise, I would kill him whenever I see him.

706
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:58,396
Forget it. We're not chatting or drinking,

707
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:01,396
but provoking anger.

708
00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:13,596
[Was I wrong?]

709
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:16,676
[But Lao Wen's action]

710
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,356
[and his hatred on the Five Lakes Alliance...]

711
00:39:20,036 --> 00:39:21,836
[How could it make sense]

712
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:24,316
[if he's not the Rong Xuan's son?]

713
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:42,356
It's me. Ye Bai Yi.

714
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:44,116
Follow me.

715
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:08,316
You've treated me a meal,

716
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:10,076
so I have to do you a favor.

717
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,476
I found a way to heal your injuries.

718
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:13,716
But let's make it clear.

719
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,676
Don't you blame me if you die
during the treatment.

720
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:20,156
Brother, since when did I ask for your help?

721
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:31,556
Who exactly are you?

722
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,196
Invincible and traceless.

723
00:40:35,956 --> 00:40:37,116
You are the disciple of

724
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:38,836
the Four Seasons Manor's Qin Huai Zhang?

725
00:40:38,996 --> 00:40:39,716
You're right.

726
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:43,236
My master is Qin Huai Zhang.

727
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:45,756
Most people in the martial arts world

728
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,676
would call him Leader respectfully.

729
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:50,436
Respectfully?

730
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:51,836
How dare an immature guy

731
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,716
show off his experience and skills in front of me?

732
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,556
Come. Show me more of your skills.

733
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:58,876
Let me have a look at how good is

734
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,196
the disciple of that hothead,
Qin Huai Zhang.

735
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:01,956
Even if you're highly skilled
in martial arts

736
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:03,996
and that I can't defeat you,

737
00:41:04,276 --> 00:41:05,676
I would never allow others

738
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,276
to insult my deceased master.

739
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,356
What? Qin Huai Zhang died?

740
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:17,276
Right.

741
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:20,276
It's been so many years.

742
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,436
All of them had died.

743
00:41:25,156 --> 00:41:26,996
The martial arts world belongs to
the young men like you then.

744
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:30,076
You said that I was insulting him?

745
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:31,476
Let me tell you.

746
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:32,756
Even if Qin Huai Zhang is

747
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,436
standing in front of me

748
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:35,836
and I scold him in his face,

749
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,676
he wouldn't dare to make a single sound.

750
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,956
Please show me your skills.

751
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,716
Your master passed you his sword?

752
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:51,045
Let me have a look.

753
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,885
Idiot!

754
00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:56,805
Did you think that I would
snatch your sword?

755
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,325
What a silly thought!

756
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,525
You're the same as
your good-for-nothing master.

757
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,285
Didn't I tell you?

758
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:03,965
I'm Ye Bai Yi.

759
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,165
[Ye Bai Yi?]

760
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:07,925
[Bai Yi?]

761
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,245
[Is the inscription on the White Clothes Sword*?]
(* Lit.: Bai Yi means white clothes)

762
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,045
[White Clothes]
[this brother's name?]

763
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:16,085
[But the White Clothes Sword was made by
the Magic Craftsman a hundred years ago.]

764
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,485
[How old is he?]

765
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:39,125
I gifted this sword to your master.

766
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:41,085
The sword and its owner should be together.

767
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,405
Now its owner is gone.

768
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:45,645
But the sword is still here.

769
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:01,805
I didn't recognize you and was being rude.

770
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:03,325
I do apologize, Senior.

771
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:05,525
Since you're the disciple of
that dumb brat,

772
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:08,245
I can't simply cause your death when treating you.

773
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,245
Let me have a look at your injuries.

774
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:42,565
