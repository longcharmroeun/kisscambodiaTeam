188
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
you and Chief Gao are close.

189
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,110
Shouldn't we...

190
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,310
Shut up.

191
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,430
I said we're going back.

192
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,250
[Mo Huai Yang -
Leader of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect]

193
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Cheng Ling, eat first.

194
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,400
Thank you, Master.

195
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,350
Oh right, Master. Where's Uncle Wen?

196
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,400
You eat first.

197
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,280
He's outside.

198
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm going to find him.

199
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,350
Ah Xu.

200
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,230
I'm an evil person, right?

201
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,590
If your heart is kind,

202
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,830
you are not evil.

203
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,190
Are you only allowed to trick others?

204
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,560
It's embarrassing to be moody like this

205
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,350
just because someone else

206
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,040
tricked you for once.

207
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,310
You're worse than my disciple.

208
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,190
I made a big mistake this time.

209
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,640
I went to gloat at someone else's act,

210
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,680
but didn't expect

211
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,590
to be one of the actors myself.

212
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,280
Do you think

213
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,760
I was too smart for my own good?

214
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,230
You really know how to compliment yourself.

215
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,350
You were too dumb for your own good.

216
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,560
Officer Zhou, you're smart.

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You understand what happened?

218
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,350
This scheme progressed perfectly.

219
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,230
There must be someone
controlling from behind the scenes.

220
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,430
Maybe even more than one.

221
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,190
I can't tell

222
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,640
right now

223
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,560
what this person's end goal is.

224
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,190
Is it not for the Glazed Armor?

225
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,680
Not just that.

226
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,920
No matter what,
Gao Chong's reputation is ruined

227
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,640
and the Five Lakes Alliance is over.

228
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,920
Not necessarily.

229
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,950
Compared to Gao Chong,

230
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,000
Zhao Jing took a step back
at the most important moment.

231
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,070
He pretended he was weak

232
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,470
and moved the blame
off of himself completely.

233
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
I remember
in the Window of Heaven's records,

234
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,640
he had another nickname besides Sai Meng Chang*.
(* Lit.: Historical figure, known for bounty)

235
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,680
It was Zhao Xuan De*.
(* Lit.: Historical figure, driven to be a hero)

236
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,470
I didn't take note of it at that time,

237
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,110
but now as I think about it,

238
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,830
his act of crying and using morals

239
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,040
to win everyone over

240
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,560
were truly spectacular.

241
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
Zhao Xuan De?

242
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,040
Who gave him that nickname?

243
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,040
What a bad person.

244
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,590
Almost as bad as you.

245
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,830
I'm bad?

246
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,760
Philanthropist Wen.

247
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,230
I've always been nice to you.

248
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,760
Really?

249
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,880
How come I didn't know?

250
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,280
The truth is hard to find,
and a scheme is hard to plan.

251
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,110
No matter how hard a person tries

252
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,400
to balance each step,

253
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,070
they can't outsmart the heavens.

254
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,190
Breaking a carefully planned scheme

255
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,350
is very easy.

256
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,040
It might be because
of one person's betrayal,

257
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,800
or unexpected rain.

258
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,590
No matter how deep the scheme is,

259
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,160
there will be a day
when the truth is revealed.

260
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,800
As long as you have patience
to peel back the layers,

261
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,590
you will definitely

262
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,400
find the missing key.

263
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,110
That means a perfect scheme

264
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,160
changes and adapts to the situation.

265
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,950
What the person in control needs to do

266
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,710
is to clearly assess the situation,

267
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,560
and push things along at the right moment.

268
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,400
It's hard to read someone's heart,

269
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,280
but easy to control human nature.

270
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,110
Endless greed

271
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,520
is human nature.

272
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,230
This is an unarguable truth.

273
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,520
Lao Wen.

274
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,430
Don't keep thinking

275
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,920
that you understand human nature.

276
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,590
First it was the matter of Four Sages of Anji,
and now Gao Chong.

277
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,190
Have you not made enough mistakes?

278
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,950
Being mistakenly stubborn
will only harm yourself.

279
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,640
Human nature is greedy,

280
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,950
but can also be righteous and loyal.

281
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,110
What do you actually want?

282
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,880
If I tell you, will you help me?

283
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,230
I can only help you if you tell me.

284
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
I want...

285
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,710
I want the demons and monsters
that don't belong to this world

286
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,470
to all scram back to Hell!

287
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,190
With Gao Chong's martial arts,

288
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,880
he definitely could've escaped
and found a way out.

289
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,680
But who knew that he would

290
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,560
break down
and prove his innocence with death

291
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,830
after the Five Lakes Monument fell.

292
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,400
If you're no longer alive,

293
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,710
then haven't you lost everything?

294
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,000
Father, you really anticipated everything

295
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
and read him correctly.

296
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,920
A strong person is easily broken,
an innocent person is easily tainted.

297
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Gao Chong's baggage

298
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,560
burdened him for too many years.

299
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,800
I've also played this game
with him for twenty years.

300
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,110
There was only one straw left
before killing the camel's back.

301
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,160
And now,

302
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,520
I've accomplished everything I need to.

303
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,190
It's just a pity

304
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,950
that it didn't go perfectly.

305
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,680
What didn't go perfectly?

306
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,430
I thought I accounted for everything,

307
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
but didn't expect

308
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,470
Elder Huang to fool me

309
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,110
and have Tao Hong and Lv Liu
kidnap Gao Xiao Lian.

310
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,110
I've already sent people after them.

311
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Father. Should we kill Gao Xiao Lian?

312
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Of course not.

313
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,920
I want her to live,

314
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,920
and live well.

315
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,190
She is my living mascot.

316
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,190
The better she lives,

317
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,920
the more righteous and loyal I seem.

318
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay. I will listen to you.

319
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,400
You did very well this time.

320
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,070
If you didn't use sorcery

321
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,560
to completely muddle Deng Kuan,

322
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,800
it wouldn't have been so easy
to defeat Gao Chong.

323
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,310
But his disciples

324
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,280
are truly loyal.

325
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,110
Especially that Song Huai Ren.

326
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,230
I treated him so well,

327
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,520
but didn't expect him
to be a double agent.

328
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,830
I said before

329
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,520
that he wasn't a good person.

330
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,040
Father, you didn't believe me.

331
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,040
You even took him as your godchild.

332
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,880
You also argued and got mad at me

333
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
for that.

334
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,280
How about it? Do you see now?

335
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,680
Wasn't I correct?

336
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,230
Scorpion King, it's you? You scared me.

337
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,310
Did Father tell you to come?

338
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,230
Yes.

339
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,880
Give me the Glazed Armor.

340
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,800
Wait.

341
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,680
Do you have Father's
verbal order or token?

342
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,560
I already came in person.

343
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,470
What token do you need?

344
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,950
This is very important
and we can't make mistakes.

345
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,430
Father only told me
to steal this at night.

346
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,350
He never told me to give it to you.

347
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,350
What did you say?

348
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
Without the token,

349
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
I won't give this to you.

350
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,710
We are both Father's trusted assistants.

351
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,760
Only...

352
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,280
Never mind, you can leave.

353
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,230
Only one of us

354
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,070
can live.

355
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,710
How could I let someone

356
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,520
ruin my plans?

357
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,040
I can achieve the goals on my own.

358
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
Wasn't I right?

359
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,710
Good thing I killed Song Huai Ren.

360
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,160
Or else Father,

361
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,310
your Glazed Armor and plans
would've all been destroyed.

362
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,280
Alright, I was wrong.

363
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,070
Scorpion, I'm sorry.

364
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,310
From now on,

365
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,560
you are my only son.

366
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,950
Where is the Glazed Armor?

367
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,070
This is your trust in me.

368
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,000
I always keep it with me.

369
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,520
Scorpion.

370
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,040
My life and all that I have
are in your hands.

371
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,640
You are the only person I trust

372
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,310
in this world.

373
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,680
There is one more thing I need you to do.

374
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,920
Father, please go ahead.

375
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,560
We still need to comfort that idiot,
Mu Si Yuan.

376
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,950
We may need to use him later.

377
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,800
That idiot Mu Si Yuan

378
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,520
is bad at martial arts, dumb like a cow,

379
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,800
and ugly.

380
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,310
Why keep him around?

381
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Scorpion.

382
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,110
Think about a sheep herd.

383
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,350
A herd of sheep

384
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,920
will naturally and stupidly crowd together.

385
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,000
If one sheep leads the way,

386
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,880
the rest of the crowd will follow,

387
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,800
even if the lead sheep
is going into the wolves' den.

388
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,430
The Five Lakes Alliance is the sheep herd.

389
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,880
And Mu Si Yuan

390
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,680
is my chosen lead sheep.

391
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,190
I never think as far ahead as you.

392
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,280
Anyway,

393
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,040
I will always listen to you from now on.

394
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,590
As long as we work together,

395
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,310
the martial arts world

396
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,560
and the rest of the world

397
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,920
will be ours sooner or later.

398
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,110
Qin Huai Zhang's disciple.

399
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,920
Who knew that your martial arts was bad,
but you could run so quickly?

400
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,800
It took me a long time to find you.

401
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,710
Senior, we meet again.

402
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,430
What do you mean again?

403
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,070
I've been following you.

404
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,590
Except this person was such a nuisance.

405
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,350
He held me up, so I lost you.

406
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,470
Master.

407
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,190
Cheng Ling. This is Ye Bai Yi, Senior Ye.

408
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,800
Senior. This is my disciple, Cheng Ling.

409
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,230
Seems dumb.

410
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,640
Each generation is worse than before.

411
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,310
No matter how dumb my child is,

412
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,350
he's still better

413
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,230
than those old monsters
who can't speak properly.

414
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,230
Your child?

415
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,920
What? Are you also from
the Four Seasons Manor?

416
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,760
Let me go!

417
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,350
Who's in there?

418
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,470
Who do you want to be in there?

419
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,280
You.

420
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,350
Then it's definitely not
whom you're hoping for.

421
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,640
Alright.

422
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,040
You weaker-than-a-boy-toy

423
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,920
old toad monster.

424
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,280
Who do you think you are,

425
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,560
fighting against me? Let's fight outside.

426
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
Ah Xu, don't stop me.

427
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,520
Wait a minute.

428
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's go!

429
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,560
Let it go.

430
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,230
Senior Ye. It's raining outside.

431
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,950
Can you two pick a clearer day to fight?

432
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Lao Wen.

433
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
Let me go.

434
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,270
Let me go.

435
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,710
Little idiot. Who did you think
was in there?

436
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,590
I thought it was Sister Xiao Lian.

437
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,400
Cheng Ling.

438
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,950
They need to use her
to find the Glazed Armor.

439
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,160
As long as that holds true,

440
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,800
they won't harm her.

441
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,160
We have time to rescue her.

442
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,760
I almost forgot.

443
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,470
Ah Xu still has a disciple-in-law

444
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,710
lost out there.

445
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,830
Of course we need to rescue her.

446
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,000
Young Leader Long.

447
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,710
Brother Huang.

448
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,310
How did it go?

449
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,000
We went through all that trouble
for nothing.

450
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,830
At least we still have the girl.

451
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,520
Let me think about whether we should
use her to negotiate with Zhao Jing

452
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,230
or trick that idiot Shen Shen.

453
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,880
Who has the Glazed Armor?

454
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,800
No one.

455
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,190
No one?

456
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,800
Before that bastard died,

457
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,880
he said that he destroyed
the Glazed Armor.

458
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,640
I don't believe that.

459
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,830
But he really didn't have it with him.

460
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,950
How could it disappear?

461
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,560
What did we do all this for?

462
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,310
Where is Gao Chong's corpse?

463
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,470
Did the Five Lakes Alliance take it back?

464
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,760
Corpse?

465
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,350
What corpse?

466
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,160
All those crazy dogs tore it apart.

467
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,160
But the Glazed Armor really wasn't there.

468
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:34,400
[Chongwu Palace]

469
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,280
Fifth Brother!

470
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,190
Fifth Brother!

471
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,880
Fifth Brother!

472
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,400
Fifth Brother, where are you going?

473
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,000
Big Brother had just died.

474
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,400
Are you going to leave this mess for me?

475
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,310
Why should I stay?

476
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,000
What dignity do I have left to stay?

477
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,360
If I didn't create trouble,

478
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,430
Big Brother wouldn't have...

479
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,710
Fifth Brother. Among the five brothers,

480
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,040
we are the only brothers left now.

481
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,000
If you leave,

482
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,040
the Five Lakes Alliance is really over.

483
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,320
Xiao Lian is still lost.

484
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,430
Before he died, Big Brother told me

485
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,710
to bring Xiao Lain back safely.

486
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,390
Everyone in the Alliance
will look for her.

487
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Yao Zhi went to search as well.

488
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,080
Listen to me. Don't go.

489
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,470
The Five Lakes Alliance
can't be without a leader.

490
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,710
Stay!

491
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,760
It's better

492
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,600
for me to leave.

493
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,360
If I can find Xiao Lian,

494
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,520
I will bring her to the bamboo forest
on Mount Dagu,

495
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,360
and never come back to this place of sorrow.

496
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,600
Second Brother.

497
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,230
The Five Lakes Alliance

498
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
rests upon your shoulders.

499
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,360
I'm useless.

500
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,670
I'm sorry.

501
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Father.

502
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,910
You're going to just let him go?

503
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,800
The Glazed Armor...

504
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,670
Gao Chong was smart and conniving.

505
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,630
He anticipated a rebellion
at the Heroes Conference

506
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,000
and was afraid
that Shen Shen would die,

507
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,910
so kept the Glazed Armor himself.

508
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,950
Who cares if that's true or not?

509
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,910
Let me catch up and kill him.

510
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,120
Absolutely not.

511
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,910
I need Shen Shen to stay alive.

512
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,120
If you act on your own,

513
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,760
don't blame me for being heartless.

514
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,910
Yes.

515
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,760
You need to understand my intentions.

516
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,150
I waited all my life

517
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,630
to finally be successful.

518
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,760
If I don't have an old friend
as a witness,

519
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,230
then it'd be as if I was hiding

520
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,910
in the dark all this time.

521
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,600
I can bear witness for you, Father.

522
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,390
You don't count.

523
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,670
We are family and like one.

524
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,150
You are not an outsider.

525
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,800
Here.

526
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,120
Everyone on this list needs to be killed.

527
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,470
Use a cruel method,

528
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,150
and don't leave anyone alive.

529
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,040
Scorpion, I want you to understand

530
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,000
that greed is not the only thing
that controls the human heart.

531
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
Then what else?

532
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,120
Father, please teach me.

533
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,190
Fear.

534
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,360
Qin Huai Zhang's disciple,
do you have food?

535
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,630
Senior, I have a name.

536
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,470
I'll call you whatever I want.

537
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,470
Stop saying nonsense.

538
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
You're right, Senior.

539
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,520
I'm right?

540
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,710
Where's the food?

541
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,120
What's this?

542
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,040
Is this for humans?

543
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,600
Cheng Ling.

544
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,040
Did your family have a copy
of Origin of Chinese Characters of the 40 Scroll?

545
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,630
I... I think so.

546
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,760
Then was his face the picture next to the idiom

547
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,360
"hated by immortals and devils"?

548
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,000
I heard earlier

549
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,150
that someone wanted to find the truth,

550
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,600
got tricked by others,

551
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,320
and even helped them in their scheme.

552
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,080
Do you have no shame
yelling here right now?

553
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,190
Hey boy.

554
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,150
On that dictionary collected by your family,

555
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,600
there must be his face

556
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,150
next to "laughingstock", right?

557
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,670
You want to find the truth?

558
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,910
Do you think the truth itself

559
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
will just come to you?

560
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,360
Did you go to find the truth?

561
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,280
Do you know where to find it?

562
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,150
Can you even find it?

563
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,000
You!

564
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,470
Senior, please teach us.

565
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,560
Do you think Gao Chong

566
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,950
tried so hard to invite this boy

567
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,040
just so he could say a few words

568
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,000
at the Heroes Conference?

569
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,910
His father leads the Longyuan Cabinet.

570
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,360
They're basically a theater troupe.

571
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,710
But the "Leader
of the Longyuan Cabinet" title

572
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,150
is worth nothing now.

573
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,600
What use does he have?

574
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,000
Old monster, stop with the suspense.

575
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,600
Why did you capture him?

576
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,600
Shut up, you little idiot.

577
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,840
He's the key.

578
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,080
Key?

579
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,840
Don't you want to know

580
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
what happened

581
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,190
to Rong Xuan and the Glazed Armor
20 years ago?

582
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,190
Longyuan Cabinet is the key to the past.

583
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,320
Why would I

584
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,320
want to know about Rong Xuan
and the Glazed Armor?

585
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,520
When you're as old as me,

586
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,670
you'll know why.

587
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,470
It's not always difficult to find out

588
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,000
what someone else wants.

589
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,960

594
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,920

♪The spring breeze
brings greenery along the river♪

596
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,560
♪But can't warm my cold heart♪

597

♪Give up the adventures on horseback
for a peaceful quiet life♪

601
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,400
♪The lights of ten thousand families
light up the world♪

602
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,960

in a sandstorm♪

enjoying my life with you♪
