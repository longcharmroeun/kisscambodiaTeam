[Episode 15]

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,590
Eldest Senior,
tomorrow is the Heroes Conference.

24
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,720
Dad said

25
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,270
he will announce

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,080
Brother Cheng Ling and my marriage
at the Conference.

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,520
I can't disobey my Father's orders.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,110
If one day you wake up,

29
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,030
will you blame me?

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,880
Who is it?

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,910
Oh, it's you, Xiang.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,360
What happened to you?

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,160
What happened?

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,750
Why are your hands so hot?

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
Hurry up and lie down.

36
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,800
Why were you so careless?

37
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,960
Be careful.

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,960
Slowly.

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,550
Silly Xiang.

40
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,830
You should be more careful.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
This close,

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
I can surely freeze her with the Unfaithful Nail

43
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,320
Sister Qian Qiao gave me.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,470
It does feel a bit hot.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,910
Don't go. Don't go.

46
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,470
Okay, let me check your pulse.

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,720
Gu Xiang, Gu Xiang.

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,030
Don't panic. I have to freeze her in one move.

49
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,160
Only then will I have the chance
to exchange her for Aunt Luo.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,550
Xiang! Xiang!

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,880
Xiang!

52
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,750
Xiang!

53
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,910
They said you are sick and came to see the doctor.

54
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,830
What's wrong?

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,110
How did you get sick all of a sudden?

56
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,270
Sister Xiao Lian, is it serious?

57
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,720
Not particularly.

58
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,190
I'll fetch her some medicine.

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,470
Xiang.

60
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,800
Go away, go away. Don't touch me.

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,910
What are you doing, Cao Wei Ning?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,670
I...

63
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,080
I wasn't doing anything.

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,600
I bought you some snacks.

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,800
Holy crap, he's so clingy.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,080
Why did he have to choose

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,080
this moment to barge in?

68
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,830
Xiang, the medicine will be bitter.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,190
Here, have something sweet.

70
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,390
No.

71
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,670
I don't want it!

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,440
It's delicious!

73
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,670
Try it.

74
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,630
Really! Look!

75
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,110
It's delicious.

76
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,800
From now on,

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,950
if Mount Tai Sect has any demands,

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,790
the Five Lakes Alliance will spare no effort
to comply, even at the expense of our own life.

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,920
Very well.

80
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,270
Mount Tai Sect's only request

81
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,640
is for the Five Lakes Alliance
to punish the murderer immediately!

82
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,390
Punish the murderer!

83
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,440
Yes, punish the murderer!

84
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,550
Punish the murderer! Punish the murderer!

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
Of course the murderer must be punished.

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,950
As long as everyone works together,

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
we'll catch the demon of Ghost Valley

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,920
and cut him into a thousand pieces

89
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,790
to comfort the spirit of Brother Ao Lai Zi!

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
You are messing around!

91
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,200
He killed my master!

92
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,550
Did you see Leader Shen kill him
with your own eyes?

93
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,110
Or did you see Leader Shen order his murder
with your own eyes?

94
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,950
So you saw neither, did you?

95
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,760
Everyone knows

96
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,720
that Senior Ao Lai Zi was killed
by the Ghost Valley.

97
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,790
Many friends and families

98
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,830
of the martial arts world

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,230
have been murdered by the Ghost Valley.

100
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,110
The reason I
arranged the Heroes Conference here

101
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,600
is to avenge the dead!

102
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,040
But everyone, you must remember,

103
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,640
do not fall for the instigation of others!

104
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,830
Do not fall into chaos!

105
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,790
Or else, you will step
right into the trap of the evildoers!

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,950
Elder Huang, what do you think?

107
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,670
You're right.

108
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
The most important thing right now

109
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,110
is to crusade against the Ghost Valley!

110
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,790
The lost Glazed Armor of Senior Ao Lai Zi

111
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,270
has most likely fallen into the hands
of the murderer from Ghost Valley.

112
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,950
As the saying goes,
evil does not suppress righteousness!

113
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,550
The Five Lakes Alliance
will destroy the Ghost Valley

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,390
and return peace to the martial arts world!

115
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,480
Crusade against the Ghost Valley,
restore peace of the martial arts world!

116
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,320
Crusade against the Ghost Valley,
restore peace of the martial arts world!

117
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,390
Crusade against the Ghost Valley,
restore peace of the martial arts world!

118
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,670
That Gao is quite eloquent.

119
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,830
Crusade against the Ghost Valley,
restore peace of the martial arts world!

120
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,760
Crusade against the Ghost Valley,
restore peace of the martial arts world!

121
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,000
Crusade against the Ghost Valley,
restore peace of the martial arts world!

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
[Five Lakes Alliance]

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
Chief Gao.

124
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,200
A few days ago at Renyi Hall, you promised

125
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,480
to explain the whole story
behind the Glazed Armor

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,200
to everyone at the Heroes Conference.

127
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Over half of the heroes
who join the Conference are here.

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,950
When are you going to tell us the truth?

129
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,350
Huang He.

130
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,040
Do you want to know the truth
about the Glazed Armor

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,670
or do you want to know the whereabouts of it?

132
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,550
So what if I do?

133
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,670
Don't the present heroes

134
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,480
deserve to know the truth?

135
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,440
That's right!

136
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,200
That is the reason why
the Iron Fist Clan came here today!

137
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,200
The Iron Fist Clan bore the brunt
of the Battle of Mount Qingya.

138
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,600
We suffered heavy casualties.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,070
Chief Gao.

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,880
You still owe us an explanation!

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,720
[Leader of the Eagle Claw Clan]
Chief Gao!

142
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,600
I lost an eye on Mount Qingya,

143
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,510
and a son!

144
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,670
I paid such a high price,

145
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,790
yet did not garner the lost secrets
of my Eagle Claw Clan.

146
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,480
Isn't it at least enough to ask
the Five Lakes Alliance for the truth?

147
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,510
Chief Gao! Give us an explanation!

148
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,040
Give us an explanation!

149
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Explain yourself!

150
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,550
Hurry up, explain yourself!

151
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,160
Give us an explanation!

152
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,880
Friend.

153
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,350
Where are you going?

154
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,920
It's you?

155
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,920
Scorpion?

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,040
Fine. I shall tell you the truth today.

157
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,640
The Glazed Armor is in
the possession of the Five Lakes Alliance.

158
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,110
Big Brother!

159
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,200
The Five Lakes Alliance did everything

160
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,000
for nothing more than the peace of the world,

161
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,230
the tranquility of the martial arts world!

162
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,550
It's because the martial arts world
has suffered heavily

163
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,910
after the Battle of Mount Qingya

164
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,520
and can't withstand even bigger calamity,

165
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,000
that we five brothers divided
the Glazed Armor between us

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,400
to secretly protect them

167
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,840
and wait for the right moment!

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,670
Chief Gao!

169
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,350
You make it sound so reasonable,
as if that's your only choice!

170
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,280
The World's Armory collected secret records
of martial arts from all over the world.

171
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,640
What right does the Five Lakes Alliance have

172
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,910
to keep the heroes of the world in the dark?

173
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,000
Chief Gao!

174
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,960
Everyone of us contributed
to defeating Rong Xuan!

175
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,440
[Leader of the Funiu Sect]
How could you keep the Glazed Armor in secret?

176
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,030
What right do you have?

177
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,590
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

178
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,200
We will redistribute it!

179
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,200
Hand over the Glazed Armor! Redistribute it!

180
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,960
Hand over the Glazed Armor at once!

181
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,840
Dear heroes, please listen to what I have to say!

182
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,400
Years ago, the Glazed Armor
caused great blood-shed

183
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,960
among the martial arts world!

184
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,030
It almost caused a catastrophe!

185
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,590
Right now in Yueyang City,

186
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,280
the fake pieces of Glazed Armor are being spread
by the wicked.

187
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,000
It once again caused countless deaths
and injuries throughout the martial arts world!

188
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,880
This item is a curse to the martial arts world!

189
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,910
Chief Gao, stop being a hypocrite!

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,350
The turmoil within the martial arts world
20 years ago

191
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,440
and the dispute caused by
the fake Glazed Armor right now

192
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,550
were both planned by your Five Lakes Alliance,
weren't they?

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,150
Tell me, only someone who is
very familiar with the Glazed Armor

194
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
could have made
such real-looking fake ones, right?

195
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,320
What are you trying to say?

196
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,960
You keep slandering Chief Gao!

197
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,960
What is your purpose?

198
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,280
What do you mean?

199
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,640
[Disciple of the Twelve Chain Cove]
Did Five Lakes Alliance make fake Glazed Armor?

200
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,150
How vicious!

201
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,440
Feng Xiao Feng! You're full of nonsense!

202
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,080
Feng Xiao Feng, shut your mouth!

203
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,550
If you dare spread any more rumors,

204
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,400
I will kill you!

205
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,640
Feng Xiao Feng! You'll be the first one I kill!

206
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,520
Come the hell down.

207
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,760
Ah Xu.

208
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Just say come down,

209
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,880
you don't need to be so rude.

210
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,790
As if I would dare to disobey you.

211
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,910
Ah Xu, it's good you came.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Drink.

213
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,550
Where did you run off to?

214
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,550
I saw Pretty Arhat just now.

215
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,880
With Scorpion involved in this whole matter,

216
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,520
nothing good will come of it.

217
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,030
Things are bad

218
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,080
wether Scorpion is involved or not.

219
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,840
As long as the fire doesn't reach our Cheng Ling,

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,230
what does it matter to us?

221
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,760
I was thinking about

222
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,230
how Scorpion abducted Cheng Ling back then.

223
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,110
There's something strange about it.

224
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,960
Wasn't that for the Glazed Armor?

225
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,840
Ah Xu, don't worry about it.

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,910
Just relax and watch the show.

227
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,280
If you ask me,

228
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,440
this big show of Chief Gao
fighting the heroes with his words

229
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,590
will entail a shocking twist.

230
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,350
Let's wait for the brilliant performance.

231
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,640
Soon he will rise up high,

232
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,960
soon he will feast on his guests,

233
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,150
soon his rostrum will collapse.

234
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,760
Gao Chong, the Beggar Gangs,
the Ghost Valley, the Window of Heaven.

235
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,840
And the Scorpion.

236
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,110
From beginning to end,

237
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,840
in this fight for the Glazed Armor,

238
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,550
the shadow of the Scorpion has always been there.

239
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,320
What role does the Scorpion play in this?

240
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,110
When you know where to stop, you have stability.

241
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,110
When you have stability, you can be tranquil.

242
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,400
Father.

243
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,110
Everything you planned has been arranged.

244
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,150
It's your turn now.

245
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,590
It's time to end it.

246
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,520
If I'm right,

247
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,590
The Ghost Valley and the Scorpion
must have joined hands.

248
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,400
The incident of the theater corpses

249
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,470
harbors the shadow of Scorpion's assassin
Qin Song.

250
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,000
And the strange Drug Men driven by evil spirits

251
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,880
at the Zhao Family's coffin home

252
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,880
also appeared in large numbers
at the base of the Scorpion.

253
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,280
Lao Wen.

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,280
Someone is manipulating
the show behind the scenes.

255
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,230
This person is scheming with malicious intent.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,960
Is that not good?

257
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,710
It's precisely because there are

258
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,710
so many twists and turns
created by those self-conceited,

259
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,110
that you and I have such a wonderful time
watching it play out.

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,080
What you call a wonderful time

261
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,150
entails the blood of innocent people.

262
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,440
Is that what you wish to see?

263
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Innocent?

264
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,470
Which of these people
dare call himself innocent?

265
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,000
But Ah Xu, you are right.

266
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,000
This kind of exciting blood-filled play

267
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,760
of starving animals fighting over food
is exactly what I want to see.

268
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,640
You go on and on about the Ghost Valley!

269
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,910
Stop beating around the bush!

270
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,030
Chief Gao, please take out the Glazed Armor!

271
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,440
Open the Armory!

272
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,880
Every sect will get back their
secret records that are lost!

273
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,880
Then we shall fight against the Ghost Valley!

274
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,670
Wouldn't that be perfect?

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,550
Open the Armory! Hand over the Glazed Armor!

276
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,230
Open the Armory! Hand over the Glazed Armor!

277
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,350
Open the Armory! Hand over the Glazed Armor!

278
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,550
Everyone!

279
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,550
It's not that I am unwilling
to hand over the Glazed Armor.

280
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Even if I hand it over,

281
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,880
I couldn't open the gate to the Armory!

282
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,000
Enough!

283
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,110
Stop telling us one lie after another!

284
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,590
We've heard enough!

285
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

286
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,400
Chief Gao is quite clever and fickle!

287
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,710
There's someone who can testify for me!

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,320
Let me see what tricks you have left.

289
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,320
Put her down!

290
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,960
Whatever, take this woman away!

291
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,960
Master.

292
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,590
Go!

293
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,350
Let's go.

294
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,470
How strange. Why haven't I seen anyone on the way?

295
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,440
Where are the disciples on patrol?

296
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,440
[Worship of Literature]

297
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,520
So strange. How come all the people here are gone?

298
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,000
Where did the doctor and pharmacist go?

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,760
Miss Gao, come with me!

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,350
You go first, I'll stop them!

301
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,000
As if you could!

302
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,960
Brother Cao!

303
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,110
You old witch! How dare you hurt him!

304
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,400
Watch out!

305
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,070
Brother Cao! Brother Cao!

306
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,830
Wei Ning!

307
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,280
Brother Cao!

308
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,350
Don't die!

309
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,760
I don't want to owe you my life for nothing!

310
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,040
Oh right!

311
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,400
Why did I choose you in the first place?

312
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,640
If I knew, I would have found another way

313
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
to get inside Yueyang Sect.

314
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,640
Why did you treat me so well?

315
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,520
Silly girl.

316
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,950
Are you really going to waste
the lifesaver I gave you like this?

317
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Aunt Luo?

318
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,190
[Young Leader of the Longyuan Cabinet, Long Xiao]

319
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,110
Who is this person?

320
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,830
He is...

321
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,040
Didn't you see the carriage's mechanism?

322
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,470
That must be
the legendary Leader of the Longyuan Cabinet.

323
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,590
He is the only one

324
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,310
who can create

325
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,430
such brilliant mechanics.

326
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,190
In the old days, even the emperor
showed Longyuan Cabinet his respect.

327
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,950
There were rumors 20 years ago
in the martial arts world

328
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,520
that Longyuan Cabinet can open the Armory.

329
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,400
Open the Armory?

330
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,880
Leader of the Longyuan Cabinet
is an old man!

331
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,830
Who is this kid?

332
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,190
I think you all recognize him now.

333
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,350
This is Long Xiao,
the Young Leader of Longyuan Cabinet,

334
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,880
the one and only Master of Mechanics.

335
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,160
I invited him here today

336
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,160
so he can tell everyone

337
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
the whole story behind the Armory!

338
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,310
Chief Gao is right.

339
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
No one knows the story behind the Armory

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,190
better than my father, Ban Zhu Ge,

341
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,400
Long Que.

342
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,470
The demon Rong Xuan relied on clever means

343
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,710
to steal countless secret records of martial arts

344
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,280
of various sects.

345
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,190
He knew he has committed many wrongdoings.

346
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,800
For fear that others will steal from him,

347
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,520
he deceived my father and tricked him

348
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,280
into designing the World's Armory for him.

349
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Young Leader Long.

350
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,350
Gao Chong just said

351
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,230
that even with the Glazed Armor,
the Armory cannot be opened.

352
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,230
What the hell is this nonsense?

353
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,520
Chief Gao is right.

354
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,000
The Armory is highly complex.

355
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,590
It is indeed impossible to open it safely
with the Glazed Armor alone.

356
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,160
Just tell us, can you open the Armory or not?

357
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,830
Yeah, can you open the Armory?

358
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
I am sorry to disappoint you.

359
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,000
I did not inherit the true teachings of my Father.

360
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,190
I cannot open the Armory.

361
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,880
Can't open it? Then stop wasting our time!

362
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,350
However, the mechanics
were designed by my father.

363
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,000
He must know how to open it.

364
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,560
Chief Gao.

365
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,830
I came here in person today

366
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,590
to convey my father's attitude to you

367
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,830
with everyone as my witness.

368
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,710
No matter how much you bribe us

369
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,190
or coerce us,

370
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,560
we will never help you open the Armory

371
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,560
and satisfy your selfishness!

372
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,640
Young Leader Long.

373
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,160
The Armory is the Armory of the people!

374
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,110
No one can embezzle it!

375
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,110
That's right!

376
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,000
Well said!

377
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,070
The Armory is the Armory of the people!

378
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,640
That's right!

379
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,070
I knew you wanted to make the Armory your own!

380
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,560
You all heard it, didn't you?

381
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Gao Chong wants to take
all the treasures in the Armory!

382
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,880
How despicable!

383
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,800
Long Xiao!

384
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,950
When has my brother ever
bribed or coerced your father?

385
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,880
Spewing such nonsense

386
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,190
in front of so many people,

387
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,560
do you think I won't kill you?

388
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,000
What the hell are you saying?

389
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,310
Why did you lie to me?

390
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,350
What are you scheming?

391
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,640
Please, don't believe him!

392
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,040
My brother has never harassed
the Longyuan Cabinet!

393
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,920
Gao, haven't you played us enough?

394
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,190
Your witness already told us the truth!

395
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,280
How much longer do you still want to deny it?

396
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,830
Quickly hand over the Glazed Armor!

397
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

398
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,760
Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!

399
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,800
Brother, I'm sorry!

400
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,590
I couldn't find the Longyuan Cabinet,
no matter how hard I tried.

401
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,880
He found me instead.

402
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,430
He said he would testify for me.

403
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,920
It's all my fault! I got you into this mess!

404
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,070
Zhao Xuan De?

405
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,830
How did such a weak and stupid fool

406
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,190
become one of the five sons
of the Five Lakes Alliance?

407
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,400
Shen Shen is not an idiot.

408
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,590
Your apprentice’s dad and Lu Tai Chong

409
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,880
are not much better.

410
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,920
What a Five Lakes Alliance.

411
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,590
Lao Wen, why do you hold such extreme views?

412
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,070
Don't let hatred blind your eyes

413
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,710
and affect your judgment
on the Five Lakes Alliance.

414
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,710
Can't you see it with your talent?

415
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,920
Someone deliberately set Gao Chong up.

416
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,830
I know that of course.

417
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,000
That's why I can’t wait to applaud this guy.

418
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,070
Ah Xu, don't speak.

419
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,430
Let's see how Chevalier Gao
will manage to turn the tide

420
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,710
and respond to this scheme.

421
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,520
Quiet down!

422
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,470
Everyone, quiet down!

423
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,310
There may be some misunderstanding

424
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,800
between Young Leader Long's father and me.

425
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,160
But I can promise you this,

426
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,950
I do not hold any selfish motives
regarding the Armory!

427
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,430
Misunderstanding my ass!

428
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,160
Don't confuse the crowd anymore!
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

429
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,000
Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!

430
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,640
I swear to Heaven!

431
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,280
Once the Ghost Valley is wiped out,

432
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,680
Young Leader Long and I

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,280
will distribute the secrets
of the Armory among all sects!

434
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,310
If I am insincere,

435
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,350
I shall be cut in thousands of pieces!

436
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,430
If there is no objection,
this matter has thus been decided!

437
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,830
Young Leader Long, you've had a long journey.

438
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,070
You may go to rest now.

439
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,110
Yes!

440
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,830
Get up.

441
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,470
Get up!

442
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,230
Cheng Ling.

443
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,800
Don't be afraid.

444
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,000
Come.

445
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,280
Uncle Gao.

446
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,310
There's one more thing I have to tell everyone.

447
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,280
This is Zhang Cheng Ling,
son of my fourth brother, Zhang Yu Sen.

448
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,710
He is the last descendant of the Mirror Lake Sect.

449
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,040
I have decided

450
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,310
to betroth my daughter to him!

451
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,640
In the future, he will be my son-in-law

452
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,040
and together with my daughter,
they will lead Mirror Lake Sect and Yueyang Sect!

453
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,430
After that, I shall become a monk

454
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,070
and walk my path with Buddha!

455
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,040
I will no longer handle
the matters of the mortal world again.

456
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,800
Big Brother, don't do this!

457
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,310
I have made my decision. You don't need to stop me.

458
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,520
You brats!

459
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,470
How dare you force my leader into becoming a monk!

460
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,310
Are you satisfied now?

461
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,710
Ah Xu. Gao Chong dragged
your apprentice down with him.

462
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,110
Do you still think I was wrong about him?

463
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,590
No.

464
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,190
Doing this

465
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,830
doesn't benefit him at all.

466
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,680
Ah Xu, why do you insist on contradicting me?

467
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,920
Gao Chong has always pretended to be
the paragon of virtue.

468
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,680
He must be using Cheng Ling

469
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,070
for some trick of his!

470
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,040
Gao Chong announced this in public.

471
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
There is no return for him.

472
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,110
Cheng Ling has handed over the Glazed Armor.

473
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,070
What'd be his value for Gao Chong?

474
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,900
Everyone, please look.

475
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,100
[Token of Honor]
What is this?

476
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,190
This is the Token of Honor!

477
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,710
What? What is the Token of Honor?

478
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,160
This is the token
of the Sword Immortal of Mount Changming.

479
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,590
The Sword Immortal once swore an oath,

480
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,560
if the Ghost Valley harms the martial arts world,

481
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,760
the holder of this token

482
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,400
can order the world to eradicate
that cancerous evil

483
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,110
in his name!

484
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,710
With this token,

485
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,640
what doubt could you possess?

486
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,070
I'm willing to return the Armory to the people!

487
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,070
I don't need power and might!

488
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,040
I only have one wish!

489
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,520
To destroy Ghost Valley,

490
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,520
to avenge the deceased brothers,

491
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
to return peace to the martial arts world!

492
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,190
Our Five Lakes Alliance
and the Ghost Valley cannot mutually exist!

493
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,430
It is imperative to attack Mount Qingya!

494
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,760
What else do you have to say?

495
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,590
Bring the wine.

496
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,180
[Lone are the Taiyue and Danyang Sects]
[Emptiness the world remains]

497
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,760
Those who are willing to work with me
to wipe out the Ghost Valley

498
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,230
may have your blood mixed in it.

499
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,430
Whether we were friends or foes,

500
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,560
after drinking this wine,

501
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,880
we will be brothers who can die for each other!

502
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,920
Before the Ghost Valley is destroyed,
this oath will not be broken.

503
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,920
Those who take the oath may stay,

504
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,310
those who wish to leave, I will not stop you!

505
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,710
Chevalier Gao.

506
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,640
You really know how to fool people.

507
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,350
Chief Gao.

508
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,590
The Gentle Wind Sword Sect and
the Ghost Valley have a blood feud.

509
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,070
Today I, Fan Huai Kong, entrust my life to you.

510
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,950
I shall follow your orders.

511
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,110
Thank you.

512
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,310
Chief Gao!

513
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,000
My Jujing Gang looks forward to your leadership.

514
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Chief Gao put it very well!

515
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,310
I and my men swear to follow Chief Gao!

516
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,520
My Water Transport Gang will also follow you!

517
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,000
Chief Gao, I didn't listen clearly.

518
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,560
I wish to confirm something with you.

519
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,760
You said that after the Ghost Valley is destroyed,

520
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,280
you'll open the Armory

521
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,350
and give the secret records to each sect, right?

522
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,430
I will not go back on my word.

523
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,590
Good. Chief Gao is an upright man.

524
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,160
There's something I'm curious about.

525
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,190
The Combined Six Cultivation Method
and the Yin Yang Book

526
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,560
belong to no one.

527
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,830
How do you plan on settling that?

528
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,280
That's right!

529
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:55,280
Who'll get the Combined Six Cultivation Method
and the Yin Yang Book?

530
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,040
Will these unowned items

531
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,310
end up

532
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,000
in your pocket?

533
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,520
You people!

534
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,470
You haven't even cleared up
the most critical issue yet

535
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,350
before anxiously pledging your allegiance!

536
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,110
This is Chevalier Gao's usual trick!

537
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,280
Who says the Combined Six Cultivation Method
and the Yin Yang Book

538
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,830
don't belong to anyone?

539
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Rong Xuan had his own sect.

540
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,590
Once I open the Armory,

541
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,400
we will return
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

542
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,470
to his mentor!

543
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,950
As for the Yin Yang Book,

544
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,640
it belongs to the Healer Valley!

545
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,350
It will naturally be returned!

546
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,230
Chief Gao, stop joking around.

547
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,560
They are all dead, how will you return it?

548
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,880
Leader of our Feisha Gang is a close friend
to the Healer Valley.

549
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,590
This Yin Yang Book should be managed by us!

550
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,710
You brat! Stop kidding!

551
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,190
What kind of friendship would that be?

552
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,280
Why don't you say that your leader

553
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,350
is the long-lost grandson
of Leader of the Healer Valley?

554
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,350
That's right!

555
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,590
Dear heroes,

556
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,880
if you ask me, our Five Tigers Broken Knives Clan

557
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,640
suffered the worst casualties

558
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,760
in the Battle of Mount Qingya!

559
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,350
Speaking of meritorious deeds,

560
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,520
our Peng Family should be awarded
the Combined Six Cultivation Method

561
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,950
as compensation!

562
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,230
Is it that glorious to have a high death count?

563
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,800
You call that meritorious?

564
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,880
You...!

565
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,680
Brother Feng is right.

566
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,070
We should distribute according to merit.

567
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,830
Our Twelve Chain Cove rendered the most merit.

568
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,520
The strategy of besieging Mount Qingya

569
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,880
was our leader's idea!

570
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,280
You bunch of robbers

571
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,830
are just idiots!

572
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,760
Your idea my ass!

573
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,680
You...!

574
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,160
Leader, are you guys of the Cove even literate?

575
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,070
Even if you get the book,

576
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,830
can you read it?

577
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,950
Everyone, our Funiu Sect has a long history

578
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,470
and long heritage!

579
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,950
This Yin Yang Book should be ours!

580
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,760
Fight.

581
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,590
Lao Wen, who are you exactly?

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,430
Do you want to test

583
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,040
my martial arts skills?

584
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,230
Why not? I'm not afraid!

585
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,430
Come on!

586
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,710
Come!

587
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,430
They want to fight but don't dare to fight.

588
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Cowards.

589
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,190
Lao Wen.

590
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,430
Do you hate the Five Lakes Alliance

591
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,800
or the whole martial arts world?

592
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,350
You are still trying to tell me
you aren't Rong Xuan's son?

593
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,830
Ah Xu.

594
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,830
Whether you believe me or not,

595
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,640
I have never lied to you.

596
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,950
In that case,

597
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,800
why bother with these ignorant people?

598
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,950
People?

599
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,880
How are they even human?

600
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,830
The righteous clans of the martial arts world?

601
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,040
The difference between them and the Ghost Valley

602
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,870
is that one is blatantly evil,

603
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,560
and the other is wearing a cover of benevolence,
justice and morality,

604
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,560
yet as soon as they see flesh,

605
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,520
they can't wait to tear off their human skin

606
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,800
and start barking and biting!

607
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,120
Exciting.

608
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,360
How exciting.

609
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,190
Alright.

610
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,040
We walk different paths.

611
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,390
I can't persuade you.

612
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,760
Do whatever you want.

613
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,910
Let's go our separate ways.

614
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
Everyone's gone. I'm all alone now.

615
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,470
There are only so few people locked up.

616
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,950
What is the point of watching over them?

617
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,840
Senior, you're awake!

618
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,670
Great!

619
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,930
[Yue]

620
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm Deng Kuan, the first disciple of Yueyang Sect.

621
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:53,560
Rewarding the evil and punishing the good,
such is the impermanence of nature.

622
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,760
What? Is it my turn?

623
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,040
Everything shall be done in accordance
with Master's arrangement.

624
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,560
The Ghost Valley came just right.

625
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
Let's work together!

626
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,950
Let's destroy these ghosts!

627
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,670
Their blood shall be
the sacrifice for our banner!

628
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,000
Chief Gao, no true man is without cruelty.

629
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,360
What a cruel mind you have.

630
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,760
That idiot Long-tongued Ghost has just
destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect for you.

631
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,760
Now you turn around and kill him?

632
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,950
Tragicomic Ghost trapped
and killed Danyang Sect's disciples.

633
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,710
Happy Ghost killed Ao Lai Zi.

634
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,840
Weren't all that instructed by you?

635
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,320
Gao Chong, it really was you!

636
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,870
You bastard!

637
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,630
We agreed on dividing up
the Armory's treasure equally

638
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,520
after collecting the Glazed Armor.

639
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,120
After you got three pieces of it,

640
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
you immediately turned around and betrayed us.

641
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,120
You want to destroy the Ghost Valley?

642
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,230
Do you think my Ghost Valley

643
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,280
will let you do whatever you want?

644
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,280
Who are you?

645
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,910
Stop slandering me!

646
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,870
A wise man won't believe in rumors!
There's no use in saying more!

647
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,870
Kuan?

648
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,000
Isn't Yueyang Sect's first disciple
Deng Kuan dead?

649
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,120
Enough, Master.

650
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,950
Kuan!

651
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,950
Everyone.

652
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,670
I am Deng Kuan, the first disciple
of the Yueyang Sect.

653
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
I'm not dead!

654
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,390
I was kept imprisoned by Gao Chong.

655
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,710
It was him

656
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,950
who instructed me to sneak into
the Mirror Lake Sect

657
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,710
and help Long-tongued Ghost sneak inside

658
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,390
to extinguish the Zhang Family.

659
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,430
Kuan, what are you talking about?

660
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,910
Gao Chong! You abandoned the Five Lakes Alliance!

661
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,190
Such disloyalty!

662
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,470
You murdered your own brothers!

663
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,190
Such disrespect!

664
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,390
You harmed the lost orphan of the Mirror Lake Sect.

665
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,710
Such inhumanity!

666
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,670
You colluded with the Ghost Valley
to disrupt the martial arts world.

667
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,120
Such injustice!

668
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,910
I assisted you in your cruel ways,
I am too ashamed to live!

669
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,000
I shall end my life to maintain justice!

670
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,150
I will die with you!

671
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,950
Kuan!

672
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,670
Senior!

673
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,520
Senior!

674
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,190
Senior!

675
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,710
Senior!

676
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,560
You can't believe him!

677
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,670
This kid is crazy!

678
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,390
Kuan!

679
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,320
Who wants me to be dead

680
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,560
by controlling you?

681
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,800
Changing Ghost, oh Changing Ghost.

682
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,230
So this is where you're making your move.

683
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,190
Sure enough, a dog that can bite doesn't bark.

684
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,360
Congratulations, you abandoned the dark
and cast a bright future.
