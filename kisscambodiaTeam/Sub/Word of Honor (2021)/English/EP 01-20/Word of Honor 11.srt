Little boy, does it hurt?

185
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,640
Do you want me to blow on it?

186
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,040
You disgusting woman, don't touch me!

187
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
But I want to touch you.

188
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,440
Those dogs are following so closely.

189
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,640
Why aren't the three of them
coming to my aid?

190
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,120
Where did your friends take him?

191
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Are you going to tell me,

192
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,040
or do you want me to squeeze
the answer out of you?

193
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,240
Little boy, can you tell us now?

194
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,320
Just kill me!

195
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,280
You want to die before telling us
where the Glazed Armor is?

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,080
Baby, killing you
would be doing you a favor.

197
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
I have over one hundred ways

198
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,840
to make you feel worse than death.

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,840
Are you done or not?

200
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,720
You frivolous woman.

201
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,520
Master doesn't have patience

202
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,360
for you to use all one hundred methods.

203
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
This boy looks weak,

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
but he's quite stubborn.

205
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
Are you forcing me
to use my real powers?

206
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,800
He's such a little brat.

207
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,120
If you accidentally kill him,

208
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
we're both going to die.

209
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,000
Leave him.

210
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,160
Let me do it.

211
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,920
Go and see why it's taking so long
for Monster Jiang

212
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,920
to meet with Qin.

213
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm not going.

214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
I don't care what happens to those two.

215
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
I want to see

216
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,640
what kind of skills you have.

217
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,520
Then bring me a pail of water

218
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,720
and a stack of Xuan paper.

219
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,760
Your hand for playing pipa

220
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,080
is now destroyed.

221
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,440
I met another tough man before

222
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,960
and asked him the same question.

223
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,400
He also wouldn't answer.

224
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,880
I had no choice

225
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,200
but to crush

226
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,520
his bones inch by inch,

227
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,880
and slowly squeeze the answer out of him.

228
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,600
My father told me

229
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,200
that the human body contains 206 bones.

230
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,310
When I got to the 80th bone,

231
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,590
that tough man answered.

232
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,070
Qin Song.

233
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,110
Tell me right now

234
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
where your friends kidnapped the boy to!

235
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
How is it?

236
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,120
I don't need your delicate
and weak torture skills.

237
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,000
A pail of water and a stack of paper.

238
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,800
I have yet to meet a man

239
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
who can withstand this water torture!

240
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,600
I admire you,

241
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,240
Tomboy.

242
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,840
No wonder that one has to be cruel
to be successful.

243
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
Compared to you,

244
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm truly not as skilled.

245
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,400
Do you want to tell us now?

246
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,800
I'll tell you.

247
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760
The Glazed Armor...

248
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,440
Glazed Armor...

249
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
What did you say?

250
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,800
What other torture methods have you got?
Use them all.

251
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
Guess whether or not I can bear them.

252
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
My father is Chevalier of Mirror Lake,
Zhang Yu Sen.

253
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,520
None of his sons is a coward!

254
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,320
Who are you?

255
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,280
You dare attack the Four Assassins?

256
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,600
A bunch of stinky scorpions
don't deserve to know my name.

257
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,800
You know about the Scorpion?

258
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
I do.

259
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,960
I am your ancestor!

260
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,160
Master!

261
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,920
Why did you come back alone?
Where is Qin?

262
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,360
I couldn't find Qin!

263
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,920
[These stupid nail wounds.]

264
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
[I can't drag out this battle.]

265
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,720
[I need to end it as soon as possible.]

266
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
Why is this bastard here?

267
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,640
Stop talking. Kill him first!

268
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,560
Master!

269
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Who are you?

270
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,080
Since you know about Scorpion,

271
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
you must also know

272
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,200
that no one can stop the Scorpion King
from killing whoever

273
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,000
and getting whatever he wants.

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What a coincidence.

275
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,200
No one can either stop me
from killing who I want

276
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,200
and getting what I want.

277
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,000
Monster Jiang!

278
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,320
Master!

279
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,480
Don't worry, I'm here.

280
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,600
He is almost tired out.

281
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,800
Let's attack together!

282
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Capture him alive.

283
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm going to get my sweet revenge

284
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,520
for Qin Song and Monster Jiang.

285
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,840
Handsome boy.

286
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
Let me show you

287
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,040
what it feels like
to want to die more than to live.

288
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,360
Uncle Wen!

289
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,640
Who hurt you?

290
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,600
Uncle Wen, they kidnapped me

291
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,600
and hurt my master.

292
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,080
No need to follow them.

293
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
We have to get Cheng Ling out of here.

294
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,080
No.

295
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,520
I will destroy whoever hurt you!

296
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,440
Let's go.

297
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,520
Master.

298
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,160
What... what are those?

299
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,600
Don't be scared.

300
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Take Cheng Ling and leave.

301
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
It's fine if you don't leave.

302
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
Dying together with you

303
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,840
is also a fine ending.

304
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,440
Who wants to die with you?

305
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,200
In life and death will you never part.

306
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,200
What a touching moment.

307
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,360
Glad to have you,

308
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
and apologies
for not welcoming you earlier.

309
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,840
These two bastards

310
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,000
were the ones that killed Jiang
and destroyed Qin!

311
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,560
You lost and disgraced me,

312
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,440
and you're not embarrassed to complain?

313
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,360
Leader Zhou.

314
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,240
Are you not going to introduce

315
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,200
your fast friend?

316
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,560
Who are you?

317
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,720
Why send people to kidnap Cheng Ling?

318
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,800
I can tell you

319
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
who I am,

320
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,200
but you have to tell me
who you are first.

321
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,680
Let's wager a bet.

322
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,440
The person who loses
should tell the person who wins

323
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,040
his true identity.

324
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
He's even more talkative than you.

325
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Your Majesty, who are they?

326
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,320
A leader of the Window of Heaven,

327
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,400
and a leader of the ghosts.

328
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,280
Ghost Leader?

329
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
How did those two devils

330
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,920
end up together?

331
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,333
[Profound Expectations]

332
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,960
Big Brother.

333
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,000
Everything's fine. Don't be too anxious.

334
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,600
The Four Assassins

335
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,560
definitely took a risk
to kidnap Cheng Ling

336
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,680
in order to find out
where the Glazed Armor is.

337
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,080
As long as Cheng Ling
doesn't say anything,

338
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
his life won't be in danger.

339
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,560
Enough.

340
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,080
Master, Uncle Wen.

341
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,440
You both came to save me.

342
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
Sister Xiang was right.

343
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,840
You didn't leave me behind!

344
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
Little idiot.

345
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,320
You call me Uncle Wen

346
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,760
and him Master.

347
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,880
You make it sound like
I'm younger than him.

348
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,720
Am I not older than you?

349
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,640
The Four Assassins tortured you

350
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,720
and you didn't even cry.

351
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,680
Why are you crying after seeing us?

352
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
Alright, act like a man.

353
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
They tortured me,
and I'd rather die than give in.

354
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,840
But when I saw you, I...

355
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,840
Master, Uncle Wen.

356
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,160
I have so many things to tell you!

357
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,720
Smells delicious.

358
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,560
Ah Xu.

359
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,560
Cheng Ling, you're hungry, right?

360
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,160
You eat first.

361
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,600
Master, I know

362
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,000
that only you guys
are sincerely kind to me.

363
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,040
Little idiot.

364
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,800
Don't your uncles treat you well too?

365
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,200
I heard that Gao Chong

366
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,840
even wanted to betroth
his only daughter to you.

367
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,680
I don't have a daughter,

368
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,720
just Xiang.

369
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,080
I don't really care,

370
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
but I'm afraid
you won't be able to handle her.

371
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,480
They just want the Glazed Armor,

372
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
and never actually cared about me

373
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
or my family's revenge.

374
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,640
In the beginning,

375
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,240
I thought they actually saw me
as their nephew.

376
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,880
But later on,

377
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,800
I realized they never even treated
my father as a real brother,

378
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,280
much less me.

379
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,120
Little idiot, what do you mean?

380
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,880
Uncle Gao isn't worried about
getting revenge at all.

381
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,800
Instead, he's using that as an excuse

382
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
to carry on with his Heroes Conference.

383
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,040
Ever since I came to the Yueyang Sect,

384
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
nobody truly cared about me

385
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,680
or asked what I wanted.

386
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,000
Then what do you want?

387
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,080
I want to learn martial arts.

388
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,680
I want to get revenge.

389
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't want to be a useless child anymore,

390
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,280
waiting for others to sacrifice themselves
to protect me.

391
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,400
I also want to continue
the Mirror Lake Sect's

392
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
heritage.

393
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,440
That is the wish of my father
and brothers.

394
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Cheng Ling,
did something happen that caused

395
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,360
your strong suspicions
of the Five Lakes Alliance?

396
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
Do you want to tell us?

397
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,040
Eat first. There's no rush to tell us.

398
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,160
No.

399
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,640
Master, Uncle Wen.

400
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,560
The day my family was killed,

401
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,600
my father didn't have time
to tell me much

402
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
except for one thing.

403
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,480
"Never trust anyone,

404
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,600
no one is trustworthy."

405
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,240
But Master, Uncle Wen,

406
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,480
I trust you!

407
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,680
Foolish child.
Don't rush to trust anyone.

408
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,120
Master, I should've trusted you
from the beginning.

409
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Back then, the fisherman

410
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,120
didn't know what happened
between my father and the Five Lakes Alliance,

411
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,720
and wanted to take me to Uncle Zhao.

412
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,160
I didn't know what to do

413
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,080
and whom to believe.

414
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,480
Master, I'm sorry.

415
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,200
I should've trusted you
from the beginning.

416
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,560
I have the Glazed Armor with me.

417
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,440
My father was in a rush,

418
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
and thus he cut my stomach

419
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,640
to hide it in there.

420
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,880
The wound healed,

421
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,520
and it's been with me since.

422
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,960
I'll take it out for you now!

423
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,000
Little idiot.

424
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,720
Did I say I wanted it?

425
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,960
Little idiot, why are you in a rush?

426
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,560
You should talk slower
and take time to get to know someone.

427
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
Your father must've been careful

428
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,920
because he guessed

429
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,200
that even if Li safely brought you

430
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,880
to his brothers in the Five Lakes Alliance,

431
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,320
they would still carefully search you.

432
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,720
It seems like

433
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,720
he lost trust in his brothers

434
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,960
a long time ago.

435
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,560
Yes. Other people don't know,

436
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
but they've been at odds
for many years.

437
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,960
Do you know

438
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,360
why their relationship turned sour?

439
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,760
I know. He gave me a letter.

440
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,920
Where is the letter?

441
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,520
I hid it under the Buddha statue
in the abandoned temple.

442
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,760
I thought you were an idiot,

443
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,240
but who knew you're quite scheming?

444
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,520
You even managed to hide it

445
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,720
in that situation?

446
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,440
My father said

447
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,280
that besides the receiver,

448
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,960
no one else can have the letter.

449
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,440
I didn't know what to do,

450
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,880
so hid it when I went to the restroom.

451
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,320
I figured

452
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,960
that worst comes to worst,
I can at least tell the receiver in person.

453
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,200
Who is the receiver?

454
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,280
Do you remember what the letter said?

455
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,960
The letter is for
Elder Changming Sword Immortal.

456
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
The letter mostly said

457
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,160
that the Five Lakes brothers, Gao, Zhao,
Lu, Zhang, and Shen

458
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,400
were all friends with Uncle Rong Xuan.

459
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,760
Uncle Rong became evil

460
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,080
because of a mistake
the five of them made.

461
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,720
Once the six of them
had a sword battle after arguing over

462
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,680
the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

463
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Uncle Rong won the battle,
but was heavily poisoned

464
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,160
and went crazy.

465
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,520
Someone had put poison on the sword.

466
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,960
And then?

467
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,120
Uncle Rong became possessed
and went crazy.

468
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,520
The five of them
should have been responsible,

469
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,400
but no one stood up for Uncle Rong

470
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
when he was attacked
by other martial arts artists.

471
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
My father was going to go to Mount Qingya

472
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,720
and fight to the death with Uncle Rong.

473
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,360
But his master broke his legs

474
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,440
and locked him up

475
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,280
until it was too late.

476
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,200
He could only regret living.

477
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,080
Who was the one
that put poison on his sword?

478
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,160
I... I don't know.

479

551
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,060
Right.

552
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,400
If it wasn't for this internal injury,

553
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,320
how would I get a chance

554
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,240
to help a master like Ah Xu?

555
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,120
Cheng Ling.

556
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,320
Did you know
that when I first saw your master,

557
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,440
I could tell he had transformed
his appearance

558
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,440
by his exceptional build.

559
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
There must be a world-class master

560
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,400
under the mask of a sick man.

561
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,320
Stop boasting.

562
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
How am I boasting?

563
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,280
My skill at recognizing people
by their build

564
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,040
is truly amazing.

565
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,680
Uncle Wen, you're so cool.

566
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
I never knew that Master

567
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,520
transformed his appearance.

568
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,480
In my entire life,

569
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,800
I've never made a mistake.

570
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,360
Many years ago,

571
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,800
I saw a dead body.

572
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
The hair was a mess

573
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,160
and face covered in blood.

574
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,800
A long spear was stuck from the front
of its chest to its back.

575
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,840
I looked at the shoulder blades

576
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,560
in detail,

577
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,760
and realized that this person
was a rare beauty when she was alive.

578
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,080
Guess what happened after?

579
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,680
We should let the past stay in the past.

580
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,520
My condolences.

581
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,760
Lao Wen, who are you actually?

582
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,480
Who am I?

583
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,360
I am Philanthropist Wen,

584
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,640
doing kind deeds for good karma,
and helping the poor and the weak.

585
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm kind and wealthy, with many beauties around

586
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,800
which I shall never reject.

587
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,840
Master.

588
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,160
Drink some.

589
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,800
Cheng Ling.

590
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,440
Do you sincerely want me
to be your master?

591
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,720
Yes, Master.

592
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,880
You and I barely know each other,

593
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,200
but you trust me fully.

594
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,360
I can only repay you with sincerity.

595
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,680
But let me tell you
who I really am first,

596
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,680
and then you can decide.

597
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,640
My real name is Zhou Zi Shu.

598
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,560
I am the current leader
of the Four Seasons Manor,

599
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,560
and also the last.

600
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,320
The previous leader, Qin Huai Zhang,

601
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,920
was my beloved master.

602
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,520
Our clan used to be well known
for our flowers that blossomed in all seasons,

603
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,040
and knowing everything in the world.

604
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,720
But now, there are not many left
in the martial arts world

605
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,560
that know about Four Seasons Manor.

606
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,200
All because of my one mistake

607
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,640
and helplessness.

608
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,960
When I was 16, my master
suddenly passed away.

609
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,720
I couldn't save the reputation
of the Four Seasons Manor,

610
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,720
so took the skilled disciples of our clan
to follow the Jin Military Governor,

611
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,600
whom the Zhou family had served
for generations,

612
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,920
and founded the Window of Heaven.

613
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I didn't expect

614
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,520
that all of the fellow disciples
from the Manor

615
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,920
would become slaves to power.

616
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,160
All eighty-one previous followers of the Manor

617
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,120
slowly died one by one,

618
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,440
until when I was the only one left.

619
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,720
"Leader Zhou" refers to the leader
of the Window of Heaven.

620
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,200
Yes.

621
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,360
This is why the Scorpion knows me,

622
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,680
and how I know where their base is.

623
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,280
Master.

624
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,040
Scorpion... what's the Scorpion?

625
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,600
It's an assassin organization.

626
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
They are rooted in Jiangnan,

627
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
and are highly secretive.

628
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,560
The Four Assassins that kidnapped you

629
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,760
are one of Scorpion's trump cards.

630
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,920
But they have much more power than that.

631
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,960
Previously, the Window of Heaven
wanted to spread our presence to Jiangnan,

632
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,480
and had a few conflicts with the Scorpion.

633
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,160
The Scorpion's power in Jiangnan

634
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,360
is no less than the Window of Heaven's
power in the Northwest.

635
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,160
Then is your Window of Heaven
also an assassin organization?

636
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,480
It's not my Window of Heaven anymore.

637
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,360
Now, I am just a normal person.

638
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,240
I spent half of my life alone,

639
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,240
doing things against my will

640
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,960
and killing people I didn't want to.

641
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,880
I wanted to wander the world
until I die,

642
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,560
but it seems like God
have other plans

643
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,920
for my destiny.

644
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,040
Now that you know who I am,

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,600
do you still want me to be your master?

646
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,000
I do, of course I do!

647
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,160
Master, regardless of whether or not
you accept me,

648
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,800
I thought of you as my master
since long ago.

649
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,000
Little idiot.

650
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,960
Since you know,

651
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,760
hurry up and finish the formalities.

652
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,000
Kowtow.

653
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,280
Hurry up.

654
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,880
Master, please accept my bow.

655
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,200
Alright.

656
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,920
Now that you are in the clan,

657
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,080
you are the first disciple
of the sixth generation.

658
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,440
With a superb disciple like you,
the heritage of the Four Seasons Manor

659
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,000
will live on.

660
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,520
I...

661
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,160
I am very happy.

662
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,960
Thank you, Master.

663
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Master, I'm very happy too.

664
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,320
Very very happy!
