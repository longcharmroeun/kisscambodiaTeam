00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,120
Master Wen.

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
I've been helping you kill
and bury bodies all night,

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,200
why are you still calling me Master Wen?

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,920
Aren't you being a bit too formal?

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
You shouldn't drink cold liquor with that injury.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
Xiang.

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Warm it up.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm fine with waiting on you,

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,680
but now I have to wait on these two idiots, too?

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,040
Sister Xiang, let me do it.

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,680
Take it.

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
Master Wen.

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
How strange.

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
It has a skin and flesh feel to it,

37
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,960
but why does it feel like you grew it yourself?

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,040
I did try to grow it myself.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
Who is this guy?

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Why could he recognize the Swift Moving Steps

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
and see through my disguise, too?

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,080
I've never made a mistake in my judgment of people.

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,440
Your figure speaks of honesty and uprightness,

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,760
you must be extraordinary.

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,440
How come...?

46
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,640
Master!

47
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Last time you pointed
at the back of a village girl

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,080
and praised her for having
fair shoulder blades,

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,280
saying she must be a beauty.

50
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,400
But when she turned around,

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
she couldn't look more homely.

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,960
You don't understand.

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,280
That girl is inherently beautiful.

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,240
But poor environment
gave her a cheesy appearance.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,640
It wasn't my mistake.

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,280
As for Brother Zhou...

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,520
Uncle Zhou.

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
I can't see anything obvious yet,

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,320
but I'm sure you've changed your appearance.

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Is it pretty?

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,680
It's perfect.

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
Master Zhang, the masks of those people
who were chasing you

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,160
had symbols of Mount Qingya's Ghost Valley.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,880
This group of evil
has disappeared for many years.

65
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,080
How did the Mirror Lake Sect
get into trouble with them?

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't know.

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,040
You don't know?

68
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,320
Brother Zhou,

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,520
you must
how strong the Ghost Valley is, right?

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,240
You got involved
in such a major issue for no reason,

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,040
don't you want to know what's behind all of it?

72
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,360
I don't know.

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
And I'm not interested.

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,960
But I can get a good picture just by guessing.

75
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
Uncle Zhou.

76
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,040
Matters of the martial arts world

77
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,840
are all about three things:
greed, hatred and ignorance.

78
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Ghost Valley disappeared for many years,

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,440
so there's no hatred to speak of.

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,240
Qiu Yue Jian has always preserved
moral integrity and been at peace with all.

81
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,200
There's no ignorance to speak of, either.

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,200
So the only thing left is greed.

83
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,440
The Ghosts on Mount Qingya
must have destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect

84
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,560
out of the greed for something.

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,600
I wonder if Brother Zhou
has heard of this nursery rhyme.

88

89
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,400
This nursery rhyme has spread
throughout Jiangnan these past few months.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,360
Everyone knows this
is the Five Lakes Alliance's campaign

91
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
to compete for leadership
over the martial arts world.

92
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,520
But a few days ago,

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
a strange second half of the rhyme
spread from Yue.

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840

What's so sad about the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,280
Each one of them is full of evil

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,480
and ended up in Ghost Valley
for they had nowhere to escape.

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
You're right.

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,480
But the words "the Ghosts on Mount Qingya"

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
don't stand for a group of ghosts,

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,560
but for Rong Xuan,
the great demon who was executed

104
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,000
at Mount Qingya twenty years ago.

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,160
It's said that this demon with the surname Rong

106
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
left behind

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,960
a martial arts treasure called World's Armory.

108
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,680
It contains long-lost supreme techniques

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,480
of various martial arts sects.

110
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,680
It can make any ordinary man invincible.

111
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,040
The key to this armory

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,080
is called the Glazed Armor.

113
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,920
A treasure that makes people invincible?

114
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
You can only trick an ignorant rustic

115
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
into believing
this kind of foolish talk.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
Master Wen, do you believe it?

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,760
Why? Don't you believe it?

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,120

secret martial arts scrolls, panaceas.

120

Every few years,

121
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,600
something of the kind gets made up

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,640
and causes the people of the martial arts world

123
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,040
to scramble for it, leading to countless deaths.

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,640
Only then will everyone be happy.

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160

have a name.

132
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,520
it's just greed.

133
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm surprised

134
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,440
that you are of the same opinion as me.

135
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,440
Though peace reigns over the land,

136
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,320

I finally figured out what you just said!

138
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,720
That's right, in fact, it's because
the people fighting over it know

139
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,599
that their skills of martial arts are poor,

140
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,629
so they try to reap without sowing!

141
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,840
They already know they are weak,

142
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,160
but they still fight with others over it,

143
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,520
do they have a death wish?

What do you think, Master Zhang?

Weren't you ordered here
to hand over the invitation?

183
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,480
Why weren't you here in time to rescue them,
either?

184
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,320
When we saw the fire while in Yue last night,

185
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,920
we rushed to the lake immediately,

186
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,960
but someone

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,800
destroyed all the boats early in that morning!

188
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,520
What a cruel scheme!

189
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,960
If I find them,

190
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,280
I will pay them back hundredfold!

191
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,920
In all my years,

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,160
I've never heard anyone boast so outrageously,

193
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,440
talking so big and irresponsibly.

194
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,000
Tao Hong, Lv Liu, what do you mean?

195
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
[Grandma Tao Hon, Grandpa Lv Liu]
Chevalier Shen.

196
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,480
When you became sworn brothers,

197
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,640
didn't you swear to die at the same time?

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,560
Now that your sworn brother
died such a cruel death,

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
why don't you end your life and follow him?

200
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,040
A few tears are all you've got?

201
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,880
Nonsense!

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,360
Old Woman, you don't understand.

203
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,080
The Five Lakes Alliance's
understanding of honor

204
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,960
has always stood out among others.

205
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,840
When they were alive,
they didn’t meet together for decades.

206
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,840
Once they died, he came as soon as possible,

207
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,080
crying like it's his mother who died.

208
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,080
This kind of deep friendship is quite special!

209
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,320
You insult the friendship
between us five brothers.

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,120
Brothers?

212
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,923
[For Auld Lang Syne]

213
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Chevalier Shen.

214
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Aren't you blowing your own trumpet too much?

215
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,440
Who knows if Zhang Yu Sen
even recognizes you as his brother?

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,840
Anyone with a discerning eye can see whether you,

217
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,520
Leader Shen,

218
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,840
are a brother or a flunkey!

219
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,120
You've gone too far!

220
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Leader Shen!

221
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,800
Elder Huang!

222
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,243
[Elder of Beggar Gangs, Huang He]

223
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,240
Leader Shen.

224
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,880
I asked Tao Hong and Lv Liu here

225
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
to help us.

226
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,120
Please hold back

227
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,120
for my sake.

228
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,120
We should stick together
when faced with our enemies.

229
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,840
Let us forget about our past grievances for now.

230
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,840
For now.

231
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
Leader Shen.

232
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,400
Is it more important to avenge Mirror Lake Sect

233
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,120
or to hold this momentary argument?

234
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,840
But Elder Huang,

235
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,440
who... who did this actually?

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,640
Follow me.

237
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:35,203
[Luohan Temple]

238
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,040
Have you stared enough?

239
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm just wondering

240
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
what kind of countenance

241
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
lies beneath your disguise.

242
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,160
It's dawn. Thank you.

243
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,000
Fate let us meet.

244
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,600
And fate will reunite us.

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,320
Brother Zhou.

246
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,760
Actually, why wait for another day to reunite?

247
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,240
You want to send this child to Tai Lake.

248
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,480
It's a long journey.

249
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,120
I happen to have a boat.

250
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
I'd also like to appreciate
the scenery of Tai Lake.

251
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
We might as well take my boat together.

252
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Wouldn't that be great?

253
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
I've always hated

254
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,920
to see the fated people
brave the wind and dew

255
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,400
on their journeys.

256
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,440
Interesting.

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm looking forward to finding out who you are.

258
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Fated people?

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,040
Master,

260
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,000
that Tuberculosis

261
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
breathes out more air than he takes in,

262
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,560
he may keel over at any moment!

263
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,080
Why would you take him with you?

264
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,840
Do you find your life too comfortable?

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,880
You haven't met enough people yet.

266
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,200
That person's voice sounds fabulous,
and his appearance is comely.

267
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,640
Especially those shoulder blades.

268
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,160
They are one-of-a-kind.

269
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,880
You made him sounds like Apollo.

270
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,040
He's just a man, isn't he?

271
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,080
Of course.

272
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
Do you think I don't know he is a man?

273
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
What I mean is...

274
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,160
this person's appearance and phrenology
are completely inconsistent.

275
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,880
Yet I can't see any trace of disguise.

276
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,720
How skillful must he be

277
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,960
for this little trick?

278
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,560
Even I can't see any flaws.

279
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,000
And that flexible sword of his...

280
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,999
Master.

281
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
Why were those people so mysterious last night?

282
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,430
That leader even called himself a Hanged Ghost.

283
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,150
Did they think we are stupid?

284
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,999
Master, where are you going?

285
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Fate... will reunite us.

286
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
[Luohan Temple]
[Smile to difficulties of life]

287
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,480
Master Shen, the only remains we haven't found

288
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,760
is Cheng Ling's.

289
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
And the others?

290
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,280
I found the remains in this yard.

291
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,280
Chevalier Shen, be careful.

292
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,240
What an insidious trap!

293
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,360
Master, these materials are extremely sharp.

294
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,040
You can hardly see them with the naked eye.

295
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,440
We only cleaned them roughly,

296
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,040
they are not cleaned up yet.

297
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,920
This yellow paper...

298
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Ghost Valley?

299
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,880
Yes.

300
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,400
All of us old people know,

301
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,520
Ghost Valley always creates a scene
before it carries out its evil deeds.

302
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,240
I was worried that someone would do evil
under the guise of Ghost Valley.

303
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,480
That was why I asked my two old friends,
Tao Hong and Lv Liu, to come here.

304
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,080
There is no one left in this world...

305
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,040
Yes.

306
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,680
There is no one in this world

307
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
who understands these damn things
better than us.

308
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,800
These things caused the two of us to become

309
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,520
the way we are today!

310
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
These are Soul Winding Threads

00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,080
Drink some water and quench your thirst.

364
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,800
If the Canglang River is clean,

365
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,800
I can wash my ribbon in it.

366
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,360
If the Canglang River is dirty,

367
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,000
I can wash my foot in it.*
(* Lit.: Lines from a classical Chinese Poem)

368
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
Brother Zhou.

369
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,680
We meet everywhere.

370
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,920
Did this person

371
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,360
put some tracking item on us?

372
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,240
Is there really a tracking technique
I do not know about?

373
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,800
Let's go.

374
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,680
Where are you going, Brother Zhou?

375
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
Aren't you going to rest a bit longer?

376
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,120
Seeing Shen frightened out of his wits

377
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,560
was truly satisfying.

378
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,120
Five Lakes Alliance
has been unbridled for so many years.

379
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,160
Finally someone can put them in their place.

380
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,200
Grandma Tao Hon, you should restrain yourself.

381
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,080
If the Ghost Valley appears,

382
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,000
it’s not just the Five Lakes Alliance
that will suffer.

383
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't care.

384
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm almost dead anyway.

385
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,960
As long as I can watch the fall
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

386
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
I can die in peace.

387
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,600
Grandpa Lv Liu, what do you think?

388
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,960
So many people were driven to death

389
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,240
for that damned Glazed Armor back then.

390
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,240
In the end,

391
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,080
the Five Lakes Alliance got all the benefits.

392
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,120
Now,

393
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,760
the Danyang Sect's bloodline was cut first,

394
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
then the Mirror Lake Sect was destroyed.

395
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,240
I feel like the time has come
for Five Lakes Alliance's retribution.

396
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,840
Lu Tai Chong left behind two young disciples.

397
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,360
They ran over to Ao Lai Zi's Mount Tai Sect.

398
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,520
He must have obtained Lu Tai Chong's Glazed Armor.

399
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,680
We have to find Ao Lai Zi quickly.

400
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
We can't let another piece of the Glazed Armor

401
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
fall into the hands of the Ghost Valley.

402
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:22,622
[Tianya Inn]

403
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,040
A single room would be enough, too.

404
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,120
Please, can't you work something out?

405
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,320
If we had a room,

406
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,840
we'd let you stay here.

407
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,680
A gentleman

408
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,400
reserved the entire place.

409
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Please forgive me.

410
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,680
Why don't you go and look elsewhere?

411
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,640
Are there other inns elsewhere?

412
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm sorry. That would be a no.

413
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,440
Where do you want us to go then?

414
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,560
It's none of my business

415
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,360
where you go once you leave our inn.

416
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Hey!

417
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
What about your woodshed? That will do.

418
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,960
We are tired through our journey.

419
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,880
We'd like to ask you for a place to stay overnight.

420
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,280
Isn't this Brother Zhou?

421
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,640
What woodshed?

422
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,480
How can you let Brother Zhou sleep in a woodshed?

423
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,680
Sir,

424
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,840
have my First-class Room cleaned up

425
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,800
for this beautiful...

426
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,120
this gallant man.

427
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,240
Of course.

428
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,920
Lad, go and clean it up!

429
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,840
Alright!

430
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,040
Brother Zhou,

431
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,400
I gave you my own room.

432
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,560
I even prepared two new outfits for you.

433
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,480
Are you just going to
take over my room so brusquely?

434
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,760
You should

435
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,400
at least invite me inside for a while.

436
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,160
Seems to me

437
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,680
that there are many empty rooms left.

438
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,760
Just find another room to relax in.

439
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,880
But there's only one First-class Room.

440
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,840
Brother Zhou.

441
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Brother Zhou!

442
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,680
Uncle Zhou, what are you doing?

443
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,480
We must always be on guard.

444
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,680
Master Wen doesn't look like a bad person.

445
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,680
You think everyone is a good person.

446
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,440
You stayed up all night.

447
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,280
Come here and take a nap.

448
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,840
Uncle Zhou, you stayed up all night too.

449
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,840
I'll just take a nap in the chair.

450
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
You should use the bed.

451
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
Just do what I say.

452
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,520
Yes.

453
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,720
You brat.

454
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,640
You don't even take off
your clothes when you sleep?

455
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
It's inconvenient for you when I'm here, right?

456
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,920
Alright.

457
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,840
Oh right,

458
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,680
how is your injury?

459
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You don't have to say it if you don't want to.

460
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
This is the hemostatic.

461
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,200
Apply it yourself.

462
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,800
Uncle Zhou.

463
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,440
Thank you.

464
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,680
Brother Zhou, we have a deep bond through fate.

465
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,640
Could it be the doomed fate of Karma?

466
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
More like a wretched soul
that keeps haunting around.

467
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,400
I wonder why you keep following me

468
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
all this time.

469
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Why don't you just tell me?

470
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,960
What I want is simple.

471
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,960
Show me your true face

472
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,800
and I'll tell you.

473
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,400
Why not let me see your true face first?

474
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,600
Your true face must be very handsome.

475
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,440
As for my true face...

476
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
It may not necessarily be that appealing.

477
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,400
Perhaps it's covered in scars.

478
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,280
Perhaps it's a terrifying appearance.

479
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,960
I don't care either way.

480
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,480
However, I will give you a piece of advice.

481
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,280
Don't be so interested

482
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,560
in things that don't concern you.

483
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,760
Then tell me, Brother Zhou,

484
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,640
what is your relationship
with that Master Zhang upstairs?

485
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,800
Do you really want to get sucked into this trouble

486
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
without knowing what it is?

487
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,040
I do my best to accomplish
what was entrusted to me.

488
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,160
I only need to bring Master Zhang

489
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,160
to Zhao Jing safely.

490
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,000
Anything else has nothing to do with me.

491
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,760
Master!

492
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Why didn't you invite me to drink with you?

493
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Xiang, tell me,

494
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,400
what is the second cutest person

495
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
in the world like?

496
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,840
Someone who treats me to dinner.

497
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,400
It's a person who is tough
on the surface but soft at heart.

498
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,480
And who is the cutest person in the world?

499
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,360
A person with a slim waist, long legs,
who is tough on the surface but soft at heart.

500
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,640
This child is the descendant
of an eminent family.

501
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,840
We shall spare no efforts

502
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,000
to find the child!

503
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Yes!

504
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,200
We will follow Law Elder's orders.

505
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,320
What should we do if we find
his whereabouts?

506
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,360
Bring the child directly to me,

507
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,240
no matter what it costs.

508
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Don't let anyone know

509
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,080
that the child is brought to us.

510
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
Yes!

511
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,560
Uncle Zhou.

512
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Young Master Zhang, you finally woke up.

513
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,600
We've been waiting for you.

514
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,040
Your Uncle Zhou wouldn't
start eating without you.

515
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,280
So we couldn't start either.

516
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,120
Wash your hands and eat.

517
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,440
I'm hungry!

518
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,160
Why wash your hands? It's not like
you're going to eat with your bare hands!

519
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,480
Girl, since we are traveling
the martial arts world,

520
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,120
do behave yourself.

521
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,240
Look at how the other girls conduct themselves.

522
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,880
[Tianya Inn]

523
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Please have mercy on us.

524
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,800
Is it him?

525
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
Have mercy on us, sir!

526
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
Young Master Zhang, why don't you start eating?

527
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
Is the food not to your taste?

528
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,360
No, that's not it.

529
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,240
Thank you for the hospitality, Master Wen.

530
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,880
So you know you should say thank-you.

531
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,600
Why aren't you eating?

532
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,200
Don't you know
that having someone like you at the table

533
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,720
is really affecting our appetite?

534
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,000
But... I really don't have an appetite.

535
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,920
I really dislike spoiled people like you

536
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,840
who never experienced any hardships!

537
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,720
You're neither versed
in literacy nor in martial arts.

538
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,240
When something happens, your world falls apart!

539
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,200
If you don’t eat, you’ll be starved to death!

540
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,680
Do you think that God could be touched by you

541
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,280
so that he will punish your enemies for you?

542
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Xiang, don't bully him.

543
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,680
Just eat.

544
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,600
Master, am I wrong?

545
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
Look at that silly boy,
his head is only there for decoration!

546
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,439
Listen,

547
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,310
if you don't eat

548
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,200
to gain strength and skills,

549
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,560
are you really just counting on us outsiders

550
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,360
to avenge you?

551
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,710
Yes.

552
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,199
At home you rely on your parents,
outside you rely on friends.

553
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,400
But that's just wishful thinking.

554
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,960
Even this Tuber...

555
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,160
Master Zhou

556
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,480
won't let his generosity
get taken advantage of this much.

557
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,159
Take your time to eat,
no one is trying to steal it from you.

558
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,640
Be careful not to choke, you idiot.

559
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
Why did you start crying?

560
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Xiang!

561
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,800
It's as if bullied you.

562
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:29,801
[Chongwu Palace]

563
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:32,441
[Five Lakes World Alliance]

564
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,520
Everybody.

565
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,441
[Leaders of Haisha Gangs & Water Transport Gangs]
During my time as the leader

566
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,520
[Leaders of Gangs]
of the world's highest alliance,

567
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,601
[Disciples of Yueyang Sect, Zhu Yao Zhi, Gao Shan]
Ghost Valley attacked the Five Lakes Alliance's

568
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:48,680
[Leader of Five Lakes Alliance, Gao Chong]
Mirror Lake Sect in cruel ways.

569
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,000
They annihilated my Fourth Brother,
Zhang Yu Sen's whole family.

570
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,520
The Five Lakes Alliance has experienced

571
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,080
unprecedented shame and humiliation!

572
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,280
This debt of blood must be paid back with blood!

573
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,120
Leader is right!

574
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,360
This debt of blood must be paid back in blood!

575
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,360
Everybody!

576
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,080
Since the Battle of Mount Qingya,

577
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,120
the martial arts world and the Ghost Valley
have been in peace for more than twenty years.

578
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,520
It's because the righteous people back then

579
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,640
made an agreement with the masters
who developed Ghost Valley.

580
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,800
As long as the Ghost Valley does not harm
the people of the martial arts world,

581
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,800
the righteous people

582
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,160
will not step inside Ghost Valley!

583
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,000
But now it’s the Ghost Valley
who did harm to our world first!

584
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,360
Therefore,

585
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,560
I will hold a Heroes Conference on July 15th!

586
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,080
It's time for us to attack Mount Qingya together

587
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,000
and eradicate this cancerous evil!

588
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,560
A debt of blood must be paid back with blood!
Eradicate the cancerous evil!

589
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,280
A debt of blood must be paid back with blood!
Eradicate the cancerous evil!

590
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,770
[Leader of Mount Tai Sect, Ao Lai Zi]

591
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
Master, how is it?

592
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,880
Fortunately, we didn't find anyone suspicious.

593
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,240
How is Qing Hua?

594
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,760
He only caught a cold.

595
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,050
[Disciple of Mount Tai Sect, Qing Bai]

596
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,120
He has a little fever from time to time.

597
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,680
Master, can we set a fire?

598
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,760
Wait a bit longer.

599
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,480
It will be alright once we get to Mount Wudang.

600
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,360
Let me keep watch.

601
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,760
You are tired from the journey, please rest.

602
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm fine.

603
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,560
Because of the fire in Mirror Lake Manor,

604
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,840
Shen Shen let us get away.

605
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
But if he catches up with us again,

606
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,760
you kid won't be able to deal with him.

607
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,000
We'll just have a battle to the death.

608
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,120
Master.

609
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,040
You're too reckless!

610
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,760
Master Ao Lai Zi.

611
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,880
How about...

612
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,960
you... you just hand us over?

613
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,640
After all,
Master Shen is my uncle's sworn brother.

614
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
We are Danyang Sect's last two descendants.

615
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,840
I think

616
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,920
Five Lakes Alliance won't do anything to us.

617
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,160
Silly child.

618
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,800
Shen Shen is chasing after you relentlessly

619
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,520
to steal

620
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,160
the Glazed Armor that your master left.

621
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,920
But don't worry.

622
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,320
Since I promised to fulfill
your master's last wish,

623
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,720
I will

624
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,720
do anything in my power

625
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,960
to prevent the Glazed Armor

626
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,360
from falling into the hands
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

627
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,480
Help! Help!

628
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:51,080
Help! Help!

629
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,400
Dad!

630
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,360
Dad!

631
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,320
Uncle Zhou?

632
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,600
It's fine now.

633
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,880
Get some sleep.

634
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,250
[Bright and Blessed]

635
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,320
Brother Zhou, are you looking
for these two people?

636
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,160
I've handled everything for you.

637
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
Go back to sleep.

638
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,240
It's the Ghost Valley again.

639
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
They followed me quite closely.

640
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,960
It's difficult to tell a ghost from a human.

641
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,720
Someone wearing a ghost mask
is not necessarily a ghost.

642
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,480
Someone looks like human
may not necessarily be a human.

643
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,480
Who knows?

644
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,920
You're a true connoisseur.

645
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,240
This is the old yellow seal liquor of 30 years.

646
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,400
Can I call you Xu?

647
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,800
You are quite skilled in judging wine, Xu.

648
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,360
It's on par with my ability to judge people.

649
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,320
How about a sip of it?

650
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,280
With that judgment of yours? Just forget it.

651
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,200
My judgment of people is perfect.

652
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm sure

653
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,160
that a really big surprise

654
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,800
lies underneath

655
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,000
your outermost skin.

656
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,120
You might as well rip it off and take a look.

657
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,400
I'm in no hurry.

658
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,000
