[Word of Honor]

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,030
[Episode 19]

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,310
Is that my fault

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,910
that your wife died in childbirth?

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,630
If you hate me,

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,870
just kill me early on

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,510
to avenge your wife's death.

28
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,160
Since you decided to raise me,

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,590
why leave me to grow up with disability?

30
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,750
Even you already knew that
the Yin Yang Book can raise the dead,

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
and reverse Yin and Yang,

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
and you also knew it is in the armory,

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,670
but you never speak even a word about it,

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,670
just sit by and watch me
being a wreck for over a decade!

35
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,320
I've told you a hundred times,
but you never trusted me,

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,550
what can I do?

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,670
Healers care about patients
like parents do to children.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,910
If that Yin Yang Book
really has such miraculous effect,

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,240
why did the Healer Valley keep it a secret?

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,470
All bullshit!

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
That's just an excuse,

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,440
you even didn't try it!

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,110
You can move the Longyuan Cabinet
for your dead wife.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,390
You can bear all these years of suffering

45
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,440
for your so-called good friends,

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,080
but just cannot open that armory

47
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,360
for your living son!

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
Sorry for this.

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,910
It's my sin that I didn't teach him well,

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,720
I deserve all of this.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,670
Do you know Yue Feng Er from the Healer Valley?

52
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,320
Senior Ye,

53
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,520
Do you mean

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,470
the senior of the Three Heroes
of the Healer Valley,

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,720
the Fairy Ganoderma Yue Feng Er?

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,390
If without the Three Heroes
of the Healer Valley's help,

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,670
Yu Zhui might not say yes to marry me.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,110
Yue Feng Er,

59
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,320
is she the wife of Rong Xuan?

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,360
Yes.

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,440
A figure like her,

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,520
only my Brother Rong can be a good match.

63
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,910
So what exactly happened

64
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,240
between Rong Xuan and his wife?

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,670
You know it, right?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,910
Yes.

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,830
Master Long, I have a question,

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,160
can you help me solve that?

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Zi Shu, who is he,

70
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,960
your friend?

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,000
Uncle Long,

72
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,110
he is my close friend.

73
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,440
His name is Wen Ke Xing.

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,360
Lao Wen regards his father with hatred.

75
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,670
The situation is not clear yet,

76
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,440
should I reveal his identity?

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
You've eventually got a friend,

78
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,270
that's great.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,040
Long Xiao said at the Heroes Conference

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,070
that Gao Chong once forced and used you

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,160
to open the armory for him.

82
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,670
Is that true?

83
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,070
Where did you hear that?

84
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,550
It was twenty years ago

85
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,200
when I saw him the last time.

86
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,920
Besides, Glazed Armor is in their hands.

87
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,320
It's no use asking me to open that armory.

88
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,550
Long Xiao also said,

89
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,760
twenty years ago,

90
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,270
Rong Xuan once deceived you into
building up the armory for him.

91
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,040
Is that true?

92
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,760
Deceived me?

93
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,000
Kid,

94
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,000
don't trust him even a single word.

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,640
I helped Brother Rong

96
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,720
reconstruct the armory willingly.

97
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,350
Uncle Long,

98
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,670
twenty years ago,

99
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,160
about the origin of the armory,

100
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,830
it seems there are many false rumors
in the martial arts world.

101
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,390
Can you tell us the whole story?

102
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,230
Why did Senior Rong Xuan
insist in constructing the armory?

103
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,510
And what happened around this armory?

104
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,110
If you are curious about that,

105
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,790
I'll tell you now.

106
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,950
But, where to start?

107
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,670
It was your master Qin Huai Zhang

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,110
who knew Brother Rong first.

109
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,720
Thanks to the serendipity,

110
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,480
we got to know each other later on.

111
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,200
Together, we practiced chivalry and justice
and cracked down on evil forces,

112
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,510
that was really a free and happy time.

113
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,600
It was all because of your master

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,040
and Brother Rong,

115
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
that I, a nerd

116
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,320
could enjoy such a good time.

117
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,160
A gang of us, a beam of light,

118
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,480
how wonderful that time was?

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,000
What good had I done

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,200
that I could be one of them?

121
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,790
Uncle Long, in the armory of Senior Rong...

122
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,390
Zi Shu,

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,040
Though

124
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Brother Rong was the rock of us,

125
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,600
the armory isn't his.

126
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,040
We built for him together.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,440
The five brothers of Five Lakes Alliance
that you've just said,

128
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
was my father included in it?

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Who is your father?

130
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,000
My father is the Chevalier of Mirror Lake,
Zhang Yu Sen.

131
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,600
What? You are Yu Sen's son?

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Good boy, come and let me see.

133
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,720
Never thought that a goon like Yu Sen

134
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,230
could have such a handsome boy.

135
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,070
You must take after your mother.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,880
How is your father?

137
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,200
He's gone.

138
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,390
Uncle Long,

139
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,000
it's a long story.

140
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,350
Master Zhang died protecting the Glazed Armor.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,390
Leader Lu Tai Chong,

142
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,070
Chief Gao Chong,

143
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,880
all died because of the Glazed Armor.

144
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,920
The Ghosts of Mount Qingya
have engaged in the land of the living,

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,790
bringing a bloody storm again.

146
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,480
Panic and vendetta have flooded
this martial arts world.

147
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,920
All of these

148
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,950
are all for the two words, Glazed Armor.

149
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,550
But scrambling for it will only end up in vain.

150
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,760
Glazed Armor is merely a lock.

151
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,230
Without Brother Rong's key,

152
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,110
what's the point of having the lock?

153
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,640
Key.

154
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,440
Do you have Rong Xuan's key?

155
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,480
No.

156
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,110
No.

157
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,600
That's it,

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,200
you don't believe me, neither do they.

159
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,230
I can do nothing for it.

160
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,600
Zhui Yu's gone anyhow,

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,040
I have no desire to see people outside now.

162
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,790
Well, it's enough.

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,070
Where's the key?

164
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,160
I know but I won't tell you.

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,960
I've sworn, I can't tell anyone.

166
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,230
You have to tell me now.

167
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,550
If not?

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,000
My son killed my disciples and servants

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,030
just right before my eyes.

170
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,910
My severed legs were also to his credit.

171
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,670
What else can you do to me？

172
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,670
Senior Ye, Chevalier Ye,

173
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,440
please do not be tough on this old man.

174
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,880
He...

175
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,670
Shut up.

176
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,230
I need to figure out

177
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,470
what on earth happened?

178
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,960
You built the armory together, then?

179
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,000
How could he go crazy as everything was right?

180
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,200
Did any one of you do him any harm?

181
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,880
Old monster,

182
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,320
he doesn't want to say, why are you keeping asking?

183
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,760
You tell me now.

184
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
What's the matter with you?

185
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,520
Are you crazy?

186
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,350
I'm fed up with you,

187
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,710
and just want to punch you up now!

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
After going through all the hardship,
now the truth is coming,

189
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,470
what are you crazy about at this moment?

190
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,760
Do you know what is coming in high spirits

191
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,590
and returning after enjoying?

192
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,280
I just regretted it, I don't want to know the truth now.

193
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,000
Enough, stop fighting.

194
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,640
Wen Ke Xing, enough.

195
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,590
I must make it clear the cause of Rong Xuan's death,

196
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,520
he is my disciple.

197
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,590
Your disciple?

198
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:14,700
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

199
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,640
Mountain Closing Sword.

200
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,960
Two Heroes of the Healer Valley,

201
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,880
Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance,

202
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,840
Senior Gao,

203
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,150
I finally got you all together.

204
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,030
You belittled me, crowded me out,

205
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,150
and bossed me around like a puppet.

206
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,350
Have you ever thought

207
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,110
that one day

208
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,230
it's me who worship you.

209
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:01,840
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

210
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]
The idea of the armory is total bullshit.

211
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,790
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

212
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,230
Just because of your whim,

213
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,280
I had to shed my blood with you.

214
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,670
But you, a wild bastard，

215
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,000
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,150
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]
you have nothing to care about,

217
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,940
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

218
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,550
so you dare to offend the world of martial arts.

219
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,440
But how about us?

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,880
I've struggled for most of my life

221
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,840
to become chief of Tai Lake Sect

222
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,550
from just a poor guy.

223
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,440
But only because of you,

224
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,550
all of my efforts nearly vanished in smoke.

225
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,200
You kept the Combined Six Cultivation Power
in hand,

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,110
and didn't let us practice

227
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,230
as you failed to master it.

228
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,640
Well.

229
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,710
Then let's not practice altogether.

230
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,600
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

231
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,880
You were the cloud and I was the mud in those days,

232
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,790
you were right about everything,

233
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,670
I was wrong in doing anything.

234
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,320
But now?

235
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:04,640
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

236
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,110
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]
You are just a tablet,

237
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,720
[Rong Xuan's memorial tablet]

238
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,080
yet I'm still standing here livingly.

239
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,640
Senior Gao,

240
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,840
if you still have your soul in heaven,

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,670
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

242
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,790
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]
you'll regret after seeing all of this, won't you?

243
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,670
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

244
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,520
I've persuaded you before,

245
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,230
but you never listened to me.

246
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,910
You acted madly with Rong Xuan,

247
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,960
and trusted that dumb Shen Shen instead.

248
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,710
Why were you determined to cling to the power?

249
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,110
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

250
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,030
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]
What you get here today,

251
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,470
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

252
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,080
it's in many ways your own creation.

253
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,250
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

254
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,550
The only thing that I regret badly,

255
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,440
is that I didn't let you see all of this
when you were alive.

256
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,030
[Gao Chong's memorial tablet]

257
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
I just want all people to see,

258
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,110
only me, Zhao Jing, is the dragon among men.

259
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,440
Only me, Zhao Jing,

260
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,400
who can carry forward the Five Lakes Alliance.

261
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,280
Mountain Closing Swordsmanship.

262
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,000
You really are his master,

263
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,520
you are Ye...

264
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,200
Ye Bai Yi.

265
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,710
You are still alive!

266
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,110
Is that Combined Six Cultivation Power?

267
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,150
Combined Six Cultivation Power，
the crippled master.

268
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,000
It really exists.

269
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,670
Immortality,

270
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,080
nature and man in one.

271
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,670
Senior, your Combined Six Cultivation Method

272
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,110
is still well-kept in the armory.

273
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,590
The dead are gone.

274
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,150
Brother Rong was ignorant then
and did things wrong,

275
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,280
he felt guilty and full of remorse.

276
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,030
Guilty and remorse.

277
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,320
Foolishness!

278
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,880
Brother Rong told his wife,

279
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,550
let her find a way to send the key of Glazed Armor

280
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,110
to the master of Mount Changming,

281
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,150
tell the Senior what happened,

282
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,200
kowtow and apologize to the Senior for him.

283
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,760
Yet things went out of expectation.

284
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,150
And then?

285
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,520
What happened next?

286
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,640
Zi Shu, any alcohol?

287
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,760
Senior.

288
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,760
No sun and moon here in the mountain.

289
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,590
I have no idea,

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,710
how long ago I've drunk it the last time.

291
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
Long, stop that nonsense.

292
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,110
Just come back to the point.

293
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,520
Senior Ye, that's not nonsense.

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,960
God let me live up to now,

295
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,150
as he wants me to reveal the truth.

296
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,670
Nice one!

297
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,280
The Yellow River comes from the sky，

298
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,470
rushing into the sea and never come back.

299
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
Do you not see,

300
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,440
do you not see the mirrors bright
in chambers high,

301
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,110
grieve over your snow-white hair
though once it was silk-black?

302
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,200
I invite you to wine. Do not put down your cup！

303
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,440
Great.

304
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,550
Great.

305
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,440
Ah Shen, what are you doing?

306
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,350
[Shen Shen]

307
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,400
[Shen Shen]
Sister Yue, forgive me.

308
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,570
[Shen Shen]

309
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:34,840
[Zhen Ru Yu]

310
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,760
[Zhen Ru Yu]
Senior, let him go.

311
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,200
[Yue Feng Er]

312
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,880
[Yue Feng Er]
Right.

313
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,000
[Yue Feng Er]

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,910
Ah Shen, you are so naughty.

315
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,710
Why have to throw this wine cup?

316
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,840
There is a saying in the martial arts world,

317
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
the two beauties in the Healer Valley

318
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,790
are the incarnation
of all the valley's aura and enchantment.

319
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,230
[Gu Miao Miao]

320
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,230
So Brother Zhen Er,

321
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,760
[Long Que][Qin Huai Zhang]

322
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,670
you are the one

323
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,080
absorbing all the foolishness
and filthiness left.

324
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,280
[Zhang Yu Sen]

325
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,110
Ah Shen,

326
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,350
[Rong Xuan]

327
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,400
Ru Yu is speaking for you, don't tease him.

328
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,230
Brother Rong, am I wrong?

329
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,790
Not wrong,

330
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,230
that's just a custom

331
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,760
in the martial arts world.

332
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,640
The martial arts world.

333
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,230
[Zhao Jing]

334
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,000
[Zhao Jing]
That's interesting.

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,980
[Zhao Jing]

336
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,950
Ah Jing,

337
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,560
what're you doing? Come and drink.

338
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,110
Ah Jing,

339
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,800
Come and drink.

340
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,280
Come now.

341
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,640
Come here, Ah Jing.

342
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,280
Don't hang about, come right now.

343
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,880
Which dumbass gave himself away
when stealing books from Mount Tai?

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
No... no one saw me.

345
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:37,920
[Gao Chong]

346
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
[Gao Chong]
No one saw you.

347
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,520
[Gao Chong]

348
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
[Gao Chong]
The Mount Tai Elder has come to father

349
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,160
[Gao Chong]

350
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,950
for a claim.

351
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,920
Father has let all disciples
of Five Lakes Alliance fitting the description

352
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,310
go to the Mount Tai Sect for investigation.

353
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,470
Ah Jing,

354
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
You just can't do anything right!

355
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,800
You crap!

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,760
Ah Chong,

357
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,590
Sit.

358
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,830
Don't worry, let's give the matter further thought.

359
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
If the cat is out of the bag,

360
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,190
I'll offer my apology to the Chief.

361
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,000
I won't get you involved.

362
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,230
Calm down.

363
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,350
You can't plead guilty,

364
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,310
put aside being expelled
from master's homegate.

365
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,520
What if the master takes away your martial arts?

366
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,430
Big Brother.

367
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,640
Big Brother.

368
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,560
Just do something about it!

369
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,710
Ah Jing,

370
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
now we cannot even scold you?

371
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,560
Shouldn't you be scolded?

372
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,000
One should answer for what he does.

373
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,040
The World's Armory is my idea,

374
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,520
it's me who should take the responsibility.

375
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,710
Don't panic.

376
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,430
Take it easy.

377
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,590
The sky wouldn't fall down
as the taller will withstand it.

378
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,400
Brother Rong,

379
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,280
he's lighted a fire in our hearts,

380
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,000
burning every one of us into a devil.

381
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,070
He always talked about the sectarian bias,

382
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,000
or the rule of the martial arts world.

383
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,880
All formalities!

384
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,470
The real martial artists
should act openly and honestly.

385
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,230
In those days,

386
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,830
we were committed to
collecting the world’s best Unique Books.

387
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
Stupid!

388
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,560
Unique Books are written by humans.

389
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,800
To fight over a Secret Book
written by someone else,

390
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,160
do you think that they've got two brains,

391
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,350
or you've lost your mind?

392
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,430
Learn whatever you are taught,

393
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,000
you are really the same as
the monkey trained by the jongleur.

394
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,800
And even died for this eventually.

395
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,950
Luckily,
that little brat turned his back on himself.

396
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,000
Otherwise, I would go die

397
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,470
if I've taught such a stupid disciple.

398
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,560
Old Monster, shut up.

399
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,760
Senior, if you keep interrupting,

400
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,760
when could Uncle Long come to the point?

401
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,350
Senior Ye has his own reason.

402
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,430
Zi Shu,

403
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,350
your master expostulated us

404
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,520
almost in the same way.

405
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,880
My master,

406
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,040
he's been through so much trouble
to determine the site of the armory.

407
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,590
We changed a few places,

408
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,350
none of which were satisfactory.

409
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,310
Finally, it was your master

410
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,110
who told us about the underground palace
of the former dynasty.

411
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,880
It was transformed by me.

412
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,680
So Uncle Long,

413
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,160
You made the Glazed Armor lock?

414
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,710
No.

415
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,560
When your master
and his friends traveled around,

416
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,560
they got the Glazed Armor lock and its key.

417
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,160
Both are made with ingenuity.

418
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,640
Huai Zhang has laboured a lot
to gather them together.

419
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Though, when he opened the palace,

420
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,190
he found nothing in it.

421
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,560
So he gave it to us,

422
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,560
and that's where the armory originating from.

423
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,190
You back to the point,

424
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,310
how did Rong Xuan die?

425
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,680
His death has puzzled me

426
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,350
for years.

427
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,230
I really don't know

428
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,760
who is to blame for Brother Rong's tragedy.

429
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Well, just one round.

430
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,760
If you lose,

431
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,640
stop talking to me about that again.

432
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,760
Brother Rong, if you lose,

433
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,950
you can't regret it.

434
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Pardon me, Brother Rong.

435
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,560
Brother Rong,
you're really gonna challenge five at one time?

436
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,950
It's too much.

437
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,800
It's time-saving for me.

438
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,470
If you five lose this battle,

439
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,070
I dare you not to argue

440
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,800
for practicing the martial art
which even I can't master.

441
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,230
Cut the cackle!

442
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,560
Form the sword array!

443
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,560
Sorry, Brother Rong.

444
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,830
Ah Chong, great job, hard enough.

445
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,350
Brother Rong, enough, swords have no eyes.

446
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,560
just a flesh wound, come on.

447
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,760
You see,

448
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,920
they are into it.

449
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,560
Admit defeat or not?

450
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,160
I've told you that you're not enough
to be my opponents.

451
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,160
Brother Rong, I admit it, I admire you,

452
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,680
sincerely and heartily.

453
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Brother Rong.

454
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:56,880
My dear.

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,830
Brother Rong.

456
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,590
-Brother Rong.
-My dear.

457
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,560
-Brother Rong.
-My dear.

458
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,190
-Brother Rong.
-My dear.

459
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,830
My dear.

460
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,520
Triplex corpses poison.

461
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,310
What?

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,400
How come the triplex corpses poison
appeared here?

463
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,230
What?

464
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,230
Who?

465
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,800
Who is it?

466
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,800
Who?

467
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,830
Who hurt my dear?

468
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,710
Gao Chong,

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
You?

470
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,350
Why did you harm my dear?

471
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,110
I didn't do anything.

472
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,520
My dear's blood is on your sword.

473
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
What nonsense, not me.

474
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,590
Senior Gao,

475
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,430
Why?

476
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,590
Why did you kill him?

477
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,560
Senior Gao,

478
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,710
It's not me!

479
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,560
It's not me!

480
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,070
Why would I do this?

481
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,070
Master Long.

482
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,710
So they really just competed,

483
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,310
not tried to kill each other.

484
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,520
We were in deep friendship then,

485
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,280
why would we kill each other?

486
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,230
Was Gao Chong the one poisoning him?

487
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,590
To this,

488
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,160
I've asked myself thousand times.

489
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,710
But I believe him,

490
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,280
he wouldn't hurt Brother Rong at any rate.

491
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,190
He had no reason to kill him.

492
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,760
Uncle Long, please excuse me for being blunt,

493
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,160
Gao Chong did have the reason for poisoning him.

494
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,000
He longed for the Combined
Six Cultivation Method for a long time,

495
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,280
but no one has got it.

496
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,400
After Brother Rong being poisoned,

497
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,160
his wife drove all five of them out

498
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,950
as she hated them.

499
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,590
The armory could only be opened by all six of them.

500
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,470
Six of them?

501
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,280
Right, five of them
kept part of the Glazed Armor respectively.

502
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,710
Brother Rong kept the key himself.

503
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,160
Since they split up,

504
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,000
the armory has never been opened again.

505
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,880
And the Combined Six Cultivation Method

506
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,760
was also remained in the armory from then.

507
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,280
Even put aside their close friendship,

508
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,640
why did Gao Chong have to harm others?

509
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,400
If not him, then who?

510
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,280
Lao Wen,

511
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,350
is there anything wrong?

512
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Lao Wen.

513
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,350
Triplex corpses poison can
just turn people into walking corpses.

514
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,560
Then who made him go crazy later?

515
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,950
Just say it out,

516
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,160
even it's the King of Heaven, or the Jade Emperor,

517
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,470
I will not spare him.

518
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
If you really want to find an answer, it's Lady Rong.

519
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,800
How could it be?

520
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,040
My father once told me,

521
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Lady Rong is a very nice person.

522
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
They are a very affectionate couple.

523
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,880
Yes, that's the reason.

524
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,350
For saving her loved one,

525
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,520
Lady Rong finally decided
to use the Forbidden Technique.

526
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,710
That's an act against the God's will
which'll be definitely bound to cause disaster.

527
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,800
The Yin Yang Book.

528
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,310
Its miraculous power can even save the one

529
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,280
with poison running into the heart.

530
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,430
Then how about those with wilted meridians?

531
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,040
He always bears in mind.

532
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,920
If that Yin Yang Book really has
such miraculous effect,

533
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,400
then why did the Healer Valley
not use it to save lives?

534
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,190
But instead,
they banned it as a Forbidden Technique.

535
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,560
The so-called raising the dead,
reversing Yin and Yang,

536
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,950
can only become true
abiding the law of life-for-life.

537
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,430
If you wanna save one's meridians,

538
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,070
you have to take a heart out

539
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,400
from another living man.

540
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:11,680
Who knows that Brother Rong
was increasingly insane later.

541
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,950
He killed his wife by mistake.

542
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,800
Impossible!

543
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Rong Xuan killed his own wife.

544
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,470
If Brother Rong had not made such a great mistake,

545
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,560
losing his last shred of sanity in over-remorse,

546
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,760
he wouldn't completely go in an evil way,

547
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,800
and be chased by the world's heroes.

548
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,710
How about Yue Feng Er's juniors?

549
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,470
Why didn't they stop them?

550
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,710
The Yin Yang Book is
the Forbidden Technique of the Healer Valley.

551
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,230
Since Lady Rong used it privately,

552
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,520
she couldn't come back to the
Healer Valley for the rest of her life.

553
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,070
So the Divine Hand couple
came back to the Healer Valley for her

554
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,160
to seek the antidote.

555
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,590
The key of the armory was then

556
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,800
returned to the Healer Valley by the Zhen couple.

557
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,680
It's only God's game.

558
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,880
When the tragedy passed to the ear of Ru Yu,

559
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:17,000
the battle of Mount Qingya
was only a few days away.

560
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,280
He galloped and whipped for day and night,

561
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,040
only could catch up...

562
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,260
[Mount Qingya]

563
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,470
Who’s there?

564
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,230
Come on!

565
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,040
Come.

566
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,800
Wait.

567
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,950
I'll kill you.

568
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,430
Kill you!

569
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,000
Big Brother,

570
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,000
Brother Rong.

571
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,110
-No.
-Brother Rong!

572
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,920
Big Brother,

573
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,190
No, no, no.

574
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,640
Brothers.

575
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,520
What're you doing? Why protect him? Go away!

576
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,760
I'm Zhen Ru Yu from the Healer Valley,

577
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,880
I know you all more or less.

578
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,520
The Healer Valley has saved lives for decades,

579
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,400
I believe we've made lots of good affinities.

580
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,230
Your family and friends

581
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,000
have also received the favor
from the Healer Valley and me.

582
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,070
So, for my sake,

583
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,880
please listen to me for just one word.

584
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,280
It's better to get rid of
an enmity than keep it alive.

585
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,280
There must be something wrong
about Brother Rong going crazy,

586
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,190
it's not in his nature.

587
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,110
Such a big talk.

588
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,800
Why should we believe you?

589
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,160
Please be quiet, everyone.

590
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,800
The wrong is gone.

591
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,230
An eye for an eye approach
can only stoke deeper hatred.

592
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life

593
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,710
in cleaning Brother Rong's sin.

594
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,880
If he killed anyone from any Sect,

595
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,190
I definitely will pay back
with saving others' lives.

596
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,280
I will take Brother Rong back
to the Healer Valley for rest-cure,

597
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,350
and won't let him stir up trouble again.

598
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,710
About the battle in Mount Qingya,

599
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,520
in the name of hunting the demon,

600
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,190
they hunted down Rong Xuan.

601
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,640
But actually, they did it for the key to the armory.

602
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,950
Unexpectedly they gained nothing
due to the death of Senior Rong,

603
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,520
so they turned to target at Senior Zhen

604
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,560
and  fell out with the Healer Valley

605
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,800
to compel Senior Zhen.

606
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,310
There was no trade-off
between loyalty and rightness.

607
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,310
Brother Zhen would rather die than blow the gab.

608
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,110
These so-called righteous clans
in the world of martial arts

609
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,400
excused that good and evil were at daggers drawn,

610
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,160
and forced the aged valley chief
to place righteousness above family loyalty.

611
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,800
Actually, they were threatening
the couple of Zhen

612
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,710
with the Healer Valley.

613
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,400
As the rumors went,

614
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,350
the couple of the second disciple of
Healer Valley lost on the stoop

615
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,470
and made friends with bandits.

616
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,520
So the old valley chief abolished
their martial arts

617
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,190
and kicked them out.

618
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,040
The old valley chief passed away soon.

619
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,160
From then on,
the far-famed Healer Valley went to the dogs.

620
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,520
It explains the matter.

621
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,070
Lost on the stoop?

622
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,040
Divine Hand Zhen Ru Yu has spent
his whole life saving others.

623
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,350
Thousands of people
are under the obligation to him.

624
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,280
Throughout the whole country,

625
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,920
no one could claim to be

626
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,950
nobler than Brother Zhen.

627
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,520
It's exactly his nobility and kindness

628
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,310
that made him incompatible with the secular.

629
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,070
When this news reached Longyuan Cabinet,

630
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,560
Mrs. Zhen has been gone

631
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,680
with her wounded husband and vulnerable infant.

632
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,430
So Uncle Long,

633
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,520
As the rumors went,

634
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,950
The message that Longyuan Cabinet
figured out ways to open the armory

635
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,830
was issued by you, right?

636
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,350
You were afraid that they wouldn't give up

637
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,400
and still targeted at the family of Zhen,

638
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,040
so you undertook

639
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,590
all of the trouble alone.

640
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,230
You gave up the promising future
of Longyan Cabinet

641
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,430
and moved it here.

642
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,800
That's why the disaster came to you now.

643
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,040
Better late than never!

644
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,950
This was the best way I could figure out.

645
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Except this,

646
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,950
I could do nothing for them.

647
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,680
I have never heard from them ever again.

648
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,560
I tried all ways to find them
but failed eventually.

649
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,110
I wish nothing but that
they have hidden somewhere

650
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,880
and lived a peaceful life.

651
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,310
I wish them to be out of chaos and turmoil.

652
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,110
Uncle Long,

653
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,110
for  friends,

654
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,430
you could sacrifice like this.

655
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
You're so faithful to friends,

656
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
as well as the life and death friendship.

657
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,830
you're exactly acting like that.

658
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,000
Owning a friend like you in my life

659
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,640
will help to be gratified

660
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,830
even in the dwelling place of the dead.

661
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,230
Senior Ye, I didn't cover up intentionally.

662
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,110
It's just that I'm not sure where the key is.

663
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,710
Although I have promised Brother Rong

664
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,560
to send back the key to the armory,

665
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,640
I was strong in will but weak in power.

666
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,230
Please forgive me.

667
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,390
No need to apologize.

668
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,560
Rong Xuan is an idiot, so are you!

669
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,840
Armory?

670
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,040
Key.

671
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,870
Secret Book?

672
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,910
Do you think I really care for it?

673
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,280
Senior, you are superb in martial arts,

674
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,910
so the armory means nothing to you.

675
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,000
However,

676
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,910
this is regret in my heart!

677
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,950
Long,

678
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,600
You are a nice man!

679
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,040
It's Rong Xuan who tied you down.

680
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,190
Tell me your wish,

681
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,760
I will try means to realize it for you!

682
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,230
I have nothing to wish for now.

683
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:59,230
I'm lack for nothing but death.

684
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,760
Senior,

685
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,000
I have an unsolvable question.

686
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,670
Since Brother Rong was gifted
and you're his master,

687
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,000
and you were adept at
Combined Six Cultivation Power,

688
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,560
why didn't you teach him?

689
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,190
Although Bro Rong have left
by sneaking the Secret Book,

690
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,870
it's easy to understand his behavior.

691
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,710
Let alone the fact
Bro Rong was a life-time Kongfu addict.

692
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,320
No martial artist

693
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,390
could resist the charm of
the unity of man and nature.

694
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,080
Nature and man in one.

695
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,630
It won't help escape from the cat-and-mouse fate.

696
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,630
On top of Mount Changming, it’s so cold and lonely.

697
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,760
In order to please him,

698
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,760
I taught him martial arts
without reservation,

699
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,390
but I stopped him from practicing
Combined Six Cultivation Method.

700
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,840
Because of this,
the brat has been at odds with me for times,

701
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,150
and eventually left by sneaking the Secret Book.

702
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,000
Combined Six Cultivation Method,
the crippled master.

703
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,630
The name of this wicked martial art

704
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,600
has given a hint of warning for the successors.

705
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,080
If it were a stunt,

706
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,190
how could I haven't given it to him?

707
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,360
It's all our fault!

708
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,520
Both his father and I had pampered him too much.

709
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,120
This little brat

710
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
might have thought it’s not a big deal,

711
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,230
and planned to come back

712
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,910
after the gliding days

713
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,910
took away our anger.

714
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,430
In the early years,

715
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,320
we bore the same thought.

716
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,000
However, none of us have expected…

717
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,710
If it's a stunt,

718
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,320
I wouldn't have hidden it from him.

719
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,520
Besides this Combined Six Cultivation Method,

720
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,520
even all the secret books of all ages
have been laid ahead,

721
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,430
I wouldn't…

722
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,470
Fine, forget about it.

723
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,950
I only regret that, due to hesitation,

724
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,150
I didn't tear up the Secret Book of this Method.

725
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,000
Senior.
