00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,790
itself is bitter.

187
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,710
Oh, my God, two idiots!

188
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,710
Don't you know you have to clean up
all the internal organs

189
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,400
before grilling the fish?

190
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,030
If the gall of a fish breaks,
the fish must be bitter.

191
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,590
I'm speechless.

192
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,470
You've always been waited on in your lives,
haven't you?

193
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,640
Where is your Master?

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,840
It's quick for people to follow bad examples.

195
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,000
Xu.

196
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
Such a beautiful night

197
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,470
is suitable for drinking and singing.

198
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,150
How can you just eat this junk food?

199
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,030
Tai Lake is famous for its fish and shrimp.

200
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,910
I happen to have a famous chef on board.

201
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,840
Why not ask him to make us some delicious food.

202
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,280
Young Master Zhang,
I haven't seen you for just one day,

203
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
and you seem

204
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,520
to have grown taller.

205
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,760
Xiang.

206
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,470
You

207
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,590
should learn how to serve others
from those two sisters when you are free.

208
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,150
This is also a discipline.

209
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,640
Was I awe-inspiring

210
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,470
when I came out today?

211
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,960
Master, I am stupid,

212
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,000
you know it.

213
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,000
If you think those two sisters serve well,

214
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,200
just go to them.

215
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,280
The clouds in the sky are like white clothes.

216
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,430
After a while, it seems to be a dog.

217
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,230
It has been the same since ancient times,

218
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,430
and all kinds of things will happen in the world.

219
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,279
Rumor has it that Rong Chang Qing,
the former Magic Craftsman,

220
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,109
created three masterpieces all his life.

221
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,470
Namely, the Great Wild Land,

222
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,760
the Dragon Back

223
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,590
and the White Cloth.

224
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,800
Back then, Qin Huai Zhang,
the last leader of Four Seasons Manor,

225
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,070
galloped around with the sword,
White Cloth, in the martial arts world.

226
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,880
After the annihilation of Four Seasons Manor,

227
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,190
this famous sword disappeared.

228
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,680
Xu. Let me tell you.

229
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,400
I saw that your sword
was very similar to the White Cloth.

230
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I thought the beggars of Beggar Gangs
were rubbish

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,520
and vulnerable to a single blow.

232
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,760
I wanted to wait for you
to draw your sword and confirm it.

233
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,160
But to my surprise,

234
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,950
you'd rather take risks than draw swords.

235
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't you

236
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,680
want to kill those beggars?

237
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,920
I thought about it.

238
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,950
There are only two reasons.

239
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,760
First, this sword

240
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,110
is not yours.

241
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,950
Of course,

242
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,070
how could you

243
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,160
do such a dirty thing?

244
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,350
Then there is only the second explanation.

245
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,040
Why are you afraid

246
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,400
to reveal your whereabouts?

247
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,160
Master Wen.

248
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,680
Our relationship

249
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,760
is like this fish.

250
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,680
Do you know why?

251
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,470
Raw*.
(* Lit.: Unacquainted)

252
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,520
Ever since we met,

253
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,760
I don't even know

254
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
who I am,

255
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,800
where I'm from

256
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,830
and where I'm going.

257
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,230
Who are you?

258
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Where do you come from?

259
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,110
Where are you going?

260
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,230
I'm not interested.

261
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,470
You helped me many times.

262
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,400
Thank you very much.

263
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,560
If you are insatiable

264
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,110
and want to see White Cloth,

265
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,880
you don't have to waste your words.

266
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,830
Xu.

267
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,640
Why are you so grumpy today?

268
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,680
It's all my fault.

269
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,430
I shouldn't have deliberately tested you

270
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,830
and hurt you internally.

271
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,110
It hurts me, too.

272
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,190
Just forgive me this time.

273
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,470
It won't happen again.

274
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,110
I should have asked you

275
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,950
what I wanted to know.

276
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,920
My Xu won't lie to me, right?

277
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,880
Yun Cai! Hong Lu!

278
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,070
Phantom Musician Qin Song.

279
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,040
One of the Four Assassins.

280
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,950
It is surprising that this man
can order this evil.

281
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,470
That's pretty good.

282
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,110
No matter who he is,

283
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,920
it is enough for him to counter phagocytosis.

284
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,800
Xu.

285
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,070
You are more and more to my taste.

286
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,710
I'm sorry to get your flute dirty.

287
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,950
I'll find a new one for you some other time.

288
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,430
Never mind.

289
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,470
But Xu, you are good at martial arts,

290
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,350
but you are tone-deaf.

291
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,430
I'll teach you sometime.

292
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,040
No need.

293
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,590
Feel better?

294
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,640
Let's go. Sit down for a while.

295
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,710
Uncle Zhou. I still feel terrible.

296
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,920
Cheng Ling. How old are you?

297
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm 14 years old.

298
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,110
The disciples of the martial arts family
begin to study at the age of five to seven.

299
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,230
Even if you begin to practice
internal skills at the age of seven,

300
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,710
you have been practicing for seven years.

301
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
How come you are like this?

302
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,920
Don't cry.

303
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,000
There, there.

304
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,430
Children are fond of play.

305
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,560
When I was a child, my parents
taught me to practice hard,

306
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,560
I was also lazy all day.

307
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,230
Why am I never fond of playing?

308
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,040
Silly boy.

309
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,920
Have you ever heard that

310
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,070
the one who dislikes you
is the one who is really good to you?

311
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,190
Your Uncle Zhou scolded you for not working hard

312
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,040
just to enlighten you.

313
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,590
Be smart.

314
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,280
Uncle Zhou.

315
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,680
Master, please accept me as a disciple.

316
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,400
I will work hard.

317
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,400
I'll absolutely live up to your kindness to me.

318
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,710
Stand up.

319
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,760
You are the Mirror Lake Sect's orphan.

320
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,760
You shoulder the important task of inheriting.

321
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,070
How can I teach you?

322
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,230
I haven't joined a Sect yet.

323
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,430
My Big Brother is good at martial arts.

324
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,110
Second Brother is a good reader.

325
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,000
I thought

326
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,400
I was only responsible for staying
with my parents for filial piety all my life.

327
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
So I never learned martial arts well.

328
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,350
I haven't learned much

329
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
about the martial arts of the Mirror Lake Sect.

330
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,520
The tree wants to be still,
but the wind keeps blowing.

331
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,760
When the children want to fulfill
their filial piety, their parents have died.

332
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,230
Most things in the world are like this.

333
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,640
Even so,

334
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,950
you should join the Five Lakes Alliance.

335
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,830
No, Master. I just want to turn to you.

336
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,560
Please accept me as a disciple.

337
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,800
Stand up.

338
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,830
I'll say it for the last time.

339
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,710
Stand up!

340
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,880
You have missed

341
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,590
the best time to learn the basics.

342
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,230
I'm afraid

343
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,950
it's hard for you
to learn the best martial arts in your life.

344
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,070
Don't talk nonsense.

345
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,310
Silly boy, you have to understand
what your Uncle Zhou meant.

346
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,000
The best martial arts he meant

347
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,190
was like the martial arts of Bodhidharma
and Changming Sword Immortal.

348
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,760
Few people can reach that state.

349
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,800
It won't be a problem for you

350
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,760
to work hard from now on
to reach the same level as mine.

351
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,110
Although you are right,

352
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,470
there are two ways to learn martial arts well.

353
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,280
One is to practice since your childhood.

354
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Another is to practice from today on.

355
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,950
Your martial arts will get better day by day.

356
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,470
Today you were bewitched by Magic Sound

357
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,160
and suffered some internal injuries.

358
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,680
I'll teach you some basic mental skills.

359
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,800
If you adjust your breath
according to mind method, it can treat the injury.

360
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,470
Xu. I already knew that.

361
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,640
You are firm in speech but soft in the heart.

362
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,640
Come on.

363
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,110
Are you okay?

364
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,000
Brother Wen, aren't you going to have a look?

365
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,400
It's okay.

366
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,190
Xiang can handle it herself.

367
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,710

afraid of?

than the water in this cup.

And you want me to play?

450
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,040

that you gained.

that you saved a dog when you were a child?

458
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,430
I'd been forcing you to throw it away,
but you didn't.

459
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
Then the dog was stewed and eaten.

460
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,160
You cried for three months.

461
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,070
I still have the same attitude.

462
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,160
If you've made a promise to it

463
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,430
but you can't take care of it
for the rest of your life,

464
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,920
you might as well finish it ahead of time.

because you thought
there was something wrong with him.

470
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,430
Now you wear out the internal force

471
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,190
to play the flute for others.

472
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,590
I don't know if the beggar is grateful.

473
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,190
It's none

474
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,800

475
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,070
Can't I just like him

476
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,280
and want to make friends with him?

477
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Once you get into it, you know the consequences.

478
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,280
I haven't slept so well for a long time.

479
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,630
You woke up, Xu?

480
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,080
Did you sleep well?

481
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,709
After playing the flute all night,

482
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,800
I was a little slow.

483
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,840
Forgive me.

484
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,840
Why were you playing the flute all night?

485
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,280
I deliberately tested you yesterday

486
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,840
and caused your internal injuries.

487
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,230
After one night, you should feel much better.

488
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,040
It can be regarded as guilty
of meritorious service.

489
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,560
Don't be mad at me.

490
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,430

Yesterday I just taught you some internal skills

495

to resolve your internal injuries.

496
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,670

00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
did that scare you?

503

Don't you know that

504
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,950
your Master is a man
who's firm in speech but soft in the heart?

505
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,470
Haunt him.

506
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,280
Haven't you heard that tough women
are afraid of clingy men?

507
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,670
Where there is a will, there is a way!

508
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,390
Come on!

509
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,430
Master. Please accept me as a disciple.

510
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,080
Are you going or not?

511
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,150
What are you doing?

512
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
Xu, you're so cruel.

513
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,800
Will you leave me alone in the wilderness?

514
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,520
Are you still short of servants?

515
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,230
No one cares about me now.

She thought I was annoying.

518
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,120
She drove me off the boat.

519
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,710
I don't believe you.

520
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,630
As a matter of fact, Xiang blamed me for
not taking care of my own body,

521
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,000
playing the flute all night.

522
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,840
So she drove me off the boat.

523
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,430
I feel a little pain in public region right now.

524
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,630
Is it a loss of energy?

525
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,950
Xu. Just give me a lift.

526
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,760
Steady.

527
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,080
Master Zhou. Lie down well.

528
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,630
You're a good driver.

529
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Xu, you are good at everything,

530
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,760
but you don't know how to enjoy life.

531
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,190
Eating and drinking are the happiest things
in life.

532
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,150
Why do you always do them so casually?

533
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,430
It is up to you.

534
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,870
Hu is just ahead.

535
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,670
If you are not satisfied, you can leave.

536
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,910
How could I not be satisfied with you?

537
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,470
I am distressed.

538
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,630
I'm worried about Cheng Ling

539
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,950
who lost weight because he couldn't eat well
or sleep well these days!

540
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,870
Look at his face.

541
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,280
When you were a mater, you looked fair.

542
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
In just a few days, you've become so thin.

543
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,120
We are approaching Hu.

544
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,870
We'll find a restaurant

545
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,360
and have a good meal.

546
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,800
How about my treat?

547
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,870
Since you have had a fight with the Beggar Gangs,

548
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,470
I'm sure a lot of people are looking for you

549
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,670
because they are well-informed.

550
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,630
In order to avoid complications,

551
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,320
you'd better put up with it.

552
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,630
We'll be fine when I get to Zhao Jing's mansion.

553
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,950
Master. Please accept me as a disciple.

554
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,150
Little Cheng Ling.

555
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,150
I didn't expect

556
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,950
that you are so tough.

557
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,150
If I had the ability to haunt people like you.

558
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,280
Uncle Wen, I don't want to leave you.

559
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,080
Don't worry.

560
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,470
I watched the celestial phenomena at night,

561
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,800
pinching and counting,

562
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,600
and found that our fate

563
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,950
had not ended.

564
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,520
Master!

565
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,080
Ao Lai Zi. Stop running!

566
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,040
At such an old age, don't you understand?

567
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,630
Lu Tai Chong is unkind.

568
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,430
If he dies, he'll take you, too.

569
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,800
I'm telling you, stay out of this.

570
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,470
You can't do it.

571
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,760
Can you?

572
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,760
What a joke.

573
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,630
Even if our Mount Tai Sect becomes weak,

574
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,630
I won't be afraid of you.

575
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,710
Don't delay.

576
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,280
Go to find Master Zhao.

577
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,150
You got involved in trouble for our Danyang Sect,

578
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,390
so we can't abandon you and leave.

579
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,840
We are going up and down together!

580
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
Together!

581
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,470
Ao Lai Zi.

582
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,800
Your internal force is exhausted now,
and you are very weak.

583
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,040
What else can you do?

584
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,120
We are bound to win the Glazed Armor.

585
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,870
Why not keep abreast of the times?

586
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,710
Tao Hong, Lv Liu.

587
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,470
Opponents always meet.

588
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,710
Uncle Shen.

589
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,120
Ao Lai Zi is also an expert.

590
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Why are you so scared all the way?

591
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,950
It turned out that it was the leader
of Mountain Dagu

592
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,600
who was chasing Mount Tai Sect.

593
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,150
Master Shen. If today's story spreads out,

594
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,520
I don't think your Five Lakes Alliance
will be respected.

595
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,520
Let's see if you can spread it out alive.

596
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,520
Qing Bai, let's go. OK.

597
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,850
[Sanbai Manor]

598
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,150
I heard a long time ago
that Chevalier Sanbai is the richest in the world.

599
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,840
It is really magnificent,

600
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,080
and even a little elegant.

601
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,190
Master, these are the two righteous men

602
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,520
[Tai Lake Sect of Five Lakes Alliance, Zhao Jing]
who found Cheng Ling.

603
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,710
You've grown up!

604
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,080
Cheng Ling.

605
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,080
I'm your father's best brother.

606
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,910
I am Zhao Jing.

607
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,520
Just call me Uncle Zhao.

608
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,360
Are you Uncle Zhao?

609
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,760
Cheng Ling, you've suffered.

610
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,150
From now on, you'll make yourself at home.

611
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,320
Just tell me

612
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,280
what you want.

613
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,800
Masters, I was rude.

614
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,950
Thank you for escorting Cheng Ling back.

615
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,950
I won't forget your great kindness!

616
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,190
Please accept my worship.

617
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,430
You're welcome.

618
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,840
Hearing about your elegant demeanor
for a long time,

619
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,870
it is better for me to hear than to see.

620
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,870
Chevalier Zhao. Chevalier Zhao. Chevalier Zhao.

621
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,690
