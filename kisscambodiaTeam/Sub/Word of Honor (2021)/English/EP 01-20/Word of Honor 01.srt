00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,520
and our lord for the rest of my life.

186
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,129
What did you call me?

187
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,410
My lord.

188
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,470
No, Leader.

189
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,630
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,020
I thought the elders called you that.

191
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,860
The last person from Four Seasons Manor is gone.

192
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,080
Don't ever say "my lord" again.

193

♪The East Wind blew my heart to the empty city♪

194
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:07,250
♪Fall silently on earth♪

195
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,190
[It's been ten years.]

196
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,190
[Ten years on this path of no return.]

197
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,800
[I remember each face of the people
from Four Seasons Manor who died.]

198
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,630
[They're all dead.]

199
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,630
[Except me.]

200
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,630
[Why?]

201
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,750
[Because I don't even deserve to die.]

202
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,910
[It serves me right to keep living.]

203
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,250
[The Leader of the Window of Heaven.]

204
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,410
[A man of extremely high status.]

205
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,630
[I live with honor and power,]

206
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,970
[but can't even save
a single person I want to protect.]

207

♪People are all gone in an instant♪

211
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,416
[Lichun Palace]

212
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,470
[Prince Jin]
Why doesn't Zi Shu come to see me?

213
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,750
[Prince Jin]
Has he still not recovered?

214
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,470
Your Highness.

215
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,910
The traitor has rallied many people

216
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,630
who are skilled at martial arts.

217
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,800
Leader hasn't fought anyone for a long time.

218
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,910
It must have aggravated his injuries this time.

219
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,580
He has been taking rest in isolation these days.

220
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,750
Since he spat blood and fainted

221
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,580
at the news of Qin Jiu Xiao's death,

222
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,020
how long have his injuries lasted?

223
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,750
About a year, right?

224
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,910
Your Highness.

225
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,020
Yes.

226
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,520
He becomes like this just for Qin Jiu Xiao.

227
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,630
He won't be of great use.

228
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,020
Tell him to come to see me as soon as possible.

229
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,080
Yes.

230
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,750
[The flowers blossom in all four seasons,]

231
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,360
[knowing everything in the world.]

232
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,690
[Eighty-one of our brothers
came to Jin with you.]

233
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,750
[Now it's just you and me.]

234
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,910
[Even Jiu Xiao is dead.]

235
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,020
[What Four Seasons Manor can there be?]

236
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,860
[In order to leave the Window of Heaven,]

237
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,860
[I spent a year and a half]

238
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,080
[to put the Nails of Seven Torments in my body.]

239
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,190
[There are actually two ways to put in the nails.]

240
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,360
[If you put all seven nails in at once,]

241
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,750
[the person being tortured
will quickly lose his senses,]

242
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,750
[and he can only live as a cripple for three years.]

243
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,020
[But if you put in one nail every three months]

244
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,360
[to let the nail get into your body gradually]

245
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,520
[and become part of your body,]

246
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,580
[though you will still have three years left,]

247
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,130
[you will retain half of your martial arts,]

248
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,630
[and your senses
will only disappear in turn slowly]

249
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,470
[until death.]

250
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,190
[You just have to endure the extreme pain]

251
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,690
[that will last
for three years and another 18 months.]

252
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,580
Senior.

253
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,750
Don't do that.

254
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,250
Jiu Xiao?

255
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,630
Why are you crying?

256
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,690
What's there to cry about?

257
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,190
It's all my fault.

258
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,690
The eighty-one brothers from Four Seasons Manor

259
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,630
all died

260
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,250
in my hands.

261
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,360
Our heritage is terminated.

262
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,020
I couldn't protect any of you.

263
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,750
I even killed your lover.

264
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,520
After I die,

265
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,470
how can I face you?

266
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,800
I wonder

267
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,410
if you've met Princess Jing An on your side.

268
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,750
She's telling on me, right?

269
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,630
How could there be
such a cruel senior like me?

270
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,470
How could I give
a bottle of poison to my sister-in-law

271
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
as our meeting gift?

272
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,190
Guard Zhou Zi Shu is here!

273
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,020
Come in.

274
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

275
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,860
Please get up.

276
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,860
You really

277
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,410
don't look well. Take a rest.

278
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,800
You are a pillar of this country.

279
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,690
I need your help to achieve my goals.

280
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,130
I was an ordinary man,

281
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,910
only fit to be your weapon.

282
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,970
Now that Hedong is peaceful,

283
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,360
you need people who know about government.

284
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,130
I can only fight,

285
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,360
and can't be of great help to you.

286
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,800
Zi Shu, what do you mean?

287
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
Zi Shu!

288
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,470
My will is broken.

289
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,630
My wounds are not recovering,
and I can't do much now.

290
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,130
I want to return to my hometown.

291
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,020
I've already left the Window of Heaven.

292
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,360
I asked for the punishment
of the Nails of Seven Torments,

293
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,750
and allowed it myself.

294
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
I've already

295
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,860
put six nails in.

296
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,690
If I put in one more,

297
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,250
I'm afraid I can't get to say goodbye to you.

298
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,360
Given my past efforts,

299
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,470
I hope you can

300
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,250
fulfill my wish.

301
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,910
Good.

302
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,860
Very good.

303
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,470
Zhou Zi Shu.

304
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,190
No wonder you're the Leader
of the Window of Heaven.

305
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,750
You're cruel and decisive,

306
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,020
even willing to hurt yourself like this.

307
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,520
Your Highness, please calm down.

308
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,630
If you don't want to live,

309
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,130
I can let you die!

310
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,020
Why go through all this trouble?

311
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,910
You saved my life.

312
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,630
If you want,

313
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,190
I can live like this for two more years.

314
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,800
If you don't,

315
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,250
then take my life.

316
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,860
You all lied to me!

317
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,130
Yun Xing left.

318
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,860
Bei Yuan...

319
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,630
Bei Yuan is gone too.

320
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,580
I'm really alone in this world now.

321
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,630
Zi Shu, you were lying to me, right?

322
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,250
If I spare you,

323
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,750
are you willing to help me

324
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,860
to achieve my goals?

325
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Please give me the last nail.

326
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,630
You'd rather be a cripple

327
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,250
that my trusted official?

328
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,470
Fine!

329
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,800
I understand your intention.

330
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,520
Nails of Seven Torments, death in three years.

331
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,750
Zhou Zi Shu, you have to stay alive.

332
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Three years.

333
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,520
Within three years,

334
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,020
I will definitely go there and ascend the throne!

335
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,910
I'm going to show you

336
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,190
that I am the chosen one,

337
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,020
and I will be successful no matter what!

338
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,750
I will try my best.

339
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,470
Peng Ju, do as he says.

340
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,300
From now on, you are the Leader
of the Window of Heaven.

341
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,800
Leader. He means...

342
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,360
Congratulations to us both.

343
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,860
We both got what we wanted today.

344
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,020
The rivers flow.
The window leads to the underworld.

345
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,580
Rumors endanger justice. The clouds hide the sun.

346
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,360
You just wait, Zhou Zi Shu.

347
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,970
I will let you go for now.
