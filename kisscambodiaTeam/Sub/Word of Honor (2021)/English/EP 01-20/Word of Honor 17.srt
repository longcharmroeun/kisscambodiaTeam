[Episode 17]

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Xiang!

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,320
Why are you up?

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,040
Xiang.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Xiang. Luckily you're fine.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,520
I dreamed that I didn't protect you well.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,120
Why is it so painful?

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,160
Lie properly.

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,480
You were beaten up into a sieve

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,560
and were unconscious for the past few days.

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,920
Who can you protect?

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,640
Xiang, I dreamed a lot

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,640
and couldn't wake up.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
I didn't manage to protect you
in every of my dreams.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,800
I was so anxious.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
I even died

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
in my last dream.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,400
I was waiting for you happily at
the Bridge of Helplessness.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,320
I thought I have to wait for 60 or 70 years,

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,360
till you become an elderly woman with white hair.

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,800
But, not long later, you came.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
I thought, "No way.

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
Aren't you too young to die?"

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,680
I was panicking.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,880
Are you cursing me?

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm not.

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,440
Knock on wood.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,600
Xiang.

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
You're so kind.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
You will live a long life.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,960
Where's Sister Xiao Lian?

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,120
She was abducted by the two old demons.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,040
We need to save her!

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,960
Forget it.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,520
Lie down!

57
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
You're half dead. Who can you save?

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,480
Who saved me?

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Was it my master?

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
Where are my masters?

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,160
Enough, my boy.

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Leader Yu of the Mount Hua Sect saved you.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,080
Rest here nicely. Don't move around.

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll go and get some medicine for you.

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,120
Miss Gu, is Nephew Cao feeling better?

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,880
He's fine.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,280
That's great.

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,960
Nephew Cao is a chivalrous man.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,480
This is the courtyard of the Mount Hua Sect.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
Let him rest here at ease.

71
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Enough, Leader Yu.

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,160
I've told him.

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,040
Stop making your life hard

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,320
and being "pretendious" in front of
a little siren like me.

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,480
Help yourself.

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,160
Xiang, it's "pretentious".

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
Alright.

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
You can chat here.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,520
I shall not disturb Nephew Cao.

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Sister Qian Qiao, can't you save my face

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
in front of an outsider?

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,840
Xiang, you're still so uneducated.

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,480
How can you be a good match of a nobleman?

84
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Who wants to be his match?

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
I can even be a good match of a prince.

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,560
That idiot...

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Yes.

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
Even the emperor don't deserve to have you.

89
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,840
Look. Even our Heartless Amethyst Fiend

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,040
would feel sad.

91
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Xiang. Listen to my advice.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,880
It's urgent now, we shall only think about
the present.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
Young Master Cao is injured.

94
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,600
You shall stay at the courtyard of
the Mount Hua Sect first.

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll settle my master first.

96
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Sister Qian Qiao.

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
Why did the leader of the Mount Hua Sect

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,800
save Aunt Luo with you?

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,240
How did you convince him?

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Give me some hints

101
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,880
in case I make mistakes later.

102
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
His son was killed by
the Five Lakes Alliance.

103
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,840
I promised to help him with his revenge,

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,520
so he helped me to save my master.

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,040
That's all?

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,360
I think that man is really cunning.

107
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Sister, you'd better be careful.

108
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,000
My kind Xiang.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,680
Stop worrying about me.

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,680
Go and take care of Young Master Cao.

111
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Yes, I'm going to get him some medicine.

112
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
I'll leave first.

113
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,520
Girl!

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,760
Time to eat!

115
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Are you deaf or dead?

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,640
Why? Are you trying to starve yourself
to death?

117
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,000
No way!

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
If you're dead,

119
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,960
all my effort will be wasted.

120
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,640
Open your mouth!

121
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,200
Open your mouth!

122
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,000
Eat! Eat it! Eat...

123
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Enough. Enough. Old Woman.

124
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,280
Stop torturing this little girl.

125
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,680
Let me convince her.

126
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
How can you convince her?

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,840
What exactly is Huang He, that bastard,

128
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,240
thinking about?

129
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
Since Gao Chong has settled his debt,

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,280
he can then look for Shen Shen or Zhao Jing.

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,520
What's the point of caging this girl?

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Since this girl knows nothing,

133
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,520
we shall kill or release her.

134
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
What's the point of caging her?

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,360
We must not release her.

136
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,440
We made such a big effort to abduct her.

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,800
We have no way to back down now.

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,800
Girl, tell me everything you know.

139
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
Your father is no longer here.

140
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,760
Why are you being so stubborn?

141
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,320
You're only suffering yourself.

142
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,480
Both of us will never torture you.

143
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,960
We might not treat others like this!

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Ah Xu, are you hot?

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Look, you're sweating.

146
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,600
Come. I'll fan you.

147
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,600
It wasn't hot.

148
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
But once you speak,

149
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,760
I'm getting annoyed.

150
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,440
Uncle Wen, my master is doing well.

151
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,280
You shall take care of me instead.

152
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,440
You're lazy again.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
Practice for an hour more.

154
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,640
Master, I've practiced
the Swift Moving Steps

155
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,960
for a few thousand times.

156
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,150
I'm already familiar with it.

157
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
It's really not bad.

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,240
Can I stop practicing now?

159
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,400
How dare you make excuses?

160
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,120
Two more hours!

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,720
Ah Xu, you're nice normally.

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,880
Why are you so strict with your disciple?

163
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Things might go wrong if you're to eager
for a result.

164
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,480
You have to teach this kid slowly.

165
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,400
How?

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
Fine. I was too busybody.

167
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Ah Xu is teaching his disciple
according to his aptitude.

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,960
A good disciple is always trained by
a strict mentor.

169
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,400
It doesn't matter who's begging me.

170
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't you know "a clumsy bird shall fly first"?

171
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,760
I can protect you now.

172
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
But can I protect you forever?

173
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,760
Master, I didn't say that I'm not flying.

174
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,160
But...

175
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,000
I can't fly now even if I want to.

176
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
He has to practice his martial arts.

177
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,440
But he can't practice if he has a heat stroke.

178
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,880
I think Cheng Ling really can't move on.

179
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,760
Why don't you let him rest for a while
in the carriage?

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,360
Move on with your training!

181
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,720
Is he your disciple or my disciple?

182
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
Are you teaching? Or am I teaching?

183
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,400
Alright, I'll shut up. You're right.

184
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,120
What's wrong with Lao Wen these days?

185
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,880
He acts like a bullied wife.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,640
What is he planning to do?

187
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Greetings, master. Scorpion King.

188
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
Brother Changing. Brother Lovelace.

189
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,280
This must be Brother Happy.

190
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Welcome!

191
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,640
Brother Zhao. Scorpion King.

192
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,200
Brother Zhao, you had a good strategy
this time.

193
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,880
I truly respect you.

194
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
You're overpraising.

195
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,200
The Heroes Conference at Mount Jun
was held smoothly

196
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,800
thanks to Brother Changing

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,120
and every ghost brothers' contributions.

198
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,480
Greetings, Zhao...

199
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,080
Chief Zhao.

200
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
Greetings, Scorpion King.

201
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,920
No wonder you get the title of Happy Ghost.

202
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
You really make people happy.

203
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
Lovelace.

204
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,520
Chief Zhao, you've finally succeeded.

205
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
Who else besides you can be
the supreme leader of the martial arts world?

206
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,920
We are all brothers.
Why are you being so polite?

207
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,280
We still have a long way to go.

208
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,920
Now, we still don't know
the whereabouts of the Glazed Armor.

209
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,120
I still need your help in the future.

210
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Brother Zhao.

211
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,440
You mean the pieces of Glazed Armor that
was destroyed by Gao Chong

212
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,800
at the Heroes Conference were fake?

213
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,400
I think my brothers shouldn't
waste their effort

214
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
on nothing.

215
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
I know Gao Chong well.

216
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,600
He did that just to confuse others.

217
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,400
He planned to die

218
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,200
and end the fight for the Glazed Armor.

219
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,520
He must have

220
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
kept the real Glazed Armor safely.

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,280
So, you have to work hard to search for it.

222
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,480
And regarding the search for
the Hanged Ghost...

223
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,040
You shall put in more effort.

224
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
But as for the Five Lakes Alliance...

225
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,520
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

226
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,680
You don't have to worry about it.

227
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,120
Since you mentioned this,

228
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm still confused about one thing.

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
Wen Ke Xing said that

230
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,280
his Glazed Armor was snatched by
the Hanged Ghost.

231
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,200
Doesn't the Five Lake Alliance have
five pieces of Glazed Armor?

232
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,760
How many pieces do you have?

233
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,280
Brother Changing.

234
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I'll eventually let you know
if you're supposed to know it.

235
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
Why should you care about those that

236
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
you're not supposed to know?

237
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,640
Changing, look at what you have done.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,560
If we work with the righteous clans,

239
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,520
we have to work hard, earning nothing.

240
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,120
What benefit can we get?

241
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,840
Moreover, I think Zhao Jing and
Scorpion King...

242
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,600
They are both mad.

243
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,560
Don't I know that they are madmen?

244
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,080
How would they come up with this plan
if they're not mad?

245
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,600
Without this plan,

246
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,760
how can my dream come true?

247
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
What are you planning to do?

248
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,120
He wants to become the chief of
the Ghost Valley.

249
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,240
What's so nice about becoming a chief?

250
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,640
Three thousand evil ghosts will be
looking out to replace you every day.

251
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,040
Who can have an eye on his back forever?

252
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,440
Everyone will die.

253
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,840
You're right.

254
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,240
What's the point of becoming the chief?

255
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Everything is still the same.

256
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,560
We can never see the sun.

257
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Even a fierce king of the valley
like Wen Ke Xing

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,200
can't escape his fate.

259
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,120
Then, what's your plan?

260
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,640
Didn't you ever think of

261
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,000
returning to the human world?

262
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,160
We'll ride on the fastest horses.

263
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,600
Drink the strongest wine.

264
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,360
Play with the prettiest ladies.

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,320
That's good!

266
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,920
And kill the cruelest enemies.

267
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,880
Yes!

268
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,960
I would think of that even in my dream.

269
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
Changing.

270
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,120
No one will recognize you
if you disguise yourself.

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,360
You're the top of the Ten Devils of
the Ghost Valley.

272
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,120
But my face...

273
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,720
If I get too excited,

274
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,680
I can't speak.

275
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Who can't recognize me?

276
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
What if I tell you that

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,920
there's a relic from the Healer Valley,

278
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,640
hidden in the armory

279
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,840
that can heal a dead person,
revive a skeleton

280
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,280
and treat any illness in this world?

281
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,120
What do you think?

282
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,440
Lao Wen, accompany me to look for some food.

283
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,280
You shall rest first. I'll go instead.

284
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,760
Kind disciple, follow me to look for
some food.

285
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,520
Uncle Wen.

286
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Even my little finger can't move.

287
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,480
Cheng Ling can't go.

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,040
He has to practice his martial arts.

289
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,840
Master.

290
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,360
I taught you the Emerging Phoenix
yesterday.

291
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Practice it 500 times before your dinner.

292
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Oh right! Bring two fishes back.

293
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
I want to drink fish soup tonight.

294
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,080
I want to drink old monster soup!

295
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,640
Why don't you boil yourself?

296
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,040
Brat!

297
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
How dare you be so arrogant?

298
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,680
Ah Xu, give it a taste.

299
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,400
Young man.

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,600
Don't you know to respect the elderly?

301
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,080
It's fine. I'll get another bowl for you.

302
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,440
Ah Xu.

303
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,680
Thank you, Lao Wen.

304
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,560
Cheng Ling.

305
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,000
Bring this soup to Young Leader Long.

306
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,070
Feed him if he wants to have it.

307
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,760
Ah Xu.

308
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,070
Why do you call that brat a young leader?

309
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,720
Qin Huai Zhang and Long Que
were Damon and Pythias.

310
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,800
Long Que met the little brat,
Rong Xuan

311
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
through Qin Huai Zhang.

312
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,440
Little brat?

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,920
What's your relationship with Rong Xuan?

314
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,280
How do you know

315
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
Rong Xuan's relationship
with these people?

316
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,920
Do you want to know?

317
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
Why do you act like an old lady?

318
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,760
Being so busybody.

319
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,040
Senior.

320
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,120
Our journey in Shu this time is far and
tough.

321
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,880
Why do you know that the Longyuan Cabinet
will have the answer?

322
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Except for the initiator of
the evil practices,

323
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,920
the only insider who is still alive now

324
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,920
is Long Que.

325
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,840
We can only find out when we see him.

326
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,600
Senior. Master.

327
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,440
Who exactly is Long Que?

328
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,080
The Longyuan Cabinet's Old Leader Long,
Long Que

329
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,440
is a sworn friend of your grand master.

330
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
The superficial knowledge of
the Mechanics

331
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,360
passed down in the Four Seasons Manor

332
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,200
is all from the Longyuan Cabinet.

333
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,520
When I first joined the clan,

334
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
Old Leader Long visited us frequently.

335
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,320
But I don't know why...

336
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,160
He disappeared suddenly.

337
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
There were some misunderstanding
between my master and him,

338
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
so he didn't look for him.

339
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,600
Later,

340
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,360
my master received

341
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,480
a distress letter from a Mechanical Sparrow.

342
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
Only then did he sense something fishy.

343
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,040
He came to Shu several times.

344
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,120
Master. Did grand master find him?

345
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,400
No.

346
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
No one knows the actual position of
the Longyuan Cabinet.

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
People said that it's a portable fortress
in the mountains.

348
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,360
Back then, the Window of Heaven
was still inexperienced.

349
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,800
I dispatched people to search for it
for a few times.

350
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,240
Every time, the people would tell me that

351
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,680
there wasn't a problem with the address of
the place,

352
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,800
but there was nothing at the position.

353
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,080
They were just useless.

354
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,760
Even their leader was useless,

355
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,320
they would be worse.

356
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,880
Useless disciple

357
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,200
with your useless friend.

358
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
But your soup is acceptable.

359
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,240
Why didn't anyone kill you till now?

360
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm good at martial arts.

361
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,240
Senior Ye, this soup might be poisoned.

362
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,360
Aren't you drinking?

363
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,120
[Five Lakes World Alliance]

364
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Have a seat, brothers. You're welcome.

00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,440
Where are the leaders of Jujing Gang and

Purple Wave Cove?

367
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
These bastards!

368
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
They are turning against us.

369
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,560
They even swore to step out of
this alliance and not come back!

370
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
Such a big thing has happened to
the Five Lakes Alliance.

371
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,120
It's unavoidable that they lose trust in us.

372
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
It's normal.

373
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,760
Chevalier Zhao, you're too generous.

374
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,800
But what these bastards did...

375
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,320
Now, they are treating

376
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,360
the oath that we swore
before we entered this alliance

377
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,880
as sugarcane!

378
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,960
They are spitting it out after
they tasted its sweetness.

379
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
How can they take it so easily?

380
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,040
In the 100-year history of
the Five Lakes Alliance,

381
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
there wasn't a time

382
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,920
when a chief collaborated
with an evil clan and

383
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,800
killed his brother.

384
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,200
Seriously...

385
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
We still can't conclude that
the former chief

386
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,240
has collaborated with the Ghost Valley.

387
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,160
The murder case of our brother is
a serious matter too.

388
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,120
It's fine if the outsiders are saying things
about him.

389
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,200
How can we, brothers, cause chaos?

390
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,080
Chevalier Zhao.

391
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
It's only a few days,

392
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,920
but those who snatched Gao Chong's body

393
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,920
died horribly.

394
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,240
Isn't this enough to explain that

395
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,000
the Ghost Valley is taking revenge
for Gao Chong?

396
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,760
Am I right?

397
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,640
The Elder of Kongtong was killed by
the Happy Ghost.

398
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,640
Eagle Claw Clan's Sun Zhong died in
the middle of the street.

399
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,080
Sixteen disciples of the Iron Palm Gangs died
in an inn.

400
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
A letter was engraved on each of their chests.

401
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Together, they are "If you kill a man of mine,
I'll exterminate your whole alliance.

402
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,880
The ghosts of Mount Qingya will take revenge."

403
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Now, everyone in the martial arts world is
anxious.

404
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,320
There are many complaints about
the Five Lakes Alliance too.

405
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,440
If we can't survive from this...

406
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,440
The departure of Jujing and Golden Tiger is
just the start.

[Profound Expectations]
I truly know that

409
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,120
the more difficult it is,

410
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,280
the more united we have to be.

411
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,880
The Five Lakes Alliance didn't rise to the top
in just one day.

412
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,040
We must forge ahead

413
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,360
to show the world our resolution.

414
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,560
The Five Lakes Alliance is unlucky to
experience this misfortune.

415
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,040

to protect the reputation of
the Five Lakes Alliance.

419
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I'll let the Five Lakes Alliance grow
for a hundred years!

You're right!

421

A disrespectful old man.

An ill-mannered kid.

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
Why did you take my words seriously?

424
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,480
Who's your kid?

425
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
How old can you be?

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,360
How dare you act like some talented senior?

427
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
I'm not your senior.

428
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm your forefather.

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,000
Leader, you shall reconsider about
your departure

433
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,280
from the Five Lakes Alliance.

434
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
Reconsider?

435
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,800
Zhao Jing is unambitious and weak.

436
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,000
He can't do big things.

437
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,920
If he's the chief,

438
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,400
the Five Lakes Alliance will be doomed
sooner or later!

439

We can draw a dragon or a tiger
but not its bones.

441
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
We can recognize a man by his appearance
but not his heart.

Leader Wang.

443
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,320

Why aren't you kneeling down and
apologizing to Chief?

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,800
Our chief is generous.

There are rumors in the martial arts world

saying that the Jujing Gang is trying
to split the Five Lakes Alliance.

moving flexibly like a snake.

546
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,520
Let him go!

547
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,040
Ah Xu, stop it! Cheng Ling is...

548
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,120
You did a good job.

549
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,560
Both of you finally pushed your disciple
to death.

550
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,680
Are you satisfied now?

551
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,160
It's fine.

552
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,560
This is strange.

553
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,560
This kid is born with much wider meridians
than a normal person.

554
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,640
Is he a genius?

555
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,520
You're right. I realized it long ago.

556
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,840
Cheng Ling's meridians are wide and smooth
since birth.

557
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,720
They are like a wide river.

558
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,680
Compared to a narrow creek,

559
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,320
we need more time to fill it up.

560
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,200
His skills were not improving

561
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,360
not because he wasn't trying hard.

562
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,360
Master, what's happening to me?

563
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
There's actually such a strange guy
in this world.

564
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,160
He's clumsy but he has marvelous sinews and bones.

565
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,400
Is God treating you well

566
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,640
or not?

567
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Even if his body is good,

568
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,560
he's a disciple of our Ah Xu.

569
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,240
Don't you have bad intention

570
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,400
after realizing he's a good material.

571
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,480
I'd seen a better one.

572
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,120
Are you still drinking?

573
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll drink it.

574
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,680
I'm not afraid of you. Come!

575
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,320
Ah Xu, you're my witness.

576
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,400
Today,

577
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,480
I'll keep drinking with him until
he calls me his father!

578
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,440
Little brat, stop bluffing. Come!

579
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,240
Come!

580
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,400
Cheng Ling, are you alright?

581
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
If you really can't stand it,

582
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,040
train an hour more.

583
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,480
He has strangely good sinews and bones.

584
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
You can push him more.

585
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,640
He won't die soon.

586
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,680
Why are you so talkative? Drink more!

587
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,640
Come!

588
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,520
Cheers!

589
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,720
How did, Yu Qiu Feng, that idiot

590
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,960
start working with Tragicomic Ghost?

591
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,440
Wu Yang, how old did the girl

592
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
who helped him with
the abduction look like?

593
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,840
Father, I'm sorry.

594
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,760
I'm dumb. I really can't estimate it.

595
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,480
But, looking at her appearance and figure,
she's at most slightly more than 20.

596
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
But her skills were fierce.

597
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,360
They don't seem to be done by a young girl.

598
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,400
I couldn't go personally

599
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
and carry out your command.

600
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,400
Please punish me, father.

601
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,160
I only asked you to order Scorpion
to abduct Tragicomic Ghost.

602
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,280
I didn't ask you to stop the people
from abducting her.

603
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Even those skillful assassins died.

604
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
You're still young.

605
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,080
How can you defeat the leader of
the Mount Hua Sect?

606
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,880
I wouldn't blame you.

607
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,040
Throughout these years,

608
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,080
you've earned the trust of the Leader of
the Yueyang Sect.

609
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
You helped me with many things too.

610
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,280
Huai Ren and you are good kids.

611
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,360
But...

612
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,880
Huai Ren couldn't make it to today.

613
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,680
Father!

614
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,120
Father, it's too rushed.

615
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,880
I can only set it up as what it was

616
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,800
at the Sanbai Manor.

617
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
But...

618
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,160
I still don't know which screen to choose.

619
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,840
Father, do you want one with clouds
and mountains,

620
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
or one with birds?

621
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,080
Father, who is he?

622
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,120
You may leave first.

623
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,200
Yes.

624
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,240
Scorpion, you may make your own decisions
on such a small matter.

625
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
You may stay there once you set it up.

626
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,560
I'll stay here.

627
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,160
How can you do this?

628
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,320
Look! How shabby is the Yueyang sect!

629
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,840
How can you stay at such a place?

630
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,190
I was a man with great ambitions and expectations.

631
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,120
These years, I acted to be wealthy

632
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,840
and pretended as if I was enjoying life.

633
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,150
My goal

634
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,360
was to confuse those silly people.

635
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,920
But now,

636
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
[Yixiang Hall]

637
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,960
I'm the supreme leader of the martial arts world,
with a bright future.

638
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,600
I don't have to pretend anymore.

639
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,760
Yes.

640
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
Father, you're right.

641
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,120
But I've set everything up.

642
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,670
Father.

643
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,960
I picked everything by myself.

644
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,400
Scorpion.

645
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,600
A man shouldn't be distracted by other things.

646
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,440
What I dislike the most is your impetuosity

647
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
and distracting thoughts.

648
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,120
You must focus on your target.

649
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,280
You must put all your effort
at your main task.

650
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,760
Complete what I've ordered you to do first.

651
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,880
Yes.

652
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,880
Me first!

653
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,320
Drink more!

654
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,640
Cheers! Cheers! Bottom-up!

655
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,040
Why should I?

656
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,360
Your mouth is big.

657
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,960
I...

658
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,720
How is my mouth big?

659
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,600
Ah Xu!

660
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,240
Ah Xu!

661
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,520
Ah Xu!

662
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,440
This... This old monster said that
I have a big mouth.

663
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,600
My mouth is just in the right size.

664
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,240
Ah Xu!

665
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,040
I found it!

666
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,960
You have some gray hairs.

667
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,880
How dare you say I'm like an old lady?

668
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,200
You look more like an old lady.

669
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,120
What's wrong with having a few gray hairs?

670
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,520
You're being too dramatic.

671
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,680
You're right.

672
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,160
I don't even know how long have you,
the old monster, live for.

673
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,800
What's wrong with having a few gray hairs?

674
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,440
But Ye.

675
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,640
How old exactly are you?

676
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,560
I can't remember.

677
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,560
Anyway, I could have died.

678
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,880
Ah Xu!

679
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,040
Ah Xu!

680
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,720
I...

681
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,840
I...

682
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,440
Go and sleep.

683
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,640
It's fine. I'm not drunk.

684
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,760
I don't want to repeat myself.

685
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,720
Brat.

686
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,160
You're still young.

687
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,840
Why don't you want to live?

688
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,920
Who said I don't want to live?

689
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,680
Your Nails didn't show effect recently,
right?

690
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,360
You're quite happy, huh?

691
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,240
It's counting down.

692
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,440
Your organs are weakening.

693
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,480
You're losing your vitality to treat
your internal injuries.

694
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,960
So, it won't make you suffer.

695
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,400
I just don't understand.

696
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,160
Many people who deserve

697
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,720
to be killed in this world

698
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
is doing everything possible to survive.

699
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,600
Why don't you want to live?

700
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,200
I have only two choices in my life.

701
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
Live peacefully

702
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,240
or die peacefully.

703
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,840
No one can force me to take a third path.

704
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,520
Little Qin, your disciple is so silly.

705
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,480
Are all the young men now so silly?

706
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,880
Chang Qing, were we like this

707
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,520
when we were young?

708
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,560
I can't remember.

709
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,120
I've lived for too long.

710
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I can't remember.

711
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,000
[Wangchen Inn]

712
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,400
Ah Xu.

713
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,320
Come. Let's drink.

714
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,240
What are you looking at?

715
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,280
Does it hurt?

716
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,360
Why don't you give it a try?

717
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,440
Look.

718
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,920
It's been so many years,

719
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,600
I've only met you,

720
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,360
a friend with similar ideas.

721
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,960
Can you not die?

722
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,400
I'll try my best.

723
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,760
Turn around. Look at me.

724
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,320
Say it again.

725
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,840
I don't want to look at you.

726
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240
I can't stand your pretentious actions.

727
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,000
You're just wearing a mask.

728
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,040
You aren't being truthful at all.

729
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,320
I... I'm just...

730
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,360
I'm just scared...

731
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
You're scared of my illness

732
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,320
and that I'll die soon,

733
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,960
so you acted along with me and
protected me purposely.

734
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,040
Lao Wen.

735
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,480
Are you pitying me or humiliating me?

736
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,200
Don't leave!

737
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm not leaving.

738
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,320
When you're sober,

739
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,440
I'll punch you in your face.

740
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,040
You knew that I'm dying soon,

741
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
but you still brush me off
with your fake actions.

742
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
They are not fake.

743
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,840
They are real.

744
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,280
You really deserve to be beaten up.

745
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,520
Hurry up and sleep!

746
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,440
I'll not die anytime soon.

747
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,480
Life is short.

748
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,400
You shall cherish it more.

749
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,560
Little brat.

750
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,200
I've said it.

751
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,240
I bet that I'm not wrong.

752
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,840
I bet that you'll

753
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,760
open up to me one day.

754
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,480
If I don't see my victory,

755
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,040
even God

756
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,200
can't bring me away.

757
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,720
Open up?

758
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,000
Human's heart is evil.

759
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,960
What's so good about knowing my secret?

760
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,560
I can only help you if I know your secret.

761
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,360
You shall sleep.

762
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,000
After knowing my secret,

763
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
you'll not treat me as your friend.
