00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,440
Uncle Gao.

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,600
Uncle Zhao. Master Shen.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,630
Cheng Ling, is everything alright?

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
You shall stay at Yueyang Sect from now on.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Cheng Ling, do you have any illnesses?

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,320
No, Uncle Gao.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,320
Why is your body so weak?

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,080
Big Brother, he is still young.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
It's not too late to train him now.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,960
He's not young.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
Everyone in the martial arts world says

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,640
that Mirror Lake Sect has been exterminated.

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,520
But they are wrong
as long as Cheng Ling is alive.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Cheng Ling, if you can't take on

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,520
your father's heritage,

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
the Zhang family will have no successor.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,440
Give me the Glazed Armor.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Come on.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
Big Brother, Cheng Ling has been traumatized

42
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,120
and lost his memory.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,280
We shall discuss the Glazed Armor later.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,920
Later?

45
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,840
The Glazed Armor is
more important than Yu Sen's life.

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,840
It's more important than our lives.

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,720
Yu Sen barely managed to let Cheng Ling escape

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,080
in order to bring us
the news of the Glazed Armor!

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
Cheng Ling.

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,600
Do you want your father and your family
to have died for nothing?

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
How many times do you want me to repeat it?

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
I don't know anything about the Glazed Armor!

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,760
Stop it!

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
Tell us where the Glazed Armor is.

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,120
Cheng Ling, don't be afraid.

56
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,560
Hurry and tell us!

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,280
Cheng Ling.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I know.

59
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,800
Your father had not been

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,200
interacting with us
in the Five Lakes Alliance for years,

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
so you don't believe us.

62
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,160
But, besides us,

63
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,439
who else can you believe now?

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,000
You have no other choice! Kid!

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,840
Big Brother, the child doesn't understand.

66
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,440
We can teach him slowly.

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm not that patient to coax you.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,520
The later you hand out the Glazed Armor,

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
the more people

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,640
in the martial arts world will suffer.

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
Do you know?

72
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,360
I don't know!

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,440
I...

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Big Brother!

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,400
Cheng Ling.

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,200
Big Brother, don't be angry.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,960
Why don't we talk about

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,800
the Glazed Armor next time?

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
You may leave.

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,200
Hurry up.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Go.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,160
Big Brother, I know.

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,280
There have been misunderstandings
between you and Yu Sen for many years.

84
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,720
But the child is clueless.
He doesn't know anything.

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,840
Shut up!

86
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,160
Second Brother, you were being unwise.

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,880
Fourth Brother's case has broke
Big Brother's heart.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
Why did you mention him?

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Help me resolve it.

90
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
I was just pitying that child.

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
He has to make a living here later.

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
You're wrong again.

93
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Even if Big Brother is angry,

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,360
will he hurt a child?

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,280
You've underestimated
Big Brother's generosity.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,160
Brother.

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,240
I was in an awkward situation today.

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,520
I was a stranger to you,
but you still helped me out with your money.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
I feel apologetic.

100
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
I live at Yueyang Sect not far away.

101
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,320
Brother, can you wait here?

102
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll be back soon.

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,080
It's our fate to meet each other.

104
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
Money is just my possession.

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,360
If I'm able to meet a new friend with it,

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,960
isn't it better?

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm Zhou Xu. May I know your name?

108
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,920
My surname is Cao. I'm Cao Wei Ning.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,160
I'm a disciple of Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
I heard that Gentle Wind Sword Sect is
the strictest in choosing their disciples.

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,440
All of its disciples are elegant,

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,640
handsome, well-educated,
and well-trained in martial arts.

113
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,720
After seeing you, I think it is indeed the case.

114
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,800
You overestimated me.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm one of the worst in my sect.

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Don't say that.

117
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,520
It's our fate to meet each other.

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,520
If you don't mind,

119
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,560
have a seat. We can drink and chat.

120
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
-Come on.
-Alright.

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,560
Brother Zhou, you're straightforward.
I'm impressed.

122
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
Brother Zhou, let's drink.

123
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,000
Here.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Here, cheers.

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
Kick him out for me.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
He can help me get into Yueyang Sect.

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
Eat as you like. Drink as you want.

128
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Xiang.

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
Find Fang Bu Zhi out!

130
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,640
Fang Bu Zhi?

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,640
Fang Bu Zhi's martial arts are quite good.

132
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,320
Xiang is just a girl...

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,200
Are you looking down on girls?

134
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,640
Girls are great.

135
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,360
How about...

136
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
How about I go with you?

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
There are many people outside.

138
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Brother Zhou, excuse me.

139
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,240
May I know where you will be staying?

140
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
I'll visit you and treat you to a meal in return.

141
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,080
Making friends is mostly about resonance.

142
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
It's fine.

143
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,280
We are invited by Chevalier Zhao Jing.

144
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,400
Once we're done with our task,

145
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
we will definitely go to visit Yueyang Sect.

146
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,400
If you can't find my purse,

147
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
don't come back.

148
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,120
"When something happens, you go to Zhong Wu Yan.*"
(*You only remember someone when you need her help)

149
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,320
Master Cao.

150
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,440
Please go back and notify Yueyang Sect.

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,960
I hope that you can find your purse soon.

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,030
Alright.

153
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,880
See you.

154
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Cao what? Why are you following me?

155
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,960
Cao... Cao Wei Ning.

156
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,000
Whoever you are.

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,240
Why are you following me?
You have no money to buy food again?

158
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,200
You want me to lend you money?

159
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Alright!

160
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,960
Then 32 percent interest rate per day. Deal?

161
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,040
I was being impolite.

163
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,760
Miss Gu, how about I bring you to Yueyang Sect?

164
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,440
You won't lose your master's thing.

165
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,240
I may relax if I let the Five Lakes Alliance
to handle this.

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,840
Do you come to Yueyang frequently?

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
Then, you must know

168
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
what is tasty or funny around this place.

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
I know them very well.

170
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,600
If you give me a chance

171
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,640
to serve you,

172
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll show you all the food in Yueyang.

173
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,000
I really want to bring you back to them.

174
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,760
They always say that I'm the top foodie

175
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
and I only like to eat.

176
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,960
After meeting you today,

177
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,840
I found out that there's someone
who's more into eating than me.

178
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,760
Let's go.

179
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,880
Let's go.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,960
Miss, this way.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,520
The Leader of Gentle Wind Sword Sect

182
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,800
is a cunning old fox.

183
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,760
Why is there a big rabbit in his fox den?

184
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,520
If you live long enough,
what strange thing can you not meet?

185
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,320
Just like someone.

186
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,960
He's cold and doesn't speak to his friend.

187
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,760
But, he was warm and friendly

188
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,840
towards the young master
from a famous sect who he just met.

189
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,480
I know that you wanted
to get some news about

190
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,720
your so-called disciple in Yueyang City

191
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
through that big rabbit.

192
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,520
When I see that guy being foolish

193
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,560
towards Xiang, I get annoyed.

194
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't worry.

195
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,320
I've asked Xiang to play along

196
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
and follow him to get into Yueyang Sect.

197
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
She will check on your silly disciple for you.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,040
How is it? Am I considerate?

199
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,240
You're just making use of Xiang's good looks.

200
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,960
Anyway, she will leave when she becomes mature.

201
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,440
She will hate me if I hold her back.

202
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,040
Shameless.

203
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,880
It's all because of you

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,160
and your disciple, who are ungrateful.

205
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,840
Why do I think

206
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,400
this is not your real motive?

207
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,640
Don't you know?

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm called Philanthropist Wen

209
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,080
because I would feel uneasy

210
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
after not helping people around for a few days.

211
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,280
If it continues, I would even fall sick.

212
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,320
So,

213
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,360
I travel around to help people.

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,080
So you're helping people and grow your virtue?

215
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
"I will never be a Buddha until hell is empty.*"
(*I'm determined to save everyone)

216
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
But, within Yueyang City,

217
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,080
decent sects and heroes are everywhere.

218
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,680
Brother Wen, where can you
find the dwellers of hell?

219
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,600
There is always a dark side
to the bright side.

220
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,680
The fiercest ghosts tend to disguise
themselves as humans

221
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
and hide in the crowd.

222
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,680
I'm here

223
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,040
to reveal them

224
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,920
and destroy them.

225
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,800
Ah Xu, do you think this is helping people
and growing my virtue?

226
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,360
I didn't expect you

227
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,800
to be a gentleman

228
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,720
who fights bad guys and seeks justice.

229
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,520
It's nothing. It's all thanks to my partner.

230
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
Junior Zhang.

231
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,880
Junior Zhang, please slow down.

232
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,640
I know the way back to my room.

233
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
I can go by myself.

234
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
I don't need you to walk me there, Senior.

235
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
No way.

236
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
Master has said that you're an important guest.

237
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
There must be someone to accompany you around.

238
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,560
Really?

239
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,960
Am I a guest or a criminal?

240
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,160
You...

241
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,200
What's wrong?

242
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,600
Xie Wu Yang, why are you two arguing?

243
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:12,640
[Xie Wu Yang - Disciple of Yueyang Sect]

244
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,560
[Xie Wu Yang - Disciple of Yueyang Sect]
Senior, I wanted to bring Junior Zhang

245
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:15,751
to the Second Generation Disciple Compound.

246
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:18,791
But he doesn't want a companion.

247
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:21,711
I understand. You may leave.

248
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,191
Leave Cheng Ling to me.

249
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,511
Yes.

250
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:27,471
Brother Cheng Ling.

251
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,631
Recently, Yueyang City has been quite messy.

252
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:31,191
My father is concerned about your safety.

253
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,151
Even I can't go out, either.

254
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,551
Are you frightened
because my father spoke too fiercely?

255
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:41,031
You'll realize if you get along

256
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:41,951
with my father longer.

257
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:44,791
He's cold outside but warm inside.

258
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,991
Actually, he is nice to us normally.

259
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,351
Cheng Ling.

260
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,191
Yueyang Sect is used to being frugal.

261
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,151
It might not be as exquisite as your home.

262
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,951
[Pine Hall]
So, we've arranged to let you live here.

263
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,031
Tell me if you have any problems in the future.

264
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:12,431
Alright. It's my fault.

265
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:14,471
You're not a kid anymore.

266
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:15,671
You're an adult now.

267
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,191
Senior, Brother Cao Wei Ning is
looking for you.

268
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,431
Alright, I got it.

269
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,471
Yes.

270
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,351
These seniors and juniors are about your age.

271
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,631
Train your martial arts with them in the future.

272
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,311
Everyone, please come here.

273
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,431
This is Brother Cheng Ling.

274
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,191
Please take care of him from now on.

275
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,511
Alright, Senior.

276
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,311
Train your martial arts here in the future.

277
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,911
I think he can't even take a punch.

278
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:54,671
Yes.

279
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,551
He will collapse after taking a few punches.

280
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:04,191
So, it takes a while to capture Zhang Bu Zhi.

281
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,671
It's not so safe in Yueyang City recently.

282
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,271
Miss Gu Xiang is a girl.

283
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,031
She might feel inconvenient outside.

284
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,631
Moreover, Master Zhou and Master Wen

285
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,071
are Chevalier Zhao's friends.

286
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,791
They will come to meet at Yueyang Sect soon.

287
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,031
So...

288
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:21,511
I think...

289
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,711
If Sister Xiao Ling don't mind,

290
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:26,871
can you let Miss Gu Xiang stay here?

291
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:30,511
Since she's your friend,

292
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,871
that's not a problem at all.

293
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,071
Miss Gu, do you mind

294
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,791
staying at my compound?

295
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,311
Thank you, Sister Xiao Ling.

296
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,711
Thank you.

297
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,111
My good sister, you're welcome.

298
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,071
Wei Ning's friend is my friend.

299
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:48,791
Senior.

300
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,831
Master asked you to prepare
the things for worshiping.

301
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,911
It's getting dark.

302
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:55,591
Why does he go worshiping now?

303
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:57,391
What kind of worship should I prepare for?

304
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:59,271
Master wants to bring the junior
from the Zhang family

305
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,631
to worship the Five Lakes Monument.

306
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:02,671
Alright.

307
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,591
Help me bring Miss Gu

308
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,991
to my compound.

309
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,551
She will stay in the west wing.

310
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:09,431
Yes.

311
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:13,671
My good sister, I'll leave now.

312
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,991
Feel free to tell my junior
if you need anything.

313
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,431
Alright.

314
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,631
You can tell Wei Ning too.

315
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,031
Candied hawthorn on sale.

316
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:34,591
Candied hawthorn on sale.

317
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,231
Good day, Sir.

318
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,471
Welcome.

319
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,151
Brother Wen, take care.

320
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:44,911
What's wrong?

321
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,031
I have something else to do.

322
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,711
We shall part here.

323
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:50,951
See you...

324
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:58,391
I'll follow you wherever you go.

325
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:01,551
Aren't you going to fight the bad guys

326
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:02,791
and save the dwellers of hell?

327
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,391
The dwellers of hell have been happy
to stay there for many years.

328
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:08,391
There is no rush.

329
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:10,791
I don't understand, then.

330
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,711
Why do you keep following me?

331
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,991
Don't you allow me to follow?

332
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,351
We should do whatever we want in life.

333
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,990
Why do you have so many questions?

334
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:24,391
Then, let me ask you.

335
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,791
Why do you keep following Cheng Ling?

336
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,231
Yes. I have been stubborn.

337
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,911
I know that you're worried about
Cheng Ling's situation

338
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:36,191
in the Five Lakes Alliance.

339
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,631
Didn't I send Xiang to check on him?

340
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,111
Those old foxes are clever.

341
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,551
They would not expose themselves so soon.

342
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,151
I'm not only worried about
the Five Lakes Alliance.

343
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:51,511
Now, many forces in the martial arts world
are keeping an eye on Cheng Ling.

344
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,831
I talked to the waiter just now.

345
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:55,511
I asked him if he had seen

346
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,951
unruly martial artists.

347
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,711
He said that there was a group of them.

348
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,791
Those who dress like feudal officials
outside the town.

349
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:11,591
It's still bright now.
Who is releasing the lanterns?

350
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,671
[The Window of Heaven is
taking action in this area.]

351
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:18,871
[Those who dress like feudal officials are
from the Window of Heaven.]

352
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,631
I'll go to Yueyang Sect to have a look first.

353
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,431
Master!

354
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:25,871
Master, it's lucky that you haven't gone far.

355
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,271
Girl, why are you back so soon?

356
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,231
It's fine. Just say it.

357
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,471
I sneaked into Yueyang Sect.

358
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,951
Good girl. How's the little idiot?

359
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,951
I'm here to tell you some urgent news.

360
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,151
Gao Chong wants to bring the little idiot

361
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,071
to worship the Five Lake Monuments.

362
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,351
I don't understand.

363
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:46,151
It's getting dark.

364
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:47,631
What is there to worship?

365
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:48,351
At night...

366
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:50,911
Go back first.

367
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:04,631
[Five Lakes World Alliance]

368
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:06,271
[Lake of the Five Continents]

369
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,711
One hundred years ago,

370
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:32,151
our ancestors imitated
the Three Heroes of the Peach Garden

371
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:35,391
in a bamboo forest.

372
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:38,951
They became five sworn brothers.

373
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:42,031
They worked together and helped each other.

374
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,511
They founded their sects
and accepted many disciples.

375
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,071
That's the origin of the Five Lakes Alliance.

376
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:49,631
[Mirror Lake Sect]

377
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,520
They built a monument here
to tell their descendants

378
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,040
that the righteousness of the Five Lakes
came before the World Alliance.

379
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
Kid.

380
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,680
If you inherit your father's position
as the leader,

381
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,080
your name will also be carved
on this monument in the future.

382
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,520
[Zhang Yu Sen]

383
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
You'll be respected by your descendants
generation after generation.

384
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,280
Someone told me
that you're not capable to become the leader.

385
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Someone also told me

386
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,680
that you can't bear this responsibility.

387
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,840
They hope that I could find
an outstanding disciple

388
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,000
from the Five Lakes Alliance to be
the successor of the Zhang family

389
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
and bear the responsibility on behalf of you.

390
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,920
But, I didn't agree.

391
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,720
No matter what, you're the direct descendant
of the Zhang family.

392
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,280
Uncle Gao, you're the chief.

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,720
I will do as you decide.

394
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,720
Shan!

395
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
Yao Zhi!

396
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,600
-Master!
-Master!

397
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,160
Chief Gao, we meet again.

398
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,160
Commander Han.

399
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,200
You even use such a base trick?

400
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,280
Are you trying to force me
to obey your command?

401
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,240
Chief Gao, I would like to settle it peacefully.

402
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,640
Hand over the orphan of the Zhang family to me.

403
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,200
I'll release them.

404
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,360
Or else...

405
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
What would you do?

406
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,800
Crossbows are important weapons of the country!

407
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,040
No one is allowed to possess them privately!

408
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:14,963
Is Prince Jin planning to revolt?

409
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,163
Chief Gao.

410
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,963
Stop worrying about us.

411
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,803
Hand over the child. He can still live.

412
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:24,163
If you refuse,

413
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:27,443
today will be
your death anniversary next year.

414
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,283
If you want to bring Cheng Ling away,

415
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,003
kill me first!

416
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,003
Chief Gao.

417
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:37,643
Don't think I'm trying to scare you
and won't take action.

418
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:40,323
The Window of Heaven is omniscient.

419
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:43,563
Even if I kill every one of you today,

420
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:47,163
I still can find out
the truth about the Glazed Armor.

421
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:03,203
Damn it.

422
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,323
Where did they come from?

423
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:13,443
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

424
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:15,203
None of your business.

425
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:16,883
The crossbows need some time to set up.

426
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:18,603
I'll draw their attention away
during their first shot.

427
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:19,723
You go to capture their leader

428
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,403
when they reload their arrows.

429
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:22,523
No way.

430
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:25,323
Arrows of the crossbows are powerful and swift.
A man can't fend off them,

431
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:27,563
no matter how good one's martial arts are.

432
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,843
A gentleman is willing to die for his soulmate.

433
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,123
So what if I risk this for you?

434
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,083
I'll distract the crossbowmen,
and you'll capture the guy.

435
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:50,323
Stop!

436
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,203
Why aren't you releasing them?

437
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:06,003
Release them.

438
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:11,843
Brothers, you are...

439
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,243
Chief Gao, don't try to befriend us.

440
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:14,563
Aren't you leaving?

441
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:16,723
Are you waiting for a carriage?

442
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:19,563
I can't express my gratitude.
See you next time.

443
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:21,403
Let's go.

444
00:24:24,403 --> 00:24:27,283
Little Master, please go with us.

445
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:28,523
Let our master go!

446
00:24:29,643 --> 00:24:30,563
Retreat!

447
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:32,381
Everyone, retreat!

448
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,421
They wouldn't hurt me.

449
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:42,101
You're right. I dare not provoke you guys.

450
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,501
We will send this master back intact

451
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:45,821
to you later.

452
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,381
Hurry and leave!
Take care of your crossbows!

453
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,461
Wait for me.

454
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,501
Let's go.

455
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:03,221
Ah Xu.

456
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:05,981
You owed me a big favor today.

457
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:14,861
Little Master, watch your eyes.

458
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,581
I abducted you.

459
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:17,981
Why are you staring at him?

460
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:19,701
My Lord.

461
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:28,741
My Lord, it's really you.

462
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,021
I thought I was mistaken

463
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,301
when I saw the Swift Moving Steps.

464
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:36,021
My Lord, why are you here?

465
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:37,781
Why aren't you disguising yourself?

466
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,221
How's your injury?

467
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,381
I've had enough of hiding myself

468
00:25:42,461 --> 00:25:43,181
for years.

469
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,661
Ying, I'm sorry.

470
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,861
I knew you would recognize me.

471
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:50,741
It was urgent.

472
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:54,021
So that you could explain it
to your subordinates.

473
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:56,941
You saved my life.

474
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:58,701
I'm willing to risk everything

475
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:02,101
at your command.

476
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:08,381
Ah Xu, shall I leave for a while?

477
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,421
First, I saw the Window of Heaven's
Trapped Sparrow and Drunk Like a Dream.

478
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:16,061
Then, I saw disciples of Yueyang Sect

479
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:17,501
communicating with the Window of Heaven's
secret code.

480
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,221
I thought they were coming at me.

481
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,461
I didn't expect that the Window of Heaven is
looking for the Glazed Armor.

482
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:26,821
Yes. Since the news about the extermination

483
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:27,741
of Mirror Lake Manor spread to Jin,

484
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,221
I was dispatched to Jiangnan

485
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,021
to investigate the song.

486
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:34,981
That is just a tale of the martial arts world.

487
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:36,941
Why is the Window of Heaven taking action?

488
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:39,181
Sorry, I don't know.

489
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,581
I only know that Duan Peng Ju cares

490
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:42,741
about the Glazed Armor very much.

491
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:44,381
He is eager to get it.

492
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,141
My Lord, if you want to know,

493
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:48,501
I can try and investigate it secretly.

494
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:49,461
Don't.

495
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,341
Since I took the risk and showed up just now,

496
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,021
I've put you in danger.

497
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,421
That was my last resort.

498
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:57,541
Few of those who joined the Window of Heaven
because of me are alive now.

499
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,101
You are loyal to me

500
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:00,901
as long as you stay alive.

501
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:03,541
Little Master.

502
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:07,221
Master, you're my lord's friend.

503
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,821
You may call me Han Ying.

504
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:09,741
Little Master.

505
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:12,541
Why did you ask for the orphan of the Zhang family

506
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:13,541
from Gao Chong?

507
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:16,661
Mirror Lake Sword Sect was exterminated
by Hanging Ghost.

508
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:19,581
The Glazed Armor should be
with the Ghost Valley.

509
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,581
Why did you get your hands
on the Zhang family's child?

510
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,941
Master, you don't know.

511
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:25,141
The Window of Heaven had a spy in Mirror Lake Sect.

512
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,581
The spy witnessed

513
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:28,141
that people from the Ghost Valley killed
the father and sons of the Zhang family

514
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,261
one after another

515
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,061
and forced them to hand over the Glazed Armor.

516
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,981
Zhang Yu Sen didn't surrender until death,

517
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,021
so the Glazed Armor must be

518
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:36,701
with his youngest son who escaped.

519
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,261
The old foxes in this martial arts world
are sensitive.

520
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:47,501
Even if they don't know about this incident,

521
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,181
when the Ghost Valley tried

522
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,821
to abduct Zhang Cheng Ling in Sanbai Manor,

523
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:52,981
it has hinted

524
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:55,261
that the case about Mirror Lake Sword Sect
is not over yet.

525
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,101
My lord, do you have any orders?

526
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:00,021
Actually, Zhang Cheng Ling

527
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,661
belongs to your lord.

528
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:02,461
Lao Wen.

529
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:05,781
My lord, you know Zhang Cheng Ling?

530
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:07,941
Please forgive me for not knowing it.

531
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,181
I will try to...

532
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:09,861
No need.

533
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,701
After you return,

534
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,541
act as if you've not seen me.
Act as usual.

535
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:18,021
But don't hurry to take action.

536
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:20,621
If my guess is correct,

537
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:24,381
the Five Lakes Alliance will definitely
force Zhang Cheng Ling

538
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,621
to hand over the Glazed Armor.

539
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:29,381
And they will do that
before the Heroes Conference.

540
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:55,301
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered
and the Glaze is shattered."

541
00:28:56,421 --> 00:29:00,421
Is this really the Glazed Armor in the legend?

542
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:05,181
But, the man was carrying it around.

543
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:07,941
Was he a fool?

544
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:24,741
Damn it.

545
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:27,181
What's going on?

546
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:43,301
First, the Window of Heaven.
Then, the leader of a manor.

547
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,381
What kind of man

548
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,061
am I following?

549
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:53,461
Just now... Thank you.

550
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,421
Answer my question first.

551
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:00,381
Why did such a man of high status

552
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:01,781
in the Window of Heaven

553
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,781
go sunbathing in Yue?

554
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,101
Were you trying to have fun with the people?

555
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,301
I've left the Window of Heaven.

556
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,821
Lao Wen, I owe you a favor.

557
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,701
You don't owe me a favor.

558
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,381
You owe me an explanation instead.

559
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,701
Ah Xu. Ah Xu.

560
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,461
Do you want me to believe

561
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:27,181
that you would do all this
because of three maces of silver?

562
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:30,661
What's your relationship
with Zhang Cheng Ling?

563
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:34,381
I've fulfilled my promise
to the old fisherman in Yue.

564
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,741
But when I saw this child in danger,

565
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,901
I couldn't stay there and do nothing.

566
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,941
Take it as a charity.

567
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:46,901
Maybe a hundred...

568
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:50,021
Maybe when I go to hell,

569
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:53,901
I may suffer less from the pain
of tendon-and-skin peeling.

570
00:30:57,781 --> 00:31:01,181
Closed friends of generations
deceive each other.

571
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:04,701
Newly met strangers entrust each other
with their lives.

572
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,901
Interesting.

573
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:09,461
But, Ah Xu.

574
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,910
Are you really not related
to the Five Lakes Alliance?

575
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,110
Right?

576
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,310
With this question, are you holding
a grudge against the Five Lakes Alliance?

577
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,270
Since you bring it up,

578
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,710
I have a question for you too.

579
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,030
The day when Mirror Lake Manor was exterminated,

580
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,630
was your appearance on the island
a coincidence?

581
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,990
Not really a coincidence.

582
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,350
Wasn't I following you?

583
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,470
Didn't you say that we would meet
if we're fated?

584
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,510
I didn't want to wait for fate.

585
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,390
So, I had to take initiative.

586
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,310
I'm asking you directly because
I treat you as a friend.

587
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,710
You're treating me as a friend?

588
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,230
We've been through thick and thin

589
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,390
many times.

590
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,830
But, you're only treating me as a friend.

591
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,990
Oh Wen Ke Xing.

592
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,630
Seems like you have to work harder.

593
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,630
Why don't you ask me what I think of you?

594
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,070
I don't care.

595
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,630
Let's go. We are about to leave the mountain.

596
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,270
You're my soulmate.

597
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,830
Search around.

598
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,150
He died from poison.

599
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,510
Be careful.

600
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,110
Don't simply touch the things in this room.

601
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,950
Beware of leftover poison.

602
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,870
-Yes.
-Yes.

603
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,750
Senior Gao, look!

604
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,950
Are the things on this table the spoils?

605
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,070
Fang Bu Zhi is very cunning.

606
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,070
Who was so competent to find him before us?

607
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,070
Come again.

608
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,870
Watermelon on sale!
Big and sweet watermelon!

609
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,150
Watermelon on sale!

610
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,230
Watermelon! Big and sweet!

611
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,790
Sir, taste it. Big and sweet watermelon.

612
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,670
Which is the sweetest?

613
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,190
Here. This. This is sweet.

614
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,430
Take the bigger one.

615
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,110
Ah Xu.

616
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,710
It's so sweet.

617
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,830
Sir... You haven't paid.

618
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,430
This one.

619
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,670
Alright. Thank you.

620
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,750
Do you want some?

621
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,630
Thank you.

622
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,670
Good day.

623
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,510
Are you done eating?

624
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,190
Why do you look like a child
who's on his first visit to a market?

625
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,550
Don't you want to find

626
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,110
your purse and your jade amulet?

627
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,789
It's fine if I can't find them.
It doesn't matter.

628
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,349
Ah Xu, do you want to try this dessert?

629
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,510
I even asked him to add
two more spoons of syrup.

630
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,030
You aren't spending your own money.

631
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,070
You're generous at spending the other's money.

632
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,909
Don't be so stingy.

633
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,670
I saved your silly disciple, right?

634
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,830
It's not a bad deal.

635
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,109
Who's making a deal with you?

636
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,070
Return me the money.

637
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,309
Ah Xu.

638
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,470
Just let me spend your money.

639
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,630
It's not a loss.

640
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,430
You risked your life for the old man

641
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,870
because of three maces of silver.

642
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,990
I only spent a little bit.

643
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,510
Or else, I'll listen to your command.

644
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,310
Is that alright?

645
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,630
Alright.

646
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,750
Please stay away softly.

647
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,950
Alright. I'll go wherever you go.

648
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,190
Come and have a look!

649
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,910
A troupe from the Western Regions!

650
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,230
It's a rare chance.

651
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,750
Ah Xu, have you seen Western Regions' magic?

652
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,350
Why are they cutting
a pretty lady with knives?

653
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,350
Magic of a living person!
A string of coins for entry!

654
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,110
I guarantee that you'll be impressed.

655
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,198
Let's go and have a look.
I've never seen this.

656
00:35:44,198 --> 00:35:45,598
A troupe from the Western Regions.

657
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:47,638
Let's go. Fang Bu Zhi might be inside.

658
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:48,438
Let's go.

659
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:50,678
Welcome, Sirs. Please come in.

660
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:26,198
An exotic performance. It's quite special.

661
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:49,358
This zither...

662
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,318
Let's see what trick he's got.

663
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,918
Good!

664
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:47,438
Good!

665
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:03,718
Congratulations on the upcoming
Heroes Conference of the Five Lakes Alliance.

666
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:08,878
Here are ten human heads,
representing the Ghost Valley's goodwill.

667
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:14,518
Hurry up! Arrest them!

668
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:21,678
Junior Wei?

669
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:26,478
Dear folks,

670
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:27,958
please don't panic.

671
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:30,918
Yueyang Sect will definitely

672
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:32,638
investigate this.

673
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,798
Under Chief Gao's leadership,

674
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,958
we will definitely bring the bad guys to justice.

675
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:39,838
Don't be afraid.

676
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:45,038
Yueyang Sect seems more powerful
than the feudal officials here.

677
00:38:45,598 --> 00:38:47,238
Protecting this place?

678
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,918
Chief Gao hasn't even passed away,

679
00:38:50,118 --> 00:38:52,158
why do they see him as an immortal?

680
00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:54,798
Yueyang Sect is heavily guarded.
They've been constantly patrolling around.

681
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:57,238
There are many martial artists
in this town too.

682
00:38:57,998 --> 00:38:59,438
I didn't expect the Ghost Valley

683
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:01,438
would cause this chaos.

684
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:05,158
It slapped him right on the face.

685
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:07,878
Chief Gao has lost all his face.

686
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:10,758
The Ghost Valley made a great effort

687
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,598
only to humiliate Yueyang Sect.

688
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,998
Do you believe that this is just the start?

689
00:39:15,998 --> 00:39:17,678
Move backward!

690
00:39:22,718 --> 00:39:24,278
Are you worried about your so-called disciple?

691
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:27,398
How come I have a disciple?

692
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:30,798
Here you go again.
Why are you not admitting it?

693
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:35,558
Why don't we take this chance
to meet with Zhao Jing?

694
00:39:35,798 --> 00:39:38,238
We can also pay our respect

695
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:41,118
to the beneficent Iron Judge, Gao Chong.

696
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:57,558
Master!

697
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:01,158
Wei... Junior Wei...

698
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:05,958
Yun Ge, my son! I'll take revenge for you!

699
00:40:06,118 --> 00:40:07,278
Goddamn Ghost Valley!

700
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:09,358
Those heartless demons!

701
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:12,327
I will fight you to death.

702
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:16,527
Absurd! How can they be so defiant?

703
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,647
I think the Ghost Valley is
overestimating itself!

704
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:23,087
Why? Even if the ghosts
in Mount Qingya are fierce,

705
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,407
do they dare to go
against the world of martial arts?

706
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,727
But, they've committed it!

707
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:31,087
Big Brother, don't get anxious.

708
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:34,767
The Ghost Valley will collapse
of its own accord with its evil deeds.

709
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:38,327
Big Brother, don't be too angry.

710
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:39,727
I swear

711
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:42,847
I'll make the Ghost Valley pay back tenfold!

712
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:47,767
Tenfold?

713
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:53,047
This is extremely shameful!

714
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:56,927
If I can't demolish the Ghost Valley,

715
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:00,447
how can I live on in this world?

716
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:02,927
-Yes!
-Chief, you're right!

717
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,367
An eye for an eye!
Demolish the Ghost Valley!

718
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:07,967
An eye for an eye!
Demolish the Ghost Valley!

719
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:11,167
An eye for an eye!
Demolish the Ghost Valley!

720
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,167
Masters, please wait for a while.

721
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:18,127
Thank you.

722
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:28,407
Brother Wen. Brother Zhou.

723
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,247
Chevalier Zhao.

724
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:31,167
How have you been?

725
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:32,927
Sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

726
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:35,887
Chevalier Shen.

727
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,207
We were looking for you guys.

728
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:40,527
But, you came here yourselves.

729
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:42,687
Chevalier Shen, you were looking for me?

730
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:44,807
I'm flattered.

731
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:45,807
Stop acting.

732
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,847
The incident of Sanbai Manor
happened unexpectedly.

733
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,127
Yet you guys left without a word.
What did you mean?

734
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:51,847
Sorry.

735
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,887
I saw that you had many incidents

736
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:55,647
and were not free to welcome guests,

737
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,007
so we decided to leave.

738
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,647
I had left a note before I left.

739
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,247
Chevalier Shen, why are you blaming me?

740
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:02,407
What a good excuse.

741
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:04,407
The night when you left,

742
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,447
Second Brother's manor suffered
a loss by theft.

743
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:07,927
Can you explain?

744
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:09,847
No comment.

745
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,327
Chevalier Zhao.

746
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,447
Are you blaming me

747
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,327
for the theft?

748
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,047
Of course not. It's all a misunderstanding.

749
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:21,847
They are the benefactors
of the Five Lakes Alliance.

750
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:24,167
Why are you suspecting them?

751
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:25,727
Benefactors?

752
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:27,767
Big Brother.

753
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:29,687
Master Wen

754
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,887
rescued Cheng Ling
from Mirror Lake Sword Sect,

755
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:34,327
and brought him all the way to my house.

756
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:37,167
They've indeed helped a lot.

757
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:51,887
Master Wen, do you know me?

758
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,767
Iron Judge, Gao Chong, is so famous.

759
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:57,367
It's not strange that I know you.

760
00:42:57,647 --> 00:43:00,247
It's my honor if you know me.

761
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:04,207
Chief Gao, do you know me?

762
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:10,607
Sorry, I don't know you, Master Wen.

763
00:43:11,767 --> 00:43:12,687
Master Wen.

764
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:17,047
How did you know my brother,
Zhang Yu Sen?

765
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:21,247
Thank you for your escort, both you and Mr. Zhou.

766
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:25,167
The Five Lakes Alliance will remember
your kindness.

767
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:27,927
[Why is Lao Wen looking strange?]

768
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:32,607
[What's the relationship
between Gao Chong and him?]

769
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:37,727
I didn't have the honor to know
Chevalier Zhang.

770
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:40,007
I did it for justice. It was fate.

771
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:42,727
We came here today

772
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:45,207
to visit Cheng Ling.

773
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:48,287
But, it seems that we came at the wrong time.

774
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:51,287
Is Cheng Ling doing well?

775
00:43:53,407 --> 00:43:57,807
Cheng Ling is feeling unwell. He's taking a rest.

776
00:43:58,287 --> 00:43:59,327
It's not a good time to visit him.

777
00:44:01,287 --> 00:44:02,567
Cheng Ling is sick?

778
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:04,727
Is it serious?

779
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:06,607
Why don't we have a look?

780
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:10,567
Master Wen, your full name is...

781
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:15,687
I'm Wen Ke Xing.

782
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,327
Master Wen.

783
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:24,287
I forgot to ask which sect you are from.

784
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:26,807
I don't belong to any sects.

785
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,727
It's just that my father taught some martial arts,

786
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,047
and I've trained them casually.

787
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:34,127
Then, may I know who your father is?

788
00:44:34,247 --> 00:44:36,887
He's raised such a heroic young man.

789
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:42,177
My father was just
an ordinary, unsophisticated man.

790
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:43,337
He was a nobody.

791
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:47,737
He was not even a clever man.

792
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,417
It's been many years
since my father passed away.

793
00:44:50,737 --> 00:44:52,697
You Chevaliers have been busy.

794
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,697
How would you remember someone like him?

795
00:44:55,697 --> 00:44:57,857
Master! It's bad! Master!

796
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:01,297
Master! They've killed...
They've killed someone again!

797
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:04,657
Don't you see the guests here?
Why are you panicking?

798
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:05,977
Master.

799
00:45:06,177 --> 00:45:07,377
When Senior Gao was patrolling,

800
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,577
he discovered a corpse.

801
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:10,217
The body was put out there.

802
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:13,217
Got it.
