Of course. Why not?

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,880
Master Zhou, congratulations on your disciple.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Do you know why I accepted Cheng Ling
as my disciple?

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,360
No.

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
Tell me why.

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
This child is stupid, and his basis is not good,

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and he is too old to practice martial arts.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
Why do you care so much about him?

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,160
As a child,

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
my master taught me like this.

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,320
There are two most rare qualities in people,

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,200
benevolence and courage.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,680
The ancient sages classified brave people
into these types:

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,320
brave in qi, blood, backbone, and spirit.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
All of the above boil down to
the bravery of teenagers.

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,480
My master promoted the bravery of
going on your own way.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,080
What does it mean?

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
To do something even
while knowing it's impossible,

45
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,880
and to trust people even though
they are hard to know.

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520

for us at our age

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,200
to show our hearts to others.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,480
I can not do this myself,

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,360
and there is no way to ask you to do so.

52
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,920
So I decided to be the first to try

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
and take a gamble.

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,040
You are

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,720

57
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,560
hit me so hard.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,920
I will kill her next time I see her.

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Ouch, it hurts.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,520
You,

61
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
what are you doing here?

62
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,240
Xiang, what's wrong with your arm?

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,400
And you look terrible.

64
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
Where did you go last night?

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
The assassins sneaked into Yueyang Sect
and kidnapped Cheng Ling.

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
Why are you asking me where I went last night?

67
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,200
You weren't in the house last night, were you?

68
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,280
How...

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
How do you know that?

70
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,960
Did you see it?

71
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,680
But you really were not in the house.

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,720
I heard that the assassins sneaked
into the Yueyang Sect

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,040
and triggered a full-scale manhunt.

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,320
I was worried that you might feel scared,

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,240
so I came to see you.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,120
Who told you to come to me?

77
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
Did you get caught that late?

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,200
No.

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
I swear.

80
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,840
I certainly know how important reputation is
to girls.

81
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,480
I came here quietly.

82
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
All of them were looking for the assassins,

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
so don't worry, nobody saw it.

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Were you also going to look for Cheng Ling, Xiang?

85
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
That's dangerous!

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,800
It's our duty.

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
You're just a girl.

Cheng Ling will be fine.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Hurry up and go,

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
otherwise people will see us together
early in the morning.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
Just go.

96

It is said that the human heart is sinister,

97
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,400
but since I came out of the valley,

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,240
I met Zhou Xu, Cheng Ling and Brother Cao,

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
and they are all stupid.

100

It's me, Senior.

Are you okay now?

109
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm fine.

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
Where is Uncle Wen, Master?

111
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
Glad to hear you were looking for me
once you woke up.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,440
You are much better than your master.

113
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,880
Let's go.

114
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,160
Where are we going?

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
In such a big world,

we can go wherever we want to go.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
But before we leave,

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,880
we need to find a secluded place

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,880
to take out what's inside Cheng Ling.

120
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,120
It's not a good thing to keep something in the body
for a long time.

121
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
What will we do with it then?

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
Throw it away, bury it or smash it up. Whatever.

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,960
It's not a good thing.

124
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,240
But Master, the Glazed Armor is the reason

125
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,840
why the Ghost Valley wanted to kill
my whole family.

126
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,920

The Heroes Conference is about to start.

129
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,880
It is said that Uncle Gao will then tell the world

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,400
the origin of the Glazed Armor.

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,520
You don't have to wait for the Heroes Conference

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
if you want to know its origin.

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
I can tell you about that.

Twenty years ago,

137
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,240
there was a mysterious master

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,320
who came out of nowhere

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
and made a big name in the martial arts world.

140
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,080
He was Rong Xuan, the Death Sword.

141
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,960
[The Death Sword, Rong Xuan]
He had a strange theory of his own.

142
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
He said that all martial arts in the world
come from the same source,

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,320
so if they all can discard their selfishness

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
and sincerely exchange and learn,

145
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,600
an unprecedented mastery can be created.

146
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000

who didn't know any better with this speech.

who didn't know any better with this speech.

149
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,520
[Zhang Yu Sen in youth]
Twenty years ago,

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,600
the martial arts world
was not as stagnant as it is today,

151
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,240
instead, there were people who knew each other
at first sight,

152
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
and stories of sincere treatment.

153
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,320
People gradually regarded Rong Xuan as the core.

154
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,800
Following his madness,

155
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,910
they wanted to change the traditions

156
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,360
of the martial arts for thousands of years

157
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,240
to create a completely new world.

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,680
However, Rong Xuan fell deeper into his dream.

159
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,800
He began to search for the secret scrolls
in various ways,

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,840
whether by trickery or violence,

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
or even by deception.

162
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
He was an outstanding young man of his generation,

163
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,400
but gradually,

164
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,240
he fell into the bad guy that everyone shouted at.

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,560
Fortunately, his wife was
the great disciple of the Healer Valley,

167
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
Although he was injured several times
by ambushes,

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,960
she saved him from the jaws of death.

169
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,120
God was blind.

170
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
Several years passed,

171
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,160
this group of ignorant people

172
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,200
actually collected countless secret scrolls

173
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,880
and created the World's Armory

174
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,440
in a hidden place.

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,920
He set up many traps outside the armory,

176
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,240
and divided the key into five parts,

177
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,120
respectively to the five strongest friends

178
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
for safekeeping.

179
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,800
Only by collecting five parts of the key

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,440
can one open the World's Armory.

181
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,600
And then?

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,920
Then,

183
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,280
then it was a well-known thing.

184
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,880
At that time, the Five Lakes Alliance
held a Martial Arts Conference,

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,200
calling on all heroes to kill this madman.

186
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,520
Rong Xuan had no other choice

187
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
but to be forced to get out of the Mount Qingya.

188
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
After killing countless people,

189
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,960
he was finally exhausted

190
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,320
and suicided by the demarcation stone
in the Ghost Valley.

191
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
A well-known thing?

192
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Why is it different from the story I heard?

193
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Because it's the end of Rong Xuan's story,

194
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,000
not that of the martial arts world.

195
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,440
After his suicide,

196
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,080
the ghosts in Mount Qingya swarmed out

197
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,280
and started a huge battle
with the martial arts heroes.

198
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,960
It was a nightmare

199
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,880
with many deaths and injuries on both sides.

200
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,120
The martial arts heroes
lost a large part of their people,

201
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,560
and the power of the Ghost Valley
was greatly weakened.

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,080
But the great battle has brought peace

203
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,240
for twenty years in the martial arts world.

204
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,800
Nearly every survivor

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,920
had a loved one

206
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,720
who died in the battle.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,640
The battle

208
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,280
was started for ignominious reasons

209
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,000
and ended up

210
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,040
with disrepute.

211
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,720
That's why people don't want to talk about it.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
Do you mean that all these people who died

213
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,000
were greedy for the treasures in the armory?

214
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,560
If twenty years ago, the Five Lakes Alliance

215
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,200
opened the armory as hoped,

216
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,600
then the Mirror Lake Sword Sect

217
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,880
wouldn't have come to an end.

218
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,080
The Glazed Armor,

219
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
the Glazed Armor is the key.

220
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,920
My dad was

221
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
one of the five friends of Uncle Rong.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
Well. Let bygones be bygones.

223
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
Bygones?

224
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,560
I don't think so.

225
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:52,333
[Chongwu Palace]

226
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,000
The assassins

227
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,240
sneaked into our Five Lakes Alliance last night.

228
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,760
They took Zhang Cheng Ling,
my fourth brother's orphan, away.

229
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,200
This is a major accident.

230
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,680
Maybe we have a mole here.

231
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,440
In the nick of time here, please allow me to be rude.

232
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,520
According to the disciples
of the Five Lakes Alliance,

233
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,840
you were not in your rooms

234
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,680
at the time of the incident yesterday.

235
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
So here,

236
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,360
I'd like to ask everyone to state
where you went last night

237
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
to clear your respective suspicions.

238
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,440
This is also to avoid any hard feelings.

239
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,280
Master, I got my decision.

240
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,280
I can't leave now.

241
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,520
I should go back.

242
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,760
You little idiot.

243
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,920
I said so much but you didn't catch anything.

244
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,720
Since you already know the origin of
the Glazed Armor,

245
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,360
and the bad intentions of these people,

246
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,000
why do you still want to go back?

247
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,080
Because guarding the Glazed Armor is

248
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,120
my dad's last wish.

249
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,240
And I know that many people are involved
in this matter.

250
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,800
Even if I'm useless,

251
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,080
I can't stay out of the way for my own safety.

252
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,760
What's more,
the Heroes Conference is about to start,

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,600
and I'm the only representative
of the Mirror Lake Sword Sect.

254
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,080
If I am absent,

255
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,440
then the Mirror Lake Sword Sect

256
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,320
will really be removed
from the martial arts world.

257
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,840
Cheng Ling, you're quite responsible.

258
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,040
Great.

259
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,960
If you have decided to go back,

260
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
then listen to my advice

261
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,960
and return the Glazed Armor
to the Five Lakes Alliance.

262
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,040
Why?

263
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,720
My father stalemated with
the Five Lakes Alliance for twenty years,

264
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,000
just because of the Glazed Armor.

265
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,600
Cheng Ling,

266
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
which is more important,

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
your safety or the Glazed Armor?

268
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
The Glazed Armor, of course.

269
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,880
No.

270
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,760
There is nothing more important than life.

271
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,200
There is no trouble in this world naturally,

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
ignorant people always create trouble
for themselves.

273
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
Cheng Ling,

274
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,920
what do you think of my martial arts skills?

275
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Your skills are definitely the best.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,760
My martial arts skills are not bad,

277
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,880
which can be considered as first-class.

278
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,880
But I am only proficient

279
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,600
in a dozen martial arts of my clan.

280
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,600
There is an end to life, but never to learning.

281
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Ordinary people can't study a martial art
thoroughly

282
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,040
even if they spend their whole life.

283
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,240
Therefore, even if the armory is opened

284
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,280
and each person is given a kind of martial art,
what can be done?

285
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
That's just human greed.

286
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,360
But Master, my dad told me...

287
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,320
Cheng Ling,

288
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,840
It was not the armory that Chevalier Zhang
clung to,

289
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,680
but brotherhood.

290
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
If your dad really wanted to open the armory,

291
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,200
he would have done so 20 years ago,

292
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
not now.

293
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,040
Rong Xuan has passed away,

294
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,240
so has your father.

295
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,680
If they can see you,

296
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,280
they must hope that

297
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,360
you can be relieved from what happened
20 years ago,

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
and live your own life.

299
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,400
They don't want you to keep carrying this trouble

300
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,440
and getting coveted and robbed constantly.

301
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
I leave other people alone

302
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,880
who live their lives around greed.

303
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,760
But I can't leave you alone.

304
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,760
Take my advice,

305
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,400
throw this trouble out

306
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,600
and let them scramble.

307
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,200
Excuse me,

308
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,240
Miss.

309
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,240
May I know which sect you are from?

310
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,240
Me?

311
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,200
I am nobody,

312
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,120
not belonging to any sect.

313
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm just a girl from the countryside.

314
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Everyone in our area says

315
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,520
Chevalier Gao is highly skilled in martial arts
with an extraordinary spirit.

316
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,400
Today I am honored to meet you.

317
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,800
I find what they said is quite true.

318
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,320
Dad.

319
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,480
She is Gu Xiang, a friend of Wei Ning.

320
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,280
He gave me a heads up on her.

321
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,560
I arranged for her to stay.

322
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,280
By the way, she's also an old friend of Cheng Ling.

323
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,360
She's not a bad guy.

324
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,000
Sister Xiao Lian, you're not smart.

325
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,560
Why do you mention this?

326
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,520
Miss Gu.

327
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,560
How did you meet Cheng Ling?

328
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,320
It's pretty obvious, right?

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,760
Young Master Zhang

330
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,640
is handsome with a good heart,

331
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,760
and he's also the offspring of a noted family.

332
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,400
Is there anyone who doesn't know him?

333
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,560
All of us in Yue know him.

334
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
Miss Gu, where were you last night?

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,760
Chevalier Gao,

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
sorry, Chief Gao.

337
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,360
Why so harsh?

338
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,200
I'm a girl from the countryside
without worldly experience.

339
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,920
Your dominance

340
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,080
scares me a little.

341
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,320
Dad.

342
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,080
Shut up.

343
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,040
You are glib-tongued

344
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
and seem rather wicked.

345
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,680
You are definitely not a good girl.

346
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Why did you let her stay over?

347
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,360
Why did you say I'm not a good girl?

348
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
Should I deliberately put on a soft voice?

349
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,920
You.

350
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,440
Uncle Gao.

351
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,960
Uncle Gao, please don't blame Sister Xiao Lian

352
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,800
and Xiang.

353
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,590
It's all my fault.

354
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,279
Don't take the blame on yourself, Wei Ning.

355
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,760
Tell me. Where were you last night?

356
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,240
You'd better be honest,

357
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,070
or I'll punish you.

358
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,800
I.

359
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,280
She was with me the whole night.

360
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:41,231
[Yueyang Sect]

361
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,760
Cheng Ling, remember

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
that you should let others know as much as possible

363
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,800
the Glazed Armor is no longer in your possession.

364

732
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,320
Luckily,

733
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,680
after Cheng Ling took the Glazed Armor
out of his body,

734
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,080
he's safe now.

735
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,720
Xiang,

736
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,200
maybe you should not risk staying
in Yueyang Sect.

737
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,680
Make up a lie and leave there.

738
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,280
Master, do you want me to go back?

739
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Ah Xu,

740
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,680
do you mind her

741
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,240
following us?

742
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Of course not.

743
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,640
I'd love to have a beauty

744
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,360
with us.

745
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,640
No, I disagree.

746
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,680
I'll give you a break, Xiang.

747
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,240
Just go everywhere you want to go.

748
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,080
I...

749
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,200
I don't want to go anywhere.

750
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,760
Master,

751
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,520
I just want to stay in the Yueyang Sect
to protect Cheng Ling.

752
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,960
You're going to pick up Cheng Ling

753
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
after the Hero Conference, right?

754
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,800
So, just in case,

755
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,360
please allow me to protect him.

756
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,760
He's stupid.

757
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,400
Who's there?

758
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,920
Get out.

759
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,680
Brother Zhou,

760
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,320
it's me.

761
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,000
Cao Wei Ning, from the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

762
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,800
You...

763
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,880
Xiang.

764
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,680
How can you not even know

765
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
there was someone following you?

766
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Cao Wei Ning, are you following me?

767
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,720
No, I don't dare.

768
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
I just heard from Zhu Yao Zhi

769
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,360
that someone wrote to ask you to meet here.

770
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,720
I thought it must be Master Wen,

771
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,120
so I felt a bit nervous

772
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,920
and came with you.

773
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,960
Why are you nervous about my master
looking for me?

774
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm afraid you'll leave.

775
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So that's why she's not willing to

776
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,120
leave the Yueyang Sect.

777
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,000
Xiang, so you decided to stay for me?

778
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,240
Her words don't count.

779
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,120
I'll decide whether she should leave or not.

780
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,760
Brother Zhou,

781
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,320
Xiang said you are seriously ill,

782
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,200
and Master Wen has found many doctors for you.

783
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,800
My master knows a lot of people,

784
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,280
and there must be competent doctors among them.

785
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,280
He'll be back in a few days
for the Heroes Conference.

786
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,280
I will introduce you two to him.

787
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,800
With the extensive knowledge,
he must have a solution.

788
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,200
I'll take care of Ah Xu,

789
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,400
so don't bother.

790
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,480
Thank you, Brother Cao.

791
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,120
But to be honest,

792
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm terminally ill and have no more days to live.

793
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,200
Thanks for your good intention.

794
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,960
Brother Zhou, I didn't expect you to have
such a serious illness.

795
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
It's a trick of fate.

796
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,320
A trick of fate.

797
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
But Brother Zhou, there's must be a way.

798
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,800
My master and Chief Gao are bosom friends.

799
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,680
I heard that Chief Gao has a good relationship

800
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
with the three sages of the Healer Valley.

801
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
I can beg my master

802
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,960
to let him help you enter the Healer Valley.

803
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,080
Things may still turn around.

804
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,600
You are such a warm-hearted man.

805
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,840
You are worthy of chevalier,

806
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,600
which moved me.

807
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,040
It's just that I'm paranoid.

808
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,560
Instead of wasting my time
in seeking medical treatment,

809
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,760
I would rather carry a jug of wine

810
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,640
to travel around the world

811
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,320
with my soulmate while I am still healthy,

812
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,760
and do whatever I want to do

813
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,080
without regret.

814
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,240
But

815
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,520
since Xiang is a girl,

816
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,960
it's inconvenient for her

817
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,920
to follow us around.

818
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,880
Today we both

819
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,280
happened to be discussing

820
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,840
if we could find a trustworthy partner for her

821
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,280
so that she can be settled,

822
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,320
we will be relieved.

823
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Bro... Brother Zhou, Master Wen,

824
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,960
do you think

825
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,680
I'm trustworthy?
