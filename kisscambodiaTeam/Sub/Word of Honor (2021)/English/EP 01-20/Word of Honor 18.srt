[Episode 18]

23
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,160
Cheng Ling, carry this little brat on your back.

24
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,190
Let's go.

25
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,470
Little brat,
the strength of your lower body has grown.

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,080
Master.

27
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't make such a big fuss.

28
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,360
Take control of yourself.

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,110
There're many dangers ahead.

30
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,320
If you don't want to die,

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,190
just follow my steps closely.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,000
The disciple of Qin Huai Zhang.

33
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,720
Keep eyes on your silly disciple.

34
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,720
Brat, you'd better be smart.

35
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,320
Your little tricks

36
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,510
are just pieces of cake for me.

37
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,510
I can forgive you for the first time,

38
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,350
but if you dare do it again

39
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,270
I'll let Wen Ke Xing break your fingers.

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,110
Why me?

41
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,600
Don't you know my nickname,
Philanthropist Wen?

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,390
How could I

43
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,070
do this kind of cruelest thing?

44
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,200
Ah Xu, listen to that.

45
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,070
Shut up!

46
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,000
Master.

47
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,200
Why does the Longyuan Cabinet Leader

48
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,200
live in such a remote place?

49
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,390
There're all kinds of people
in this enormous world.

50
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,550
So he lives in such a place

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
with so many traps.

52
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,230
How heart-pounding it is.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,110
What if he gets lost

54
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,550
when he goes out?

55
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,480
Is that the same as

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,510
putting mouse clips aside one's own bed?

57
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,720
Put mouse clips aside one's own bed.

58
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,670
Once a mouse got into my room,

59
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,270
and I couldn't catch it.

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,230
So I put two mouse clips under my bed.

61
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,270
But I forgot them when I got up
the next morning.

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,790
One step down,

63
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,760
I was caught in a rat trap and broke my foot.

64
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
You little brat, the reasons why people hide

65
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,350
are nothing but the common ones.

66
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,160
Either he always feels like an enemy is after him,

67
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,480
so that he needs to hide in

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
a place no one can find

69
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,790
or

70
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,550
Long Que is a yesman

71
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,880
and he's always being taken advantage of

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,110
while he never starts a feud with others.

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
The disciple of Qin Huai Zhang,

74
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,920
your master knows this best.

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,160
Then it must be the second reason.

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,440
Sadness.

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,640
The person he wants to meet won't appear anymore,

78
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,070
so he just hides and refuses to meet anybody else

79
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,000
to avoid being reminded of the person.

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
If your master disappears one day,

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,670
I'll find a place like this and hide.

82
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,000
See no one anymore.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Just like…

84
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
Just like the story of Yu Bo Ya cutting the strings?

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,790
It's okay. It won't happen.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,040
Master's internal skills are superb,

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,270
and he always does the good things,

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,350
so he will sure to grow old safe and sound.

89
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,230
Doing evil brings gold and fortune

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,480
while doing good leaves no whole corpse.

91
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,110
You little brat, do you want to die?

92
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,550
Senior Ye, please guide the way.

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,200
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,950
Don't you want to go to Longyuan Cabinet?

95
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,550
It's on the opposite.

96
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,230
What? Are you afraid
that I will trigger the traps?

97
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,760
Three masters are overwatching me.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,790
What else can I do?

99
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,760
Little idiot, let me carry him.

100
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Let's go.

101
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,440
Hold on.

102
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,920
Young Leader Long, please forgive me.

103
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,110
I'll go first then, Ah Xu.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,350
It's not your turn.

105
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll go first.

106
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,920
-Senior.
-Old Monster.

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Just kidding.

108
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,510
Childish.

109
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,230
Come over.

110
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll go first.

111
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,350
Watch out.

112
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,470
I was pretending. Now it's real for you.

113
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,320
Master.

114
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,590
Uncle Wen.

115
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,440
Master, Uncle Wen.

116
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,910
Master.

117
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,320
Lao Wen.

118
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,000
Lao Wen.

119
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,400
Ah Xu.

120
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,000
Stop talking.

121
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,790
I'm OK.

122
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,200
It's just like having my guts moved.

123
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,350
I need to get used to that.

124
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,670
I don't know.

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Where is the little brat?

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,670
I didn't expect

127
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,000
that he has the mettle to cross the rubicon.

128
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,640
I hurt so bad from this falling.

129
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,030
He must be dead now.

130
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,640
He didn't fall down.

131
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,840
Can he fly?

132
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,350
Weird.

133
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,110
I did remember the position of

134
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,710
Ye Bai Yi's every step.

135
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,960
How come he was fine

136
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,670
while I triggered the trap?

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
The reason why the trap was triggered

138
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,880
might be the weight.

139
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,080
The weight of Ye Bai Yi
is not heavy enough to trigger it.

140
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,000
But when we three stepped on it,
things were different.

141
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,910
I thought they would hold back

142
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,590
when Long Xiao was under our control.

143
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,110
Who would know that the traps
in Longyuan Cabinet are so ingenious?

144
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,520
Where is it?

145
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,110
Why is it so dark?

146
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,320
I thought this was the nether world.

147
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not really that high.

148
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,150
If it were not for me,

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
you would not have fainted.

150
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,470
We must have hit the second tier of the trap

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,350
on the way down.

152
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,150
That's why we are here.

153
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,470
Master.

154
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,840
Uncle Wen.

155
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,000
Alright, alright, just get up.

156
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,030
Don't mourn anymore.

157
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,150
Little idiot,

158
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,640
use your brain.

159
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,400
The brat triggered the trap

160
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,670
and was the first to fall into the valley.

161
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Did you think he was willing to die
with that couple?

162
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,470
There must be some tricks.

163
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,840
Right, Master wouldn't die definitely.

164
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,370
So wouldn't Uncle Wen.

165
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,890
Don't worry, scourges never die

166
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,690
so they won't die that easily.

167
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,250
Lao Wen,

168
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,810
are you very nervous?

169
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,490
What am I nervous about?

170
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,050
Then why are you grabbing me?

171
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,610
I'm not.

172
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,010
-Drug men.
-Drug men.

173
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,810
I wanted you two to die without a burial place,

174
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,450
but after a second thought,

175
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,570
if you guys die

176
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,170
without enjoying

177
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,570
these sophisticated traps,

178
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,610
it will be a waste.

179
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,890
Look at these adorable kids.

180
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,690
They are my proudest works

181
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,490
and the first group of drug men that I made.

182
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,930
Although they are silly,

183
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,050
they are still my first-born.

184
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,050
I couldn't bear to destroy them,

185
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,370
so I keep them here secretly.

186
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,450
When passengers passed here by chance,

187
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,450
I would open the trap
to throw them down here

188
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,370
to feed these kids.

189
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,810
I've left so many days.

190
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,250
They must be very starving.

191
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,730
Kids, time to eat.

192
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,570
It turns out drug men are raised
by the Longyuan Cabinet.

193
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,010
Uncle Long has been upstanding in his whole life.

194
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,570
I didn't expect that his beloved only son is

195
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,690
so frenzied

196
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,930
to make drug men with Scorpion.

197
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,130
Upstanding?

198
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,810
That's stupid.

199
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,250
I'm his only son.

200
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,810
He knows that there is something to cure me

201
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,810
in this world,

202
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,050
but he still let me be in this status,

203
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,810
neither human nor ghost.

204
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,250
It's the disability you're born with.

205
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,570
There is no medicine to cure it.

206
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,450
Even the elixir to bring the dead back

207
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,570
can make you grow.

208
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,690
You know nothing.

209
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,250
Yin Yang Book, the treasure of Healer Valley,

210
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,930
can cure all the intractable diseases
in the world.

211
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,250
In the days when Rong Xuan was terminally ill
and all the meridians of his heart were broken,

212
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,450
Yue Feng Er could bring him back to life still.

213
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,890
My sickness can and must be cured, too.

214
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,250
Alright,

215
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,250
if you say so.

216
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,690
You're the butcher, and I'm the meat.

217
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,490
As long as you're happy…

218
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,370
You…

219
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,610
You're doomed to die.
I won't waste time talking to you.

220
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,810
The old man doesn't help me, but God does.

221
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,490
I can open the armory without him.

222
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,130
It's too bad that you can't
see the majestic posture

223
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,610
when I stand up.

224
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,810
Even though Rong Xuan was

225
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,730
saved by Yin Yang Book before,

226
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,810
what happened then?

227
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,690
He went against the laws of nature
and became mad.

228
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,690
You don't care.

229
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,610
I almost forget that

230
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,250
you're a lunatic.

231
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,010
Of course you don't care.

232
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,450
What do you know exactly?

233
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,570
You want to know the secret of Yin Yang Book.

234
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,170
Then you choose the right person to ask.

235
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,050
It's just that I don't like talking to people
with my head up.

236
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,570
You need to figure it out yourself.

237
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,490
You're the heir of Healer Valley.

238
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,050
kind of.

239
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,490
Little brat, who is cheating?

240
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,690
The heirs of Healer Valley died out already.

241
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,610
Oops, don't coax him.

242
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,570
Kids, eat them all.

243
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,850
Kill them first.

244
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,450
Why the hell is there so much of it?

245
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,330
Ah Xu, can you hold on?

246
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,930
What can I do if I can't?

247
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,970
Stop saying this nonsense.

248
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,210
If we can't get through this,

249
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,850
it must be my fault.

250
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,050
Take it back.

251
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,050
Lao Wen,

252
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,370
my life is worthwhile

253
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,330
for being your friend.

254
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,330
It's so fortunate that your feeling is
the same as mine.

255
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,970
My head is aching when you're reading poems.

256
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,390
Long Que,

257
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,790
I, Ye Bai Yi, am here.

258
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,750
Won't you come out and welcome me?

259
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,230
Senior, are we going in?

260
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,150
There must be many traps in the cabinet.

261
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,990
I'll go first and have an exploration.

262
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,790
You stay here and wait. Don't move.

263
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,230
Insignificant tricks.

264
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,710
Be careful, Senior Ye.

265
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,470
Little brat.

266
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,990
Long Xiao, get out of here.

267
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,830
[No wonder no one can find Longyuan Cabinet.]

268
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,310
[The cabinet turns out to be camouflage.]

269
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,310
[The real one is under the abyss.]

270
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,790
Master.

271
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,270
Master.

272
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,470
Master.

273
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,630
You're alive as we expected.

274
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,910
Where is my master?

275
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,470
Your master might be

276
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,070
walking on the Naihe Bridge now.

277
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,630
If you die faster,

278
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,390
you might catch up with him.

279
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,470
Bullshit.

280
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,390
The number of times I've had my ass chased

281
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,710
can be counted with one hand.

282
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,150
And it's  all because of you.

283
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,230
It's called arrogance would bring you
retribution eventually.

284
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,790
Ah Xu, Officer Zhou, please pity me.

285
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,790
I don't suffer any loss in my life.

286
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,190
Now I'm so poor because of being schemed.

287
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,950
Maybe I've run out of good fortune

288
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,390
when I meet you.

289
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,390
I've got such a big misfortune.

290
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,950
Let's go.

291
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,790
It seems like we're on the hillside.

292
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,450
Let me take the lead.

293
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,610
You cover me.

294
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,810
Or what? If the lead dies,

295
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,370
could I be alive by myself?

296
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,610
Even it was an extremely dangerous place,

297
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,050
we still got through.

298
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,050
I think of a story.

299
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,970
There is a man in the desert.

300
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,210
I've heard of this story before,
Philanthropist Wen.

301
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,610

Hi, bro.

336
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,970
Where is this?

337
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,730
Bro.

338
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,970
Bro.

339
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,490
I didn't expect that the puppet skills
of Longyuan Cabinet have

340
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,330
reached this kind of ingenious degree.

341
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,930
Which kind of evil thing is it!

342
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,610
In my lifetime,

343
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,450
it's so surprising to hear
that you call other things evil.

344
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,370
Watch out!

345
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,410
I just said one word to him.

346
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,370
Is the word heavy enough to make him so mad
to explode itself?

347
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,650
Ah Xu, its temper is so bad

348
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,250
almost like yours.

349
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,130
Idiot.

350
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,010
Just like I said, the scourge never dies.

351
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,170
That little idiot is crying as if his parents died.

352
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,250
While you're enjoying yourself

353
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,490
and flirting with each other.

354
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,530
Senior, where is Cheng Ling?

355
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,980
Old Monster, he is asking you now.

356
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,100
Where is our silly disciple?

357
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,740
Lost.

358
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,620
Little brat, he runs so fast.

359
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,820
Our Longyuan Cabinet is full of traps and holes.

360
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,420
If I just let you run

361
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,580
at your will,

362
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,740
Believe or not

363
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,820
You couldn't escape
even when you were starving to death.

364
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,860
You're so stubborn.

365
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,340
Good, very good.

366
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,860
I like kids of your style.

367
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,500
The tougher you are,

368
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,540
The more melodious sound
of breaking your bone is.

369
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,820
Have you figured it out yet?

370
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,940
What are you rushing for?

371
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,940
Shut up!

372
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,420
The little idiot of ours

373
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,060
is still held by Long Xiao.

374
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,820
He's not your kid and

375
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,820
you're not worried about him.

376
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,220
Lao Wen, this trap is cycling

377
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,220
and is changing all the time.

378
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,540
No one can't figure it out within a few minutes.

379
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,860
So be it if that's the case.

380
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
The most powerful is strength.

381
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,340
We can barge in anyway.

382
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,460
And I can burn this place down with fire.

383
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,940
Little idiot,

384
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,460
do you know what purple golden liquid is?

385
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,180
Of course, you don't know.

386
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,900
Look at how ignorant you are!

387
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,940
Old Monster, you still get the spare time
to mock at me.

388
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,900
Hurry!

389
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,220
I tell you what,

390
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,100
all you need to know that

391
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,900
the motivation of the traps in this valley comes

392
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,260
from the purple golden liquid.

393
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,620
And it will explode once being ignited.

394
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,780
The power can blow all the things to heaven.

395
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,700
This is?

396
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,660
This is the map of Longyuan Valley.

397
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,220
Let go of me, you guys let me go.

398
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,980
Why do you tie me up?

399
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Kill me if you have guts!

400
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Of course I won't kill you, kid.

401
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,300
You're the son of Zhang Yu Sen, right?

402
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,020
Twenty years ago,

403
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,900
Our fathers were friends.

404
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,940
Why didn't you tell me early?

405
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,100
Your father was my grand master's friend, too.

406
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,900
Since we have this kind of relationship,

407
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,540
we can talk in a normal way.

408
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,460
If we don't have this kind of relationship,

409
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,260
I can let you die in a most comfortable way.

410
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,660
Just because of the friendship
between your father and Long Que,

411
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,100
I won't let you die so easily.

412
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,860
Don't worry.

413
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,980
These two are the masters trained by myself.

414
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,300
They will make you feel better.

415
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,540
Where to start?

416
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,460
I'll dig your eyes first.

417
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,180
Human eyeballs are good medicinal materials.

418
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,300
Wait, wait for a moment.

419
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,620
Do you know

420
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,580
why do I like to stay underground?

421
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,780
Because I've lived in the dark

422
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,400
since the moment I was born.

423
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,600
As I am doomed to live my life in darkness,

424
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,200
Then the darkness is my home.

425
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,720
What's wrong?

426
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
You like moving underground so much.

427
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,640
Is that just because

428
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,240
you were born to be a mouse in the gutter?

429
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,440
Purple golden liquid.

430
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,240
Right.

431
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,720
Your mouse hole is circuitous and intricate.

432
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,240
Even though with a map,

433
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,680
nobody wants to get in.

434
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,600
Why don't just explode it?

435
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,760
My kids!

436
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,560
What did you do to them?

437
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,280
That's the heart of theirs.

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
Drug men are your kids.

439
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,360
The puppets are your kids, too.

440
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,160
You're a mouse dedicated to raising bastards.

441
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,680
This is such a remote place.

442
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,560
Where can we find so many explosives?

443
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,760
Luckily, you have so many kids

444
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,040
and they're generous enough

445
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,480
to sacrifice themselves.

446
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,080
I still have one piece left.
Just give it back to you.

447
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,400
Wait, Lao Wen.

448
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,360
Okay, you tell me

449
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,760
if the needle in my disciple's head
can be removed?

450
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,200
Zhou Zi Shu, you killed my kids

451
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,240
and used their hearts to make explosives.

452
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,960
I'll never let your disciple go.

453
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
I'll let him die together with me.

454
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,080
Little brat, you need to think it twice.

455
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,640
As far as I know,

456
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,720
people with a whole complete body

457
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,440
would act totally different from

458
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
those who are disabled.

459
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,520
Do you want me to help you to experience it?

460
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,840
I was born with a disability.

461
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,960
You can't scare me.

462
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,720
I didn't even think about letting you go, either.

463
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,800
Senior Ye,

464
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
What is this for?

465
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,880
Hold on, don't!

466
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,160
Why not?

467
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,360
What are you afraid of?

468
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,480
It won't let him die.

469
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,240
If he dies, I'll get you a new one.

470
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,760
Master, you come to save me again.

471
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,960
The word again is a really nice touch.

472
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Ah Xu, why don't you calculate the fate

473
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,160
before you take disciple.

474
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,920
What a misfortune fate he has

475
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,080
that he encounters disasters unceasingly.

476
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,760
Master, they wanted to dig my eyes.

477
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
Leader Long is benevolent in his whole life

478
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,760
While you're so vicious.

479
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,080
Benevolence?

480
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,520
That old man is so hypocritical,

481
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,200
sitting idly and watching his son half dead.

482
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,800
This bullshit

483
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,760
can be told to your father when you meet him.

484
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,280
Master,

485
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,560
This puppet looks like the villain

486
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,680
a lot.

487
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,160
It's this puppet that

488
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,360
leads us to the entrance of the underground palace.

489
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,920
It must be made by Long Que

490
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,280
with the look of his devoted son.

491
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,680
For some people, all they do this life

492
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,800
is to bring trouble to their parents.

493
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,440
Master, what is this smell? So stinky.

494
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,320
A dead-alive person in a remote
and humble house.

495
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,560
Please forgive my poor hospitality.

496
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,250
[Longyuan Cabinet Leader Long Que]

497
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,440
This is Long Que.

498
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,680
Uncle Long.

499
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,080
Zi Shu, it's really your voice.

500
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,360
I thought I was dreaming.

501
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,200
Is your master fine?

502
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,440
Uncle Long,

503
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,840
you still remember me.

504
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,240
My master has passed away.

505
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,520
Yeah, how can I forget you?

506
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,040
Once someone is too miserable
to face the reality,

507
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,200
all he could do is sinking into the memory.

508
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,360
When I close my eyes,

509
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,360
I can see your naive look

510
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,360
when you first came to Four Season Manor.

511
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,930
Huai Zhang has passed away.

512
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,090
Yeah, some people who were dead
just like they were alive.

513
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,850
Some people who are alive are better to be dead.

514
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,010
Instead of letting your son live,

515
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,210
you'd better chock him to death
when he was born.

516
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,130
He is not my son, just a beast.

517
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,610
My son died already.

518
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,930
I'm too tired to mind the messy business
between you and your son.

519
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,930
I don't mind

520
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,890
even if you close your eyes and ears
and lie to yourself.

521
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,090
However, the little beast of yours

522
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,170
is cheating and harming others outside

523
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,650
in the name of Longyuan Cabinet.

524
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,890
Since you still don't take control of it.

525
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,610
I can't control it, either.

526
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,250
Uncle Long.

527
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,650
I don't know how long I have been

528
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,490
imprisoned here by that vile spawn.

529
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,930
How dare you do this to your father!

530
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,130
Even the animals are far better than you.

531
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,130
I'm a beast.

532
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,010
Is he a good person, then?

533
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,210
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

534
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,730
Yet he treats me in such a cruel way.

535
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,690
He knew that there is medicine in this world

536
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,090
to cure me

537
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,250
But he still let me be a half-dead carp.

538
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,930
I treat him like this

539
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,450
and he is still not willing to help me.

540
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,490
Nonsense.

541
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,490
Your father has been so worried
about your illness.

542
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,530
Everyone knows about it.

543
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,890
He is referring to helping him to get Ying Yang Book,

544
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,850
