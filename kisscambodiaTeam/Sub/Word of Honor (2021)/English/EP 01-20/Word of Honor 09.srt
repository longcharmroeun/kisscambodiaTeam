553
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
If we used force,

554
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,470
would you still be alive right now?

555
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
The World's Armory

556
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,150
has the secret arts
from all sects and clans,

557
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,190
including that of the Beggar Gangs.

558
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,360
It is completely reasonable
for us to take back the Glazed Armor.

559
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,040
Madam Pei, this is for your own good.

560
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,360
Look at our other friends here.

561
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,520
They're not as reasonable
as the Beggar Gangs.

562
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,470
Master Huang, what do you mean?

563
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,390
What?

564
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,710
The Four Sages of Anji are right.

565
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,430
The Glazed Armor belongs to no one.

566
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,760
Whoever is strong controls it.

567
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,390
If the Beggar Gangs
have the right to fight for it,

568
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,360
does the Mount Hua Sect not?

569
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
What does this have to do with you?

570
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,870
Is it even your turn?

571
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,390
Stinky beggar.

572
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,670
Are you stupid from kowtowing for food?

573
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,910
[Gao Shan Nu]
The Glazed Armor

574
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,520
[Gao Shan Nu]
was last with that old man, Ao Lai Zi.

575
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,000
Everyone knows that the Ghost Valley

576
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,520
killed him.

577
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,280
Now it's with the "Four Idiots of Anji".

578
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,470
That means they're the Ghost Valley's dogs!

579
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,870
You damned midget!

580
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,910
This is no place for you to speak!

581
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,760
Third Brother!

582
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,520
Third Brother!

583
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,470
Third Brother!

584
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Feng Xiao Feng,
you vicious bastard!

585
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,000
Give us the antidote!

586
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,360
Then give me the Glazed Armor!

587
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Do you have any dignity?

588
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,360
It's okay for the Beggar Gangs, the Mount Hua Sect,
and the Kongtong Sect

589
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,280
to fight for the Glazed Armor.

590
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,000
After all, there are their secret records
in the armory.

591
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,600
Which hole

592
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,430
did you midget jump out of?

593
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,280
Twenty years ago, you weren't even
in the martial arts world.

594
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,800
Scram! Scram far away!

595
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,910
You disgust me!

596
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,000
Gao Shan Nu, beat her!

597
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,710
Enough!

598
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Elder Huang. The Beggar Gangs have always been
on good terms with the Five Lakes Alliance.

599
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,840
But you and your disciples
keep making trouble

600
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,040
in the city!

601
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,600
Are you disregarding the Five Lakes Alliance?

602
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,230
Chief Gao, I should be the one
asking you that!

603
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,520
The Five Lakes Alliance
gets arrogant and unbearable recently,

604
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,430
but I let it go for your sake.

605
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,600
Now you brought so many people
to attack us?

606
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,280
Is the Five Lakes Alliance
acting this overbearing

607
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,870
because you think there's no equal left
in the martial arts world?

608
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,280
Elder Huang.

609
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,630
It's not your place to represent
the martial arts world, is it?

610
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,870
Mount Hua Sect only follows
Chief Gao's lead!

611
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,190
You ass kisser!

612
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,190
The reputation
of the Five Mount and Sword Sects

613
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,910
is ruined because of you!

614
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,150
Elder Huang.

615
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,630
You are so close
with Tao Hong and Lv Liu.

616
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,080
You are the one that humiliated
the Beggar Gangs!

617
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,520
Better than the Five Lakes Alliance

618
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,120
that has no dignity to begin with!

619
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,150
Grandma Tao Hong.
Don't think you can gossip as you wish

620
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,910
just because you are a woman.

621
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,600
I can't cut off your tongue,

622
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,190
but I can cut off your neck!

623
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,190
How dare you!

624
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,760
What are you doing?

625
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,840
Shen Shen! How do you dare say that?

626
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,120
And you pride yourself on being from
a proper and famous sect!

627
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,840
Killing devils and maintaining justice
is the duty of a proper sect!

628
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,630
Chief Gao, you are indeed bold!

629
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,560
How many worms did you spill

630
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,190
from this old clay pot?

631
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,430
This is disgusting.

632
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm not fighting you all anymore!

633
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,320
Feng Xiao Feng! Don't you leave!

634
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,190
Leave the antidote!

635
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,390
Fifth Brother. Stop him!

636
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,800
Follow me!

637
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,430
Madam Pei, this is Master Gao.

638
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,120
The Four Sages of Anji
are my honored guests.

639
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,710
I'll wait and see

640
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,600
who dares to trouble you!

641
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,120
Madam Pei!

642
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,950
The Glazed Armor!

643
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,430
Stop! Don't kill him!

644
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,470
We've lived in seclusion for fifteen years,
and forgotten all of our worries.

645
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,470
Fifteen years of accompaniment

646
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,150
was destroyed in one instant

647
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,430
because of this thing!

648
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,600
Brother Du, you...!

649
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,560
Chief Gao.

650
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,950
The four of us retreated from the world
long ago,

651
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,190
and only wanted to spend the rest of our lives
in the forest.

652
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,120
We only came out

653
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,190
to take part in the Heroes Conference

654
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,430
because of you.

655
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,230
But I never expected

656
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,230
that a loyal friendship between you and me

657
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,710
would cause us to die in Yueyang City.

658
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,470
Gao Chong.

659
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,840
Brother Pei stole the Glazed Armor
for you.

660
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,360
Was it worth it?

661
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,190
Was it?

662
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,040
Brother Du. I do apologize!

663
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,230
But Brother Du, please rest assured.

664
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,600
I will definitely

665
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,000
avenge you and the others!

666
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,560
What is the point of keeping you

667
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,870
if I have no soulmates left?

668
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,630
Brother Du!

669
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,190
No!

670
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,840
Chief Gao.

671
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,600
Every debt has a debtor.

672
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,430
The Four Sages of Anji either directly

673
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,040
or indirectly died
because of Feng Xiao Feng.

674
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,670
This is not related to the Beggar Gangs.

675
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,390
This brother was tricked and poisoned.

676
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,760
Tao Hong and Lv Liu
acted out of self-defense.

677
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,910
The Beggar Gangs and the Five Lakes Alliance

678
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,600
don't need to ruin our relationship
because of this small incident...

679
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,710
Elder Huang!

680
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,760
Don't you want the Glazed Armor?

681
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,560
Take it!

682
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,800
Is one piece enough?

683
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,520
I'll give you another!

684
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,150
Everyone!

685
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,390
On July 15th,

686
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,800
after the Heroes Conference,

687
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,760
I will clearly explain

688
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,600
everything

689
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,080
about the Glazed Armor to you all!

690
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,360
Elder Huang. The two of us

691
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,000
must settle our matters

692
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,760
after the conference!

693
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,980
