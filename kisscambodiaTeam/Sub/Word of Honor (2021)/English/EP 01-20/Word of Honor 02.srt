00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,800
Uncles, hurry up and heal your injuries
with your internal strength.

363
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,880
I'll guard you!

364
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
[Road, brightness, ordinary, saint]

365
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,160
Silly kid!

366
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,400
He's a good kid.

367
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,880
But he's silly.

368
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Tuberculosis, can you still stand up?

369
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,880
I need 15 minutes.

370
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,560
Alright.

371
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,560
Hanged Ghost, one of the top ten evil ghosts
from Mount Qingya is here!

372
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,160
Hand in the Glazed Armor

373
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,480
and I'll make you suffer less!

374
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,360
You foul ghost!

375
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Go in!

376
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Uncle Li!

377
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,320
Uncle Li!

378
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,520
I'll kill you!

379
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,080
I didn't expect that

380
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Qiu Yue Jian would have

381
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,720
such a useless kid.

382
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,800
You evil Hanged Ghost!

383
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,360
How dare you do evil in front of me?

384
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
I'll make you into the real ghost!

385
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,480
You! Beggar!

386
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,720
You're good at martial arts.

387
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,080
Nice sword.

388
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,480
Master!

389
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,560
Brother, we've met again.

390
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,360
Li!

391
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,360
Uncle Li!

392
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,480
Bastard.

393
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,800
I was almost brought away by the Grim Reaper.

394
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,280
Master! Master!

395
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,720
Hurry up and save him!

396
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,200
Why are you crying?

397
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,800
I'm not dead yet.

398
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,360
It's not too late to cry for me

399
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,400
after I take my last breath.

400
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,520
Tuberculosis.

401
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,920
Your martial arts are good.

402
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,280
Slightly better than yours.

403
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,400
I gave up.

404
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,880
I never owe anyone in my life.

405
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,960
I can finally repay my life today.

406
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,240
I can rest in peace now.

407
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,160
You

408
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,400
rode and dashed two times.

409
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
One trip costs three mace of silver,

410
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,080
including the interest...

411
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,880
If you're not a bastard,

412
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,680
you shall repay me.

413
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,920
What do you want me to do? Just say it.

414
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
I want you

415
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,960
to bring this kid

416
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,600
to Five Lakes Alliance's

417
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,000
Zhao Jing safely.

418
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,880
Uncle Li!

419
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,560
No, I'm not leaving!

420
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,800
Silly kid!

421
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,520
You're a good kid.

422
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,640
But your father has taught you

423
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,400
too well.

424
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,000
In the future...

425
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,720
Tuberculosis, what's your name?

426
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,360
I'm

427
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,680
Zhou Xu.

428
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,440
Zhou Xu?

429
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,360
Alright.

430
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,400
Silly kid, show your respect!

431
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,600
In the future, you must listen to him.

432
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,920
Hurry up!

433
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,600
Uncle Zhou.

434
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,800
Good.

435
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,600
Zhou Xu, he has paid his respect.

436
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,880
You must be loyal to him.

437
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,920
I'll...

438
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,240
I'll remember your name.

439
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
God will be watching you.

440
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,360
If you break your promise,

441
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,360
I'll curse your ancestors

442
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,960
even if I'm in the Netherworld!

443
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
Uncle Li!

444
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,670
Uncle Li!

445
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,480
Uncle Li!

446
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,360
Uncle Li!

447
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,560
Uncle Li!

448
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,190
Uncle!

449
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,840
I promise you.

450
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,120
Call the boatman here!

451
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,920
Yes!

452
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,130
[Yue]

453
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,680
What's wrong?

454
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,520
What are you waiting for? Prepare the boats!

455
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,600
Senior, this boat is gouged.

456
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,120
[Disciple of Yueyang Sect, Deng Kuan]
Senior, this too!

457
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,360
Senior, this too!

458
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,560
Senior!

459
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,160
The boatman is dead.
His whole family is killed.

460
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,240
Do you know his name?

461
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,600
I only know his surname, Li.

462
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,320
Brother Li.

463
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,040
You have a good sense.

464
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,640
You entrusted the kid to Brother Zhou.

465
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,760
Brother Zhou looks firm.

466
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,480
Seems like he's a loyal man.

467
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,720
You may rest in peace.

468
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,560
Thank you...

469
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Wen. Wen Ke Xing.

470
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,200
You're Zhou Xu. Which character is Xu?

471
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,400
The one inside Liu Xu*.
(* Lit.: Catkins)

472
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,120
What a good name.

473
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,400
A courteous man, flies like catkins.

474
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,458
[Here rests Uncle Li]

475
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,720
What's wrong?

476
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,120
Uncle Zhou, I'm fine.

477
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,880
I just felt dizzy suddenly.

478
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,560
Excuse me, Master.

479
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,640
Stop trying to be tough.

480
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,720
You're exhausted.

481
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
You need to rest.

482
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,880
No, Uncle Zhou. I can travel.

483
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,880
It's alright to rest for one night.

484
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,000
Xiang!

485
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,160
Set up the fire and make some food.

486
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,760
That's needless to say.

487
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,640
They're all done. Come in!

488
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,960
Brother Zhou. Master Zhang.

489
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,040
Please.

490
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,760
Master!

491
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,400
Master!

492
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,760
Brother.

493
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
Master, you shall eat first.

494
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,840
I will serve him, alright?

495
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,000
Beggar.

496
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,720
Although you're good at martial arts,

497
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,000
you're timid.

498
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,400
What's wrong?

499
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,600
Are you afraid that I'll poison you?

500
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,600
Return it to me if you're not eating.
I'm still hungry...

501
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,120
Brother, if you don't trust her,
you can have this.

502
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
I'm not hungry.

503
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,800
This...

504
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,200
You're being so alert to us.

505
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,680
But you were bluffed by that guy

506
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,920
just for three mace of silver.

507
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,120
You promised to take care of him

508
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,520
without knowing who he is.

509
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,200
Girl, what do you know?

510
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,200
An ordinary traveler obeyed his principle and
kept his promise.

511
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,480
He traveled a long journey
without a fear of death.

512
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,400
Zhou, your action

513
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
shows that you're a gentleman.

514
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,960
What do you mean?

515
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,440
Master, stop acting literate.

516
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,960
I have a headache whenever you act literate.

517
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,960
This is written in a historical record

518
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,160
by Sima Qian.

519
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,200
It means,

520
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,000
"Even if he's an ordinary man,

521
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,440
once he made a promise,
he would fulfill it.

522
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,160
Because of that, he would travel a long way
without worrying about his life.

523
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,440
That is called a ranger."

524
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
My father taught me this.

525
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,400
Uncle Zhou, I...

526
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,200
Thank you.

527
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,480
You don't have to thank me.

528
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,440
What's wrong?

529
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,280
You don't like that bread?

530
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,160
Here's a bun. Catch it!

531
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm not eating your food.

532
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,640
Enough, Young Master.

533
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,280
I saved your life.

534
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,080
Why don't you die and

535
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,320
return me your life?

536
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,000
Girl, stop it.

537
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,160
Your words are hurtful.
Beware that you can't get married.

538
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,480
Indeed, people nowadays can't distinguish
between good and evil.

539
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,960
I saved his life just now.

540
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,120
I only scolded him slightly,

541
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,480
but he dislikes me.

542
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,000
Why didn't you fight your enemies instead?

543
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,080
Coward!

544
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,680
Miss Gu, you're right.

545
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

546
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,560
Thank you for saving my life, Miss.

547
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,640
I didn't ask you to kneel.

548
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,480
Enough, stand up.

549
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,040
Brother Zhou.

550
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,520
Did you disguise yourself?

551
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,240
Young Master Zhang.

552
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,280
My name is Zhang Cheng Ling.

553
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,880
Chevalier, you may call me Cheng Ling.

554
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,400
Don't you call me Chevalier.

555
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,000
I hate chevaliers.

556
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,880
Master.

557
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,240
Previously, this guy kept talking about
being righteous

558
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,440
and helping others,

559
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,360
as if he was telling stories.

560
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,320
I thought that he's capable to do them.

561
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,200
It turns out that he was just bluffing.

562
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,920
When there's a fight,

563
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,840
he would only run away

564
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,880
and cry.

565
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,480
I think that you can only act out

566
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,160
the manner of a righteous man in the theater.

567
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,280
You...

568
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,520
Me? What's wrong?

569
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,000
A man should never quarrel with others.

570
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,280
You're a man
who can't even hold a sword properly.

571
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,240
Xiang.

572
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,040
I haven't thanked you, kind lady.

573
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,200
You've helped us at the crucial moment.

574
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,160
Stop calling me a kind lady.

575
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
You're giving me goosebumps.

576
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,240
My name is Gu Xiang.

577
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,240
We are indeed fated.

578
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,520
We met at the right time.

579
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,920
We met at the wrong time too.

580
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,640
Your fate is granted by God.

581
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,240
Aren't you and Little Young Master Zhang

582
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,400
fated too?

583
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,120
Young Master Zhang, you're injured?

584
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,440
I... I'm fine.

585
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,240
Thanks for your concern, Master Wen.

586
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,640
You shall be treated early if you're injured.

587
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,640
I've learned some medical skills
from my family.

588
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,520
If you don't mind, I can...

589
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,840
It's alright, I'm fine.

590
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,000
He said that he's fine.

591
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,960
Stop hiding his injury and
refusing my treatment, Brother Zhou.

592
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,520
I won't be the one to blame

593
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,400
if he dies from the worsened injury,

594
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,960
but your ancestors in the netherworld would...

595
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,520
Master Wen, if you have a bad intention,

596
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,440
why don't you make it clear?

597
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,080
You don't have to act.

598
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,520
If you're not our enemy, stop forcing him.

599
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,200
Alright.
