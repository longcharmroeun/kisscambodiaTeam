00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,480
Let me check your injuries.

24
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,670
What do you want?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You brat, where did you come from?

26
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,240
None of your business.

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,720
I just don't like you.

28
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,670
Alright, stop fighting.

29
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,000
Darn it.

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,360
I experienced what women feel
getting harassed

Senior Ye.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,880
We just met, and don't know anything
about each other.

34
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't trouble you to treat my injuries.

35
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,910
Are you stupid?

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,390
Why are you being polite
with this boy toy?

What did you call me?

Boy Toy?

Am I wrong?

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,470

What does he mean?

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,190
Ah Xu, is he being serious?

46
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,800
Serious or not,

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,830
you'll know if you take off his clothes.

48
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,720
Shut up!

Your meridians are about to die,

56

when its roots dry out.

came back to life,

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
he still wouldn't be able to save
you dying brat.

59
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,440

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,320

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,230
you've used up all your strength.

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,230
I can definitely kill you
within ten moves.

72
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,230
You dirty-mouthed boy toy,

73
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,790
you've already passed your peak.

74
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,920
I can definitely kill you
within the next ten years!

75
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,320
Your mouth is more powerful
than your fist.

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,950
Likewise.

77
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,110
Let go of each other.

78
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,440
Senior Ye, you are a skilled master.

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
You don't need to be ruthless
with a junior.

80
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,640
One of you doesn't respect seniors
and the other doesn't love juniors.

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,830
What is the point of this fight?

82
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,550
Life and death are up to fate. I...

83
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,480
What a coincidence.

84
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,600
I love fighting against fate.

85
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,790
Take off your clothes and let me see.

Let me see what hurt you.

87
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
What do you mean?

88
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,070
You can really heal him?

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,350
Who are you?

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
If I guessed correctly,

91
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,950
you must be
the Mount Changming Sword Immortal.

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,440
My master always thanked you
for gifting him his sword.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't think you know everything, brat.

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,070
Old ghost, I'm asking you a question!

95
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,350
Can you really treat his wounds?

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you have the right
to ask me questions?

97
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,390
I'm telling you,
I don't have much patience.

98
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,440
I'm going to ask you one last time.

99
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,830
Do you want to treat your wounds or not?

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,720
Ah Xu, let me see.

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,950
Let go!

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,390
Are you done yet?

103
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
There are two men pulling at my clothes

104
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,040
in the middle of the night.

105
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,230
What kind of a scene is this?

106
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,390
You both want to see?

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
Nails?

108
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
I see.

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,790
No wonder your pulse is faint,

110
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,640
but you can still stay active.

111
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
These nails are keeping
your meridians in place,

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,440
so that they don't break
from internal force.

113
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,070
Whose idea was this?

114
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,720
It's both clever and cruel.

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,070
Mine.

116
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,760
Yours?

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,670
You're really trying to kill yourself.

118
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Fix your clothes and come with me.

119
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,830
I asked Qin Huai Zhang's disciple
to come over.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,880
Why are you here?

121
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,230
Senior, what do you think?

122
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,320
Give me your hand.

123
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,110
How is it? Can you treat it?

124
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,160
Of course I can.

125
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,760
Even if someone just died,

126
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,200
as long as his body is still warm,

127
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,830
I can still bring him back to life
for a short while.

128
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
Then what are you waiting for?

129
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,390
What's your request of treating him?

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,670
Just tell us.

131
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,550
If my first request

132
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,760
was for you to kneel on the street

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,070
for three days and three nights,

134
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,830
and yell "I'm a blind idiot",

135
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,830
would you do it?

136
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,670
Senior.

137
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,720
You have sharp instincts

138
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,040
and could immediately tell

139
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,550
that I'm indeed a blind idiot.

140
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,440
As long as you can treat him,

141
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm willing to kneel for three months,

142
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
much less three days.

143
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,040
Fine.

144
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,270
Humiliating a thick-skinned person like you

145
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,640
is not fun anyway.

146
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,230
Qin Huai Zhang's disciple.

147
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,670
I can give you another ten years to live.

148
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,150
The rest is up to you.

149
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,960
Ten years?

150
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,080
That's enough.

151
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,030
More than enough.

152
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,320
Alright.

153
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,790
First,

154
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,550
I will abolish
all of your martial arts

155
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,470
and dissipate your internal force.

156
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
No objections, right?

157
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,470
What?

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,640
It's all your fault.

159
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,110
You should only have about a third
of your power right now.

160
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,320
It's only hard to bear at night

161
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,760
when your internal force
is circulating about.

162
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,230
Once I remove the nails,

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,670
your internal force

164
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,400
will completely crush

165
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,000
all of your meridians.

166
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,110
If I don't abolish your martial arts,

167
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,760
you won't even pass the first step.

168
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,230
Is there another way

169
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,960
without losing his martial arts?

170
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, of course!

171
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,960
If Chief of the Healer Valley

172
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,350
hasn't been reborn,

173
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,150
you can go and try to find his soul.

174
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
But I think

175
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,440
that he won't have
any medical skills left

176
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,640
in this life.

177
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Life and death are up to fate.

178
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,150
Thank you for worrying about me, Senior.

179
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,320
I won't trouble you anymore.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,960
Qin Huai Zhang's disciple.

181
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,960
You brat.

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,470
Why do you keep following him?

183
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,590
What's your relationship?

184
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,960

is truly lying to the world

367
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,070
and plotting such terrible acts,

368
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,110
then we must do

369
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,000
whatever it takes to defeat them.

370
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,190
Don't be scared.
The sky has cleared after the storm,

371
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,590
and it is time to bring justice to light.

372
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,880
Say what you need to say
and do what you need to do.

373
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,680
Don't worry.

374
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,520
The Beggar Gangs' thousands of disciples
and the spirit of the martial arts world

375
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,950
are with you.

376
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,400
Thank you, Elder.

377
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,280
I will leave now.

378
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,400
Goodbye.

379
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,830
Please.

380
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,280
Huang He.

381
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,160
What are you planning now?

382
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,000
Since you found out such a big secret

383
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,430
of Gao Chong and Shen Shen,

384
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,560
why not make a move now?

385
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Why are you in a rush?

386
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,590
We waited all these years already.

387
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,230
What's a little bit longer?

388
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,190
Torturing a person

389
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,230
is like roasting a chicken.

390
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,430
You can't rush.

391
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,920
It tastes best when it's been roasted
for long enough.

392
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,280
I will take care of the next steps in public,

393
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,760
but there's one more thing

394
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,000
I need you two to cooperate with me on.

395
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,760
Master Zhao.

396
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,190
Open the door.

397
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,920
Master, please.

398
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,880
[Prison]

399
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,920
Master Zhao, this woman's tongue
is really tight.

400
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
She won't say anything.

401
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,830
Master said

402
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
that she is a woman after all,

403
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,800
and wouldn't let us torture her.

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,590
Who cares if an evil ghost is male or female?

405
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Master, do what you need to do

406
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,160
and I won't tell anyone.

407
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
She has to at least tell us

408
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,830
how Eldest Senior was hurt,

409
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,520
and why he's still not awake.

410
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
You can go now.

411
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

412
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,230
Let's go.

413
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,680
You bastard.

414
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,040
Whatever cruel methods you have,

415
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,520
use them all!

416
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,560
I'm not scared of anything.

417
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,040
You really don't recognize me?

418
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,190
I do.

419
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,950
You are that fake righteous dog!

420
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What do you want?

421
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,470
Come at me with all you have!

422
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,560
I've always heard that before a person
enters the Ghost Valley,

423
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,430
he must drink the Water of Lethe
to forget their cares

424
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,350
and let go of their obsessions.

425
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,040
I used to think this was a rumor,

426
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,430
but who knew

427
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,190
that it's real?

428
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,310
I am the person you cared the most about.

429
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,520
But Fu Meng,

430
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,950
why is it me?

431
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,470
How do you know my name?

432
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,950
Fu Meng. I betrayed you,

433
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,920
and turned you from a noble girl

434
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,070
into a ghost.

435
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,950
Kill all the unfaithful people
in the world...

436
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Don't touch me!

437
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Don't touch me.

438
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Forget it.

439
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,310
Forget it all.

440
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Fu Meng, Fu Meng.

441
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,520
Life is just like a dream*.
(*Lit.: what "Fu Meng" means in Chinese)

442
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,950
Fu Meng. I owe you in this life.

443
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
If there is another life...

444
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,310
Let's not meet again.

445
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,520
Chief. I have finished the preparations.

446
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,280
Is there anything else you need?

447
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,000
Department of the Unfaithful's side manor
was attacked by the Five Lakes Alliance yesterday.

448
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,230
Tragicomic Ghost was captured.

449
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,310
Captured?

450
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,880
What...

451
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,950
What should we do?

452
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,160
Chief.

453
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,280
You must rescue her quickly.

454
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,880
With her personality,

455
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,520
if she is captured
by the Five Lakes Alliance...

456
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,470
Stop talking nonsense.

457
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,110
It's not the right time to fight yet.

458
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,400
I want you to transform into Yu Qiu Feng

459
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,310
and poke around.

460
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
If I guessed correctly,

461
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,880
Gao Chong won't kill her just yet.

462
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,680
He will execute her in public

463
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,070
during the Heroes Conference.

464
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes.

465
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,950
I apologize for being rude.

466
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,920
Chief. Do you want me
to break into the prison she's in?

467
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,000
Break into the prison?

468
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
Is that your job?

469
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,070
With your martial arts,

470
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,520
can you get out of the Yueyang Sect
in one piece?

471
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,680
I want you to confirm
that Tragicomic Ghost is still alive.

472
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,560
Don't alert the enemy.

473
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,430
But Chief, we need to rescue her quickly.

474
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,430
The closer we get
to the Heroes Conference,

475
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,880
the more masters...

476
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,160
Do I need you to teach me?

477
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,310
Don't worry. I have a plan.

478
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,560
During the Heroes Conference,

479
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,950
Iron Judge Gao Chong
will have his hands full.

480
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,590
Yes.

481
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,680
Of course you wouldn't leave
my master to die.

482
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,190
No one can anticipate
or predict your plans.

483
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,680
Leave.

484
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,160
Yes.

485
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,000
Those who understand me
know my worries.

486
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,760
Those who don't
think I have other intentions.

487
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,310
Eldest Senior. Eldest Senior!

488
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,340
[Worship of Martial Spirit]

489
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,590
Monkey, be quiet.

490
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,350
We're not in the mountains anymore.

491
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,000
Brother Zhu will laugh at us.

492
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,710
How would I dare laugh
at our Casanova Cao?

493
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm just jealous.

494
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,230
Brother Wei Xu, I'm telling you...

495
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,350
Geek, don't make up rumors.

496
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,000
Wei Ning. Don't be rude.

497
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,880
Don't worry.

498
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,710
The two of us

499
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,110
have gotten along really well lately.

500
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,160
But Young Master Cao,

501
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,680
it's too late.

502
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,230
Your senior already knows
all about your amazing past.

503
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,760
Alright, alright.

504
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,830
I'll stop.

505
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,280
I need to prepare

506
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,230
for the Heroes Conference.

507
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,110
You've traveled far.

508
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,920
Get some rest, and then please come as well.

509
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,400
Young Master Cao.

510
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,680
We will continue the "Casanova Adventures"
next time.

511
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,470
Wei Ning.

512
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,070
Eldest Senior,
don't listen to his nonsense.

513
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,950
I...

514
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
I just met a girl that I like.

515
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,560
Let's not talk about this.

516
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,160
Wei Ning.

517
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,190
My father left to go back
to Mount Qingfeng last night.

518
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,160
Master will represent
the Gentle Wind Sword Sect

519
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,190
at the Conference instead.

520
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,760
What? Why?

521
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,880
Oh, right!

522
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,560
I almost forgot something.

523
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,280
I heard the juniors say earlier

524
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,560
that Miss Xiang is sick
and in hospital.

525
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,520
What?

526
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,950
Alright, don't worry.

527
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Xiao Lian is with her.

528
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,880
That's all.

529
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,070
Goodbye.

530
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,310
Xiang is sick?

531
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,640
Look at you.

532
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,350
Losing your mind over one sentence.

533
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,430
The martial arts world is in chaos.

534
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,880
You're a man,

535
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,400
but not directing your energy
towards the right place.

536
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,560
You have no ambition.

537
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,950
Everyone has their own ambitions.

538
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,310
If I can't marry the girl that I love,

539
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll just follow... follow Master

to be single for my entire life.

Even if I master martial arts

542
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,560
and become the best in the world, I...

543
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,680
You dare comment talk about Master?

544
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,160
No respect for your elders.

545
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,880
You're really stepping out of line
more and more.

546
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,400
Alright, go.

547
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,430
Really?

548
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,160

I'll be straightforward.

by the Five Lakes Alliance

633

and is locked in the Yueyang Sect's prison.

yet difficult for women to live on..

and brought me into the Ghost Valley?

697
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,190
Why would I chase you?

698

kill one of his own?

might be wrong.
