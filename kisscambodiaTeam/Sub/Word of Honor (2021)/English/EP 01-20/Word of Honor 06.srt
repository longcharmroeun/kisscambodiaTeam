What are you looking at?

226
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040

Xiang is not here.

231
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,760
And we've got nothing to heat the wine.

232
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I heated it up with my internal strength.

233
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,120
Put up with it.

234
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,240
It's better than drinking it cold.

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,400
Lao Wen.

236
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,120
Is your surname really Wen?

237
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
I really didn't lie to you.

238
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,040
A gentleman. As warm* and gentle as jade.
(*Wen means warm)

239
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,040
Don't you think that this name suits me well?

240
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,960
This must be the Soul Winding Box.

241
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,960
Back then, Hanging Ghost

242
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,000
swaggered in the martial arts world

243
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,160
with this mysterious Soul Winding Box.

244
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,200
I didn't expect that he would
really become a ghost by now.

245
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,960
Then we got this precious item.

246
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
He wasn't Hanging Ghost.

247
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,480
Ah Xu, you know a lot about the Ghost Valley.

248
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,720
Not really.

249
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
But, that guy was too young.

250
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,960
When Hanging Ghost became famous,

251
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,160
he might be just a kid.

252
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,070
Where is the real Hanging Ghost?

253
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's not talk about if he's the real one now.

254
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,350
But, this treasure is real.

255
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,000
If Hanging Ghost were still alive,

256
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,640
why would his treasure go to someone else?

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,920
Be careful.

258
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,800
This thing needs to be opened in a special way.

259
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,560
Or else, it might destroy itself and hurt you.

260
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,640
Since you were awake,

261
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
why did you kill the fake Hanging Ghost?

262
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,280
We need him

263
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
to answer our questions.

264
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
I made mistakes because I was worried about you.

265
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,640
Don't you know?

266
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm hungry.

267
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,600
Lao Wen, get some food for me.

268
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Why aren't you getting it by yourself?

269
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
Alright, I'll go.

270
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Take a rest here.

271
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Zhou Zi Shu.

272
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
He's indeed...

273
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,400
Zhou Zi Shu.

274
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,639
[Scorpion King - Leader of Scorpion]

275
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,680
It's really wonderful.

276
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,680
I thought

277
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,880
Qin Song's magic sound was the best in the world.

278
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,640
But, I didn't expect

279
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,720
the real expert to be here.

280
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
How lucky was Long-tongued Ghost?

281
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,360
He got to learn how to use the magic sound

282
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,520
to control the Drug Men from you.

283
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,040
I really envy him.

284
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,080
It's just right.

285
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,440
He's dead.

286
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,600
He's dead?

287
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,240
Is he really dead?

288
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,720
No. Who did it?

289
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
Where's the Soul Winding Box?

290
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,280
How dare you ask me?

291
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,720
I wanted to ask you.

292
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,520
Where's the Glazed Armor?

293
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,640
No. I've got the Glazed Armor.

294
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,600
Well, didn't I go to Sanbai Manor

295
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,760
to get rid of Ao Lai Zi's body?

296
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
I wanted to make no mistake.

297
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,480
So, I asked Long-tongued Ghost

298
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,680
to bring the Glazed Armor here.

299
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,240
There are so many Drug Men here.

300
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
This place is also filled with the scent

301
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,880
and Soul Winding Spell.

302
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,880
There should be no problem.

303
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,000
Scorpion King. Shouldn't you

304
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,920
come and get the Glazed Armor earlier?

305
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,480
Shouldn't you...

306
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,440
Changing Ghost.

307
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,200
Are you blaming me for my late arrival?

308
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,880
I don't dare to.

309
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,200
Forget it.

310
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,960
I didn't expect

311
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
someone could break through
these obstacles

312
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
and come in.

313
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,040
This is...

314
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,360
getting interesting.

315
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,360
The Glazed Armor?

316
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,880
Why is it hidden in the Soul Winding Box?

317
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,720
Who knows?

318
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,200
You may take it.

319
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,200
This thing

320
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,280
is related to the secret of opening
the World's Armory.

321
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
So many people have been fighting

322
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,680
for this.

323
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,480
You just exchange it

324
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,920
for two rabbits from me?

325
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
At least I can fill my stomach
with the rabbits.

326
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,640
They are better than this thing.

327
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,320
Ah Xu.

328
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,920
Are you really not interested in it?

329
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,880
Nonsense.

330
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,840
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered and
the Glaze is shattered."

331
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,040
This sounds so unlucky.

332
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,360
Why would I keep such an unlucky thing?

333
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,760
Ah Xu.

334
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
I thought you just seemed to be cold
while having a warm heart.

335
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,040
I didn't expect you would have a sharp tongue.

336
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
There are many things
that you don't know about me.

337
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,320
I not only have a sharp tongue,

338
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
but I'm also ruthless.

339
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,720
You'd better be careful.

340
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,520
You're ruthless indeed.

341
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,160
You knew that this is unlucky,

342
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,200
but you still gave it to me.

343
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Aren't you afraid

344
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
that I will be in trouble?

345
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,560
You're already a trouble.

346
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,720
Why would you be afraid of this thing?

347
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,000
If you don't want it,

348
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,080
you may throw it away.

349
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,040
No way.

350
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,280
This is the first gift

351
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,800
from Ah Xu.

352
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,160
I would never throw it away.

353
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
I will get a string

354
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,880
and hang it on my body.

355
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,280
I will appreciate it every day.

356
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,480
But, Ah Xu.

357
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Do you think this Glazed Armor

358
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,000
belongs to Zhao Jing

359
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,560
or Zhang Cheng Ling?

360
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,560
If the Ghost Valley got Cheng Ling's
Glazed Armor,

361
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,680
why would they try to abduct Cheng Ling?

362
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,840
I suspected Ao Lai Zi

363
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and Shen Shen this morning.

364
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,200
Then, his body

365
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,040
appeared at the entrance
of Sanbai Manor at night.

366
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,640
Ah Xu.

367
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,720
Do you think there is something strange?

368
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,120
The Ghost Valley was instigating him.

369
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,200
Before Lu Tai Chong died,

370
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,120
he handed over everything to Ao Lai Zi,

371
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,600
but not his brothers.

372
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,680
This already embarrassed
the Five Lakes Alliance.

373
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,320
The Ghost Valley purposely dirtied
the Five Lakes Alliance

374
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,600
with the blood of Mount Tai Sect

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,680
to provoke rumors.

376
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Let's stop talking about this.

377
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,520
If you're bored,

378
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,520
help me out with cleaning these rabbits.

379
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,160
I hunted these rabbits.

380
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,760
I still have to clean them?

381
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Whatever.

382
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,200
You can't eat them if you're not cleaning them.

383
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Ah Xu, I'll clean them.

384
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,360
Cheng Ling, how was your sleep yesterday?

385
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,920
Are you not having a good appetite?

386
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,520
You've suffered on the way.

387
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,200
Cheng Ling, your uncle is worried about you.

388
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,400
So, we can't rest.

389
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,000
We have to move on with our journey immediately.

390
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,200
But, we are here.

391
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,920
We will take care of you.

392
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,200
Thank you, Uncle.

393
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,520
Why are your eyes swollen?

394
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,600
Did you cry?

395
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,760
No.

396
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,760
Cheng Ling, the two chevaliers yesterday

397
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,440
left without a word this morning.

398
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
I'm not sure if we didn't serve them well.

399
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,680
I didn't get to talk to them.

400
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,880
Are they friends of your father?

401
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,280
I don't know.

402
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,480
Why did you follow them
without knowing their identity?

403
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,280
Yesterday, you were exhausted from your journey

404
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,520
and there were many people.

405
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,360
It's good that they've left today.

406
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,560
Tell us.

407
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,360
What happened

408
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,720
in Mirror Lake Manor that night?

409
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
I don't remember.

410
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,160
That's absurd.

411
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,040
We are your father's brothers.

412
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,480
Why can't you tell us?

413
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,760
I was frightened that day.

414
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,520
Later, I had a fever for a few days.

415
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,480
When I woke up,
I was beside Uncle Zhou and Uncle Wen.

416
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,800
I don't remember

417
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,920
what happened next.

418
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Fifth Brother, enough.

419
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,680
Then, how did your parents die?

420
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,320
Don't you remember the 300 lives

421
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
in Mirror Lake Manor?

422
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
Fifth Brother.

423
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,840
You can't remember anything.

424
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
Then, do you mean

425
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,560
that we can forget our duty

426
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,240
to take revenge?

427
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
Don't talk to a child like this.

428
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
Cheng Ling, it's alright.

429
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,960
Fifth Uncle is just anxious.

430
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,560
We will definitely take revenge.

431
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,680
Fifth Uncle and I are

432
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
your father's sworn brothers.

433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,680
Though there were some misunderstandings,

434
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,160
nothing can break our relationship.

435
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,960
Your father's problems

436
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
are our problems.

437
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,400
From now on, you're my son.

438
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,800
Second Brother, it's urgent now.

439
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
Three out of the five parts
of the Glazed Armor are gone.

440
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,440
Yours and Third Brother Lu's Glazed Armor

441
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,400
must be taken by the Ghost Valley.

442
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,880
How can we relax

443
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,760
without making things clear?

444
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,200
This child is obviously...

445
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,400
He's a child. What does he know?

446
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,480
Once we arrived at Yueyang,

447
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
we shall let Big Brother decide.

448
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,640
Cheng Ling, I'm here.

449
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,400
Don't be afraid.

450
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
We are late.

451
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,160
-Brother Zhao.
-Chevalier Shen.

452
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,640
Chevalier Shen.

454
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,120
Brother Zhao.

455
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,200
I heard

456
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,520
you would depart to Yueyang today.

457
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,400
Yes.

458
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,280
There is still some time before
the Heroes Conference.

459
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,160
But, I would like to go back earlier

460
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,480
to see if I can help.

461
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,760
My big brother has been missing Cheng Ling too.

462
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,680
Do you have any plans hereafter?

463
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,120
If you don't, why don't you go with us?

464
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,920
We can take care of each other on our way.

465
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,920
[Mu Si Yuan - Lord of Broken Sword Manor]
It's fine.

466
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,320
Brother Yu, where is Tian Jie?

467
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,760
My pupil, He Rui Cai, has been missing for a few days.

468
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,640
So, Tian Jie went to search for him.

469
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,800
But, a lot of things have happened lately.

470
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,120
You should restrain your pupils.

471
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,560
Don't let them go out frequently.

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,920
Second Brother.

473
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,760
Stop boosting others' morale

474
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,120
while undermining our courage.

475
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
Those evil ghosts

476
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,760
only hide in the dark

477
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,640
and harm people with their base tricks.

478
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,320
I would suppress

479
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,600
whoever dares to come out and cause trouble!

480
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,160
Fifth Brother, never let your guard down.

481
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,160
Think about it.

482
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,400
The world has been in peace for a long time.

483
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,600
When did people get so anxious as they do now?

484
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,040
So, I still hope that Big Brother

485
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,600
can lead all the heroes

486
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,160
to suppress the Ghost Valley

487
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,440
and make the world peaceful again.

488
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,480
Yes.

489
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,520
Yes.

490
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:50,972
[Zhao Coffin Home]

491
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,880
This is strange.

492
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,120
Was what happened yesterday just a dream?

493
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,240
It has only been some couples of hours.

494
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,240
They've got rid of the traces from yesterday.

495
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,440
This can't be done by normal people.

496
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,400
Ah Xu.

497
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,120
What was the strange scent yesterday?

498
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,360
It's alright if you don't want to tell.

499
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
I'm not forcing you.

500
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,960
Stop running away!

501
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,080
Ah Xu, walk slower.

502
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,000
Wait for me.

503
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,200
This is the place. Am I right?

504
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,920
Yes, the cured meat was hung here last night.

505
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,160
At least tell me the name of that scent.

506
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,600
The scent is called Drunk Like a Dream.

507
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,320
Then, why did you have the antidote?

508
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,200
Why did Drunk Like a Dream appear in Hu?

509
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,680
Is the Window of Heaven working
with the Ghost Valley?

510
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,760
Ah Xu, why are you ignoring me?

511
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,840
Since you have its antidote,

512
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,560
you should know its origin too.

513
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,440
Can you get me two boxes of it?

514
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,800
No way.

515
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,640
Don't refuse me right away.

516
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
I'll pay a good price.

517
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,240
You can get whatever you want.

518
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,840
In the illusion caused by the scent,

519
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,160
people will see what they desire most.

520
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Brother Wen.

521
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,920
You kept calling a person's name at that time.

522
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,280
What did you see?

523
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,280
Ah Xu.

524
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,800
I thought you were a decent man.

525
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,240
It's too obtrusive

526
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,840
for you to ask me about

527
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,680
such a private matter.

528
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,160
[This man is mysterious.]

529
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
[He knows about
Four Seasons Manor very well.]

530
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,760
[What relationship does he have with my sect?]

531
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,920
Alright.

532
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,960
I'll tell you.

533
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,240
In the illusion, I saw...

534
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,960
When I was young, I threw

535
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,400
a dead rat into my mother's bed.

536
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
She found it out

537
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
and chased me across three streets.

538
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,040
Ah Xu, I won't joke with you.

539
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,200
I joked around

540
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
because I didn't want to lie to you.

541
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
The main ingredient

542
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,160
of Drunk Like a Dream is a mysterious herb
called Nepenthes.

543
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,360
Once a man takes in a little of it,

544
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,480
he would sleep for six to seven days

545
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
and have a good dream.

546
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,440
The fuel used in the coffin home

547
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,920
was similar to this.

548
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,960
But, it's much stronger than the one I've developed.

549
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,160
So, people would see illusions.

550
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,720
You made this scent?

551
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,280
Drunk Like a Dream came from an ancient recipe.

552
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,000
I only turned it into an incense

553
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,640
and lessened its effect to improve one's sleep.

554
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,040
Since ancient times, there haven't been
Nepenthes in the Central Plain.

555
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,120
I don't know where he got them.

556
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,720
Drunk Like a Dream.

557
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,280
What a good name.

558
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The world is dangerous and men can be evil.

559
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,840
What is there

560
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,280
that makes you stay awake?

561
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,480
What's wrong with staying in a dream?

562
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
You shall keep dreaming then.

563
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,640
Ah Xu!

564
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:58,639
[Sanbai Manor]

565
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,480
Guard Geng, why are you here?

566
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,600
Let's get to the point.

567
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Call your master out.

568
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,120
An official from the Northwest is
in the carriage.

569
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,120
If we don't serve him well,

570
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,960
we will be in big trouble.

571
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,280
Unfortunately,

572
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,840
my master has gone to a distant place.

573
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,800
Master, I'm sorry.

574
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,670
My master and Chevalier Shen have

575
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,920
departed to Yueyang.

576
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,280
Five Lakes Alliance is holding

577
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,150
the Heroes Conference in Mount Jun in mid-July

578
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,630
to discuss the war against the Ghost Valley.

579
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,190
Did the orphan of the Zhang family
follow them too?

580
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,480
Master, Young Master Zhang...

581
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,280
[Han Ying has come to Jiangnan too.]

582
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,040
[Seems like the Window of Heaven]

583
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,400
[is really involved in the matter
about the Glazed Armor.]

584
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,480
Heroes Conference?

585
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,040
It sounds interesting.

586
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,320
Ah Xu, why are you hiding?

587
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,280
Why? Are you afraid to see the guard?

588
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Or...

589
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,040
Are you a fugitive?

590
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,360
Yes, I murdered people and set them on fire.
I've committed many crimes.

591
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,120
Philanthropist Wen, stay away from me.

592
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,040
Then, do you pluck flowers?

593
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,760
Alright.

594
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
I'll stop joking.

595
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,120
How is it?

596
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,760
The Heroes Conference.
It'll be an interesting drama.

597
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,560
Are you going?

598
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,280
Are you following me there to kill people

599
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,760
or set the fire?

600
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,800
Of course we are going there
to enjoy the drama.

601
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
What in the world is more interesting

602
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
than drama?

603
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,800
Moreover,

604
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,640
it's a drama about a dogfight.

605
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,840
We have to go even if it's far away.

606
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,040
The Heroes Conference
with a group of barking dogs.

607
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,360
The Five Lakes Alliance

608
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,720
is eager to take control of Zhang Cheng Ling.

609
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,680
A lonely chick that has nothing to rely on.

610
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,920
He's surrounded by hounds
that are smarter than foxes.

611
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,160
What a pity.

612
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,320
No one would think that you're a mute
even if you keep quiet.

613
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
I'll go and look for Xiang

614
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,600
to settle something.

615
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,240
I'll be there right away, Ah Xu.

616
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,760
Brother Zhao, you really know how to enjoy.

617
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,320
I've enjoyed myself on the way

618
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,840
with you, Brother Zhao.

619
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,040
My second brother

620
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,680
is the son-in-law of West Zhejiang's Observer.

621
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,840
He's a nobleman.

622
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
He's worried that we would laugh at him

623
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,720
as he's traveling with a bunch of rough men.

624
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,480
He's so quiet now.

625
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
You always tease me.

626
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,320
It's all because of Cheng Ling.

627
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,000
[He often stops on his way.]

628
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,360
[When can he bring Cheng Ling to Yueyang?]

629
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,160
Master.

630
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,200
Come. What are you looking for?

631
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,360
A hairpin or a ring? Pearl, jade, gold or silver?

632
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,120
We've got everything.

633
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Can you make glass?

634
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,280
You're at the right place.

635
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
In this region,

636
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,480
no other shop is better than us

637
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,240
in making glass.

638
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,160
Make 30 copies of this.

639
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm in a hurry.

640
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
Can I get them tomorrow?

641
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,120
Master, you sound like an outsider.

642
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,480
A customized glazed ware

643
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,520
takes at least ten days to half a month to make.

644
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,640
Your treasure was made by some expert.

645
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,880
It's crystal clear.

646
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,600
I think my furnace can only...

647
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
Alright.

648
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,200
Master, three days.

649
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,040
Give me three days.

650
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,920
I'll get them ready.

651
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,840
Three days later, I'll come

652
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
to get my goods,

653
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,520
or burn your shop.

654
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,680
Alright. Don't worry.

655
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,040
I'll get them ready in time.

656
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,560
I won again.

657
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
I lost again.

658
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,120
I gave up.

659
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,760
I'll lose my dress if I continue playing.

660
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,840
Sister Xiang, you give up once you lose.

661
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
That's not good.

662
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,840
Hong Lu, am I right?

663
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,920
You're right, Sister.

664
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,000
Sister Xiang, you can't do this.

665
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
Let me tell you.

666
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,720
It's just that I don't know
how to play this game.

667
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
If we play Pai Gow,

668
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,120
I'll make you pay

669
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,280
with your dress and underwear.

670
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,960
But, we still need one more player.

671
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,160
Sister Xiang, when will Master be back?

672
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,240
Are you already missing Master?

673
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,560
Don't laugh at me.

674
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,200
I just think

675
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,760
you've saved our lives,

676
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,040
so we should try our best

677
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,800
to serve you and Master.

678
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,760
But, we've been only playing around these days.

679
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,320
I feel guilty.

680
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,400
Stop it.

681
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,160
You're just trying to say
that you're missing Master.

682
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
It's useless.

683
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,360
Why is it useless?

684
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,520
Master?

685
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,960
-Master
-Master.

686
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,320
Master, we need one more player. It's you.

687
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Ungrateful.

688
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,000
Girl, why did you miss me?

689
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,520
You see?

690
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
They are loyal servants.

691
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,960
Unlike you.

692
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,480
You've been like a reinless horse
once you left the valley.

693
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,400
You only think about playing.

694
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,720
It's uneasy to have you as my servants.

695
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Xiang.

696
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,080
Give them a hundred taels of silver later.

697
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,480
You may return to your home.

698
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,840
Using them wisely,

699
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,360
you should be at ease

700
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
for the rest of your lives.

701
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,720
Master.

702
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,480
Please do not dislike us.

703
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,120
We survived

704
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,560
due to Sister Xiang's and your help.

705
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,040
We are willing to follow you
for the rest of our lives.

706
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,200
We will continue to repay you in our next lives.

707
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,680
Follow us for the rest of your lives?

708
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,360
It's easy to say it.

709
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,840
Gu Xiang.

710
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,360
What did I tell you previously?

711
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,640
Master.

712
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,400
I've prepared this especially for you.

713
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,280
Wolong's famous nuts.

714
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,720
They are big, crispy and delicious.

715
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,720
I queued for them. Have a taste.

716
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
Did you get paid?

717
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,600
You're praising them so obviously.

718
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,840
No.

719
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,760
I just wanted to offer my master
the best thing.

720
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,120
How is it? Not bad, right?

721
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,760
You have good sense.

722
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,000
We will get our nuts
from this store next time.

723
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,040
Master, I didn't buy them.

724
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,440
Yun Zai and Hong Lu bought them.

725
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,920
They queued purposely for these.

726
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,960
My good master.

727
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,880
They are orphans.

728
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,520
They don't have anyone to rely on.

729
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
The world is in a mess.

730
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,640
I'm afraid

731
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,400
they can't survive even with the money.

732
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,800
Master, please let them stay.

733
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,600
Please, Master.

734
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,240
It's hard to survive outside.

735
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,800
Throughout our lives,

736
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,520
we were sold around like kittens or puppies.

737
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,960
Only Sister Xiang treats us as humans.

738
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,520
Master, please let us stay and serve you.

739
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,560
Yes, Master.

740
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,360
We are willing to do it.

741
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,960
Alright.

742
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,520
Thank you, Master.

743
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,080
Since you're willing to do it,

744
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,800
these two girls

745
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,280
are your servants from now on.

746
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,720
You decide it yourself,

747
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,640
so you are responsible for the outcome later.

748
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,880
I won't interfere.

749
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,400
Yes. Thank you, Master.

750
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,080
Since I take them in,

751
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,560
I'll protect them.

752
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,400
We'll see if you have the capability.

753
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,640
You two may leave first.

754
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,640
Yes.

755
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,840
Come here.

756
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
I need you to do two things.

757
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,760
You must complete the first task

758
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,680
as soon as possible.

759
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
We need to plan carefully

760
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,600
for the second task.

761
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:02,580
♪The sky was gray
as I crossed the cold river♪

762
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:10,530
♪The moon in my cup at night
reflects the sadness in my smile♪

763
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:17,860
♪Who allowed me to roam
around the world on horseback?♪

764
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,940
♪Who is drunk in their dreams
but can't find home when they wake?

765
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,500
♪The cold rain kisses my windows♪

766
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,490
♪I don't mind hate and slander,
but my melancholy persists♪

767
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,120
♪The spring breeze
brings greenery along the river♪

768
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,180
♪But can't warm my cold heart♪

769
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:57,140
♪Is that our light out of nowhere?♪

770
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,070
♪I regret not meeting you earlier,
but we've finally met now♪

771
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,370
♪Don't let the seasons pass in vain♪

772
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:12,000
♪Give up the adventures on horseback
for a peaceful quiet life♪

773
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,030
♪The lights of ten thousand families
light up the world♪

774
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,550
♪The past disappears like smoke
in a sandstorm♪

775
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,940
♪I will spend the rest of my days
enjoying my life with you♪

776
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:34,860
♪I will be with you forever♪
