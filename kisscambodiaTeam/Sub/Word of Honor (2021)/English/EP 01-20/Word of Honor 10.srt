00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
So what if we use force?

186
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,680
It's the martial arts world!

187
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,480
It's always been a place
where the strong prey on the weak!

188
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
Third Brother Lu died without children.

189
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,640
It should naturally be up to us

190
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,720
to take over his belongings and disciples.

191
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,440
What does it have to do
with an outsider like Ao Lai Zi?

192
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
He is incapable, yet insists on

193
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
getting involved
in our Five Lakes Alliance's matters!

194
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,360
Fifth Brother!

195
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,320
Are you saying

196
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,320
you can just go ahead
and raise hell at Mount Tai Sect?

197
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,320
Forcing people to come out and beg for help?

198
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
Causing Ao Lai Zi to die
in a place far away from home?

199
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,040
What will the righteous of the martial arts world

200
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,760
think of our Five Lakes Alliance?

201
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
I didn't kill him.

202
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
We'll just avenge him.

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,500
Humph!

204
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,840
[Unfettered]
Master, all the people of Renyi Hall

205
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,280
look down on our Mount Hua Sect.

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,760
I...

207
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,720
Such insolence!

208
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,480
What's the use of saying all this?

209
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,920
Tell the disciples

210
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
not to participate in this kind of matter
in the future!

211
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,640
And report it to me immediately!

212
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,480
You want to join

213
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
the gathering of the world's greatest alliance

214
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,280
and the world's greatest sect?

215
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,000
Are you trying to get killed?

216
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Why overestimate other sects

217
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,040
while underestimating our own?

218
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,680
Back then, our Five Mount and Sword Sects...

219
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,560
There is no Five Mount and Sword Sects left.

220
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
Ao Lai Zi is no longer alive.

221
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,640
The Mount Tai Sect is destroyed.

222
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,000
Even if I

223
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,000
have the ability to move heaven and earth,

224
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,960
how can I support
the Five Mount and Sword Sects on my own?

225
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,520
Please forgive me.

226
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,440
Enough.

227
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,760
Is there still no news from Tian Jie?

228
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,120
No.

229
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,320
Master.

230
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,080
Is there news about Tian Jie yet?

231
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,120
No.

232
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,440
Seniors from the Mount Tai Sect
are here looking for you.

233
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
They said...

234
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,160
What did they say?

235
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
They said there is more to

236
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,160
Master Ao Lai Zi's death.

237
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,120
They said the Five Lakes Alliance did it.

238
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
Master, what shall we do?

239
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,640
Tell them I'm not here.

240
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,920
How do I tell them that?

241
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,800
Say that I went out.

242
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,480
Say that I'm sick.

243
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,640
Say that I'm dead!

244
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,240
I don't care what you say.

245
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,320
I won't see them!

246
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,960
Yes, Master.

247
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,840
Go!

248
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
You leave too!

249
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,400
Yes.

250
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,680
Han Ying?

251
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,680
It's an eventful time for Yueyang City.

252
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,280
With yesterday's incident in Renyi Hall,

253
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,200
if it wasn't for the fact
that the Window of Heaven's spy

254
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,760
happened to be our confidant,

255
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
you'd have been exposed by now!

256
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
How is your injury?

257
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,240
I've experienced ups and downs in the court

258
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,400
wearing an obscure face.

259
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,920
Days have gone by since I've left.

260
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,640
If I still continue to live in fear,

261
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,840
what would be the point of leaving?

262
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,910
Leader, you created the Nails of Seven Torments.

263
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,480
Is there really no cure?

264
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,000
There are the Healer Valley,
the Witch Doctor Valley, and the Western Regions.

265
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,040
There will always be a way in this vast world.

266
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,879
How about I accompany you...

267
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,640
Enough.

268
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,720
I've done too many evil deeds.

269
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,519
God won't let me die this easily.

270
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,000
Han Ying.

271
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
When did you start to believe in Gods and Buddhas?

272
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,880
I had no request before,

273
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,760
thus I did not believe.

274
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,120
But now I do,

275
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
thus I have to believe.

276
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,640
You will not be blessed by Gods and Buddhas

277
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,560
on this journey I have taken you upon.

278
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,920
Leader, it is either

279
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,040
this way

280
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,600
or death for us.

281
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,840
Any day we live is a day we gained.

282
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,800
I was lucky to have you take care of me last night.

283
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,520
Han Ying, the more we are interconnected,

284
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,400
the more danger you'll find yourself in.

285
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,560
Lie low in the Window of Heaven.

286
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
Always remember to protect yourself.

287
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,560
I'm leaving.

288
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,720
Leader! If there is anything troubling you,

289
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,600
if there's something I can do for you,

290
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,960
I'll lay down my life with no regret!

291
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,640
But

292
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,800
I already had the two pieces of Glazed Armor
sent to Jin.

293
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,200
Why do you...

294
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,760
have another piece of it?

295
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,440
Two pieces?

296
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,440
Yes.

297
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,280
My subordinates found
two identical pieces on Fang Bu Zhi,

298
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,560
the Nine-Clawed Fox.

299
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,560
It's very strange.

300
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,640
It's not surprising.

301
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,360
There are even more.

302
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,240
There should be many imitations
floating around the martial arts world.

303
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,800
That's why these two pieces
look exactly the same

304
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,960
while the five pieces

305
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,080
of Glazed Armor in
the Prince's painting are so varied.

306
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,600
Turns out they are all imitations.

307
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,160
Why did Lao Wen do such a wicked thing

308
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
which didn't even benefit himself?

309
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Who made these imitations?

310
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
They must be evil at heart!

311
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,200
Han Ying.

312
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,200
The scramble for the Glazed Armor

313
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
will only get worse.

314
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,720
Just do what you're told,
do not investigate any further.

315
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
Never get involved.

316
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,880
Leader, if you need,

317
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm willing to do anything

318
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
to find the two lost pieces
of the Glazed Armor!

319
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,920
Don't do that!

320
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
You'd be violating the prince's orders.

321
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,280
When I first came to Window of Heaven,

322
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I swore

323
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,840
to stay loyal to you forever,

324
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
not to Prince Jin!

325
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm a dying man.

326
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,800
What would I want such ominous things for?

327
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
You only need to remember my words.

328
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,000
Living a good life

329
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,600
is the best way to show your loyalty to me.

330
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,280
The 81 people who founded
the Window of Heaven with me

331
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,320
have been annihilated.

332
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,440
I do not wish to hear the word "Leader” anymore.

333
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,880
But...

334
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Even if all your brothers are gone,
there's still...

335
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,320
Enough.

336
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,120
Perhaps my end is near.

337
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
These days, I often wonder

338
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
if there really are Gods and Buddhas,

339
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,920
Karma and retribution,

340
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,720
wouldn't I, with my blood-stained hands,

341
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,120
have to

342
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,240
suffer in the deepest pits of hell
for thousands of years?

343
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,920
Elder Huang, we got ourselves
into real trouble this time!

344
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,240
Which rascal did it?

345
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,200
He created a fake Glazed Armor

346
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,080
and played us like a fiddle!

347
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,320
Old Woman, stop repeating yourself.

348
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
We are all angry.

349
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,960
Gao Chong wants to marry off
his daughter to Zhang Cheng Ling.

350
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
Step down.

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
Once Gao Chong gets serious,

352
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,840
he can even treat his brothers,

353
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,960
his own children and disciples

354
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,680
like his pawns.

355
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
What do you mean?

356
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
He wants to marry off his own daughter

357
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,080
to that little bastard Zhang!

358
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,120
You could truly say

359
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,280
"You can't make an omelette
without breaking eggs".

360
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,400
If that little bastard really gets controlled 
by him,

361
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,240
no one from the outside will gain any benefit.

362
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,203
[Xiangzhu Hall]

363
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,000
Chevalier Goldbean!

364
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,600
Sister Xiang.

365
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,920
Silly boy, I've got something delicious!

366
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,920
Since you're putting so much effort
into your practice,

367
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,920
I bought you some nuts.

368
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,640
It'll nourish your body!

369
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm fine, Sister Xiang.

370
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,200
I won't eat it, thank you.

371
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,360
Why?

372
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
Your Brother Cao

373
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,880
specially bought these Wolong nuts for me.

374
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
They are so delicious and really popular in town!

375
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,760
The queue for it is really long, you know?

376
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,560
It tastes really good, come and try some!

377
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,560
What's wrong?

378
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,920
What happened? Who bullied you?

379
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,840
Tell me! I'll break their legs!

380
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,240
Don't cry, you good-for-nothing
Chevalier Goldbean.

381
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,840
You can't stop talking when I tell you to be quiet.

382
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,560
But when you should be talking,
you don’t say anything.

383
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,680
It's alright.

384
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,920
If you can't beat them,

385
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
you can always tell on them.

386
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,520
Let's go and tell on them.

387
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,800
Sister Xiang.

388
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,200
Why do they hate me so much?

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,760
They said...

390
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,160
Silly boy, if you tell on them,

391
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,320
Gao Chong will definitely...

392
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,320
Miss Xiang. You two know each other?

393
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,440
Yes, Sister Xiao Lian.

394
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,320
You didn't know it?

395
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,360
We've known each other for a long time!

396
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
What can I do for you, Senior Gao?

397
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,800
What happened to you?

398
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Who bullied you?

399
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,680
That's too much!

400
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,600
Senior Gao, no one bullied me.

401
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,000
I was practicing moves
with your seniors and juniors.

402
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
My skills are poor,
I have nothing to say for myself.

403
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,360
Practicing moves?

404
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,200
You've only just arrived here.

405
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,720
You haven't even learned any skills yet!

406
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,880
I came at the wrong time.

407
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
You two must want to speak in private, don't you?

408
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,720
I'll be leaving.

409
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,280
Miss Xiang gave this to you, didn't she?

410
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,120
Those are Wolong nuts.

411
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
If you like it, you can have it.

412
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,320
Miss Xiang is so kind to you.

413
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,800
These Wolong nuts

414
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,080
are truly popular in Yueyang City.

415
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,440
It's really hard to get them.

416
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,640
I was worried you wouldn't be used to our food,

417
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,160
so I especially asked someone
to teach me how to make

418
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,160
these Yueyang-style Osmanthus Cakes,

419
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,160
since this is your hometown's specialty.

420
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,920
Thank you, Senior Gao.

421
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
I feel very grateful.

422
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,360
But please take back this gracious present.

423
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,680
Cheng Ling.

424
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,160
Father told me

425
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,920
to take care of you.

426
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm grateful for Leader Gao and for your kindness.

427
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,040
Thank you.

428
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,440
Cheng Ling.

429
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,760
Why do you keep calling me Senior Gao today?

430
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Why are you being so formal?

431
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,160
Don't you usually call me...?

432
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
As you said,

433
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,280
we used to call each other brother and sister.

434
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,960
I bear no grudge against you.

435
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,040
Even though I'm still young,

436
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,320
I'm not a puppet at the mercy of others.

437
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,640
Leader Gao made arrangements for my marriage.

438
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,560
I didn't know it and I'm afraid

439
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,480
I do not deserve this blessing.

440
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,080
Brother Cheng Ling...

441
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,920
Senior Gao, you need not say more.

442
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,680
I know myself.

443
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,280
If I say yes to this marriage,

444
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,000
I'd be taking what isn't mine to take,
and people will misunderstand.

445
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,680
I may feel looked down upon.

446
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,760
What's wrong with you?

447
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,960
Is it wrong for her to treat you well?

448
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
I know Sister Xiao Lian treats me well.

449
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm just...

450
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,320
Alright, alright.

451
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,040
Stop it, Chevalier Goldbean.

452
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
Sister Xiang.

453
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,680
Where are Master and Uncle Wen?

454
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,880
I don't know.

455
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,480
Why are you looking for them?

456
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,440
Why?

457
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
You aren't happy living here?

458
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm not living here.

459
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,320
It's a house arrest.

460
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Spring is constant in all four seasons,

461
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,880
knowing everything in the world.

462
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,280
Master.

463
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,760
What happened?

464
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,280
Something big.

465
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,200
Gao Chong wants his daughter
to marry Zhang Cheng Ling.

466
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
He's going all-in.

467
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,120
Yes.

468
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
That Gao Xiao Lian

469
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,200
was originally with Deng Kuan,
the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect.

470
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,120
Even though there was no promise of marriage yet,

471
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
everyone has already accepted the fact.

472
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
Once Gao Chong announced his decision,

473
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,880
a lot of people began commenting on it.

474
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,680
Right, that Deng Kuan,

475
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,920
the survivor of the last Funeral Game,

476
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,560
returned to the Yueyang Sect a few days ago.

477
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,240
He was hurt by someone
and still lies unconscious.

478
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,440
By someone?

479
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,600
I was at the Funeral Game that day.

480
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,440
Deng Kuan only suffered some scratches.

481
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,520
He should have recovered long ago.

482
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,400
He shouldn't still be unconscious.

483
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,840
Is the corpse incident in the theater

484
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,480
Changing Ghost's work?

485
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
How much do you and Tragicomic Ghost know?

486
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,080
Not much. Is there anything wrong?

487
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,160
What did Zhang Cheng Ling say?

488
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
If he marries Gao Chong's sole daughter,

489
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,880
he'd be climbing the ladder of society quickly.

490
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,880
That kid

491
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,600
seems quite stupid,

492
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,760
but on this matter,

493
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,640
he clearly knows what's going on.

494
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,000
That Gao Xiao Lian gave him the signs many times.

495
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,520
But he ignored them all.

496
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,040
But I think that Gao Chong

497
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,400
was being too obvious.

498
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,480
It's as if he keeps Cheng Ling

499
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,200
arrested inside Yueyang Sect.

500
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,320
That place is heavily guarded all around.

501
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,240
He can't get out,

502
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
and no one can get in.

503
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,640
Master.

504
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,080
Cheng Ling asked me if there's a way
to get him out.

505
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,040
He misses you a lot.

506
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,480
Why?

507
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,360
It's nothing.

508
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,840
I just find him a bit pitiful.

509
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,200
You dare to

510
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,040
criticize my plan?

511
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,480
I wouldn't dare.

512
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
You forgot who you are

513
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,320
after wearing that human skin for so long?

514
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,320
Don't forget you are Heartless Amethyst Fiend.

515
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
Humans and ghosts travel different roads.

516
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,440
You pity him.

517
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
Who will pity you?

518
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,400
If Gao Chong watches Zhang Cheng Ling so closely,

519
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,560
he must have something planned.

520
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
Watch him.

521
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
If anything happens,

522
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,760
report to me immediately.

523
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,600
Xiang.

524
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
Do you think I'm crazy?

525
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,320
Aren't you afraid that I will go crazy someday

526
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
and kill you too?

527
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,440
I'll follow you even if you go crazy.

528
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,960
If you kill me,

529
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,120
I'll even follow you in death.

530
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,180
Good.

531
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,760
In that case,

532
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
I shall go crazy to the end.

533
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:50,422
[Profound Expectations]

534
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,560
The Heroes Conference will be held soon.

535
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,760
Everyone, do your best.

536
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,960
Do not slack off.

537
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,440
Yes!

538
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,120
Big Brother, don't worry too much.

539
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,240
It's been quite peaceful lately.

540
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,560
There should be no problem.

541
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,160
Fifth Brother, you don't know.

542
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,560
The martial arts world seems peaceful
on the surface,

543
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,120
but in fact, danger lurks everywhere.

544
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,280
Things are not that bad.

545
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,080
Right now,

546
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,760
heroes from all over the world
have gathered in Yueyang City.

547
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,160
The Ghost Valley

548
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,480
wouldn't dare to make trouble again.

549
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Humans are unpredictable.

550
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,120
The Five Lakes Alliance has many enemies.

551
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,600
The Ghost Valley isn't the only one

552
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,640
who wants to watch us fall.

553
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Father, Uncle Shen.

554
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,080
Seeing how troubled you both have been lately,

555
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,680
I made some lotus seed soup for you.

556
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,720
Good girl.

557
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,920
Brother, it's so great to have a daughter.

558
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,280
We won't eat it.

559
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
Bring it to Cheng Ling later.

560
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,720
Father, I...

561
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,040
don't want to do that anymore.

562
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,160
Do what?

563
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,880
Father.

564
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,640
Why did you betroth me to him

565
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,800
without even asking me first?

566
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,600
He is still a kid!

567
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,560
Children will grow up.

568
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,960
Your marriage has been decided in advance.

569
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,560
You can finalize the wedding
in several years.

570
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,760
But he doesn't like me!

571
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,280
The children's marriages
should be decided by their parents!

572
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
How can a girl ask something like this

573
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,000
in front of her father?

574
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,200
You're shameless!

575
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
Big Brother.

576
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,920
Calm down.

577
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,160
Listen to her first.

578
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,920
Father, so you know that I have my pride, too.

579
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,840
I listened to your orders

580
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,160
and repeatedly expressed
my goodwill to Cheng Ling.

581
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,600
But he turned me down again and again.

582
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,520
I know

583
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,280
I’ve never done Cheng Ling wrong!

584
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,440
I don't understand

585
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,000
why you're doing this to me,

586
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,880
even less

587
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,840
why Brother Cheng Ling is treating me like this!

588
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,760
Enough. Don't bring it to him then.

589
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,040
I'll have someone sent it to him.

590
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,240
Go.

591
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Father!

592
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,440
Just go!

593
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,440
I'm in a really good mood today.

594
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,960
Can I listen to a song?

595
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,559
Sure, of course!

596
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,680
Anything you want.

597
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,960
I'm only responsible for the bill.

598
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,640
Miss, come here.

599
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,040
Sing me a song.

600
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,680
What song do I choose?

601
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,040
Which music house are you from?

602
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,309
We are from Qing Yu Tower.

603
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,920
Qing Yu Tower?

604
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,270
That's a good place.

605
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,560
Happy Meeting. Can you play that?

606
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,080
Yes.

607
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,790
Madam, please tune the qin.

608
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,749
Happy Meeting?

609
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,120
Is Xiang trying to

610
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,000
tell me something with this song?

611
00:34:56,591 --> 00:35:00,231
[Roasted Fish]

612
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:07,471
[Qing Yu Tower]

613
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Sister Qian Qiao, the chief asks for you.

614
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:29,271
[Luo Mansion]

615
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,880
You...

616
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,960
Very good.

617
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,480
I allowed three ghosts of Mount Qingya

618
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,600
to break the oath and exit the valley

619
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,720
so you could catch the Hanged Ghost

620
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,440
and take back the Glazed Armor he stole.

621
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Yet

622
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,280
you haven't even found a single hair

623
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,320
of his.

624
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,000
Instead, you caused quite a lot of trouble.

625
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,720
You organized three Funerals,

626
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
annihilated the Danyang Sect,

627
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,280
destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect,

628
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
killed Mount Tai Sect's leader,

629
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,960
and publicly threw out the corpses
to provoke the Five Lakes Alliance.

630
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,080
In just three months,

631
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,200
you destroyed the peace
that has been maintained

632
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,160
for twenty years between the Ghost Valley
and the Five Lakes Alliance.

633
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,280
Very good. Very good indeed.

634
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,440
Forgive us for our crimes.

635
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,480
Crimes?

636
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you think I'm being sarcastic?

637
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm praising you.

638
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,960
Though you didn't do any
proper business these three months,

639
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
we are evil ghosts.

640
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,400
And as evil ghosts,

641
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,240
bringing disasters to the world is our job.

642
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,640
What crimes did you commit?

643
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,600
You did a great job!

644
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,400
I want to give you a reward!

645
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,840
Get up.

646
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,920
I said,

647
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,360
get up!

648
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,320
Come!

649
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,600
As for merit,

650
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,600
Tragicomic Ghost,

651
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,040
were the Funerals fun?

652
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,280
Wasn't it a great idea of mine?

653
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Watching those fake things

654
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,480
show their true faces

655
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,760
and kill each other like crazy animals,

656
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,520
wasn't it even more fun
than killing them yourself?

657
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,680
You are wise, Chief.

658
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
The Danyang Sect shelters evil people
and countenance evil practices.

659
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,120
Lu Tai Chong deserves all the credit.

660
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,120
It’s fine to kill all the disciples
of the Danyang Sect,

661
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,840
but Lu Tai Chong died too from anger.

662
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,880
Originally, I wanted to keep him alive
to deal with him slowly.

663
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,240
What a misstep.

664
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,160
This counts as your mistake.

665
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,080
I won't reward or punish you.

666
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
Do you accept it?

667
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,160
I do.

668
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,840
Great.

669
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,200
Let's talk about the second merit.

670
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,240
Mirror Lake Sect's overnight annihilation.

671
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,400
Great job.

672
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,800
Who did it?

673
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,720
Isn't he here?

674
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,840
That only leaves Long-tongued Ghost.

675
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,840
Changing Ghost, where is your subordinate?

676
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,400
Chief.

677
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,520
Ever since we left the valley,

678
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,960
Long-tongued Ghost
no longer listened to my orders.

679
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
I believe that Long-tongued Ghost
has already defected.

680
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,880
As for the destruction of the Mirror Lake Sect,

681
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,600
it should be Long-tongued Ghost's work.

682
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,280
I was unable to govern my subordinate.

683
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,360
Please bestow upon me the sin of incompetence.

684
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,000
Long-tongued Ghost
wouldn't listen to you anymore?

685
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,880
That's nothing.

686
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,800
In the Ghost Valley,
the weak are the prey of the strong.

687
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,120
The able ones are the ones in charge.

688
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,560
If he has the ability to kill you,

689
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,360
I will make him the head of the Ten Devils.

690
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,000
If you have the ability to kill me,

691
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,920
I'll admire you even in death!

692
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,440
I wouldn't dare.

693
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,040
Wouldn't dare?

694
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,360
That's funny.

695
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,840
The evil ghosts of Mount Qingya

696
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
fight their life and death struggles

697
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,360
every single day of the year.

698
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
If I sat injured here today,

699
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,880
would you dare say you won't kill me

700
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,080
and replace me?

701
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,240
Really, White Grim Reaper?

702
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,680
I wouldn't dare!

703
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,920
I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare!

704
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,120
Ch... Chief!

705
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,840
I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare!

706
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,440
Stand up, everything's fine. Don't be afraid.

707
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,160
Chief.

708
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
Chief!

709
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,160
Please have mercy, Chief!

710
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,360
Changing Ghost. He is your subordinate.

711
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,680
Do you think he deserves to die?

712
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,560
He doesn't deserve it, he doesn't!

713
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,560
Please calm down, Chief!

714
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,080
The Ghost Valley is in need of manpower!

715
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,960
Please, Chief!

716
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,880
You're right.

717
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,480
The Ghost Valley is in need of manpower.

718
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,920
The martial arts world

719
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,240
is full of rotten people.

720
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,800
I want to use them too.

721
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,040
But I am the chief of the Ghost Valley.

722
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Ghosts

723
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,080
are the only ones I can use.

724
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
Isn't that right?

725
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Black Grim Reaper.

726
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,640
You are right, Chief.

727
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Black Grim Reaper.

728
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,560
I turned

729
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,000
your good brother into a ghost for no reason.

730
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,240
Do you feel resentful?

731
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,360
Chief, it was great that you killed him.

732
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,000
How boring.

733
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,240
Come on, let's talk about
your merits for the time being.

734
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,200
Changing Ghost.

735
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,720
Was it you who came up with the plan
to throw out corpses

736
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,960
in Yueyang City?

737
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,040
Yes.

738
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,000
Did someone assist you?

739
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,960
I ordered my subordinates to do it.

740
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm not too sure about

741
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,480
the specific details.

742
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,960
I don't think there was
any assistance from the outside.

743
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,520
Who did you send to handle this?

744
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,600
White Grim Reaper.

745
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,680
Well planned.

746
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,800
Changing Ghost, you planned it too well.

747
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,400
White Grim Reaper is guilty for his inability.

748
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,200
You cleaned up my subordinates for me, Chief.

749
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,680
It was great you killed him.

750
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,680
It was great.

751
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,640
And who killed

752
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,080
Mount Tai Sect's leader?

753
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,960
Happy Ghost.

754
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,400
Your marks were left behind

755
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,760
on his face.

756
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,960
Chief.

757
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,960
It... It wasn't me.

758
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,040
Some... Someone set me up.

759
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,200
If it was really me,

760
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,360
I'd never deny it.

761
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,560
Is it funny?

762
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,560
Chief, this is an old problem of mine.

763
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,240
It's... It's a breathing issue.

764
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,960
I can't speak without laughing.

765
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,440
Please have mercy, Chief.

766
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,480
It is quite funny.

767
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,080
Seeing you guys so scared,

768
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,960
is of course funny.

769
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,840
But it's only funny for a while.

770
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,640
We have to find some other fun.

771
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,400
The gathering of those righteous bastards
is in two days.

772
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,440
Come, come. Speak freely.

773
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,200
We have to devise a cunning plan

774
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,240
to utterly destroy the pride

775
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,480
of the Five Lakes Alliance's survivors,
the three dogs,

776
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,960
so much they can't reassemble them again.

777
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,080
That would truly be funny.
