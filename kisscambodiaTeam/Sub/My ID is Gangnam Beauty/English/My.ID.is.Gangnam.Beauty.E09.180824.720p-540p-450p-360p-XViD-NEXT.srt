1
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,195
Why didn't you call me?

2
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,935
Have you been waiting long?

3
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,205
- No. - Let's go in.

4
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:57,590
Exactly in a month from now,

5
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,390
your rent and half of the utilities are due.

6
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,930
If you can't pay that, you must move out.

7
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:02,460
I can't accept your belongings instead.

8
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,155
Also, we'll buy our own food, okay?

9
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:07,185
- Okay. - All right, then.

10
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:11,495
I'll sleep here. You can sleep there.

11
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:13,695
I'll sleep on the couch.

12
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,165
Sure, that's fine.

13
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,065
Now, here's some important stuff.

14
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,135
Make sure all windows are open before you use the vacuum cleaner.

15
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:26,635
And separate the recyclables carefully. This is very important.

16
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,860
The top two shelves are mine. The bottom one is yours.

17
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,285
If you must use my shelf, don't forget to label your container.

18
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,085
And...

19
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,955
What? What is it?

20
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,955
Nothing. You're just a bit different from what people say about you.

21
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:45,495
In what sense?

22
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:48,095
You're a worse nagger than my housekeeper is.

23
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:51,965
You'll also have to watch your mouth.

24
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,890
Give me that. Because my place isn't that spacious,

25
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,405
you should lay it out like this.

26
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,475
Then fold it like this.

27
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,945
After that, all you have to do is this.

28
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,345
You saw what I did, right?

29
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,015
What else?

30
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:18,855
Don't you think that guy, Woo Young, likes Mi Rae?

31
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,255
What?

32
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:22,965
Now that she's pretty, guys swarm around her.

33
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,335
What? Who? That jerk?

34
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,365
Why are you calling him a jerk?

35
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:31,990
He's in Mi Rae's department. I heard he's a TA.

36
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,845
Whatever he is, it doesn't matter. All men are animals.

37
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,030
If he's a TA, he should focus on guiding students.

38
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,960
How dare he have a crush on Mi Rae? What a jerk.

39
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:42,215
He's someone's beloved child too. Why do you keep talking ill of him?

40
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:44,955
I'd love to have a son-in-law like him.

41
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:47,055
A son-in-law? Did you say "son-in-law"?

42
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,400
Mi Rae is too young to get married.

43
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,025
She's still a kid!

44
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:54,740
Okay, I heard you. Just drive carefully.

45
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:56,065
Goodness.

46
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,935
Where does he live?

47
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,235
Is it close to Mi Rae's place?

48
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,835
Oh, dear.

49
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,045
Who is it?

50
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:16,885
Hey, Mi Rae.

51
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,325
My mom wanted me to give you this.

52
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,895
- Your mom? - Yes.

53
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,225
Take the containers. Come in for a few minutes.

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,175
Make sure you tell your mom that I thanked her.

55
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,505
Okay.

56
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:42,160
You should put everything in the fridge as soon as possible.

57
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,445
Oh, right.

58
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:45,475
Let's see.

59
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:54,040
Hey, what are you doing here?

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,485
I live here now.

61
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,025
What?

62
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,520
I posted about looking for a roommate,

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,305
and he showed up. He practically begged me.

64
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,760
Right, you're at the age where you must be dying to live on your own.

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,190
When you saw a cool guy like me doing it,

66
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:17,315
you must've wanted to move out too. Aren't I right?

67
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,215
My, these side dishes look amazing.

68
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,685
Kyung Seok moved out of his parents' place?

69
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,270
Yes, I was so surprised too.

70
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,580
I was definitely not expecting to see him there.

71
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,995
There must've been a reason.

72
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:39,965
I wonder if the talk Ms. Na had with him went well.

73
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:43,305
It bothers me that he moved out right after that.

74
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,035
Are you worried?

75
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,475
A little, I guess.

76
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,530
About yourself or him?

77
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,060
About me? Why?

78
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:53,430
Now that he lives so close by,

79
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,800
you might fall for him. Are you worried about that?

80
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,885
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,830
I think...

82
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,870
that something big will happen between you two in the near future.

83
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,270
Are you writing a novel or what?

84
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,970
What? It's possible.

85
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,610
Kyung Seok's nice to you.

86
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,280
Stop writing stories.

87
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,480
You should've majored in literature, not psychology.

88
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:12,550
What?

89
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,780
Eat up. This is really delicious.

90
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:18,135
I cooked for you today to congratulate your move.

91
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,360
But starting from tomorrow, you should cook your own meals.

92
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
Okay.

93
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,875
Let's eat.

94
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,845
Mi Rae's mother is a great cook. This is really delicious.

95
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,315
How do you know her parents?

96
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,485
I ran into them a couple of times.

97
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,585
How many times did you run into them?

98
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,495
What?

99
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,980
What are you going to eat for breakfast tomorrow?

100
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,695
I rarely eat breakfast.

101
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,405
Have you ever worked?

102
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,475
No.

103
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,575
That means you'll have to turn into an adult starting from tomorrow.

104
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,275
Reality strikes you once you move out of your parents' place.

105
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:13,355
Turn left.

106
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,980
You've gone off-course. You'll be redirected.

107
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,965
(Do Kyung Seok)

108
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm sorry. Today's my first day, so I'm kind of lost.

109
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,430
No, it's okay. I'm not bothered by you.

110
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,430
Just focus on driving safely.

111
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,815
Okay. Thank you.

112
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,135
I wonder if Ms. Na called because she knew.

113
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:01,305
You startled me.

114
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,215
Sorry.

115
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:06,515
Are you in charge of recycling?

116
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,245
Yes.

117
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:30,005
Can you wait a little?

118
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,020
I'm not done with my garbage.

119
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:33,375
Okay.

120
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,825
Who throws away cans like that?

121
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:04,905
Are you okay?

122
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,445
Yes.

123
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,375
I'm fine.

124
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:17,000
Are you hurt? Come over here.

125
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,615
No, it's okay.

126
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,425
Let me see.

127
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,195
I'm really okay.

128
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,175
I'll see you.

129
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:45,145
See you again.

130
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,715
"See you again"?

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,685
Do I need to see him every day now?

132
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,940
- Goodnight. - You're sleeping already?

133
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,825
I need to leave early in the morning.

134
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,195
You should sleep too. You'll have to face reality tomorrow.

00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:08,765
Are you okay?

140
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:16,405
Let me see.

141
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,575
I'm really okay.

142
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,050
Hey.

143
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,945
The hot water won't turn on.

144
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,275
Hot water?

145
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:00,375
I haven't used it yet, but I'm sure there's a button.

146
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:04,045
But you're a man. I'm surprised you shower with hot water.

He can't be human.

150
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,380
- Why is he so handsome? - You should go talk to him.

151
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:56,520
No, you should go up to him and say hello.

152
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:58,005
No.

153
00:12:58,457 --> 00:12:59,735
My gosh.

154

Kyung Seok.

161
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,525
What are you doing here?

162
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,195
I was waiting for you guys.

163
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,595
He waited...

164
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,005
for me?

165
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:41,020
How did you know we'd come?

166
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,545
I never saw you pass by.

167
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,210
The weather's so nice.

168
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,095
The fine dust level is really bad.

169

It's really bad today.

170
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,035
Why did you move into Woo Young's place?

171
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,020
I thought you moved out of your dad's place to live by yourself.

172
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,745
It's cheap there. I don't have money right now.

173
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,885
Didn't your dad offer to pay for you?

174
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:27,085
Did you run away from home?

175
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,855
Why would I run away from home? I'm not a high school kid.

176

Does your mother know about this?

177

00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:56,615
You can go first.

183
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,285
- Hey. - Hey.

184
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,965
Is he mad at us?

185
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:19,050
So why did you have to ask details about his private life?

186
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:21,690
We're friends. You can ask a friend that much.

187
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:24,145
You asked him whether Ms. Na knew about it too.

188
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:28,145
Anyway, it doesn't look like he moved out for a good reason, right?

189
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,585
Right.

190
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:45,295
You face reality once you move out from your parents' house.

191
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,205
Why does he want the study guide from me?

192
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,845
- Who? - Jang Won Ho.

193
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,345
Gosh, why is he talking so nicely all of a sudden?

194
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:08,325
Ji Hyo, do you have a study guide for the finals?

195
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,485
Would you share it with me?

196
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,395
I guess he's trying to hit on me now because it doesn't work on you.

197
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,350
I've got you a new cup of coffee.

198
00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:25,635
- You're here. - Here you go.

199
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,435
Sung Woon.

200
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,675
Check this out.

201
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:31,630
Here.

202
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,730
(Hyun Soo A)

203
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,085
Here.

204
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,570
It's the picture that I took, right?

205
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:40,970
She changed her profile to this picture.

206
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:44,625
How do you notice even her newly updated profile picture?

207
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,365
That's impressive.

208
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,780
Didn't you say you'd get flicked 10 times in the forehead...

209
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,635
if she changed her profile to this picture?

210
00:17:56,088 --> 00:18:01,790
I mean, she shouldn't be giving you empty hope like this.

211
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,175
This isn't right.

212
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:04,630
Okay, get ready.

213
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,430
Come on. You're in a good mood today,

214
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,485
- so let it slide this one time. - Okay.

215
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,955
- One. - Bring it on.

216
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,370
- Two. - You're good at it.

217
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:19,655
Right?

218
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,425
Three.

219
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:23,595
Awesome.

220
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,165
Sung Woon?

221
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:28,635
Sung Woon.

222
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,475
Hi, Soo A.

223
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,290
Hello.

224
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,205
Can I come over to your house one day?

225
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:41,500
Well, it's pretty late when I go home after my part-time work.

226
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,185
Is that right? How about weekends then?

227
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:46,930
I should go to my parents' house on weekends.

228
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,355
You mean, Dogok-dong?

229
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,140
Right.

230
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,940
Do you live with your grandparents?

231
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:54,640
When you live with a lot of family members,

232
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:57,125
you happen to dream of living alone. That's why I'm asking.

233
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:05,075
My grandparents passed away.

234
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,305
I'll take care of it myself.

235
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,525
You've become very curious about me.

236
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:32,895
Well, yes. You can tell me if you're struggling with anything.

237
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,635
I could help you with it.

238
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:37,020
Okay.

239
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:40,150
My class is starting soon. I have to go. See you later.

240
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,475
Bye.

241
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,815
Should I eat spicy stir-fried pork or omelet rice?

242
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,315
I'll have pork cutlet.

243
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,570
Should I eat spicy stir-fried pork or omelet rice?

244
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,285
I said I'll have pork cutlet.

245
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:58,870
- I had it yesterday though. - Pork cutlet.

246
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,495
- Let's go. - All right.

247
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:47,535
- Hello? - Have you had lunch?

248
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,205
No.

249
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,245
Come to the faculty cafeteria.

250
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,085
Never mind if you don't want a free meal.

251
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,820
We were having naengmyeon,

252
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,265
and he gave me his egg.

253
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:18,920
You know, this happens when you eat naengmyeon.

254
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,705
Its toppings matter because it's too bland to eat just the noodles.

255
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:24,020
Among all the toppings,

256
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,275
the half-cut egg is so precious that you wouldn't share it with others.

257
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,315
You know what's surprising?

258
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,245
He gave me the pear too.

259
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:35,470
He knows very well about how to move your heart.

260
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:38,670
After all, he meant it when he said I didn't need to lose weight...

261
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:40,695
and that I was cute just the way I was.

262
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:43,965
Did you guys kiss each other?

263
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:47,795
Did you hold hands?

264
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,820
He's conservative, so he isn't good at that kind of stuff.

265
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,175
Hey.

266
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,360
Even conservative men become open-minded to their girlfriends.

267
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:57,960
What are you talking about?

268
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,645
Be quiet. Others might hear you.

269
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,045
Jung Yeob.

270
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:04,645
Oh, hey.

271
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:07,015
Let's eat together here.

272
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,885
Ye Na is here, so people won't suspect us.

273
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:15,525
I'm good at keeping secrets, so you don't need to worry.

274
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:17,525
I'm not worried.

275
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,795
- Enjoy your food, then. - Won't you eat with us?

276
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:23,765
I'll eat with those guys.

277
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,275
I'll call you later.

278
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,115
Ye Na.

279
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:44,955
By the way, why do you keep your relationship from others?

280
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:46,910
It's no good to make it public.

281
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:48,695
We'll only be gossiped about.

282
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,525
Did your boyfriend say that?

283
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:54,335
Well, I think the same.

284
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,220
Why aren't there any campus couples in our department?

285
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,075
Maybe it's just that we don't know.

286
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,100
Hi.

287
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:11,915
- Hello. - Hello.

288
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,255
- Are you going to have lunch? - Yes.

289
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:17,040
I see. Enjoy your lunch.

290
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:18,425
- Okay. - Thanks.

291
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:27,735
You can call me when you want to grab a drink.

292
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,835
I'm a huge fan of yours.

293
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,380
You happen to be hungrier when you have no money.

294
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,995
You crave a lot of food too.

295
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,235
- Did you get a part-time work? - Not yet.

296
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,905
You might get it quickly if you post a writing on a job-hunting website.

297
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:08,890
Or you should look for a job about private tutoring...

298
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,645
or teaching at institutions because they pay you more than minimum wage.

299
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,690
It's easy for students in our college to get such part-time jobs.

300
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:17,360
If not, look for a modeling job at shopping websites.

301
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,085
They pay you more than 10 dollars per hour.

302
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:21,770
Make sure your workplace is close to your house and school...

303
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:23,585
in order to save transportation fees.

304
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,455
And...

305
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:27,810
if they often hire new part-timers, the work must be tough there.

306
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,825
It means their part-timers often run away.

307
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:31,395
And what else?

308
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,910
Ask me if something's strange.

309
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,835
I know a lot because I've done all kinds of part-time jobs.

310
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,235
I have to go prepare for my next class. Bye.

311
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,145
Take your time and eat slowly.

312
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,285
Do you live with Woo Young?

313
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:00,125
I've heard you two talk.

314
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,065
I eat here to avoid the kids.

315
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,765
I've done a shameful thing.

316
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,635
I deserve a beating from my junior.

317
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,465
I've abused my power just because I'm a senior.

318
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,505
Sorry about that.

319
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,060
You should be apologizing to Mi Rae, not me.

320
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,375
What?

321
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,845
Right, I should apologize to her too.

322
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,745
I've been looking for her the past few days so I could apologize.

323
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,615
But it's not easy to spot her.

324
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,185
Do you know where she is?

325
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,395
Do it properly if you're going to apologize.

326
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:38,265
Right, I should. I've done a terrible thing to her.

327
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:45,135
Should I introduce you to a good part-time work?

328
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,375
- I'll go first. - Oh, okay.

329
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,915
What's up with that punk? Does he like Mi Rae?

330
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,785
He's hot enough to go out with Soo A. What a lunatic.

331
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:05,295
Gosh, it's hard to maintain relationships.

332
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,335
What's wrong?

333
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,450
Kim Chan Woo?

334
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:17,820
That Kim Chan Woo?

335
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:18,850
What does he want?

336
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,535
Did something else happen?

337
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,760
No.

338
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,575
Then why is he calling you out of the blue?

339
00:26:24,262 --> 00:26:25,730
Shall I answer it for you?

340
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,075
No, it's okay.

341
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:32,015
Are you still scared of that jerk?

342
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:34,055
Hey.

343
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:38,155
We avoid stepping on poop because it's gross, not because it's scary.

344
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:47,865
What's wrong?

345
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,505
Is he that poop?

346
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:54,335
What does he want?

347
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,315
Hey, Mi Rae. How have you been?

348
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:07,030
Can we go somewhere quiet and talk for a moment?

349
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:08,455
What is this about?

350
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:13,095
I need to apologize to her about something.

351
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:21,950
My friend can come too, right?

352
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:23,020
What?

353
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:25,835
I hate even the thought of talking just with you.

354
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:29,645
I see. Right, you must feel that way. I understand.

355
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:34,015
Can I get you a cold drink?

356
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:35,745
No, thanks.

357
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,145
Oh, okay.

358
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,455
Hit me and swear at me all you want.

359
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:47,570
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

360
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:50,310
Violence is the best way to punish those who are violent.

361
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,735
Why are you being like this suddenly?

362
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,165
You may not believe me,

363
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,465
but I've been very distressed.

364
00:27:57,555 --> 00:28:01,035
I'm a senior, but I made fun of a freshman's looks.

365
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,705
Soo A was the one who rejected me, but I took it out on you.

366
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:07,545
I'm really sorry.

367
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,745
Punch me all you want and forgive me.

368
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,670
Forget it. It's all good if you regret what you did.

369
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:22,740
- Hey. - Does that mean you forgive me?

370
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:24,425
Get up, please.

371
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:28,065
Thanks.

372
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:29,480
Let's get on good terms.

373
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,935
All right.

374
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:33,150
Just don't do things like that again.

375
00:28:33,158 --> 00:28:35,020
Of course, I won't. Never.

376
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:37,505
Mi Rae was really hurt by what happened.

377
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:40,875
Be grateful that she's accepting your apology and forgiving you.

378
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,045
Yes, of course. I am grateful.

379
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:45,215
Then...

380
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm off.

381
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,415
All right, bye.

382
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,825
What's with him now?

383
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:00,295
I guess he wanted to apologize to me.

384
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,305
Who's that midget? Who does she think she is?

385
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,475
Is your dad a congressman too?

386
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:15,445
Gosh, my knees.

387
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,640
You must be very busy these days. What brings you all the way here?

388
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:29,340
I have too much on my mind.

389
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,495
I came here for your words of encouragement.

390
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,705
I'm not sure how helpful I can be, but I'll do my best.

391
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:44,990
Then I shall...

392
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:48,845
I'll always think of you as well in my prayers.

393
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,185
Thank you.

394
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,510
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

395
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:08,580
Kyung Seok packed up his stuff and moved out.

396
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,765
What is the matter with him?

397
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:13,705
He met Hye Sung.

398
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:16,975
He's mad at me for fooling him when his mom never cheated on me.

399
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:22,360
So what? Is he staying with her now?

400
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,615
No, he's with Yoo Jin now.

401
00:30:26,137 --> 00:30:28,085
Then he'll come back home soon.

402
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,070
That idiot's bar went out of business.

403
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:33,870
He's trying to see when he can move back home.

404
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:37,625
You won't find anything like this. It's in a great location too.

405
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:41,965
- Oh, I'll show you over there too. - Okay.

406
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:44,380
Have a look at this.

407
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:45,875
Hey, you made it.

408
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:53,360
For this, you need someone who's older and experienced. Why me?

409
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:56,360
My mom just knows how to spend. She doesn't know things like this.

410
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:59,530
She opened this bar for me when I didn't know a thing about business.

411
00:30:59,537 --> 00:31:00,915
Can't you tell?

412
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,670
For the premium, we're thinking 80,000 dollars.

413
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,025
80,000 dollars?

414
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:11,340
I paid 100,000 dollars when I got this space.

415
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:13,380
Gosh. The business has been very slow, you know.

416
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:16,965
It's not easy to find someone who's willing to pay this much.

417
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:20,850
It's been slow because he's not well versed in how to run a business.

418
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,820
Other business in the area are still doing great.

419
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:25,190
The whole place was renovated only a few months ago.

420
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,760
How could you ask for 20,000 dollars less?

421
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:29,785
Please be considerate of how much we'd be losing.

422
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,985
Then let's settle at 90,000 dollars. I can't pay more than that.

423
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:37,685
Sure, let's do that.

424
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:41,555
Are you out of your mind?

425
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,640
If it's less than that, I'll get kicked out.

426
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,835
My dad will beat me up to a pulp.

427
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:54,350
It all comes down to money.

428
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,720
They can't do anything if we cut off financial support entirely.

429
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:59,990
Right? He'll come back home and beg me, right?

430
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:02,145
Don't even help him with his tuition fees.

431
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:06,430
Right, I guess he can figure out a way to support himself,

432
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:07,800
but not for a long time.

433
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:10,485
You must be firm and strict at times like this.

434
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:13,010
If you go easy on him, he'll keep getting worse.

435
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:15,240
I certainly won't go easy on him.

436
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:17,810
They say that no parent can win against their children,

437
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:20,035
but children can't win against their parents either.

438
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:21,795
You know that, right?

439
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:34,390
When you're here, make sure you button up your lab coats.

440
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,045
And tie your hair back too.

441
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:39,115
Tie your hair back. You too.

442
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,715
It's for your safety.

443
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,385
Guys, why did you submit your report a week late?

444
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,355
- Because of him. - Because of him.

445
00:32:45,777 --> 00:32:49,425
Can we move along already? He's such a nagger.

446
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,640
I wonder if he also nags people around him like this.

447
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,295
If he does, he probably has no friends.

448
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,365
Thanks for not being meaner.

449
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,065
I have no friends. How did you know? Has the word already spread?

450
00:32:58,189 --> 00:32:59,550
No, don't mind us.

451
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:01,320
- We were just kidding. - All right.

452
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,105
We must strictly follow the protocol.

453
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:07,660
I don't think you're a nagger.

454
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:10,415
Also, I think you must be popular among your friends.

455
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,185
Oh, really? Thanks.

456
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,435
What did you want to talk to us about?

457
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:36,820
I have a crush on Woo Young.

458
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,020
- What? - What?

459
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,475
I want to date him.

460
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,285
I have no idea how to make that happen though.

461
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,445
Give me some advice, girls.

462
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:48,315
Oh, my goodness.

463
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:51,085
Yoon Byul, this is crazy.

464
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,110
You're so cute.

465
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,870
Seriously? Do you really have a crush on him?

466
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,025
Have you ever seen her cracking jokes?

467
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,535
How did that happen?

468
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,880
I've been observing him, and I have a lot to learn from him.

469
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,950
He's sensible, and he does everything by the book.

470
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,650
He's a great role model for all of us.

471
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,705
Plus, he's handsome too.

472
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:12,090
What should we do with this girl now?

473
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,590
But how are you going to bring it up directly to him?

474
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,560
Why can't I?

475
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:18,245
As far as I know, he's not seeing anyone at the moment.

476
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,285
Right, he is single,

477
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:25,470
but all of his ex-girlfriends were drop-dead gorgeous.

478
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:26,870
- Seriously? - So what?

479
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:28,470
Yoon Byul is pretty too.

480
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:31,240
I just wish she was a bit more feminine.

481
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:34,495
I know, right? Grow your hair out and put on some makeup.

482
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:37,280
I like your tomboy style,

483
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,550
but I don't think that's Woo Young's type.

484
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:41,205
What's wrong with my style?

485
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,305
You are pretty.

486
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,575
- Hello. - Hello.

487
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,045
It's been a while, girls.

488
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:54,900
Do you happen to know of any good part-time position?

489
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:57,185
Why are you asking about part-time jobs out of the blue?

490
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,755
I'm helping Kyung Seok find a part-time job.

491
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,925
Why would you do that for Kyung Seok?

492
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:05,140
Kyung Seok and I are close.

493
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:06,695
- You guys are close? - You guys are close?

494
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,610
They say, "After a storm comes a calm."

495
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,550
I apologized and reconciled with him,

496
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:12,335
and now we're very close.

497
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,220
- Gosh, we're friends. - You're quite strong.

498
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,715
- My gosh. - Hey.

499
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:21,475
Do you guys have part-time jobs?

500
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,945
- No. - No.

501
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,545
You guys have so much to learn.

502
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,285
You should learn from Kyung Seok.

503
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Let's learn from him.

504
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,885
How am I going to get him a part-time job?

505
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:35,725
Gosh, he just shows up out of nowhere and talks nonsense.

506
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,895
Yoo Jin put his bar up for sale.

507
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:42,980
Really? Then what's going to happen to his bar?

508
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:45,735
The bar will still be there, but it'll have a different owner.

509
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,705
He'll be selling it to someone else.

510
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,605
Then what's going to happen to Yoo Jin?

511
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:53,215
He's completely bankrupt, so he's going to go back home.

512
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,445
I see.

513
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:00,915
I'll help you out.

514
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:04,200
Goodness, thank you.

515
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,255
It's really hot. You should drink some water.

516
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,140
- You're always so nice. - It's no big deal.

517
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,395
Woo Young is so sweet.

518
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:15,480
Yoo Jin's two years older than Woo Young.

519
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:17,980
- It's okay. I'll do it. - But Woo Young seems way older.

520
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,875
- Should I take it over there? - Yes.

521
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,860
(List of expenses, Total amount of money: 50 dollars)

522
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:32,730
(Current balance: 80 cents)

523
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:34,115
80 cents.

524
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:47,095
Can I sit next to you?

525
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,565
Do whatever you want.

526
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:06,715
That's our Physics homework.

527
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:08,715
It's due today.

528
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:10,885
Some questions were pretty hard to solve.

529
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,670
Are you stuck on any questions?

530
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,055
Not really.

531
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,095
I heard everyone say that the questions are really hard.

532
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,765
Hey, you solved this one.

533
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,665
Can you teach me how?

534
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:48,555
Do you get it now?

535
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:51,325
I had a hard time solving this question.

536
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,095
Thanks.

537
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,235
Mi Rae.

538
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:03,220
You're here.

539
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,405
Hey.

540
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:09,145
- Hey, Mi Rae. - Hi.

541
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:12,245
Sit here.

542
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:14,785
What?

543
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,425
What's wrong?

544
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,885
No, it's nothing.

545
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:33,735
Are you doing homework for Physics?

546
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,735
It's nothing.

547
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:39,675
Hey, Kyung Seok. Did you move out from home?

548
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:42,245
- Yes. - Really?

549
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,745
Gosh, I thought Chan Woo was talking nonsense.

550
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:48,515
Did you ask him to find a part-time job for you?

551
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,200
- No. - He's not crazy.

552
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:51,985
Why would he ask him to look for a part-time job?

553
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:53,955
Plus, why would Kyung Seok need a part-time job anyway?

554
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:56,365
- I do need a part-time job. - Why?

555
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:58,125
Because I need to earn money.

556
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,695
Don't you get money from your dad?

557
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:02,905
No.

558
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:05,835
Really?

559
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,805
Please don't tell anyone that you live near my place.

560
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:13,275
Soo A, you moved out as well.

561
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,045
Really?

562
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,515
I recently started living by myself.

563
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,115
Since when?

564
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:24,255
It's been a while. It's really fun.

565
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,655
Don't you agree?

566
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:29,625
Are you guys living together?

567
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:32,095
- What? - I'm wondering the same thing.

568
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,680
You guys are both from rich families,

569
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,465
but you both moved out during a similar time.

570
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,835
- I smell something fishy. - Hey.

571
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:42,760
You're really talking nonsense.

572
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,620
It's not entirely impossible.

573
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:48,775
Kyung Seok and Soo A are living in a parallel universe.

574
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:50,230
You guys look good together.

575
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,245
Why don't you guys just date each other?

576
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,530
- Date each other. - Date each other.

577
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:54,885
Hey.

578
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:57,285
You better watch what you say.

579
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:01,055
I'll watch what I say.

580
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,120
Get me a designer handbag for women.

581
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,575
For women?

582
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:21,845
It's for Kyung Hee, so get me the most trendiest one.

583
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,645
I don't care how much it costs, so get me the best one.

584
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:29,885
He's going to give Kyung Hee a designer handbag?

585
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:39,310
These two are the most expensive products in our store.

586
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:41,710
This product was purchased by top celebrities such as...

587
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,850
Kim Hye Soo, Kim Nam Joo, and Ko So Young.

588
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:45,180
This is the only one left.

589
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:47,550
This one's a limited edition,

590
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:48,550
and only five of them were imported to Korea.

591
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,220
It's a very popular item in Hollywood.

592
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:52,790
Many female idols wanted to buy this,

593
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:54,760
but they all gave up on buying it because of the price.

594
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,045
I see.

595
00:40:57,068 --> 00:41:00,015
Then I guess this one will be better suiting for a 17-year-old.

596
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,015
A 17-year-old?

597
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:05,385
She's so pretty.

598
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,125
Do you think she's a celebrity?

599
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,725
She looks so elegant.

600
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,240
I look forward to working with you.

601
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:14,395
Me too.

602
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:17,380
She's the CEO of Kelun.

603
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:20,020
I heard they'll be doing a collaboration with our brand.

604
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,250
Please send my regards to your CEO.

605
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:24,805
Okay, I will. We should get going now.

606
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,555
What's wrong with the weather?

607
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:45,195
Let's go.

608
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,310
- Actually... - Yes?

609
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,535
I'd like one that will suit a middle-aged woman.

610
00:41:50,654 --> 00:41:53,235
Okay, I'll introduce you to some other products.

611
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:59,915
You don't have any other schedules for the day.

612
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:01,745
Do you want me to take you home?

613
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:04,945
Just a moment.

614
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:15,355
Hey, Ms. Na.

615
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:18,225
I was wondering if we could meet up for a while.

616
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:20,380
I have something to ask you.

617
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,365
I'll go to your neighborhood.

618
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:23,865
Just tell me your address.

619
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,935
Okay, I'll see you later.

620
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:28,805
Bye.

621
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,245
You already hired someone?

622
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:41,315
Okay.

623
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,255
Have you still not found a part-time job yet?

624
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:48,055
No.

625
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,625
Why don't you apply for the place I work out?

626
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:52,440
It's located near our school,

627
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:54,195
and the owner's really kind.

628
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:57,265
How much is the pay?

629
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,450
If the owner likes you,

630
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:02,535
he pays you more than the minimum wage.

631
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:09,885
Isn't he Do Kyung Seok from the Chemistry Department?

632
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:11,945
Will he be working here?

633
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:16,325
To be honest, we don't really need to hire anymore part-timers.

634
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,100
Do you know how to make a latte?

635
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:19,385
No.

636
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:23,610
Then have you ever worked as a waiter before?

637
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:24,895
No.

638
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:27,365
I've only waited tables at the school festival.

639
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,450
There won't be much to learn.

640
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,475
You'll just have to stay as handsome as you are now.

641
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:41,645
Soo A especially asked me for a favor.

642
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,945
You can come to work with Soo A starting from tomorrow.

643
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:47,930
Okay.

644
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:49,885
Thank you, sir.

645
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,855
This is great news, isn't it?

646
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:54,155
Yes.

647
00:43:57,014 --> 00:44:00,895
Hey, I think one of us will end up getting fired.

648
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:03,265
It'll probably be me.

649
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:06,235
Our manager always hires people based on their looks.

650
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:09,720
It sucks to be ugly.

651
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,475
I agree.

652
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:13,975
See? He's calling me right away.

653
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,145
This is so annoying.

654
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:21,630
Where are you?

655
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:24,355
I have something to say, so please come upstairs.

656
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:27,655
- Sir. - Yes?

657
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:30,225
I'm sorry. I don't think I can work here.

658
00:44:30,247 --> 00:44:32,195
- What? - Bye.

659
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:33,795
Wait.

660
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:41,535
Good-looking punks are always so rude.

661
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:47,860
You wanted to see me?

662
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:51,660
Hey, I just wanted to tell you that you're doing a great job.

663
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:53,885
- Keep up the good work. - Pardon?

664
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:55,685
Get back to work.

665
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:58,285
Kyung Seok.

666
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,170
What's wrong?

667
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:02,455
Didn't you know...

668
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:05,525
that someone had to quit...

669
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:07,195
if I got hired?

670
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,165
What are you talking about?

671
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:15,535
I only did it to help you.

672
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:18,075
Thank you,

673
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:20,790
but you don't have to care about me from now on.

674
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:22,145
Kyung Seok.

675
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,330
You're so mean, you know that?

676
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:28,315
Is this my fault too?

677
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,995
I just don't want to harm others.

678
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:34,855
Bye.

679
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,045
Do Kyung Seok.

680
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,715
Me?

681
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:04,708
Me?

682
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:09,313
Did you wait for me?

683
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:10,581
What?

684
00:46:11,782 --> 00:46:13,050
No.

685
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,885
Never.

686
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:25,662
I'm meeting someone here.

687
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,198
Who?

688
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:30,934
Woo Young?

689
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:33,704
- What? - Are you meeting him alone?

690
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:35,039
No.

691
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,409
Do you like him?

692
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:41,879
Do you?

693
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:48,185
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

694
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:52,790
Why can't you answer?

695
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:54,425
Do you like Woo Young?

696
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:58,295
Hey, be quiet. It's just that I'm flustered.

697
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,763
But you aren't saying no.

698
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:03,600
No, I don't like him, satisfied?

699
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,537
Okay.

700
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:10,574
What will you do if someone hears it?

701
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,242
Why do you care about that?

702
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:13,944
You said you don't like him.

703
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:16,814
Hey, you might not understand,

704
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:19,850
but people usually care about rumors.

705
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,788
Ms. Na.

706
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:26,790
You're here.

707
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:33,897
Were you waiting for her?

708
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:35,466
That's right.

709
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,001
What about you?

710
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:40,704
I live nearby here.

711
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,272
What?

712
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:45,476
Well, right.

713
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,645
He moved to this neighborhood recently.

714
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,615
I see.

715
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,286
How's the stay?

716
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,622
It must not be as good as living in your father's house.

717
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,758
It's manageable.

718
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,160
I see.

719
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:07,531
Let's grab a meal together soon.

720
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:11,401
Let's go, Mi Rae.

721
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:13,036
Okay.

722
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:17,908
Buy me a meal today.

723
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:22,412
What?

724
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:24,448
If you don't mind letting me join you.

725
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:26,984
Of course, you can join us.

726
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:29,086
You want to?

727
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:44,468
You couldn't even stand the sight of food like this when you were young.

728
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:50,641
You might get an upset stomach.

729
00:48:51,074 --> 00:48:52,676
Eat slowly.

730
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:07,090
Why did you want to see Mi Rae?

731
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,728
Well...

732
00:49:12,196 --> 00:49:14,464
You know, Mi Rae likes perfume.

733
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:17,301
We're like a mentor and mentee.

734
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:19,369
That's right.

735
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,072
How are you feeling?

736
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,608
I'm all better now.

737
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:35,986
Can I order something else?

738
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:38,855
Of course. What do you want?

739
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:42,125
Soju.

740
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:43,961
Soju?

741
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,063
Yes, or soju bomb.

742
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:50,567
Shall we?

743
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:52,302
Excuse me.

744
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:55,706
Can we have a bottle of soju and two bottles of beer?

745
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:24,568
Cheers.

746
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,681
So he's good at drinking because he takes after his mother.

747
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:54,097
This is for me?

748
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,566
I got you the most expensive bag in the store.

749
00:50:56,566 --> 00:50:58,969
Don't brag about it too much though.

750
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:05,042
Put your computer back to your room.

751
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:06,476
Really?

752
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:13,216
I'm telling you this just in case.

753
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:16,386
Tell me if you get a call from that woman.

754
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:18,388
Don't ever meet her.

755
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,879
I'm glad you and Mi Rae are neighbors.

756
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,349
Do you live alone?

757
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,684
No, I have a roommate.

758
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:49,086
Is that right?

759
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:54,124
Aren't you going to ask me...

760
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:56,326
why I moved out?

761
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:59,029
Actually,

762
00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:01,465
I knew about it...

763
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:03,700
because your father came to see me.

764
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:09,873
I was worried and curious.

765
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,476
But...

766
00:52:13,243 --> 00:52:14,911
I couldn't call you.

767
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:18,882
Why?

768
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,919
I thought you might not like it.

769
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:38,135
You can really hold your alcohol.

770
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:46,777
Kyung Seok is famous at school for being able to hold his liquor.

771
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:49,045
- Really? - Yes.

772
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:51,381
I guess...

773
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:54,484
I take after you for it.

774
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,600
Why don't we call it a day after this bottle?

775
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:14,137
You're going to school tomorrow, so you shouldn't drink too much.

776
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:20,610
We already drank too much.

777
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:32,889
I'll treat you to delicious food again next time.

778
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:35,592
Thank you.

779
00:53:38,328 --> 00:53:39,629
Ms. Na.

780
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:45,569
Woo Young. Do you live in this neighborhood too?

781
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:49,940
He's my roommate.

782
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,109
Really?

783
00:53:53,743 --> 00:53:55,512
That's good.

784
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:03,353
Actually, Kyung Seok is...

785
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:04,921
my son.

786
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:08,058
Oh, I see.

787
00:54:10,393 --> 00:54:11,761
How do you two know each other?

788
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:16,900
Professor Park in your department is very fond of him, you know.

789
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:18,235
I know him very well.

790
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:21,104
Why don't you come with us to our place since you're here anyway?

791
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:23,273
May I?

792
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:26,109
Of course. I even bought a bottle of soju for Kyung Seok.

793
00:54:26,743 --> 00:54:29,880
My gosh, we already drank a little bit.

794
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:32,082
Then go for your second round at our place.

795
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:38,255
Well, I feel like I'll be a nuisance to you.

796
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,856
Not at all. Let's go.

797
00:54:40,156 --> 00:54:43,493
Then shall I come in for just a few minutes?

798
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:44,861
Mi Rae, you should join us too.

799
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:46,796
This way, please.

800
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,237
I'll just go home.

801
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:56,506
Why? Come with me.

802
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:06,283
Your place is very neat and cozy.

803
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:09,185
Kyung Seok doesn't have a bed though.

804
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:10,654
That's not a big deal.

805
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,656
Please take good care of him for me.

806
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:14,925
Feel free to come by as often as you like.

807
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:17,928
Next time, I'll bring some good food with me.

808
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:19,095
Thanks for everything today.

809
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:21,164
Gosh, no problem. I didn't even do anything special.

810
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:24,000
Then... Cheers, everyone.

811
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:30,740
Isn't that your second one?

812
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,712
I guess you can drink more now.

813
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:37,714
Yes.

814
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:39,683
Mi Rae, are you really all right?

815
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,551
Yes, I'm totally fine.

816
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:44,821
By the way, please feel free to speak casually to me, Ms. Na.

817
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:46,690
I'm Kyung Seok's friend, you know.

818
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:50,894
- Can I? - Of course.

819
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:53,863
I'm happy because you two seem close.

820
00:55:55,098 --> 00:55:56,399
Do we?

821
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:02,305
Are you seeing anyone at the moment?

822
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,575
- No, I'm not. - Do you have a crush on anyone?

823
00:56:10,046 --> 00:56:11,781
He probably does.

824
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:14,150
Really?

825
00:56:15,518 --> 00:56:17,954
- Who is it? - What are you talking about?

826
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:19,155
Who is this girl?

827
00:56:19,155 --> 00:56:20,724
Is she in first year too? Or is she older?

828
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,258
I never said I have a crush on anyone.

829
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:24,294
But you're not denying it either.

830
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:30,600
- I don't have a crush. - I guess you can't lie.

831
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,969
You couldn't lie at all even when you were a kid.

832
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:35,839
Think whatever you want.

833
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:44,180
Why did you down it like that?

834
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:49,019
Ms. Na must be the happiest person at this moment.

835
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:53,123
Actually, it might be Kyung Seok as well.

836
00:56:57,093 --> 00:56:58,428
What are you...

837
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:00,764
doing here?

838
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:02,465
You're all grown up now.

839
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:06,436
Even until just a little while ago,

840
00:57:07,437 --> 00:57:11,775
they probably couldn't even imagine chatting with each other like this.

841
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:15,478
We all change,

842
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,914
and so do our relationships.

843
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:28,692
And I had no idea...

844
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:33,830
that I'd meet the person, who saved my life when I was younger,

845
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:36,633
again like this.

846
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:39,836
It has nothing to do with you.

847
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:43,873
I also didn't know that I'd be...

848
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:46,643
able to call the handsome guy, Do Kyung Seok, my friend.

849
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:49,546
I guess I'm no longer an outcast. I have a friend now.

850
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:51,081
What?

851
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:53,316
You're my friend.

852
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:56,519
No matter how insignificant the change is,

853
00:57:57,053 --> 00:57:59,856
and although we can't even imagine its consequences at this moment...

854
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:03,059
- You two look so much alike. - You think so?

855
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:06,596
If it's a heartwarming change like this, it'll be so nice.

856
00:58:09,032 --> 00:58:11,868
Others' happiness can give me this much joy.

857
00:58:12,936 --> 00:58:14,504
I felt it for the very first time.

858
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,245
Mi Rae.

859
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:23,413
- Mi Rae. - Mi Rae.

860
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,614
What should we do?

861
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:25,949
- Mi Rae. - Mi Rae.

862
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:27,250
Gosh.

863
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:31,521
I'm all right. I'm really okay.

864
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:34,124
I should take her home. Let me carry her.

865
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:35,825
No, it's okay. I'll carry her.

866
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:37,894
I'm really okay.

867
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:40,430
- I'll do it. Put her on my back. - No, I'll carry her.

868
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,398
- Gosh. - I'm really all right.

869
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:44,534
Kyung Seok, you should carry her.

870
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:46,002
Woo Young, help me.

871
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:47,871
- Oh, okay. - Mi Rae, I'll help you up.

872
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,573
- I'm okay though. - There.

873
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:55,111
Don't worry. I'll make sure she gets home safely.

874
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:56,446
Okay.

875
00:58:58,515 --> 00:58:59,983
Mi Rae, are you all right?

876
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,317
Oh, boy.

877
00:59:01,985 --> 00:59:03,653
Yes, I'm fine.

878
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:04,821
She's not fine at all.

879
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:06,823
- Woo Young, I'll get going. - Okay, get home safely.

880
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:08,758
- Make sure she gets home safely. - Bye.

881
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:10,827
Be careful.

882
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:13,530
Get home safely. Hey, be careful.

883
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:18,701
What's wrong? What happened to her?

884
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:20,870
She passed out after three shots of soju.

885
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:22,438
What?

886
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,775
Hello.

887
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:28,478
Aren't you her friend she brought to the event?

888
00:59:28,478 --> 00:59:30,580
- Yes, I am. - Where's her bed?

889
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:32,115
Here, this one.

890
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:35,919
What happened?

891
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:37,720
Be careful.

892
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:40,890
She'll be okay, right?

893
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:45,395
Of course, she'll be fine. Thank you so much.

894
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:50,400
- I'll see you around. - Oh, thank you.

895
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:55,071
Bye.

896
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,150
- Get home safely. - I will.

897
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,252
I'm so happy for them.

898
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,355
What a relief.

899
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:20,830
You could've moved into my place.

900
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:24,901
I guess...

901
01:00:25,668 --> 01:00:28,338
you'll be uncomfortable as we've been living separately for too long.

902
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:33,243
It's not that.

903
01:00:35,478 --> 01:00:37,380
I wanted to try living independently.

904
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:41,551
Shall I give you some spending money?

905
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:45,655
No, it's okay.

906
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:53,162
Buy a hangover recovery drink for Mi Rae tomorrow morning with this.

907
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:56,833
I don't have any change.

908
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:58,735
Take it.

909
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:17,320
Can I give you a hug?

910
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:23,326
Yes.

911
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:04,634
You should come over sometime.

912
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:06,703
Okay.

913
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:57,820
Hello.

914
01:02:58,554 --> 01:03:00,990
- I'd like a transit pass, please. - Sure.

915
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,700
(No More Hangovers)

916
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:12,068
I'd like this too.

917
01:03:12,468 --> 01:03:13,770
Sure.

918
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,227
Are you up?

919
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:41,130
Do you remember anything?

920
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:43,433
About what?

921
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:45,601
Do Kyung Seok carried you home on his back.

922
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,004
What?

923
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:49,772
Ms. Na came too.

924
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:54,877
They met up to reconcile after being estranged for years.

925
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:57,447
Why did you have to tag along and ruin it all?

926
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:58,815
What happened?

927
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:01,150
I don't know.

928
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:04,787
I have class, so I have to leave now.

929
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:08,424
I made hangover soup for you. Make sure you have some.

930
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:18,000
Gosh, I should've stopped after my second shot.

931
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:37,220
Hi.

932
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,159
(No More Hangovers)

933
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:45,094
I'm fine.

934
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:48,631
You can't be fine. Isn't three shots of soju your drinking limit?

935
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:57,473
You should take it.

936
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,469
Is your stomach okay?

937
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:31,507
Yes, I think I feel better now.

938
01:05:34,243 --> 01:05:37,413
Don't worry. You didn't make any drunken mistakes.

939
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:41,150
What are you talking about? I heard you carried me home.

940
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,451
What about it?

941
01:05:42,552 --> 01:05:45,087
I'm sorry for the trouble.

942
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:49,825
Don't ever drink more than three shots when I'm not around.

943
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:51,994
What?

944
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:56,165
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

945
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:25,962
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

946
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:27,463
Are you her boyfriend?

947
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:28,464
- Yes. - No.

948
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:30,833
Why is he being like this? He's leading me on.

949
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,169
Oh, I see Mi Rae and Woo Young over there.

950
01:06:33,169 --> 01:06:34,670
You're the prettiest girl in our department.

951
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,472
Don't you want a boyfriend?

952
01:06:36,472 --> 01:06:37,907
I can be there for an interview today.

953
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:39,242
Are they hiring for another position?

954
01:06:39,242 --> 01:06:41,944
Are you doing a facial mask for your shift tomorrow?

955
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:43,446
Do you and Mi Rae work together?

956
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:45,381
- Have you ever cried tears of joy? - What?

957
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:47,116
I'm not sure if it's enough to make me cry,

958
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:48,584
but I'm happy that we met again like this.

959
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:51,120
Do they need another part-timer by any chance?

960
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,155
I like Kyung Seok.
