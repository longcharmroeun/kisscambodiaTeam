1
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:13,435
Take it easy. Have a good day.

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,135
Take it easy.

3
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:18,505
Take it easy.

4
00:00:21,658 --> 00:00:23,975
Why did they send you of all people?

5
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:25,475
- A little higher. - Is this good?

6
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:26,520
Pull it up a little higher.

7
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:27,915
(Fun Times with Chemistry)

8
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,085
This is the department of chemistry.

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,130
This is the department of chemistry. Come visit us!

10
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:33,570
Come visit us!

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,185
We've prepared many fun things.

12
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,255
Everyone, come visit us!

13
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:39,270
We'll have food too.

14
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,070
Hey, what's taking the girls so long?

15
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:44,635
- They're getting changed. - Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,775
I wish I was born as a pretty girl so that I could take orders only.

17
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,785
That's the uniform?

18
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:10,955
- I don't like it. - Me neither.

19
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,170
You said you picked the design with them.

20
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,670
Well, Jung Yeob and Jung Ho...

21
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,995
said this design is nice, so I just went along with it.

22
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:21,335
The skirt looked a bit longer on the photo.

23
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:25,435
What do you think? Will you be okay in this uniform?

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,875
I'm a bit...

25
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,275
You don't like it?

26
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,820
Let's not wear this if Mi Rae doesn't want to.

27
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,290
Why are you putting it on me?

28
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:36,015
Are we allowed to not wear this uniform?

29
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,215
What are you doing? We'll have customers soon.

30
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:41,630
Our bar will be packed.

31
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,970
You girls look exactly as how I imagined.

32
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:46,255
None of us imagined this.

33
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:49,425
Is it a bit too short?

34
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,765
What are you talking about? I've seen many girls in skirts like this.

35
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:55,910
What should we do?

36
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,705
Come on, you all look great in it.

37
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:58,920
Girls, stand right there.

38
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:02,945
I'll take a nice photo of you to remember this moment.

39
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:04,320
- Strike a pose. - We'll have customers...

40
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,020
Come on, hurry up. Strike a pose.

41
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,260
All right, 1, 2. Smile, please.

42
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,690
1, 2.

43
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,285
You all look gorgeous. All right, one more time.

44
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:13,855
1, 2.

45
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:19,125
Oh, the chemistry department? I'll definitely come by.

46
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:21,695
I wonder which bar has the hottest guys.

47
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:24,280
We'd like a pancake and a serving of assorted skewers.

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,840
- A pancake and assorted skewers? - Yes.

49
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,480
- Sure, no problem. - We need some water here.

50
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,365
Sure. Just a moment, please.

51
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:32,280
- Is there anything else you need? - No, we're good.

52
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:34,375
- Okay. Your food will be out soon. - Thank you.

53
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,190
- Excuse me. We'd like a pancake. - Oh, my.

54
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:39,190
- She's so pretty. - Sure, I'll bring it over shortly.

55
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:42,315
Hey, we already ordered a pancake just a minute ago.

56
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,960
- Gosh, another pancake. - To tell you the truth...

57
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,900
I was going to tell you. Gosh.

58
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:50,500
- Actually, this was the reason. - Gosh, seriously.

59
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,770
- Because of this? - You always...

60
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:55,325
It looks like Jung Boon has many guy friends.

61
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:57,810
She knows a lot of people.

62
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:59,965
I heard she knows everyone from her school.

63
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,205
- Oh, boy. - Why do you even live?

64
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:10,815
I've never had a guy friend in my life.

65
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:15,530
Excuse me, where can we sit?

66
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:16,945
Oh, this way...

67
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,825
Hey, Kang Orc.

68
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:26,155
I'm calling you, Kang Orc.

69
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:29,325
You don't even know your nickname?

70
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,695
You're lying, right?

71
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:32,565
Tell me that it's a lie. Right now.

72
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,810
- Yong Chul. - Kang Orc.

73
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:37,135
I'll kill you if you tell people that you have a crush on me.

74
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:38,975
You'd better not tell anyone.

75
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:41,975
I didn't think...

76
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:44,775
I'd see him ever again.

77
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,715
- Hey, you made it. - Yes, hi.

78
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,530
- Is he your friend? - Yes, my new friend.

79
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,455
We met through social media.

80
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,795
This is the pretty friend I mentioned. You saw her in my photo.

81
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,810
These are Park Yong Chul and his friends.

82
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,505
These are Kang Mi Rae and Lee Ji Hyo.

83
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,605
Hi, nice to meet you.

84
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:16,575
It's nice to meet you guys. I should get back to work.

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,575
Kang Mi Rae?

86
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:20,960
What's wrong?

87
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:22,845
I know someone with the same name.

88
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,155
Really? A friend of yours?

89
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:26,815
My middle school alumna.

90
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,725
- Have a seat here. - Let's sit.

91
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:37,565
All right.

92
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:51,990
Did you call the police?

93
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,015
I did, as I was firing her.

94
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,745
I feel so bad for the way I treated Jung Boon. What should I do?

95
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,030
You should apologize to her.

96
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:01,600
What I'm saying is, I feel so bad that I can't even apologize.

97
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:03,725
Then apologize and tell her how terrible you feel.

98
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,395
Let's go.

99
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,095
Go where?

100
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,365
My department's bar. Jung Boon should be there.

101
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,765
Will you be with me when I apologize to her?

102
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:15,965
- Are you a kid? - Gosh.

103
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,405
What are you doing? Let's go.

104
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:22,305
So which school do you go to?

105
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,875
I'm studying psychology at Hankook University.

106
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:29,145
The psychology department at Hankook University?

107
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,060
Your grades must've been very high.

108
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,585
Gosh, no.

109
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:36,085
By the way, why didn't you choose the department of practical music?

110
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:40,470
I'm a huge fan of Tiger JK.

111
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:43,070
I saw him on a TV show a while back,

112
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,980
and he said he recommends choosing...

113
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,665
something else for your major if you want to become a rapper.

114
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,935
- Hey. - Hey, Tiger JK.

115
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,905
What's up, man?

116
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:56,205
- Hello. - What's up?

117
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,790
Hey, man. How are you doing?

118
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:00,245
Tiger JK, she's a huge fan of yours.

119
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:01,990
- Hello. - Hello.

120
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,885
Hey, peace. Peace.

121
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:07,530
She's a university student, but she wants to be a rapper.

122
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,470
I asked her to come by to show us what she can do.

123
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:12,325
Okay, then could you show us? Don't be nervous.

124
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:13,965
Sure.

125
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,765
- Do it. - Do it.

126
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,350
Are you ready?

127
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,350
- Yes. - I'll drop the beat.

128
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:24,735
Okay.

129
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:36,360
I wear mismatching shoes

130
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,130
And I start running backwards

131
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:40,160
People tell me I'm imperfect

132
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,370
But no, I'm perfect

133
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:45,125
I have my own way of survival

134
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:49,295
A life that's lacking is imperfect

135
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:55,410
It's okay. Don't feel discouraged. Let's hear it one more time.

137
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:59,180
Okay, I'm sorry. I should've practiced a bit more.

138
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,450
I'll try one more time.

139
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,775
- One more time. Let's go. - Let's go.

140
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:06,845
Here's the beat.

141
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,395
Oh, come on.

142
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,635
Jung Boon, can we talk for a minute?

143
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,280
Do you know him?

144
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,990
- Who is he? - Who is he?

145
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,050
- Is there something wrong? - No, it's nothing.

146
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,620
No, I'll be right back.

147
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:38,790
- Don't take too long. - See you later.

148
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:39,820
Excuse me.

149
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,090
Let's drink.

150
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:43,060
- Cheers. - He's out of alcohol.

151
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,855
Pour him a drink.

152
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,485
You're better-looking.

153
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:51,455
Tae Young, I have something to tell you.

154
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:55,025
- What is it? - I'm not feeling so well.

155
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,480
Can I take a short break?

156
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,265
Do you feel sick?

157
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:01,750
I'm just a little tired.

158
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,165
Oh, really?

159
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,905
If you leave, someone will have to take your place.

160
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,205
I'll do it.

161
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,790
Kyung Seok? I thought you didn't want to wait tables.

162
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,385
I'll take your place.

163
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,870
(Episode 6: The handsome guy's counterattack, Part 2)

164
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:24,225
I thought you wouldn't come, but I guess you're loyal after all.

165
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:27,765
Kyung Seok said he wasn't going to come, but he did.

166
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,270
You said you didn't want to wait tables.

167
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,480
Are you here as a customer?

168
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,750
No, I'm here to wait tables.

169
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,235
I'm glad you're here.

170
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:38,305
How nice of you.

171
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,845
- Let's go. - It smells here.

172
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,290
- What's in here? - Are there green onions in here?

173
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,615
Green onions?

174
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:55,155
What if Yong Chul recognizes Kyung Seok?

175
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,525
Is he in your major?

176
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,740
Who? Kyung Seok?

177
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:06,140
He used to go to my middle school.

178
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,510
Really?

179
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:09,665
That means you went to the same school as Mi Rae as well.

180
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,050
Oh, she's talking about the pretty girl you saw earlier.

181
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,875
Mi Rae and Kyung Seok are from the same middle school.

182
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:29,955
Do you feel sick?

183
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,425
No, I'm just tired.

184
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,995
Thank you. I'm going to go take some rest.

185
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,635
Mi Rae.

186
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,750
Just a second.

187
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,705
What? Why?

188
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,175
Kyung Seok.

189
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:50,860
Can you help me carry this? It's so heavy.

190
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,460
Hey, I'll carry it for you. You should've asked me for help.

191
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,845
Kyung Seok.

192
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,815
Hello. Do you need anything?

193
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,470
Since when were you friends with Jung Boon?

194
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,025
He's so manly.

195
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:12,565
Mi Rae, Yong Chul apparently went to the same school as you.

196
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:20,305
Are you Kang Mi Rae from Jaryong Middle School?

197
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:25,490
Yes.

198
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,645
I'm Park Yong Chul. You remember me, right?

199
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,415
Yes.

200
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,960
So you guys do know each other.

201
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:34,485
This is so cool.

202
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,270
What a joke.

203
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,400
Why?

204
00:10:39,408 --> 00:10:41,295
What? No, it's nothing.

205
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,180
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:51,380
You took that thief's side and treated me like a liar.

207
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:54,520
To be honest, I don't really know you that well.

208
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:57,345
Then how well did you know her?

209
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,290
I'm really naive, so I'm not good at making the right judgments.

210
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:03,315
I couldn't see what a brat she was. Meanwhile, you're so nice and...

211
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,870
Gosh, I'm such a stupid jerk.

212
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,725
I'm the one to blame. I shouldn't have done that.

213
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,610
You just laughed, didn't you?

214
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:17,295
I think I saw you laugh.

215
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:23,435
Thank you so much.

216
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,475
And I'm sorry.

217
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:28,050
People can make mistakes.

218
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:29,650
Does that mean you forgive me?

219
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:32,220
Well, you keep apologizing,

220
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:33,875
so I should forgive you.

221
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:38,260
My gosh, I seriously had trouble breathing earlier.

222
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,355
I can finally breathe now.

223
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:42,085
Thank you.

224
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:43,885
And I'm sorry.

225
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,990
You guys must be really glad to see each other.

226
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:06,760
What a small world.

227
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:10,245
I should've been nicer to you if I knew you'd become so pretty.

228
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:12,455
My gosh.

229
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:14,530
Are you guys not going to wait tables?

230
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:17,600
Just give us a minute. They're from the same school.

231
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:21,095
That's so cool. How amazing.

232
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,935
I hope you guys all have a great time.

233
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:30,135
I hope you guys have fun.

234
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,335
Do you still hate me?

235
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:34,945
Kyung Seok.

236
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,975
I heard he went to the same middle school as you.

237
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:42,860
Did you do something wrong?

238
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:46,515
I can already guess what happened. He must've liked her one-sidedly.

239
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:49,655
It was actually the opposite. She's the one that liked me.

240
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:53,740
Have you gone mad?

241
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:56,125
I'm serious. She even told me that she liked me.

242
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,935
Didn't you?

243
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,610
You should go now.

244
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:05,180
How can you tell me to leave? I'm a customer.

245
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:06,180
Just leave.

246
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,375
What's wrong? I'm really glad to meet...

247
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:11,590
- Kang Orc again. - Hey.

248
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:13,775
- She's the orc? - She's the orc?

249
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,330
She's the orc I told you about.

250
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:22,685
Hey!

251
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,500
You should go now.

252
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:29,140
How can you tell me go leave? I'm a customer.

253
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,140
Just leave.

254
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,265
What's wrong? I'm really glad to meet...

255
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,580
- Kang Orc again. - Hey.

256
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,805
- She's the orc? - She's the orc?

257
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,360
She's the orc I told you about.

258
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,745
Hey!

259
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:56,870
Follow me.

260
00:13:56,872 --> 00:14:00,595
I just wanted to talk about the good old days. Are you upset?

261
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,510
- Yong Chul. - I said, follow me.

262
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:08,405
How scary. Hey, Mi Rae.

263
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:11,475
Do you think you're all that now that you've become pretty?

264
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:18,915
Yes.

265
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,185
After I changed, I could finally see...

266
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,515
that people like you were worthless jerks.

267
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,155
What?

268
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,525
You didn't change at all.

269
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,925
You look down on people based on their looks...

270
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,895
and harass them.

271
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,365
You better remember this every time you remember the name "Kang Orc".

272
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:47,235
To me, you were just...

273
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:49,375
a piece of trash.

274
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,245
What did you say?

275
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,795
Hey, you totally ruined the mood.

276
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:12,265
Hey, wait.

277
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,365
Hey, scumbag.

278
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:20,375
- What? - Scumbag.

279
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,405
Pay for your food.

280
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:27,645
Goodness.

281
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:32,485
Soo A, I'll call you again later.

282
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,025
How could you do that to your old friend?

283
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,115
It was a failure.

284
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:02,215
What's wrong with your voice by the way?

285
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:04,655
What?

286
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,415
Who? Park Yong Chul?

287
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:10,355
Why did he come all of a sudden?

288
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:14,225
How many surgeries did she do that he didn't even recognize her?

289
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,265
Didn't Kyung Seok recognize her?

290
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,910
No, come to think,

291
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,980
Kyung Seok didn't recognize her at first either.

292
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:24,035
So nothing on her face is original?

293
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:27,435
Her face must've changed because she got plastic surgeries.

294
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,745
Did Mi Rae not recognize Yong Chul either?

295
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,745
Or did she act like she didn't know?

296
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,915
Anyway, it's the worst nickname I've ever heard of.

297
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:38,985
How could he call her that?

298
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,895
She's the orc I told you about.

299
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,925
Do you think you're all that now that you've become pretty?

300
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:54,095
My face may change,

301
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,910
but my past never changes.

302
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,305
Mi Rae.

303
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:14,725
I shouldn't have invited the people I barely knew.

304
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:20,155
They came to see me at the cafe I work at,

305
00:17:20,843 --> 00:17:23,165
so I only told them to come visit during the festival.

306
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,465
I didn't know he was such a jerk.

307
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,265
Sorry.

308
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,475
It's not your fault.

309
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,980
No, I'm really sorry.

310
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:37,475
This wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for me.

311
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:42,085
It's okay. Don't mind it.

312
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,445
I want to mind it.

313
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,325
I want to be better to you.

314
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,025
You see,

315
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,665
I actually had a prejudice...

316
00:17:58,147 --> 00:17:59,765
about plastic surgeries.

317
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,135
I wondered if they wanted to become prettier than others that much.

318
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:06,735
I thought it was too phony.

319
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,445
But I realized...

320
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,445
that some people could be desperate for it.

321
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,285
That some people might be in pain because of their faces.

322
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,665
Do you think you can go back and wait the tables?

323
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:33,235
I'll tell Tae Young if you think you can't.

324
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:46,690
I can't see Soo A anymore because of you, punk.

325
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:47,930
Why can't we?

326
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,485
We can see her without him.

327
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,585
Guys, where's your loyalty?

328
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,985
Hey, Park Yong Chul.

329
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:00,340
You remember me?

330
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:02,295
I'm Oh Hyun Jung, Mi Rae's friend.

331
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:04,525
So what?

332
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:08,010
I just can't understand why you showed up here.

333
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,050
You bullied her enough in middle school already.

334
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,480
I had no idea.

335
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,205
I only came because Soo A invited me.

336
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:17,520
Why would she invite someone like you here?

337
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:20,715
Hey, she asked me to be friends first.

338
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:23,245
She visited my Instagram account and liked my pictures first.

339
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,955
You saw it too, right?

340
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,355
Hold on.

341
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:30,985
See?

342
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:36,765
(Comments)

343
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:43,980
So she left?

344
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:47,475
I told her to go and that I'd explain to you.

345
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,805
It can't be helped then.

346
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:52,690
But I have to go work part-time now too.

347
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,115
Really?

348
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,945
Can you walk around the school to promote our bar before you go?

349
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,930
Okay, thank you.

350
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,470
- Thanks. - Tae Young.

351
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,070
I think I have to go too.

352
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,695
Who's going to wait the tables then?

353
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,870
I mean, think about it.

354
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,965
Waiting the tables should be done by the girls.

355
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:14,765
Park Yong Chul, that guy, is really weird.

356
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:18,275
How could he say such a thing to a friend from middle school?

357
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,150
It's upsetting.

358
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,520
(Come visit the chemistry department bar.)

359
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:24,045
You brought him here.

360
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,415
I didn't know he'd be like that.

361
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:33,115
Who on earth came up with that nickname?

362
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:35,455
How could they do that to a girl?

363
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:39,295
She wouldn't have been that ugly, you know.

364
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:42,225
She was cute.

365
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,105
Mi Rae was cute.

366
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,255
I actually had a prejudice...

367
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:08,325
about plastic surgeries.

368
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,125
But I realized...

369
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,125
that some people could be desperate for it.

370
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:18,565
That some people might be in pain because of their faces.

371
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:28,745
(Ms. Na Hye Sung)

372
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:35,385
Hello, ma'am.

373
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:37,745
I got the candles.

374
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,960
My employees said...

375
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,055
its scent was amazing.

376
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:45,655
What are you doing right now by any chance?

377
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,395
I have time right now.

378
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,625
No, not in front of the school.

379
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,835
I'll go to your company.

380
00:21:56,218 --> 00:22:00,475
Good. Then I'll go to your house.

381
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:03,705
Okay.

382
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:17,355
- Did Ye Na leave? - She left for her appointment.

383
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,170
The okay-looking girl left.

384
00:22:20,175 --> 00:22:22,470
Make the boys do the job if you're short on labor.

385
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:23,670
Girls should wait the tables.

386
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,510
No one will come if guys are the servers.

387
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:27,080
This number of people should be good enough.

388
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:28,180
It's almost over too.

389
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:31,520
Not every girl can be considered woman just because of their gender.

390
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
It would've been so nice...

391
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:35,205
if you guys prepared for a situation like this by doing as I said.

392
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:39,415
Even if we put the uniform aside, your looks aren't qualified.

393
00:22:41,163 --> 00:22:42,260
What did you just say?

394
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:45,500
You first have to grow your hair to look like a girl, Yoon Byul.

395
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,555
Didn't I tell you to lose weight?

396
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:48,800
And you should smile a bit.

397
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:51,340
Girls should be equipped with amiable smiles.

398
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,070
Who are you to order me around?

399
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,725
Don't talk back, freshman.

400
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,210
I quit.

401
00:22:58,213 --> 00:22:59,910
Make food like you've been doing.

402
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:01,210
I won't do that either.

403
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,850
I won't do anything, so don't look for me.

404
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:04,405
Where are you going?

405
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:08,345
Why do I have to do this even after hearing such ridiculous gibberish?

406
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:11,815
I can't take your stupid remarks anymore.

407
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,215
Do you think we never criticize you because we can't?

408
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:16,845
I simply didn't want to stoop as low as you.

409
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:19,385
- Ugly punks. - What?

410
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,355
- Let's go. - Guys.

411
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:24,530
- What's wrong? - They've suddenly become sensitive.

412
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,695
They're getting mad at our jokes.

413
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,025
Did we ever tell you that you're ugly?

414
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,810
I only gave you suggestions, so what's wrong with that?

415
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:34,165
Stop it already. We don't want to hear your suggestions.

416
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:36,705
What's with you, Tae Hee?

417
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:39,505
What does it mean that I'll look pretty when I lose weight?

418
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:41,705
Are you saying that I'm a loser this way?

419
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,350
You tell us to do plastic surgeries, grow hair,

420
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,215
change fashion style, and lose weight.

421
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,160
Should we get back at you just the same way?

422
00:23:47,162 --> 00:23:48,490
I know you'll make all the fuss then.

423
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:51,700
Tae Hee, how could you twist his good intention like that?

424
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,760
He only meant your face looks cute and pretty.

425
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,030
I don't even want to hear that.

426
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,655
I didn't ask you to say that I'm pretty.

427
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,800
You think we're products displayed in a showroom?

428
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:00,855
You judge us by our looks.

429
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,770
Keep such thoughts to yourselves.

430
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,535
How dare you say that bluntly to us?

431
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:08,780
I'm out too.

432
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:10,705
I told you to stay put, freshman.

433
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,905
Does being a freshman mean that I have to do everything I'm told?

434
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,145
Who are you to order us around?

435
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,645
Let's stop and go.

436
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:21,445
Hey. Goodness.

437
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,315
Hey.

438
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:27,400
I told them out of concern,

439
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:29,470
and how could they behave this way to their senior?

440
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,440
- Stop it. - Think about their attitude.

441
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,795
That's enough.

442
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,825
Where are you going?

443
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:51,045
I'm sorry.

444
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,915
I should've scolded them for their rude behavior earlier.

445
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:57,585
I let it slide because things were hectic with the festival.

446
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,985
Sorry.

447
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,840
Please don't be upset.

448
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:07,995
You know what's more irritating?

449
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:13,365
I keep trying to fit myself in their standards unconsciously.

450
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,710
I always tell myself to lose weight.

451
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,305
You don't need to lose any weight.

452
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:20,250
They're doing that because they like seeing you all riled up.

453
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,945
Seeing you flustered amuses them.

454
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:26,575
Besides, I don't like girls who are too skinny.

455
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,160
There are many men who are like me.

456
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:33,785
Guys like me find cute, chubby girls like you attractive.

457
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:42,095
Well, I'm not just talking about looks.

458
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:45,435
The way you talk and do things too. You're cute in many ways...

459
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:48,365
Anyway, you don't need to change.

460
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:51,065
So don't let it stress you out.

461
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:57,275
Do you feel better now?

462
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,775
I'll be off, then.

463
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:40,885
Where are you?

464
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,540
I've always wanted to sit here and eat ice cream,

465
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:49,010
but doing that alone would look a bit weird, you know.

466
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,625
I mean, this isn't coffee.

467
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:52,065
Right.

468
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,935
The favor I asked you must've stressed you out.

469
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:00,005
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:01,975
No, it's okay.

471
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:04,550
I really wanted to do it for you,

472
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,290
but I don't think I can persuade Kyung Seok.

473
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:10,245
Is everything well with him?

474
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:14,155
Yes, I think so.

475
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:17,025
Are you two close?

476
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:19,395
Yes, I guess...

477
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,425
we are pretty close.

478
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,710
We went to the same middle school too.

479
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:25,165
Really?

480
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:29,005
Which one? He transferred schools during his middle school years.

481
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:31,905
Jaryong Middle School.

482
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:35,805
Then the two of you have known each other since then.

483
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:40,315
We did know of each other,

484
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,745
but we weren't close back then.

485
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:48,630
How was he in middle school?

486
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,685
He was very popular.

487
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:52,725
Was he?

488
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,465
He's very handsome, you know.

489
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:59,465
I guess I'm not the only person who thinks that.

490
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,780
I saw him once from afar...

491
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:05,505
back when he was in middle school.

492
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:08,375
Only once...

493
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,005
for a brief moment.

494
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:13,815
I could see how much he had grown.

495
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:16,185
And he's all grown up now.

496
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:25,025
I actually met you when I was in middle school.

497
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:27,695
Me?

498
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:29,495
Yes.

499
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,125
When?

500
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,565
You may not remember it though.

501
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:41,505
Even if you remember me from that day, you won't recognize my face.

502
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,645
I had plastic surgery.

503
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:49,585
I got everything done.

504
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:55,955
By the way, where did we meet?

505
00:28:57,572 --> 00:29:00,695
That day, I was so upset.

506
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:07,535
To tell you the truth, I had a tough time growing up...

507
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,735
because of my face.

508
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,275
Even I thought...

509
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:17,645
that no one could be uglier than me.

510
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:21,545
Even I thought that I looked like a monster.

511
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,145
Hey.

512
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:54,545
Are you stressed out about something?

513
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:56,945
My classmates...

514
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:00,055
say that I'm too ugly.

515
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,095
They call me an orc.

516
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,525
They say that my face is worse than garbage.

517
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:46,595
That must be so hard.

518
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:55,875
No matter what anyone says,

519
00:30:56,691 --> 00:31:00,615
you are the most precious person to yourself.

520
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,715
That's when I learned...

521
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:10,285
that kind words and nice scents...

522
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:12,495
can even save someone's life.

523
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,065
I remember.

524
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,580
You were that girl.

525
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,135
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

526
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:24,805
You said you started to like perfume because of the intangible beauty,

527
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,935
but my face is...

528
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:32,175
You've become much prettier.

529
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:38,115
Are things better now?

530
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,855
Are you okay?

531
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:46,725
I thought I'd be okay,

532
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,525
but anyone can tell that I had plastic surgery, so...

533
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:56,210
Why do you say that? You look very pretty now.

534
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,735
You are beautiful.

535
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,905
It's embarrassing to hear that from such a gorgeous lady like you.

536
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,945
You see,

537
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,585
I think my life could've been much easier...

538
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:19,355
had I been born less pretty.

539
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,865
Did that sound obnoxious?

540
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:30,565
No, not at all. I'm just not following.

541
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,805
I liked it when I was young...

542
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:37,975
because everyone said I looked pretty.

543
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:41,290
- That's Na Hye Sung. Look. - Isn't she so pretty?

544
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,960
- So what? Even if she asks me out, - The prettiest girl in our school.

545
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,460
- I won't date her. - Not just in our school.

546
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,560
Hey, she's the prettiest girl in our town.

547
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:48,730
Why are you so pretty?

548
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:50,570
My gosh, she's really stunning.

549
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:51,700
I know. I want to be pretty too.

550
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,800
Girls envying me...

551
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,810
and guys being nice to me...

552
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,165
were just something I was used to in my day-to-day life.

553
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,195
There's this saying, you know.

554
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:04,635
"A beautiful woman is like someone who passed the bar exam."

555
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:09,245
Beauty certainly gives women power.

556
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:11,405
People respect you wherever you go.

557
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,415
Hye Sung.

558
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:21,555
And that's why I thought the world would be my oyster.

559
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,525
I was confident that I'd succeed in both my career and love.

560
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,725
Ms. Na,

561
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,165
do you have a boyfriend?

562
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:32,540
She must have many.

563
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:35,080
Guys are lining up to get a date with her.

564
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,510
I know a very competent young man.

565
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:40,275
He's from a great family as well. What do you say?

566
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:47,920
My husband looked best on paper out of all the guys I had dated,

567
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:49,645
and his family was rich and powerful.

568
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:53,085
My parents were fond of him as well.

569
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,985
If women are flowers,

570
00:33:57,071 --> 00:34:00,155
you are the most beautiful flower...

571
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,625
I've ever seen.

572
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,565
"A beautiful flower".

573
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,305
Back then,

574
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:13,405
I had no idea that those words would end up shackling me down.

575
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:21,545
So did you...

576
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,515
have to quit your job back then?

577
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,385
Yes, I did.

578
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:32,155
It was very hard for me to get to where I am now.

579
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,625
I see.

580
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:37,710
It was my fault too.

581
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:41,795
When people complimented my looks, I thought they respected me.

582
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,935
I thought that I should be...

583
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:47,435
able to have my way with any man.

584
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,445
I was foolish.

585
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:58,545
So you should try to date many guys.

586
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,785
And choose your husband wisely.

587
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,685
Got it?

588
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,225
Yes.

589
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:12,325
Jung Yeob, give us some sausages.

590
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,495
Hang on a moment.

591
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:17,865
What did you say to make the girls all leave?

592
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:20,775
Are you seriously asking me that right now?

593
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:26,260
Tae Young, how are we going to handle everything tomorrow...

594
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,615
without the girls?

595
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,185
We'll just have to do it by ourselves.

596
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,885
Soo A. Ji Hyo. Did the guys text you?

597
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:38,840
They asked if I could make it tomorrow,

598
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,795
but I'm not available.

599
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:42,525
Me neither.

600
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:45,325
We should let them handle everything on their own.

601
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,835
But that's not enough to get rid of my anger.

602
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,505
Should we take revenge?

603
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,850
Yes, let's do that.

604
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:52,305
How?

605
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:04,160
Hey, why did you come home so late? Did you go somewhere?

606
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:06,055
- Yes. - Look at this.

607
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:08,770
What is it? Did you take a photo with that rapper?

608
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,855
No, that's not what I'm about to show you. It's something important.

609
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:15,965
Soo A commented on Yong Chul's social media page.

610
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,325
Do you see the time?

611
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,365
And Yong Chul replied on Soo A's social media page...

612
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,405
two hours later.

613
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:27,575
That means Soo A contacted Yong Chul first.

614
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:33,875
Look. Yong Chul wrote which schools he graduated from on his profile.

615
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:35,545
Isn't something weird?

616
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:42,585
Do you think Soo A did this on purpose to harass you?

617
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:47,295
Come on. That's absurd.

618
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:10,860
(Comments)

619
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,855
(You look great.)

620
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:19,525
(Mom)

621
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:24,670
Hey, Mom.

622
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,810
I'm going to head to your place to give you some side dishes.

623
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:28,465
You can go to school.

624
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:31,880
You don't have class?

625
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:34,475
Then I'll get to see you today.

626
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,405
Mi Rae's staying at home today.

627
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,490
Dad's going to go with me.

628
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:42,615
I can't carry all these side dishes by myself.

629
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:50,970
Welcome.

630
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:53,400
We already have so much food. Why are you trying to buy more?

631
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:56,225
We never got cake for Mi Rae after she got into college.

632
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,565
Come here and help me pick a cake.

633
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:07,675
I want this one. The pretty one right here.

634
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:09,575
No.

635
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:12,205
We'll take the biggest one here.

636
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,485
I told you we should drive here.

637
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,355
Take a look around. There's nowhere to park here.

638
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,955
It's just so heavy. That's all.

639
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,535
Should I help you carry that?

640
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,165
No, it's okay.

641
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,865
I'll carry them for you. Where are you headed?

642
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,835
We're going over there.

643
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,805
Over there?

644
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,345
- My gosh. - Oh, it's heavy.

645
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:52,685
- Over there? - Yes. Thank you.

646
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,085
Thanks.

647
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,385
Come on.

648
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:03,925
It's right there.

649
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:05,865
Oh, okay.

650
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:09,550
Wait here. I'll get you something to drink.

651
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,565
No, it's okay. You should go inside.

652
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:14,705
- My gosh. - Thank you.

653
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:16,545
- Thank you. - No problem.

654
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:21,045
My gosh, he's good-looking and nice at the same time.

655
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,890
I hope we get a son-in-law like him.

656
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,085
Gosh, let's go inside. I'm so tired.

657
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,695
You brought a lot more side dishes than I thought you would.

658
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:36,195
Ms. Na, it feels like Thanksgiving.

659
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:39,910
We should've taken you guys to a nice restaurant.

660
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:43,365
It's our first meal together after Mi Rae got into college.

661
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:46,580
Hurry up and eat. The kids must be starving.

662
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,135
Okay.

663
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:50,805
You're the one who decided to buy the biggest cake.

664
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,245
Thank you, Dad.

665
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:58,985
Yes, don't mention it.

666
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,060
Hyun Jung, you must be hungry.

667
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,885
- Hyun Jung, let's blow the candle. - Okay.

668
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,195
Please let these girls have a great time in college.

669
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:10,125
1, 2, 3.

670
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:16,105
Thank you.

671
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:18,335
Let's eat.

672
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:21,835
Wait.

673
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,220
You guys didn't get to take a photo at the entrance ceremony,

674
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:25,860
so you should take one today.

675
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,415
You're right.

676
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:29,030
If I had a son,

677
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,630
I would've made you become my daughter-in-law.

678
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,415
- Really? - Yes.

679
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,030
Go sit over there.

680
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:35,970
Everyone, gather together.

681
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,385
Come here.

682
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:38,670
I think...

683
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,170
you guys should sit on the sofa. It'll look way better.

684
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:44,670
Mr. Kang, sit closer to Mi Rae.

685
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,365
- Here. - A little closer.

686
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:48,910
That's nice.

687
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,650
Mr. Kang, I want you to give me a big smile.

688
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:54,705
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

689
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,150
Now, that's a nice photo.

690
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:58,445
In 1, 2, 3.

691
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:02,745
Look over here, Mr. Kang. In 1, 2, 3.

692
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,130
Are you guys having fun?

693
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,115
Let's take a photo.

694
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,425
- Everyone, he's here. - Hello. Hello.

695
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,140
- You're great. - Thank you.

696
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,525
My goodness.

697
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:18,010
Hello, everyone.

698
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:21,235
- We're going to take a photo. - Okay.

699
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:22,880
Okay, now.

700
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,450
Ma'am, you must be exhausted.

701
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,680
You should get on his back.

702
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:29,520
- He's right. Come on. - Get on his back.

703
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:30,650
That's nice.

704
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:33,660
Gosh, that looks nice. You guys are like mother and son.

705
00:41:33,661 --> 00:41:35,620
That looks perfect. Everyone, smile.

706
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:38,985
Okay, I'm going to take a photo now. In 1, 2, 3.

707
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:42,755
Let's take one more photo. In 1, 2, 3.

708
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,755
My gosh.

709
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:50,040
I hope you stay healthy. I love you, ma'am.

710
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:51,670
Eat up, everyone.

711
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,835
Enjoy your food. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

712
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,235
Let's go.

713
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:00,405
I just got a report from my junior.

714
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:02,505
Apparently, she hasn't really done anything yet.

715
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:05,550
She met up with a female student in front of her place.

716
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,675
But they just parted ways after eating ice cream together.

717
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,730
Ms. Na has a very tight schedule,

718
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:15,115
and he's apparently having trouble following her around.

719
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:19,995
Instead of wasting his time following my ex-wife,

720
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:22,495
he could just follow Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee instead.

721
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,765
My goodness.

722
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:32,280
Do Sang Won!

723
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:37,005
- Do Sang Won! - Do Sang Won!

727
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:15,475
Gosh, these jerks.

728
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,630
Hurry up and get out here.

729
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:22,800
- Come on. - My gosh.

730
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:26,225
You guys, this is way too much.

731
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,155
- My gosh. - What is this?

732
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:30,270
They're muscles.

733
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,210
Do you guys seriously want to be like this?

734
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:35,040
You guys should've worked out.

735
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:38,050
If you guys took care of your body and worked out diligently,

736
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,705
you wouldn't have had to wear these.

737
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,935
If you don't want to wear that, you can wear this instead.

738
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,090
You guys, this is too mean.

739
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:47,045
Exactly. You're making us look funny.

740
00:43:47,595 --> 00:43:48,890
Well, you should at least look funny.

741
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,045
You guys aren't good-looking enough to gather people with your looks.

742
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:53,030
Now, give us a funny pose.

743
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:55,460
- Come on. Don't take a photo. - Gosh, forget it.

744
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,000
- Don't take a photo. - In 1, 2...

745
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,800
- Gosh, stop it. - Don't take that photo.

746
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:00,325
What are you guys doing?

747
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:02,355
Woo Young.

748
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:09,135
You guys were a mess yesterday, and the same goes for today.

749
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,080
Who said you could wait tables wearing something like that?

750
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:13,335
They were being immature and told us to wear these.

751
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:14,880
Well, they're the ones...

752
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:17,705
who kept insisting that only the pretty girls could wait tables.

753
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,375
And they always comment on our appearances.

754
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:24,460
Explain this.

(Hankook University, Community, Notice Board)

756
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:29,885
Did they volunteer to wear this outfit?

757
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,600
Well, we decided to order skirts for their uniform.

758
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:36,010
- But they were shorter than we... - Did you guys agree to this?

759
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,735
No, they made them wear it.

760
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:42,165
They didn't even care what the freshmen said.

761
00:44:42,716 --> 00:44:45,905
This is nothing compared to what they did to us.

762
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:47,405
Is that why...

763
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:50,645
Was this your only solution?

764
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:59,060
How is it that you guys haven't changed at all?

765
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,400
If you're going to keep pulling this kind of nonsense,

766
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:03,070
just get rid of the snack bar.

767
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,485
I'm sorry.

768
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,895
Sorry.

769
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:14,995
My gosh.

770
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,575
Just forget about it and let it go.

771
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,190
It's our first college festival.

772
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:28,620
It'll be unfair to let someone like Park Yong Chul ruin it.

773
00:45:28,629 --> 00:45:30,760
Shouldn't you be at your department's booth?

774
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:32,315
You said you were late.

775
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,885
Where are Yoo Eun and Jung Boon?

776
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:37,325
They're over there.

777
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:39,425
Go already.

778
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,240
Make sure you have some real fun, okay?

779
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,770
Okay.

780
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,165
Bye.

781
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,765
Bye.

782
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,935
- Go already. - Bye.

783

784
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:07,555
What are you doing alone?

785
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:12,025
I'm just looking around.

786
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:15,955
- What about you? - I'm waiting for Ji Hyo.

787
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,465
I worried a lot about you yesterday.

788
00:46:23,717 --> 00:46:25,135
Are you okay?

789
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:32,545
By the way,

790
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:37,045
I went to Yong Chul's social media account,

791
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:41,915
and it said Jaryong Middle School on his profile.

792
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,255
Didn't you see it?

793
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,895
I don't know.

794
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:52,025
Did you say you went to that school?

795
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,835
I don't know well about the school name.

796
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,310
- Is that right? - If I had known,

797
00:46:58,318 --> 00:46:59,980
I would've told you beforehand...

798
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,505
that I knew someone from your middle school.

799
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,245
Don't you think so?

800
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:08,645
Soo A.

801
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:10,615
Hey.

802
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,360
I have surprising news.

803
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:15,000
The guys got scolded so much by Woo Young just now.

804
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,585
- Really? - Yes.

805
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:18,825
Check this out.

806
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:20,700
Isn't it hilarious?

807
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:22,325
What's that?

808
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,740
This is even more hilarious. Check this out.

809
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:27,165
Oh, my.

810
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:29,495
Goodness.

811
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:32,735
There's this picture too.

812
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:51,525
Are you still down?

813
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:56,865
Did you get scolded a lot?

814
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:58,765
Yes.

815
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:01,210
What we did was wrong after all.

816
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,080
- Don't say that. - It was wrong.

817
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,505
Woo Young never scolds innocent people.

818
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:17,915
I feel better whenever I eat something sweet.

819
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,130
Thanks.

820
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:27,325
Still, you're better than all of them.

821
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:30,025
What?

822
00:48:30,511 --> 00:48:32,495
I mean, among the guys in our department.

823
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:38,335
Let's not stay here and go out. It's festival time.

824
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:39,905
Okay.

825
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:45,875
What?

826
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:48,145
It won't open.

827
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:55,115
What's wrong with this?

828
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:00,440
Excuse me.

829
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,365
The door won't open, so could you try opening it from the outside?

830
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,435
Thank you.

831
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:10,605
What's wrong with it? Tae Hee, come out.

832
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:18,005
Can you open the door?

833
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,260
It's working.

834
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,420
What's wrong with it?

835
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:23,845
- Maybe it's broken. - When did it break?

836
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,900
It's not fun to be with just girls.

837
00:49:28,902 --> 00:49:30,630
Please don't do that.

838
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,285
Do you have boyfriends, girls?

839
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:35,570
It's best if you're single, but it's still okay even if you're taken.

840
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:39,070
Give me just 10 minutes for this game.

841
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,910
Please come this way.

842
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:43,195
- What is it? - Come, come.

843
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,950
Come this way. How pretty.

844
00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:51,390
Please move inside.

845
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:53,220
Have a seat.

846
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:57,445
All right. Gosh, you guys are lucky.

847
00:49:57,764 --> 00:50:00,630
You've met the prettiest girls in our school.

848
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:03,730
- Hello. - Hello.

849
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:08,155
Please hold for a second. I'll go bring one more guy.

850
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:14,280
I'm dazed because we got dragged here all of a sudden.

851
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,235
- Us too. - It's the same here.

852
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:19,310
Does anyone want to be on a group blind date?

853
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,605
Wait, Kyung Seok?

854
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:26,145
Should we pretend like we don't know him?

855
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:32,785
Gosh. When did he come take a seat?

856
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,355
You're so handsome.

857
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:36,830
I should come to my senses.

858
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:40,440
All right, guys. Now that we have even numbers,

859
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,600
I'll give you 10 minutes to get to know each other.

860
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:45,440
You'll partner up with someone you like afterwards.

861
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,195
Can't we point out the person right away?

862
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:50,610
You must've sat here because you have someone in mind.

863
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:55,175
Okay, who on earth is the girl you have in mind?

864
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,315
Her.

865
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:06,099
Her.

866
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:13,240
If she says yes, they will be the fastest couple created ever.

867
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,610
Will it become a group blind date among four people?

868
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,713
Let's hear how she feels.

869
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,466
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

870
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:42,769
- I'm okay. - You're all wet.

871
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,271
What should we do?

872
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:47,441
There must be extra t-shirts in our department room.

873
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:49,242
Really?

874
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:51,645
Then I'll go first.

875
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,115
- I'll go with you. - I'll go with you.

876
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:11,631
I'll go with Kyung Seok.

877
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:17,804
Let's go.

878
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,377
Anyway, they've become a couple.

879
00:52:23,744 --> 00:52:25,846
Excuse me. Take the prize.

880
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,214
Excuse me.

881
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,362
You want to run?

882
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:43,864
What?

883
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:47,000
If it's embarrassing, let's run there.

884
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:54,074
Okay.

885
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:05,318
Don't try to calculate love in order not to get hurt.

886
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:07,988
That'll only make you suffer even more.

887
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,991
- Okay. - Good luck.

888
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:12,392
Thank you.

889
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:14,528
- You can do it. - I can do it!

890
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:16,663
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

891
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:25,105
Hey, Woo Young.

892
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:27,841
This is awesome. We should've done this kind of stuff too.

893
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:30,744
Not everyone can do this, you know.

894
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,180
Can you read my fortune too?

895
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,148
Sure. Have a seat.

896
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:40,654
Choose one of these.

897
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:46,159
I'll choose this one.

898
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,396
This is unexpected.

899
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:53,300
I thought you'd choose this one.

900
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:56,236
I know well about the future I want, that's why.

901
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,904
I see.

902
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:01,374
All right, then. I'll start the psychological test now.

903
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:05,212
Let's say you went to buy a cozy knitted sweater.

904
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:08,782
Choose what kind of sweater you'd buy among four options.

905
00:54:08,782 --> 00:54:10,183
- Okay. - The first one is...

906
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:12,719
a sweater with a big highlight pattern.

907
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:14,788
The second one is a striped sweater.

908
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:16,323
A sweater with stripes.

909
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:17,991
The third one is a plain sweater...

910
00:54:17,991 --> 00:54:20,660
in a bold color such as red or blue.

911
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,130
The fourth one is a plain sweater in an achromatic shade...

912
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,632
such as gray or black.

913
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:27,200
An achromatic shade...

914
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:33,006
- I'll go with the 3rd one. - The 3rd one?

915
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,776
That means you want simple love.

916
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:41,515
You prefer an uncomplicated love to an extremely passionate one.

917
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:46,219
You can keep your emotions in check no matter how upset you are.

918
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,021
It's pretty accurate.

919
00:54:49,689 --> 00:54:53,293
It can look graceful,

920
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,962
but on the other hand, your love...

921
00:54:55,962 --> 00:54:58,498
may be seen hypocritical as well.

922
00:54:58,498 --> 00:54:59,900
Hypocritical?

923
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:02,969
You should try to be honest with your feelings.

924
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,404
When you're not honest with yourself,

925
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,540
you can't really win someone's heart.

926
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:08,842
I'm very honest...

927
00:55:12,279 --> 00:55:14,180
Right, I've been careful these days.

928
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:16,383
Why?

929
00:55:18,718 --> 00:55:20,186
It's a secret.

930
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:22,889
Your secret will be safe with me.

931
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:28,061
She's a student in our department.

932
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:35,468
You mean, the chemistry department?

933
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,674
I see.

934
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:46,112
- Are we done, then? - Yes.

935
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,381
Thanks. I'll see you around.

936
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,417
Okay. Bye.

937
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:24,184
- My gosh. - There it is.

938
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:26,953
Did you find it?

939
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:31,791
- Here. - Thanks.

940
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:33,226
I'll wait outside.

941
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:39,532
What's going on?

942
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,602
What's wrong?

943
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:46,539
You can't open it?

944
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,776
Let me try.

945
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,523
Hello?

946
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:07,260
Anybody outside?

947
00:57:26,112 --> 00:57:27,914
Why isn't she picking up?

948
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:30,150
You should also try calling other people.

949
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:32,252
I don't have my phone now.

950
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:34,487
What?

951
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:35,922
All right. Everyone is ready, right?

952
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:39,993
Then here we go. 1, 2, 3!

953
00:57:43,663 --> 00:57:47,367
Sadly, we don't have a match.

954
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:48,735
Then I can leave, right?

955
00:57:48,735 --> 00:57:50,770
Yes, you can leave.

956
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,549
Whose phone is this?

957
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:05,485
- It's not mine. - It's not mine either.

958
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:08,154
It must be Kyung Seok's phone. You can give it to me.

959
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:09,756
Okay.

960
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,524
(Kang Mi Rae)

961
00:58:11,524 --> 00:58:13,093
(1 Missed Call)

962
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:21,367
The person you're trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave...

963
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:24,270
No one's picking up.

964
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:26,473
I guess I lost it.

965
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:30,777
Eun isn't answering her phone. Jung Boon isn't either.

966
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:32,879
Who else can we call?

967
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:37,283
Shall I try calling Soo A and Ji Hyo?

968
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:40,653
Forget it.

969
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,290
- Just get changed first. - What?

970
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,025
Will you wait until it dries?

971
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:57,237
What's going on between Kyung Seok and Mi Rae?

972
00:58:58,238 --> 00:58:59,773
Could they be...

973
00:59:01,107 --> 00:59:03,510
No, no way. That can't be.

974
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:08,081
Is Kyung Seok trying to make you jealous?

975
00:59:08,948 --> 00:59:10,784
I don't know what you're trying to say.

976
00:59:12,352 --> 00:59:13,887
That must be it.

977
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:16,890
Come on. Are you playing hard to get?

978
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:20,994
What are you talking about?

979
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:24,798
Do you think I have a crush on him?

980
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:42,282
- I won't look. - You shouldn't, of course.

981
01:00:00,867 --> 01:00:02,235
Are you done?

982
01:00:02,502 --> 01:00:05,405
No, I'm not done. I haven't even taken off...

983
01:00:10,977 --> 01:00:12,412
Tell me when you're done.

984
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,298
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

985
01:01:05,298 --> 01:01:08,067
- What? You guys were here together? - What's going on between them?

986
01:01:08,067 --> 01:01:10,436
I heard Kyung Seok's father is a former congressman.

987
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:12,138
You dropped this yesterday.

988
01:01:12,138 --> 01:01:13,406
You're really the worst.

989
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:15,808
Ms. Na was just taken to the emergency room.

990
01:01:15,808 --> 01:01:17,043
To the emergency room?

991
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:19,345
Soo A, didn't you say you live in Dogok-dong?

992
01:01:19,345 --> 01:01:21,414
I moved out of my parents' place a little while ago.

993
01:01:21,414 --> 01:01:22,415
Kyung Seok.

994
01:01:22,415 --> 01:01:23,583
I'm sorry I misjudged you.

995
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,686
You would've kept misjudging me if it weren't for Ji Hyo.

996
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:27,720
Yes, Woo Young.

997
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,189
I'm having a housewarming party this Saturday. Can you make it?

998
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:31,457
You'll be home late, right?

999
01:01:31,457 --> 01:01:32,792
You have to watch a movie with Kyung Seok.

1000
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:34,494
This is driving me crazy.
