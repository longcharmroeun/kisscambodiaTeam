1
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:12,850
Good job today.

2
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:15,565
Put the equipment in each basket and return them safely.

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,135
- Okay. - Okay.

4
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,865
Please check if we missed anything.

5
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:26,320
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,815
No, I'm okay.

7
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,775
Give me the flask.

8
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,645
Thank you.

9
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,655
- Give me that too. - Okay.

10
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:43,795
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

11
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,035
What is it? Is it hydroxide solution?

12
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,805
Yes, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,360
Go wash it off quickly and head to the dispensary right away.

14
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,775
Okay.

15
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,635
- Watch the glass. - Hey!

16
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,285
How many more times do I have to tell you to be careful?

17
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,655
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,645
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,420
It's okay. Little shards must've gotten on me.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,975
What would you have done had they gotten stuck in your face?

21
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:40,385
- Soo A. - Hey!

22
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:43,355
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,055
Thanks, Won Ho.

24
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:52,025
A box of adhesive bandage without ointment? What was he thinking?

25
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,305
- Take it off carefully. - I'll go pick up some ointment.

26
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:03,005
It's okay. The cut isn't deep.

27
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,605
You must love vending machines.

28
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,645
I heard you cleaned up all the broken glass.

29
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,675
- I'm sorry. - I didn't do it for you.

30
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,815
You're always so prickly toward me.

31
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,385
I find it quite impressive.

32
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:52,055
Impressive? I can't beat you on that front.

33
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:58,740
It must be fun.

34
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,810
What?

35
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,335
Having fun with the guy you like that likes you back.

36
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:05,435
That's not what's going on.

37
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:08,005
- Soo A. - Hey, Soo A.

38
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:11,060
I heard you got hurt. Do you want me to carry you?

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,160
It's not a big deal.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,260
What do you mean it's not a big deal? It's a big deal to me.

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,290
Hey, get down.

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,530
No, it's okay.

43
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,930
If you can't trust him, you can get on my back instead.

44
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,860
- My back is broader. - No, mine's broader.

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,270
- Soo A! - Soo A!

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,030
Hey, it's fine.

47
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,600
She's fine. She's okay.

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm okay.

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,655
- She's okay! Soo A's okay! - Nice!

50
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:30,465
Let's go eat.

51
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,235
How's your hand? Is it okay?

52
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:37,935
Yes.

53
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,575
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

54
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,360
Did you really break it?

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,645
Of course, I broke it.

56
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,370
Are they hiring an announcer or something?

57
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,540
Why can't a waitress have a dialect?

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,525
How can you fall in love at first sight?

59
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:06,025
What do you like about him?

60
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,535
He has a beautiful smile.

61
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:11,680
I didn't know that kind of smile was considered beautiful.

62
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,330
The moment he smiled,

63
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,575
I felt a rush of dopamine spreading through my body.

64
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,545
Dopamine?

65
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,745
Eat up.

66
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,070
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

67
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,715
No, I'm okay.

68
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,555
Give me the flask.

69
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:33,255
Thank you.

70
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,735
Why aren't you eating?

71
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,765
Is it because of the mistake you made earlier?

72
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:48,575
No.

73
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:50,690
Is it because the TA scolded you?

74
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,745
He didn't scold her. He was just telling her to be careful.

75
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:00,655
By the way,

76
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:05,185
Chan Woo didn't do anything to you after that incident, did he?

77
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,700
No.

78
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,795
I wasn't going to tell you this because it was a private discussion.

79
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,995
But Woo Young actually called me to his office that day.

80
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:16,380
Chan Woo gathered all the freshmen from our year.

81
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,420
He had already heard about what happened.

82
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,405
So I just told him everything.

83
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:25,275
Well, I told you that wench, Kang Mi Rae, hit me first.

84
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:29,200
Do you believe the freshmen's words over my words?

85
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,515
Hey, Chan Woo.

86
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,015
Regardless of the reason,

87
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:38,355
if you bother freshmen once again,

88
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,525
I'm going to do my best to ruin your future.

89
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,210
I'm going to talk to every single freshman...

90
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,440
and expose every bad deed you've done.

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,750
I'll make sure you get no reference letter when you graduate.

92
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:51,620
Even if you manage to get a job without a reference letter,

93
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,305
I'll tell our alumni in the field about everything you've done.

94
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,705
Just a moment.

95
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,945
Didn't you say you'll pay for this?

96
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,015
- Hello. - I'll pay for everything.

97
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:13,640
Thank you.

98
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,255
- Thank you. - Sure thing, I'll see you around.

99
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,665
That's what you call a senior.

100
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:22,110
I was getting sick of being the head of our year...

101
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,135
and coming to school because of Chan Woo.

102
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:28,275
But Woo Young made me feel a lot more comfortable.

103
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:35,615
I guess I should've told you this.

104
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:45,710
Our one on one customer strategy started going viral,

105
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:50,040
and a lot of celebrities promoted our products via social media,

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,965
so we're getting positive results faster than we expected.

107
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:56,480
Since our sales have become stable, we're planning to strengthen...

108
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,950
our marketing strategy by hiring a model for our brand.

109
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,320
And we're going to increase our brand awareness...

110
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,030
to expand our product line and sales volume.

111
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,490
That way, we'll be able to maintain our current product costs...

112
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,275
and increase our sales at the same time.

113
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:10,815
That sounds great.

114
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:14,000
Perfumes rely more on each person's individual satisfaction...

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,110
rather than other people's opinions.

116
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:19,325
So I want to maintain the unique characteristic of our products.

117
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:23,310
Please continue developing our brand without losing...

118
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,295
our brand's characteristic.

119
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:28,235
And consider making affiliate brands as well.

120
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,265
Okay.

121
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:34,105
Next, there will be a briefing about the perfume sampling event.

122
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,755
- Let's go. - Hello.

123
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,610
I can't believe you're a professor.

124
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:30,995
My gosh.

125
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:33,380
It feels like yesterday that you got scolded...

126
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,535
for pretending to be MacGyver in the lab.

127
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,805
Yes, I remember. You're the one who started it.

128
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,160
Really?

129
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:43,530
Let me see. You haven't changed at all.

130
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,420
You've become more cheerful.

131
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,170
I've aged a lot.

132
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,875
You look nice.

133
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:50,545
Hello, professor.

134
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,360
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,470
Remember the thesis I sent you last time?

136
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:56,985
He's the one who wrote it.

137
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,855
Really?

138
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:02,495
Hello.

139
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,020
I was getting sick of being the head of our year...

140
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,135
and coming to school because of Chan Woo.

141
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:20,205
But Woo Young made me feel a lot more comfortable.

142
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:29,055
Hey, Mom.

143
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,740
You're eating lunch now?

144
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,370
I had a busy schedule.

145
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,070
Having a lot of work to do is a good thing.

146
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,310
I'll do part-time jobs and pitch in for the hospital fee,

147
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,895
so don't work too hard.

148
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:42,480
Hearing you say that is more than enough.

149
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,535
Just focus on studying and having fun.

150
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,305
What about Dad?

151
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,305
What about him?

152
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,775
He won't pick up my calls.

153
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:53,605
- A set menu, please. - Okay.

154
00:09:57,705 --> 00:09:59,815
- Mom? - Right.

155
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:02,570
Don't worry.

156
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,425
He'll call you soon, so give him some time.

157
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:09,625
Okay.

158
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:15,695
Hey, what are you doing here?

159
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:17,605
You're here.

160
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:20,290
- Hey. - Yes?

161
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:21,975
Take a photo of me.

162
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:39,270
(Voice message)

163
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,225
Mi Rae told me that she'll pay back the hospital fee.

164
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:45,265
Hearing her say that almost made me cry.

165
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,495
Is this how you show your daughter that you love her?

166
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:55,575
I get that you're upset.

167
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,545
But what can you do? What's done is done.

168
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:01,575
I have a limit to how much I can put up with this.

169
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:04,185
You're not even sending me money for living expenses.

170
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,585
Are you just going to abandon your family?

Honey!

174
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:34,445
You should at least eat!

175
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,315
One bulgogi set, please.

176
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:41,415
We have one bulgogi set.

177
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,525

00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,105
Are you kidding me?

183
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,145
Why did you upload the photo?

184
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,300
You hate taking pictures with me.

185
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,930
Only because it's a sure way to gain more followers.

186
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,655
I know it's lame, but what can I do?

187
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:56,225
You don't smoke, right?

188
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,695
I should quit.

189
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,845
Do you actually smoke?

190
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,615
Did you buy that? You're so gullible.

191
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,645
Dad said he'll send me to the States.

192
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:22,155
I obviously won't get into one of the best colleges like you did.

193
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,540
I guess he'll send me to some no-name school there.

194
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:27,285
- Did you tell him that you'd go? - I can't disobey him, you know.

195
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,355
Don't go if you don't want to.

196
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,565
Well, I don't really dislike the idea.

197
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:37,535
My allowance will probably go up if I move there.

198
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:44,775
You know what though? I may not miss Dad,

199
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:47,075
but I think I'll miss you.

200

("Na Hye Sung Appointed as CEO of Kelun Korea")

201
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:41,910
Hey, that is so cool.

202
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,550
Gosh, that hurts.

203
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:46,950
Forget those who act helpful to your face.

204
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,175
Those who help you behind your back are the truly kindhearted ones.

205
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,545
- Did you just hear that? - Hear what?

206
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,445
There's someone behind us.

207
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,255
There's nobody.

208
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm scared.

209
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,255
Why are you scared? No one is following us.

210
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:11,410
That's why I'm scared. I heard something, but there's no one.

211
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,840
Here we go again.

212
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,110
Hey, do you smell poop when no one else is around?

213
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,095
Do you smell cigarette smoke when you're alone?

214
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,750
You'd better take me seriously.

215
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,875
Be careful on your way home, okay?

216
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:25,960
What's with you these days? Gosh, it hurts.

217
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,700
- Come on. Let's go. - Gosh.

218
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:30,190
Jesus the Lord said he considers those who listen to God's word...

219
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,900
and put it into action his family.

220
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,600
According to his teachings,

221
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
we must sacrifice ourselves in and outside...

222
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,885
of the church like a grain of wheat that gladly sacrifices itself.

223
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:45,225
We must also live the kind of life where we can nourish our children.

224
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:47,625
In this day and age,

225
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:51,090
the tougher things get in life, the more you need...

226
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,465
your precious family who's there to support you.

227
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:58,275
With that said, I'd like to introduce someone who's here.

228
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:03,315
He lets his faith lead and guide him every single day.

229
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,585
It's Congressman Do Sang Won.

230
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:14,385
I'm sure some of you already know his story.

231
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:18,265
He's a single dad, and the government keeps him busy,

232
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:21,750
but he still did such an excellent job...

233
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:24,335
of raising his two children, his son and daughter.

234
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:46,285
Thank you very much for your kind words about my family.

235
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:51,195
Good luck with the by-election. I'll be praying for you.

236
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,550
I'm always so grateful for you.

237
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,095
I wouldn't be where I am now without your prayers.

238
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:59,265
It is my absolute pleasure.

239
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,905
I heard your son got into Hankook University. Congratulations.

240
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:07,475
We owe it all to Buddha's mercy.

241
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,275
The merciful Buddha.

242
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,885
So what is our religion?

243
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:16,755
What do you think? Whatever that is believed by more people.

Hey, come here.

251
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,535
Hey, do you think each guest is getting one of this?

252
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:10,735
We may be able to get another one if we take one now.

253
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,245
We're poor students, but let's not do that, okay?

254
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,815
Gosh.

255
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:23,840
- This is awesome. - I know.

256
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,500
Hey, look. Isn't that...

Mi Rae.

258
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:32,565
- Hello. - What are you doing here?

259
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,565
I won tickets to this event.

260

This is my friend. He's our TA.

261

Hello.

263

- Hello, it's nice to meet you. - Woo Young.

264
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:03,410
Her doe eyes, perfectly defined nose, and flawless skin.

265
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,240
She's a perfect natural beauty.

266
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,310
(A perfect natural beauty)

267
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,695
100 out of 100.

268
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,765
I did it again without even realizing it.

269
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:15,675
Hello.

270
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:17,335
Welcome.

271
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:22,275
Could she be...

272
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,855
Oh, she's a freshman at our school. This is a friend of hers.

273
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,920
This is Ms. Na Hye Sung, the CEO of Kelun Korea.

274
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,535
- She's our alumna. - Really?

275
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:46,505
Hello.

276
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:48,935
It's nice to meet you.

277
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,175
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

278
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,280
- Yes. - Sir, it's me, Young Mo.

279
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:12,380
Yes, what's up?

280
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,650
I'm tailing her at the moment.

281
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,035
Hey, hold on.

282
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:21,460
- Yes, go on. - She's at a perfume sampling event.

283
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:24,775
I looked everywhere but didn't see Kyung Seok or Kyung Hee.

284
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:28,415
They're with me now.

285
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,985
Kyung Seok, can I use your phone? My battery is dead.

286
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,915
Kyung Hee, how did you do on your midterms?

287
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:38,285
The exams haven't even begun yet.

288
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:42,525
Have you been studying English hard?

289
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:45,265
Yes.

293

Will you join a research lab after completing your master's degree?

294
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,280
That was my plan initially,

295
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,890
but I'm considering studying to become a patent attorney.

296
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:59,020
Even in this field, independent labs keep shutting down.

297
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,320
Everything is owned by big corporations.

298
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:02,330
It's okay to keep your options open.

299
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:05,045

303
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:17,885
- Oh, hi. - Hi.

304

- Hyun Jung. - Okay.

312
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:19,800
It seemed like you knew how to rap.

313

Pardon? Oh, I like rap music.

314
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,255
Oh, really? That's what's up.

315
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,740
If I send you a mix tape, would you listen to it?

316
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,610
Yes, of course. I'll have a listen.

317
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,135
- Okay, thank you. - Thanks.

318
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,855
I heard you applied for the event and won.

319
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,355
You must be interested in perfumes.

320
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:04,455
Yes.

321
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:06,840
My dream is to become a perfumer.

322
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,595
Really? Is that why you decided to major in chemistry?

323
00:24:11,155 --> 00:24:13,365
- Yes. - Really?

324
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,205
I majored in chemistry for the same reason.

325
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:17,235
Since when did you want to become a perfumer?

326
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:24,515
Ever since I read a magazine in middle school.

327
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:29,885
I'd like to thank everyone for attending today's event.

328
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:33,925

- One Americano? - Soo A, you can sit down.

333

Oh, thank you.

One Americano?

335

- Yes. - Okay.

00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:54,220
When do you finish?

337
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,230
I still have an hour left.

338
00:24:56,235 --> 00:24:57,715
I have great news.

340
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:02,055
Hey.

341
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:05,355
It's time for President Na Hye Sung's speech.

342
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:12,925
Hello, I'm Na Hye Sung.

343
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:22,375
I thought about what I should say to you.

344
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:25,390
And thanks to a young lady I met just now,

345
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,475
I was reminded of what I wrote in a magazine a long time ago.

346
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:34,015
"The true beauty of perfume lies in the fact..."

347
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,515
"that it can't be seen."

348
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:41,040
"Scent is the one and only beautiful thing..."

349
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,355
"that can be felt even with your eyes closed."

350
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:46,380
"I believe this intangible beauty..."

351
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,495
"will be somewhat of a consolation..."

352
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:52,365
"to those who are sick of this world that only focuses on outer beauty."

353
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:58,130
I think we are blessed to be able to love...

354
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,405
this intangible beauty called scent.

355
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,530
I hope you all enjoy your time.

356
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,315
And thank you so much for coming to our event.

357
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:17,740
You did great.

358
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,640
- That was amazing. Congratulations. - Thank you.

359
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,780
- Hello. - Welcome.

360
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,695
I really liked your speech.

361
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:25,590
Ta-da. Isn't this amazing?

362
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:28,905
Junoflo told me that he'll listen to my mix tape if I send him one.

363
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,175
What's wrong?

364
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:39,315
That's her.

365
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:42,030
(Kang Mi Rae)

366
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,855
Isn't it weird? She's not even in the group photo.

367
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:46,855
I wonder if it's her.

368
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:50,355
Maybe she was absent on the day they took graduation photos.

369
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:53,440
Don't people normally hand in another photo?

370
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,965
No one leaves it blank.

371
00:26:57,255 --> 00:27:01,105
I think she used to hate taking photos.

372
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:03,435
I wonder why.

373
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:06,030
Maybe she used to look like a monster.

374
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:07,745
Gosh, come on.

375
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:15,985
Why don't you just tell her that you're the one who wrote it?

376
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,170
Thank you for coming.

377
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,525
Thank you.

378
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:24,725
I wrote that I was sick of the world that only focused on outer beauty...

379
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:28,595
and that's why I came to like perfumes.

380
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:32,305
What would she say once she finds out that I got plastic surgery done?

381
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:35,905
Mi Rae.

382
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,060
What's your plan for today?

383
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,675
If you're free, I was thinking about buying you guys dinner.

384
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:45,300
I'm sorry. I'm a little busy today.

385
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,215
No, it's okay. Don't be sorry.

386
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:49,485
I'll see you at school then.

387
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:51,315
See you next time.

388
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:54,655
Hey, Woo Young.

389
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:57,795
I'm sorry for last time.

390
00:27:58,185 --> 00:27:59,525
What are you talking about?

391
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:04,595
You tried to help me that night at the party, but I...

392
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:07,465
Are you talking about when you spilled water on me?

393
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:09,975
That's fine. Don't worry about it.

394
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:12,105
I'll see you guys.

395
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,545
Thank you for inviting me.

396
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,600
- I'll see you again at school. - See you next time.

397
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,515
I'm going to go home.

398
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,085
I need to write the lyrics when I'm inspired.

399
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:27,655
Okay. You should write about how I feel as well.

400
00:28:28,255 --> 00:28:29,625
Bye.

401
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:39,965
I'll see you at work.

402
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:48,530
I was able to make a good speech thanks to you. Thank you.

403
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,045
No, you're the one who wrote it.

404
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:54,930
That's why I'm grateful. That was the first and last time...

405
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,485
I ever wrote anything in a magazine, but you remembered that until now.

406
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,585
Gosh, I'm so touched.

407
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:06,140
Would you like to eat dinner with me...

408
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,965
if you're free?

409
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,380
Pardon?

410
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,020
Do you feel uncomfortable that I'm asking you to eat with me...

411
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,865
when we just met today?

412
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:15,735
No, not at all.

413
00:29:16,135 --> 00:29:17,890
I'd love to.

414
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,690
- Really? - Yes.

415
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,115
Does the food street in front of our school still exist?

416
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:27,745
Our school's surrounded by food streets.

417
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:35,555
I used to walk here like this.

418
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,195
Why?

419
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:40,395
Why do you think? Because I was drunk.

420
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,535
Do you drink, Mi Rae?

421
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,250
Just a little.

422
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,390
Then let's skip dinner and go drink right away.

423
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:52,375
You can choose where we should go.

424
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:57,230
I don't know that many bars.

425
00:29:57,235 --> 00:29:59,385
I don't mind going anywhere.

426
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm busy, and I'm also really lonely.

427
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:10,655
I don't have a girlfriend. Show me some pity.

428
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:13,365
You should be able to handle this alone to cut down on labor costs.

429
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,765
That's not for you to say. You get paid a lot.

430
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:19,665
Just get over here.

431
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:22,350
Welcome. Is it just you two?

432
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,675
Yes.

433
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:25,160
Hey.

434
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:27,200
- Hello. - Hi.

435
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:28,530
Please sit down.

436
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,075
- This way. - Okay.

437
00:30:39,015 --> 00:30:40,755
Where are you going at this hour?

438
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:44,225
Yoo Jin asked me for help.

439
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,065
I really don't understand that punk.

440
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,905
I'll see you when I get back.

441
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:57,805
Always be careful of your actions.

442
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:05,345
Today's event was really incredible.

443
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:08,585
I've never been to an event like that in my life.

444
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:16,855
I can't drink that well yet.

445
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:20,065
I also want to drink well.

446
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,890
I reread what I had written,

447
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,045
and I realized that it was just full of bluff.

448
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,330
I was talking about the trend...

449
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:38,645
and some other stuff that I didn't really mean.

450
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:43,985
But I came to my senses as soon as I talked to you.

451
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:46,870
I realized that I'm just someone who likes perfumes...

452
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,455
more than I am a businesswoman.

453
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:53,395
Here you go.

454
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:57,995
One more bottle, please.

455
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:02,375
I always drink my shots in one go.

456
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:04,990
This is why they say it's hard to change old habits.

457
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,420
I think it's great.

458
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,975
I've aged and deteriorated in many ways,

459
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:13,140
but I'm still good at drinking.

460
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:15,240
I envy you so much.

461
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:16,855
Why?

462
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:21,655
Because you're living your dream.

463
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:33,235
Being envious...

464
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:37,775
is also a sad thing.

465
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:43,675
Being envious of something...

466
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:46,085
that's ordinary...

467
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:49,655
is sad.

468
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:58,195
Hey, you over there.

469
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:00,395
- I said your face must show. - Gosh, seriously.

470
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,780
What is her problem?

471
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,480
Her ugly face is her problem. No wonder she wants to hide it.

472
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,065
It's too hot. I'm getting annoyed.

473
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,450
Hey, Kang Orc.

474
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,835
I'll kill you if you tell people that you have a crush on me.

475
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,675
You'd better not tell anyone.

476
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,615
Being envious of something...

477
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:26,855
that's ordinary...

478
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,525
is sad.

479
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:01,755
Mi Rae.

480
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,055
Yes.

481
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,880
Mom, I said it's okay.

482
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,635
Come on, it's fine. Give it to me.

483
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:20,505
Gosh, it's so heavy. Let's go, son.

484
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,715
Hey, you. You're early.

485
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:34,685
Ms. Na.

486
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:38,195
I have something to tell you.

487
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:46,305
What are you doing? Get to work already.

488
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,085
Hey, you. You're early.

489
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,055
Ms. Na.

490
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,565
I have something to tell you.

491
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:20,665
What are you doing? Get to work already.

492
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:48,325
He's my classmate.

493
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,135
- This is... - What are you...

494
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,635
doing here?

495
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,515
You've grown up so much.

496
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:16,695
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help out today.

497
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:18,655
Hey.

498
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:20,665
Kyung Seok, Kyung Seok.

499
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,165
Kyung Seok.

500
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,415
I'm his mom.

501
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:44,685
Pardon me?

502
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:58,635
Kyung Seok.

503
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:02,805
I'm off.

504
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,770
I'm sorry for leaving like this.

505
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:19,525
It's okay. Please get home safely.

506
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:22,525
- I'll see you around. - Okay.

507
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:13,905
Let go.

508
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:16,900
Let go! Let go of me, please.

509
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,275
Let go!

510
00:38:18,605 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm not a flower.

511
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:22,715
I said, I'm not a flower!

512
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:24,415
Let go.

513
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,585
- Come to your senses, please! - Let go of me.

514
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:29,855
Let go!

515
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:31,725
Let go.

516
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,235
I told you to let go of me. Gosh...

517
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:41,235
Let go. Please let go of me!

518
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,575
This is so nice.

519
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:46,805
It may seem like everyone else is free of worries and problems,

520
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:50,905
but we're all forcing ourselves to cheer up and chug along.

521
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:23,035
Hi, Mom.

522
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,045
Where's Dad?

523
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:32,985
Well, just because. I miss you two.

524
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:44,350
- Hello? - Yes?

525
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:45,895
What's wrong?

526
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,025
It's nothing.

527
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:52,320
Don't starve yourself trying to lose weight.

528
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,235
Okay. I'll call you again soon.

529
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,405
All right, good night.

530
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:03,775
(1 New Message)

531
00:41:09,145 --> 00:41:11,555
(5,000 dollars deposited into the Daejung Bank account, Kang Tae Sik)

532
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,055
What on earth is this about?

533
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:35,845
Hey, it's me, Eun Shim. Did you talk to Tae Sik today by any chance?

534
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:38,315
No?

535
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:43,685
Gosh, I don't even know. He hasn't been coming home.

536
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:58,295
You're here.

537
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:01,105
Can you take a look at this for me?

538
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:04,875
Did you talk about it?

539
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,145
What's wrong?

540
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:09,275
Did she not remember?

541
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:12,840
I didn't get to tell her.

542
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:14,215
Why?

543
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:17,515
We weren't in the right mood for me to bring up the subject.

544
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:21,840
By the way, I heard some noise on my way back again.

545
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,925
- Again? - Yes.

546
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:27,965
It felt like someone was following me.

Your postures are the same, but they feel totally different.

Forget it. You'll only get compared to him.

I met her for the first time at the perfume sampling event that day.

559
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:30,550
Our TA was there too.

560
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,675
He introduced me to her, saying she was our alumna.

Well...

563
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:46,185
It happened that way by accident after the event.

Is that all?

565
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:49,825
Yes.

Don't tell others about this.

572
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:14,060
I won't. Why would I tell such a thing to others?

573
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,585
You asked me not to tell others that we went to the same school,

574
00:47:16,745 --> 00:47:18,240

I won't care, so don't worry.

- It's finally over. - Why would you throw it to me?

00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,570
- Did you do well on your tests? - Of course not.

601
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,870
Let's go eat first.

602
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,140
- Deal. - But I'm sleepy.

- This one smells nice. - It's really nice.

How much will you sell it for?

608
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:10,285
9 dollars and 90 cents seem a bit cheap, so I'll make it 10 dollars.

609
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:14,125
Then how many of it should you sell a month?

610
00:51:14,415 --> 00:51:19,295
If I work part-time for 4 hours, it's 30 dollars and 12 cents.

611
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:21,465
I think I should sell at least 60.

612
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:24,235
Do you think you'll be able to?

613
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,735
I'll raise the price for the ones with a bigger size.

614
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:30,775
If it's not enough, I should get another part-time job.

615
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:35,875
It's 71 dollars and 60 cents.

616

Can't you give us a little discount?

617
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:50,450
Go ahead and check the other stores. Our place is the cheapest.

618
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:55,010
Still, we came all the way here instead of buying items online.

619

Hey, try acting cute.

620
00:51:58,095 --> 00:51:59,835
- Hurry. - What?

621
00:52:00,795 --> 00:52:03,920
Sir, we plan to sell products,

622
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,960
so we're going to come really often from now on.

623
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:09,045
It's already the cheapest I can offer.

624
00:52:11,005 --> 00:52:12,515
What are you doing?

625
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:25,695
Please give us a 10-cent discount for each item. Please?

626
00:52:34,365 --> 00:52:35,735
Come on.

627
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:42,545

630
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:03,795
I actually wanted to do it once in my life.

631

"Mister, please give me a discount."

632
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:09,850
You want to get beaten up?

633
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:13,505
But you told me to act cute. Aren't I cute?

634
00:53:13,765 --> 00:53:15,460
- Goodness. - Hey.

635
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,245
Don't do it for the rest of your life.

636
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:19,015

Yes, I'm doing great.

Pardon?

I know it's a difficult thing to ask, and I'm sorry.

She's Kyung Seok's mom?

646
00:54:00,415 --> 00:54:02,625
I guess good looks are genetically inherited.

647
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:07,195
Are his parents divorced then?

648
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:12,465
Why doesn't he want to see his mom though?

649
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:15,005
I don't know.

650
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:19,375
So what are you going to do?

651
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:25,745
I'd do it if I were you.

652
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:29,015
She saved your life, so what's there you can't do for her?

653
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:31,955
Don't say that.

654
00:54:33,945 --> 00:54:36,155
It's hard for me to say no to her as well.

655
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:39,395
So don't say such a thing.

656
00:54:40,055 --> 00:54:43,420
That's right. You're good.

657
00:54:43,425 --> 00:54:45,465

658
00:54:47,565 --> 00:54:48,720
Look.

659
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,290
Fill 20 percent of the glass with foam.

660
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,005
Nice and neat like that.

661
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:54,775
Do you want to try another glass?

662
00:55:00,945 --> 00:55:03,985
Glaring like that will only hurt your eyes.

Go ask them what they need.

672
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:40,085
- Did you come alone? - Yes.

673
00:55:40,145 --> 00:55:41,655
Sit here then.

674
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:43,525
Hi, Kyung Seok.

675
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:45,425
Let's sit over there.

676
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:50,465
Give us two glasses of beer.

677
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:53,635
Is he trying to avoid me now?

678
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:56,405
You're making me want to avoid you too.

681
00:56:20,455 --> 00:56:23,265
It went all right in the beginning of the semester, but not anymore.

682
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:27,035
Maybe my father's prayer is working.

683
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:29,720
Does he pray for your business to fail?

684
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,130
Don't get me started.

685
00:56:31,135 --> 00:56:34,445
He keeps talking about "The Return of the Prodigal Son" these days.

686
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:37,670
He must be waiting for you with a feast then.

687
00:56:37,675 --> 00:56:40,460
I should be the one who prepares the feast...

688
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,085
by becoming successful somehow.

689
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:45,055
My mother helped me because she counted on me.

690
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:49,955
Oh, please.

691
00:56:50,955 --> 00:56:52,295
Come on...

692
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:57,695
It's not my phone.

693
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:03,320
Check your phone already if you know you got a message.

694
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,105

Can we meet up tomorrow?

697
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:24,125
Hasn't she contacted you yet?

698
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:33,435
Let's not talk about it.

701
00:57:57,085 --> 00:57:59,595
Twice.

What?

706
00:58:13,735 --> 00:58:15,600
- We'll serve too. - Well, right.

707
00:58:15,605 --> 00:58:17,675
We might not need your help.

708
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:24,285
Why is it essential for me?

709
00:58:26,515 --> 00:58:28,125
Because you're the face of our campus.

710
00:58:29,515 --> 00:58:32,310
Exactly. I want to help her.

711
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,895
Why would they want to stop me from helping?

712
00:58:35,855 --> 00:58:38,335
Stop hitting on Soo A already.

713
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:40,965

How about we have a drink?

719
00:59:26,305 --> 00:59:28,485
(We thank Junoflo and Jeon Jin Ki for their guest appearances.)

720
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:42,865
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

721
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:45,520
I smiled only once throughout my middle school life.

722
00:59:45,525 --> 00:59:47,035
It was because of you.

723
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,750
- I must be crazy. - There's a beauty among freshmen?

724
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,090
What about Kang Mi Rae?

725
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,290
She's a new face.

726
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,760
Can you help us serve at the bar during the campus fest?

727
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,030
What about Mi Rae? She must be in it.

728
00:59:57,035 --> 00:59:59,030
She's the known as the goddess of Hankook University.

729
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,415
Why did she like your picture?

730
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:04,140
I thought you guys didn't know each other at first...

731
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:05,810
because you acted as if you were strangers.

732
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:07,000
What do you do during the festival?

733
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,925
During the festival? I'm not sure.

734
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:10,780
I'm a bit busy these days.

735
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:12,710
Right? You're the teaching assistant of Mi Rae's department.

736
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,320
How about we grab some beer later today?

737
01:00:14,325 --> 01:00:16,320
It'd be nice if we go nearby our school and tell Mi Rae to join us.

738
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:19,020
We have a good selection of servers.

739
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:21,605
Soo A is feminine while Mi Rae is sexy.

740
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:23,960
That woman came back to Korea.

741
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:27,030
She had an affair with a young punk and abandoned her children.

742
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:28,860
I know you won't see her even if she asks you to.

743
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,860
Mi Rae.

744
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,630
I'll hold a housewarming party after unpacking, so come over then.

745
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,460
What are you doing? Didn't you say you were busy?

746
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,000
- When will you hold the party? - Are you really going to come?

747
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,355
Or is there someone you like among them?
