1
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:20,945
Is your stomach okay?

2
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:25,955
Yes, I think I feel better now.

3
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:31,755
Don't worry. You didn't make any drunken mistakes.

4
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:34,025
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,625
- I heard you carried me home. - What about it?

6
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,295
I'm sorry for the trouble.

7
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:44,375
Don't ever drink more than three shots when I'm not around.

8
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:46,475
What?

9
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:50,675
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

10
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:58,455
What does he mean by that?

11
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,955
I shouldn't let any other guy carry me home?

12
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,395
Aren't you taking this bus?

13
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,105
Oh, yes. I'm coming.

14
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:36,055
Hello.

15
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:38,555
- How have you been? - Good.

16
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,025
Who is he?

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,165
Once, I thought Mi Rae was a celebrity and followed her.

18
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,850
You even remember my name?

19
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,820
I remember because you're so pretty.

20
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,865
You probably don't remember my name.

21
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:52,535
- Your name? - I'm Kim Se Hoon.

22
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,445
Right, Se Hoon.

23
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:58,575
Mi Rae, are you on social media? Let's follow each other.

24
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,545
I don't do those things.

25
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:03,955
You should remember my name too.

26
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,255
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

27
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,085
Are you her boyfriend?

28
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,425
- Yes. - No.

29
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:13,880
You're Mi Rae's boyfriend?

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,225
- No. - Yes.

31
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:24,305
This is my stop. Have a good day.

32
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,875
Bye.

33
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,975
Why did you lie to him?

34
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,385
When did I lie?

35
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,415
I am a boy, not a girl. It's not like I'm your girl friend.

36
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:41,325
It's a good tactic to ward off...

37
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,285
those who bug you.

38
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:49,025
Why is he being like this? He's leading me on.

39
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:59,635
(Episode 10: I Can Be Your Boyfriend)

40
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,455
Her.

41
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,395
Do you like him?

42
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,595
Do you?

43
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,635
Don't let any other guy carry you home.

44
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:40,715
Hey.

45
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,315
Do you have feelings for me?

46
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,205
Stay focused, please.

47
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,450
Okay.

48
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,790
This is the last experiment of the semester.

49
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,330
Stay focused until the end of the class...

50
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,575
and be sure to submit your report by the end of the day.

51
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,315
- Got it. - Okay.

52
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:23,300
What's wrong?

53
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,170
I don't have last week's report.

54
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,455
What?

55
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:29,710
I'm sure you have it with you. Try looking again.

56
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:31,065
It's not here.

57
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,135
What should I do?

58
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,450
What's wrong with you today?

59
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,950
All our grades depend on that report.

60
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,175
And you're saying you lost it?

61
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:41,945
What are we going to do?

62
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:46,145
Should we just make it up?

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,745
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,355
My gosh.

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,455
Let's look for it again.

66
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,370
(The recrystallization of acetanilide)

67
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:32,155
(The heating time of benzoic acid and acetanilide)

68
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,065
Yes, it was 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

69
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,735
Yes, it was 2g. I remember now.

70
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:44,305
My goodness.

71
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,305
He's not only good looking, but he's a genius as well.

72
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,385
This is all we need, right?

73
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,855
Yes, sir.

74
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,685
Thanks.

75
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,510
Soo A, you should treat Kyung Seok to a meal.

76
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,855
Of course.

77
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,220
I'll go now.

78
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,505
I'll go with you.

79
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:23,705
Bye, Kyung Seok.

80
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,645
I was really startled because of the report.

81
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,785
I'll treat you to a meal later.

82
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,125
No, it's okay.

83
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:38,225
I'll just get you something at the school cafeteria.

84
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,195
At least let me buy you that.

85
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:44,350
We really picked a great team leader.

86
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,050
Well, that's not really true.

87
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,835
He only volunteered to do it because no one else wanted to.

88
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,390
Imagine how it would've been if you were the team leader.

89
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,790
What's wrong with me? Am I jealous right now?

90
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:55,375
My gosh.

91
00:06:58,164 --> 00:07:01,415
I was really upset after you left yesterday.

92
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:04,800
I just wanted to help you out because I figured...

93
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:06,715
you and I come from a similar background.

94
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,855
Plus, we both moved out and are living by ourselves now.

95
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,555
I thought both your parents passed away.

96
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,295
Why bother moving out?

97
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:20,495
My grandma nags a lot.

98
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:22,535
Do you feel better?

99
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,835
I know a restaurant that sells great hangover noodles.

100
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:26,875
Just a second.

101
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,990
We came to hand in our team's report.

102
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,430
You can leave it on my desk.

103
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,630
Okay.

104
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,645
Sorry. They also sell a lot of other delicious menus as well.

105
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,185
It's on me. Let's go eat there.

106
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,025
The next person in line can come in.

107
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:49,965
It's really delicious.

108
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,735
I'm glad you like it. Eat up.

109
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:54,635
Thank you.

110
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:00,535
How are things going with your fragrant candles?

111
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,005
I was planning on selling fragrant candles,

112
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,875
but it's not that easy, so I'm just going to get another part-time job.

113
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,055
Cheer up.

114
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:17,625
Thank you.

115
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,065
You should've added your photo.

116
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,210
Your appearance plays a big part when you're job searching.

117
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,265
You should know after the interview you did yesterday.

118
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,265
Looks don't get the work done.

119
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,935
Goodness, you guys look great together.

120
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,490
The sight of you two together is too much for my eyes.

121
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:38,690
Be careful.

122
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:39,860
Block your own eyes.

123
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,160
Stop joking around.

124
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,830
Are you guys finally going out?

125
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,115
No.

126
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,985
Eat up.

127
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,155
Gosh, I'm so jealous. Enjoy your meal.

128
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,165
Are you bothered by those kind of comments?

129
00:08:58,217 --> 00:08:59,495
I don't care.

130
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:00,935
Really?

131
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,435
I'd love to be so strong-minded like you...

132
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,145
so that I wouldn't have to care about what others say about me.

133
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,385
By the way,

134
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:18,815
are you not interested in dating anyone?

135
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,365
Do you not want a boyfriend?

136
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,750
I'm not really interested.

137
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,580
Why not? You're probably really popular.

138
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm not popular.

139
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:39,975
There are so many pretty girls out there.

140
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:43,945
You're the prettiest girl in our department.

141
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,045
Stop joking around.

142
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:51,115
I'm being serious.

143
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:59,025
Did I just make you feel uncomfortable?

144
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,395
No, that's not it.

145
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,995
But I'm sure you already know.

146
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:14,035
I did a lot of plastic surgery.

147
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:17,845
What's wrong with that?

148
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,145
You did it to become pretty, and now you're pretty.

149
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:27,485
What's weird about that?

150
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:33,955
Let's eat.

151
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,635
How weird.

152
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,095
What's weird?

153
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,065
You don't seem weak-minded...

154
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,035
seeing that you moved out to live on your own.

155
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:48,605
Although I don't know why you had to move out in the first place.

156
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,915
There's no special reason.

157
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:06,755
That's Mi Rae and Woo Young.

158
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,680
Thank you.

159
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:15,280
You really didn't have to buy me anything.

160
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,820
Stop thanking me. I only bought instant noodles.

161
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,275
But still...

162
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,520
You're making me want to treat you to another meal.

163
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:22,620
Pardon?

164
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,230
I need to get to class.

165
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,690
- Okay. - See you again.

166
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:26,975
See you.

167
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,070
Hello?

168
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,995
You applied for a part-time job, right?

169
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,825
Yes.

170
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,595
Yes, I can make it to the interview.

171
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,465
Okay, thank you.

172
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,375
Mi Rae.

173
00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:58,475
Did you eat?

174
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,530
Yes.

175
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,815
With whom?

176
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,245
Woo Young.

177
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,515
You guys must be really close.

178
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,725
Yes, we live in the same neighborhood.

179
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:12,495
Let's go home together later.

180
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:19,235
Kyung Seok and Woo Young live together.

181
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,090
I need to go somewhere.

182
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,120
Where?

183
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,350
I have an interview for a part-time job.

184
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,675
A part-time job?

185
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:29,920
Do they need more workers?

186
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,415
I'm not sure.

187
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,260
Can you ask them for me?

188
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:36,160
You can ask yourself. I'll give you the number.

189
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:37,855
I've never done anything like that before.

190
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,615
Please do me a favor. After all, we're friends.

191
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,880
I'll be off now.

192
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,225
See you guys later.

193
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,635
Kyung Seok, I wish you good luck this time.

194
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,090
If you're neighbors, does that mean you're close?

195
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,160
What?

196
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,475
You said you're close with Woo Young because you're neighbors.

197
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:11,015
I just said that because Soo A asked me a question.

198
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,330
Does that mean we're close as well?

199
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,155
That doesn't apply to you.

200
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,540
What?

201
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,755
I mean, we were already friends...

202
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,865
even before you moved into my neighborhood.

203
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,610
Then can I go to the interview with you?

204
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:27,635
- Are you seriously going to go? - Yes.

205
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:42,845
Why?

206
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,615
It's so weird.

207
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,725
Why?

208
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:04,805
Soo A.

209
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:07,675
I took a snap, but it looks like a photoshoot.

210
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,345
Look.

211
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,730
You seemed really startled earlier...

212
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,285
because of the report.

213
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,185
I would've been in big trouble if it weren't for Kyung Seok.

214
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:22,085
You must've been worried your grade might go down because me.

215
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,225
Don't say that.

216
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:28,465
But I hope you don't take pictures without asking me like this.

217
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,665
Isn't it a crime to take someone's pictures without their permission?

218
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,075
Soo A.

219
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,020
Do you think job interviews are a joke?

220
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,845
You can't bring your friend as you please like this.

221
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,575
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,145
Okay.

223
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:51,885
Bye.

224
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,885
What did he say? Did he tell us not to come?

225
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,025
No, he told us to come for now.

226
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,010
- You didn't do any part-time work? - No.

227
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,920
You can work only on holidays and weekends before the break.

228
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:11,235
That's right.

229
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:16,805
We'll work hard.

230
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,315
- Fill out the papers. - Pardon?

231
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:25,685
They're the employment contracts.

232
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:27,870
You'll get paid per day,

233
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:29,455
so make sure you write down your bank account correctly.

234
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:33,495
Thank you.

235
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:37,165
Get used to the product explanations beforehand.

236
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,465
- Okay. - Look at that guy.

237
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,165
He's too handsome to be human.

238
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,405
That girl's face isn't so realistic either.

239
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,285
- Doesn't it look delicious? - Yes.

240
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,585
Here.

241
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,625
No one would come at this hour. They all went home.

242
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,635
I'll just have it myself.

243
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:30,385
It's delicious.

244
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:42,125
Look at this lovey-dovey couple.

245
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:50,165
Since when did you start going out? Has it been a long time?

246
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:52,535
That's not it.

247
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,275
Is that right?

248
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:56,645
Can I join you guys then?

249
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,085
Hurry up. You said you aren't dating.

250
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,825
It's delicious. Keep it up.

251
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,435
- What are you reading? - I got a part-time job.

252
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,250
I have to learn this>

253
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,075
Can you memorize the details by reading that fast?

254
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:28,645
I'm good at memorizing.

255
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:33,415
I'll go to bed first.

256
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:35,545
Brush your teeth before you go to bed, or they'll rot.

257
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:48,395
Today's menu is delicious tuna sashimi.

258
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:50,625
Do you see this?

259
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,480
(Lovely Do has turned on her broadcast.)

260
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:56,535
(It's tuna sashimi this time.)

261
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,305
I'll take a piece...

262
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:03,445
and dip it into this soy sauce.

263
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,860
(I can't wait.)

264
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,260
(Is that expensive?)

265
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,900
(What are you eating?)

266
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:13,930
(Is that the limited edition bag in the back?)

267
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,285
(Awesome! How did you get that bag?)

268
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,670
I got it as a gift.

269
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,810
(The tuna sashimi has gone out of attention.)

270
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:24,040
(Why do you look upset after receiving such an expensive bag?)

271
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:26,535
(Are you sure you're a high schooler?)

272
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,805
(Kyung Seok)

273
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,645
Hold on.

274
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,015
- Hello? - Have you had dinner?

275
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,625
Who are you? Do you know me?

276
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,895
You sound all right. I'm relieved.

277
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,995
Who says you can feel relieved?

278
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:57,995
Why on earth did you move out?

279
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,135
Let's meet up and talk tomorrow.

280
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:08,360
Not tomorrow. I have to go work part-time.

281
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,420
What?

282
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,175
You're working part-time? Where?

283
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,445
At an interior design store? Where is it?

284
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:20,085
I'll call you again. Don't skip meals.

285
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:23,585
Brush your teeth before you go to bed, or they'll rot.

286
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,235
What is he saying?

287
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,550
Aren't we going anywhere during the break, my friend?

288
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,505
It's already late to book a place.

289
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,445
I don't think I can go.

290
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:48,345
I still have my hospital installments to pay.

291
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,700
I should at least earn some pocket money.

292
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:52,900
Let's make it cheap and short.

293
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,885
It's a shame to waste our time like this, isn't it?

294
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,665
Check everything you want to do from this list.

295
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,620
(Everything about views in Hong Kong)

296
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,980
(To the best nature in Hong Kong)

297
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,935
I want to do everything.

298
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,275
I'll earn money and go on a trip during my winter break for certain.

299
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:20,590
By the way, why are you putting on a facial mask...

300
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,945
when you're only going to work part-time?

301
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:26,655
Are you going on a blind date?

302
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:29,925
What?

303
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,050
Are you going on a blind date?

304
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:43,605
No, I'm going to work.

305
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:44,950
Did you write a contract?

306
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,935
You have to be careful on that.

307
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,945
I signed the contract already. Mi Rae was good at it.

308
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,645
Are you working part-time with her?

309
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,945
Yes, why?

310
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,015
Well...

311
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:05,225
I think you have to come home early today.

312
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,740
You have to clean the house, the toilet,

313
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,465
and the rooftop.

314
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:11,680
And you have to do the laundry too.

315
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:13,680
You told me to do the laundry once every two days.

316
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,035
Well...

317
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:18,505
I mean, the blankets. You have to wash the blankets.

318
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,620
I didn't know it was in the contract.

319
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,745
Sure, it's absolutely included in the contract.

320
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,615
- This feels somewhat evil. - What?

321
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,055
Evil?

322
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,225
You're becoming more rude as days go by.

323
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,035
Oh, hello.

324
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,805
Hi.

325
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,775
You didn't have to bring all these.

326
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:59,990
I felt sorry for having all the fun without giving you...

327
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:01,515
any housewarming gift last time.

328
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:05,385
I can't eat them all by myself.

329
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,555
Why would you do that?

330
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,355
You'll have them with Woo Young.

331
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,925
We're paying for our food expenses separately.

332
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:14,865
That's written in the contract.

333
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:18,780
I don't know about other stuff, but you shouldn't do that with food.

334
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,580
Two guys can finish this much food in a few days.

335
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:21,650
Right.

336
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:23,335
That's what the contract says.

337
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:34,575
We'll take care of this matter.

338
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:40,285
I still have to wash the blankets, right?

339
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:45,295
I think you can do it later.

340
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:06,675
This is grapefruit-scented, and the other is mandarin-scented.

341
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,485
Which one should I wear?

342
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:12,985
They're both fruit-scented.

343
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,385
Wear that perfume.

344
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:36,805
Ms. Na.

345
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,685
Hello.

346
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:47,000
I heard that both of you have a shift today. Get in.

347
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,655
You don't need to give us a ride.

348
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:57,695
Get in.

349
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:06,020
I'm sorry about the other day.

350
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:08,620
I drank more than I can handle.

351
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,405
Don't worry about it at all.

352
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:13,845
I even passed out and threw up here once when I got very drunk.

353
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:23,155
Oh, right.

354
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,440
Everyone at work gave positive feedback about the candle you sent.

355
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,625
I've been meaning to tell you, but I forgot.

356
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,010
Oh, really?

357
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:32,735
Everyone in our lab said that the scent ratio is amazing.

358
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:35,550
I think it'd be good for you to consult them in person.

359
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:37,380
I'd be so grateful for such an opportunity.

360
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:39,290
What time does your lunch break start?

361
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,105
Shall we have lunch together?

362
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:44,745
Well, I'm not sure when our lunch break is yet.

363
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:46,460
Is there anything you want to eat?

364
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,315
We're on our way to work now.

365
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,245
Yes, I know.

366
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,800
I shouldn't bother you guys when you're working.

367
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:54,355
I'll just drop you off and leave.

368
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,225
Okay.

369
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,125
What time will you be done though?

370
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:04,725
I just wanted to tell you to get home safely.

371
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,920
Hello.

372
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:19,260
Our showroom provides you with a one-stop shopping experience.

373
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:22,900
From doors to kitchen units, you'll find all furniture pieces here.

374
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:26,585
Please browse around and let me know if you have any questions.

375
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:28,240
Good. That was great.

376
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,200
Even when a customer asks you about something you don't know,

377
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:33,710
stay calm and friendly and keep a smile on your face.

378
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,465
You can just come and get me or ask anyone on the team for help.

379
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,610
- Are we all good? - Yes, sir.

380
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:42,120
And you two will get the same title as everyone else here.

381
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,905
You're our interior curators.

382
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:45,975
Everyone, let's get to work.

383
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:54,375
Thank you.

384
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:19,575
What are you doing here?

385
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:22,145
So you actually got a part-time job.

386
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:36,670
They want to know more about Kelun's targeted marketing strategy.

387
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:39,155
I prepared our corporate answer with regard to that.

388
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:40,795
Would you like to take a look?

389
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,965
You know that reading off this will make me look less credible.

390
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,420
You guys have been updating me on it,

391
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:51,405
so I'll just say what I think.

392
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:52,705
Okay.

393
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,590
Here's our menu.

394
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:55,905
Thank you.

395
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,775
Let me know when you're ready to order.

396
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:03,285
Then you'll come up with the corporate answer yourself...

397
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:05,370
Would he be around 20?

398
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,370
Pardon me?

399
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:09,425
He looks young. He must be a part-timer, right?

400
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:12,625
Well, he could be a full-time server.

401
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:15,595
He doesn't look that young. Why do you ask?

402
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:18,595
I was just curious.

403
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,560
Our meeting can be done by 4pm, right?

404
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,490
Yes, that's more than enough time.

405
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,015
Do you have another meeting after?

406
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,815
I have to go somewhere.

407
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:42,870
So she's your little sister.

408
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:44,925
I've been wondering who she is.

409
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,840
Do you two live together?

410
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,010
No.

411
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,140
Then where are you staying now?

412
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,265
I told you. I live with a senior from my school.

413
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,965
I'm not a senior. I'm a freshman as well.

414
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,375
It's nice to meet you.

415
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:03,945
Likewise, but I probably won't see you after this.

416
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:05,830
- Sorry? - After our dad's election,

417
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,315
I'll be going abroad to study...

418
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,645
to escape the school system here as my grades are bad.

419
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,815
Just stay if you don't want to go.

420
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,955
I'll try to talk to Dad again.

421
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,255
What do you want to eat?

422
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:28,535
I guess they don't have lunch sets.

423
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,320
I want pork cutlet as well as Hamburg steak.

424
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:33,650
Then let's get one each...

425
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,075
and share.

426
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:39,075
What about you?

427
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,975
I'll get pork cutlet too.

428
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:29,825
(Younglim Industrials)

429
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,415
I'll be off, then.

430
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:52,685
Go in first. I'm going to see her off.

431
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,540
It's okay. The bus stop is so close. You don't need to walk me there.

432
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,600
I'm off.

433
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,885
Kyung Hee.

434
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:59,225
Bye.

435
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,895
She's very independent.

436
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,905
Shall we go in?

437
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:45,475
Kyung Hee.

438
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:06,595
Pass me the white plates over there.

439
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:14,835
Why are you smiling like that?

440
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,305
I must say, you're quite sweet as a big brother.

441
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:23,945
Then you can call me a sweetheart.

442
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,245
- What? - Kyung Seok.

443
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,330
Spare me a moment.

444
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,645
Sure.

445
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,515
What was that about?

446
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:37,385
I had no idea he could be that cheesy.

447
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:42,025
Has everything been well with you?

448
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,435
You must be surprised.

449
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:52,405
I know that this is very sudden.

450
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:57,845
I'm sorry.

451
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,145
The moment I saw you,

452
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:03,085
all I could think was that I had to talk to you.

453
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:04,885
Why are you back?

454
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,225
What do you want to say after all those years?

455
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:15,865
I want to say that I'm sorry.

456
00:32:21,452 --> 00:32:23,105
I'm sorry about everything.

457
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:27,505
I should've took you guys with me at all costs back then.

458
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,945
Everything I say will sound like an excuse.

459
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:33,215
- But... - "But"?

460
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,745
Ma'am.

461
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,530
Whatever you say now...

462
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,485
won't change the fact that you abandoned us.

463
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,455
Just because of a man.

464
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:46,895
You had an affair and left your kids and husband for another man.

465
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,925
It's a fact, and it won't change.

466
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:52,435
I had an affair?

467
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:54,410
What are you talking about?

468
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,335
I guess that face can't charm men anymore.

469
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,775
What's with that look on your face?

470
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:06,745
Why are you acting like a victim?

471
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,845
You should pity me.

472
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:11,985
Me...

473
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,185
and Kyung Seok.

474
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,725
I pity our lives.

475
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:32,975
Crying won't solve anything.

476
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,485
Kyung Seok.

477

(Younglim Industrials)

478
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,535
Bye.

479
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:10,145
Mi Rae, are you getting off work?

480
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:11,845
Yes.

481
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,045
- How's the work? - It's okay.

482
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,615
Do you have time?

483
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,315
No, I'm sorry. My friend's waiting for me.

484
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:23,385
Let's go.

485
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:25,325
What did he say?

486
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:27,825
Mr. Park?

487
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:30,965
He asked if the job's okay and that he'll treat me to a meal.

488
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:32,865
Let's go.

489
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:42,920
Five days' worth of pay will be enough to last me a month.

490
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,475
(Younglim Corporation wired 100 dollars to your bank account.)

491
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,045
- You need to pay rent, right? - Yes.

492
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,000
- How much do you need to pay? - 70 dollars.

493
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:52,655
- A month? - Yes.

494
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,425
That's so cheap.

495
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:59,355
Woo Young's practically letting you live there for free.

496
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:01,940
I do all the housework.

497
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:04,180
I think he's making you do all the housework...

498
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:05,935
so that you won't have to pay that much.

499
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:08,165
What a nice offer.

500
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:10,265
He's such a nice senior.

501
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:19,590
Hello?

502
00:35:19,597 --> 00:35:21,715
- Are you done? - Yes.

503
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,945
Hurry up and come home. You have a lot of work to do.

504
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:29,555
Are you hungry?

505
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:32,825
Then I'll buy some pork belly on the way.

506
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:37,065
Do you pay for food?

507
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:38,895
We share whatever we buy.

508
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,005
By the way,

509
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:46,435
where can I buy pork belly?

510
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,575
What?

511
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:57,315
Why is he going to buy pork belly when we have Korean beef?

512
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,555
- I'd like some pork belly, please. - Okay.

513
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:06,095
No, not that one. We'll take the one behind that.

514
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:09,495
Thank you.

515
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:12,835
Thank you.

516
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,365
Why did you choose this one?

517
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:21,305
It's not good when the color of the fat is yellow.

518
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:23,845
It needs to be light pink like this one.

519
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,545
Where did you learn stuff like that?

520
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:28,530
This is all basic knowledge.

521
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,445
I went grocery shopping with my mom ever since I was young.

522
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,270
Are you going to buy vegetables for wraps?

523
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,585
Yes.

524
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:53,575
Mi Rae gets drunk over three glasses of soju.

525
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:56,505
And he gets drunk over two.

526
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:16,195
Did... Did you take Mi Rae home safely?

527
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:19,265
Yes, I tucked her in bed.

528
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:22,905
What?

529
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:39,715
(Morning Dew, Pure Wave)

530
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,880
- You should come too. - Me?

531
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,665
I got a job thanks to you, so I should treat you to a meal.

532
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:54,865
I guess I should buy some more pork belly.

533
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:58,405
Hyun Jung will be waiting for me at home.

534
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:00,635
Then tell her to come as well.

535
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:05,675
Why is he being so kind?

536
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:09,660
- Do Sang Won... - Do Sang Won...

537
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:12,485
- will brighten your lives! - will brighten your lives!

538
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,870
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

539
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,585
Thank you for your work.

540
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:19,155
- Good luck, sir. - Thanks.

541
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:32,535
Can we talk?

542
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:35,975
You're not as well-mannered as you used to be.

543
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:39,945
You're the one who's ill-mannered for lying to our children...

544
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:41,730
that their mother...

545
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:45,415
left home because she had an affair with some other guy.

546
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,285
I have people working for me here.

547
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:50,385
Will you please excuse us?

548
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,855
This won't be any beneficial for his election.

549
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:56,865
Please excuse us.

550
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:58,465
Okay, sir.

551
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,045
Kyung Seok, you're pretty good now. Did you practice?

552
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,185
No.

553
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:19,355
What's so hard about this?

554
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:21,985
He picked up pretty quickly after a few lessons.

555
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:23,785
He just doesn't know a lot of stuff.

556
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:25,455
I'll do it now.

557
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,295
I'm not dumb. I know...

558
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,565
you made up stories about me...

559
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:35,035
so that things will work to your advantage.

560
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,735
I held things in...

561
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,505
because I felt sorry toward the kids, not you.

562
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:43,345
But this is way out of line.

563
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,515
I don't care what others think about me,

564
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:49,285
but I can't stand my kids getting the wrong idea about me.

565
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:52,985
The wrong idea?

566
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:55,755
What exactly is wrong?

567
00:39:57,408 --> 00:39:58,570
Are you asking because you don't know?

568
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:00,595
What's the point of correcting the story?

569
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:02,495
Do you think anything will change?

570
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:06,365
This is a fact that will never change.

571
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,935
Regardless of what the reason was, their mom still abandoned them.

572
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,605
And their dad is the one who protected them until now.

573
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:14,805
That will never change.

574
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,545
You're way too brazen.

575
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:26,685
Do you want me to leave it to the public...

576
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:29,585
to judge what you did to me...

577
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:31,525
by stating the facts?

578
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:37,740
Are you threatening me right now?

579
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:40,365
You're thinking of it that way because you have something to hide.

580
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:42,350
What do you say?

581
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:45,835
I'd wreck your entire career if I could have things my way.

582
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,575
I'm giving you a chance.

583
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,205
Tell our kids...

584
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:53,075
the truth.

585
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,695
- It's so delicious. - I know.

586
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:09,140
How can pork belly taste so good?

587
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:10,865
It's good, right? Eat up.

588
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:12,180
Why are you acting like you did them a favor?

589
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,935
Can't you see that I'm grilling the meat?

590
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:18,420
I'm sure it's good-quality meat,

591
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:21,490
but I think it tastes better because Woo Young's grilling it for us.

592
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:23,405
I agree. You grill meat so well.

593
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,585
Here.

594
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:33,685
Have a glass of soju.

595
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,155
Mi Rae probably won't drink any.

596
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,955
I don't want any either. I prefer cola when I eat meat.

597
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:42,495
- You're going to drink, right? - No, I don't feel like it today.

598
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,395
Why?

599
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:46,695
Is it because you collapsed after two shots?

600
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:51,935
What... What are you talking about?

601
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:53,375
Me? You?

602
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:57,705
I... I only fell asleep because it was time to sleep.

603
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,445
You must have low stamina.

604
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:04,085
Did you just question my stamina?

605
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:06,770
My nickname is Yeon Stamina.

606
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,055
- Do you mean Weak Stamina? - Was that a joke?

607
00:42:09,206 --> 00:42:11,440
That was really lame.

608
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,570
It wasn't a joke.

609
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:14,825
I saw you collapse after you drank two glasses of soju.

610
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:20,965
Kyung Seok.

611
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:23,905
One's ability to drink has nothing to do with stamina.

612
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:25,320
There are guys who can drink...

613
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:28,490
even though they're really skinny and weak like you.

614
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:29,845
What did you just say?

615
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,345
What's going on right now?

616
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,170
Judging by the conversation,

617
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,825
it seems like we should hold a stamina competition.

618
00:42:45,176 --> 00:42:47,210
- What? - You guys should arm wrestle...

619
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:48,595
like a man.

620
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:52,695
Gosh, come on. His arm will break.

621
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:54,965
You must be scared.

622
00:42:58,622 --> 00:43:01,190
Gosh, stop babbling with your mouth.

623
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:02,945
Just show us who's stronger by arm wrestling.

624
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:07,160
You guys are both right-handed, right?

625
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,615
- Yes. - Yes.

626
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,300
Okay, then that's a fair fight.

627
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:12,785
I think Woo Young will win. What about you?

628
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,055
I'm not sure.

629
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:22,595
I'm not sure.

630
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:29,365
I really don't want anyone to get hurt because of me.

631
00:43:30,387 --> 00:43:32,135
You have no important schedule tomorrow, right?

632
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:34,605
You'll be in pain for a while.

633
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,645
Kyung Hee, your father is home.

634
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,510
One might break his arm at this rate.

635
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:35,865
This is fun. Do you want to try a round with me?

636
00:44:37,388 --> 00:44:38,735
It's coming.

637
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:42,375
Gosh, it's so nerve-racking.

638
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,020
- A little more. - Go for it.

639
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:45,345
Almost there.

640
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:58,625
I told you Woo Young would win.

641
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:03,895
You're stronger than I thought though.

642
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:07,180
Don't be so down.

643
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,735
You couldn't beat me, but you can beat others later.

644
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,175
Right, Kyung Seok. You did a good job.

645
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:18,745
Why would you depress him even more by saying that?

646
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,225
Anyway, she was the one who left you behind.

647
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:34,255
Still, I wouldn't have had to resent her that much.

648
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,695
I thought...

649
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:41,165
she was such a horrible person.

650
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,905
Why did you make me keep that prejudice?

651
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:47,335
Who are you...

652
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:50,475
to turn my mom into that kind of a person?

653
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:53,075
Get out.

654
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:54,845
Get out.

655
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:01,415
Let's talk later once you calm down.

656
00:46:21,425 --> 00:46:22,820
We're leaving, bye.

657
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:24,745
- Are you leaving? - Yes.

658
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,915
Thank you for the meal, bye.

659
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,640
Go home safely.

660
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:39,440
- Bye. - Goodbye.

661
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:40,825
Come again.

662
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,735
I can do it today if you want.

663
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:50,405
It's okay.

664
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:57,545
Is your arm okay? If it hurts, go see a doctor.

665
00:47:09,506 --> 00:47:11,155
- Here. - Thanks.

666
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:17,480
Kyung Seok seemed like he was in a bad mood.

667
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,480
I guess arm-wrestling is a big deal in the world of men.

668
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:23,465
It may be a bigger deal if it's in front of someone he likes.

669
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:28,675
No matter how much I see it, he looked like he had feelings for you.

670
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,645
It's because he's finally got a friend after a long time.

671
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:36,445
Still, what will you do...

672
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,615
if he does like you?

673
00:47:40,637 --> 00:47:43,825
No one would dare reject someone so handsome like him.

674
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:52,065
Someone so handsome like him isn't my type of man.

675
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,835
My ideal type of man...

676
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:58,905
is someone with an average appearance...

677
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:01,575
who is okay with my past plastic surgeries.

678
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:04,260
Someone who isn't so tall,

679
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:06,075
so rich,

680
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,245
or so popular.

681
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:13,515
That's pretty picky.

682
00:48:14,304 --> 00:48:15,585
Right?

683
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:18,225
What kind of guy do you like then?

684
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:24,065
Someone who looks neat?

685
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:26,965
For example?

686
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:30,265
Well...

687
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,735
Someone like Woo Young.

688
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:37,375
You're right.

689
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,715
Woo Young fits that criteria.

690
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:47,455
Don't you think your standard is a bit too high?

691
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,170
I know.

692
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:51,840
This must be why both of us can't date anyone.

693
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:53,195
Don't you think so?

694
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:55,095
Tell me about it.

695
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:11,745
Hello?

696
00:49:12,362 --> 00:49:13,675
Hey, this is Soo A.

697
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,515
What's up?

698
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:18,585
I'm calling just because I'm bored.

699
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,355
Have you decided to work part-time with Kyung Seok?

700
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,125
Yes.

701
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:32,995
I have something to tell you.

702
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,265
Spare me some time to talk on Monday.

703
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:37,565
See you at school.

704
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:49,115
Who was it?

705
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,285
- Hyun Soo A. - That weird girl?

706
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:54,115
I think she's really weird.

707
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:58,025
I just can't believe she invited Yong Chul over without knowing.

708
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,295
Sir, this is bad.

709
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:14,075
I think Kyung Hee has run away from home.

710
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:25,515
Did you have a good night?

711
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:26,970
It's the last holiday before the election.

712
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,085
Your schedule today is busier than any other days.

713
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:31,825
Kyung Hee ran away from home.

714
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,225
What?

715
00:50:33,944 --> 00:50:36,525
Look for her quietly without letting others know.

716
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:38,295
Okay, sir.

717
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:00,085
He's so handsome again.

718
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:20,535
He's so handsome again.

719
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:25,445
This isn't an ordinary sight of someone going to work.

720
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:39,425
Why are you standing there?

721
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:47,765
Oh, I'm coming.

722
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,075
You seemed to be in a bad mood yesterday.

723
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:01,415
Are you feeling better now?

724
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:05,515
Actually,

725
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:07,755
I went easy on him.

726
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:10,425
He lets me stay in his house for a cheap amount of rent,

727
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,085
so I should do that much.

728
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:17,695
I see. Okay.

729
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,435
Just a second.

730
00:52:25,155 --> 00:52:27,935
- Hi, Mom. - Do you have another shift today?

731
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:31,475
We're on our way to your place now to drop off some side dishes.

732
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:33,145
Does she have to work again today?

733
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:36,030
She probably doesn't even make much a day.

734
00:52:36,032 --> 00:52:37,445
She gets 100 dollars a day.

735
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:40,885
All right, then. Take it easy.

736
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,825
- Shall we visit her at work? - Gosh.

737
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:48,495
Do you know where it is?

738
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:50,225
I sure do.

739
00:52:58,388 --> 00:52:59,765
Feel free to browse around.

740
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:02,675
Mi Rae.

741
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:06,560
Mom, what are you doing here?

742
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:07,790
Why do you think we're here?

743
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:10,285
We wanted to visit you at work.

744
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,585
You should've acted like a customer. You're making her uncomfortable.

745
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:16,215
Hello.

746
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:28,535
Oh, Mom. He's my friend from school.

747
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:31,605
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

748
00:53:33,557 --> 00:53:34,875
Hello.

749
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:39,045
What's your relationship with Mi Rae?

750
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:43,175
She just said they're friends.

751
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,415
Yes, she's my closest friend in our department.

752
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:52,785
Excuse me.

753
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,195
Yes, ma'am.

754
00:54:02,652 --> 00:54:05,305
Does this chair come in different colors by any chance?

755
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:13,875
Shouldn't a guy like him become an actor?

756
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:17,345
How can someone be that handsome?

757
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:19,285
That is just not fair.

758
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:20,955
All right.

759
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:23,170
- We'll get going, then. - Okay.

760
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:26,085
- I'll call you later. - All right, go back inside.

761
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:27,695
- Bye. - Bye.

762
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:31,995
See? Don't you think the surgery was a good idea?

763
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,965
She can be friends with a guy like that now that she's pretty.

764
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,580
Isn't that girl who just walked by a Gangnam beauty?

765
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:42,075
Totally. She's a typical Gangnam beauty.

766
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:01,595
Not even just a beauty. They called her a Gangnam beauty.

767
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:03,480
Gosh, everyone is so obsessed with Gangnam.

768
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,465
People associate everything nice with Gangnam.

769
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,480
- Let's go to a department store. - What?

770
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:09,835
Actually, should I go to a hair salon first?

771
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:13,790
I must make sure I look good enough to call myself Mi Rae's mom.

772
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,935
I want to look like those ladies in Gangnam.

773
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:21,345
I'm due for a haircut too.

774
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:24,745
Mi Rae.

775
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,415
Good work today.

776
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,485
- I guess you work out a lot. - Sorry?

777
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:31,955
You look very fit.

778
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:44,705
What did he say? Did he ask you out for a meal again?

779
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:47,605
No, he asked me if I find anything stressful.

780
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:49,475
Let's go.

781
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,285
Hello?

782
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:06,025
Did something happen?

783
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:15,395
You must've resented me to the point...

784
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:17,935
that you can't even talk about it.

785
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:20,735
Kyung Hee is right.

786
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:24,175
Regardless of what I say now,

787
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:25,875
nothing will change.

788
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,275
I can keep apologizing, but it doesn't mean...

789
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:33,015
I can go back to that time and hold you two in my arms.

790
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:38,325
I can't turn back the hands of time and change what happened.

791
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:40,855
But...

792
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:43,480
I want you to know that I didn't leave...

793
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,525
you and Kyung Hee for another man.

794
00:56:46,816 --> 00:56:48,735
That is really not true.

795
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,435
I'm sorry.

796
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:58,145
It must've been much harder for you two.

797
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:01,475
In all those years...

798
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:04,445
It must've been so tough.

799
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,455
Yes, it was hard.

800
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:18,225
And I did resent you a little.

801
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:26,135
But you see,

802
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,945
I don't want any of us to be in such pain anymore.

803
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,285
Mom.

804
00:58:13,002 --> 00:58:14,315
Thanks.

805
00:58:16,439 --> 00:58:17,925
Thanks so much.

806
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:25,995
And I'm sorry.

807
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:29,595
I must look shameless now.

808
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:34,675
I'm sorry that I can't hide how happy I am.

809
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:02,965
Did something happen to Ms. Na?

810
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:05,405
No, she's fine.

811
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,575
I see. I'm glad she's fine.

812
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,645
By the way,

813
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:18,545
- do people cry out of joy? - What?

814
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:20,485
Have you ever cried tears of joy?

815
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:27,425
Yes, I have. When I found out that I got into Hankook University.

816
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:32,025
Why do you ask? It's never happened to you?

817
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:34,095
I'm not sure.

818
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:38,165
I guess you've never been that happy.

819
00:59:38,454 --> 00:59:39,765
Maybe not.

820
00:59:41,524 --> 00:59:42,875
Shall we go?

821
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:55,455
I'm not sure if it's enough to make me cry, but...

822
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:57,355
What?

823
00:59:58,274 --> 01:00:00,025
I'm happy that we met again like this.

824
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,665
Do you really have feelings for me?

825
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:09,395
If you keep doing this, I'll totally fall for you.

826
01:00:11,187 --> 01:00:13,165
Hyun Jung must be waiting for me.

827
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:14,975
Let's hurry.

828
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:31,755
I'm at school now. Where are you?

829
01:00:51,494 --> 01:00:52,945
How's your part-time job going?

830
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:56,515
It's been pretty good.

831
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:00,915
Will Kyung Seok keep working there as well?

832
01:01:01,738 --> 01:01:03,085
I think so.

833
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:08,755
Do they need another part-timer by any chance?

834
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,310
- What? - I think it'll be fun...

835
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:12,765
to work with you and Kyung Seok.

836
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:20,775
What's wrong? Will that make you uncomfortable?

837
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:25,045
No, it's not that.

838
01:01:26,362 --> 01:01:27,975
I'll look into it for you.

839
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:33,285
To tell you the truth,

840
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:36,915
I like Kyung Seok.

841
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:44,665
Can you help me?

842
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,195
Well...

843
01:01:49,152 --> 01:01:52,005
I don't think I can help you with it.

844
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:53,465
Why not?

845
01:01:53,523 --> 01:01:56,935
I'm asking you because you're his closest friend.

846
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:00,375
Do you...

847
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,415
have a crush on him too?

848
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:08,285
No way. Do you?

849
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:10,755
What's the problem?

850
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:13,425
Am I not allowed to like him or what?

851
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:18,325
You won't need my help.

852
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:22,510
You're bright, active, and pretty.

853
01:02:22,518 --> 01:02:24,065
You're pretty too.

854
01:02:24,921 --> 01:02:26,235
What?

855
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:27,950
Are you guys going out?

856
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:29,835
Why do you think so?

857
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:32,745
You're popular among guys as well...

858
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:34,645
because you're pretty.

859
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:39,885
I think...

860
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:43,355
it's a blessing to be pretty, don't you think?

861
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:48,355
People naturally like you.

862
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,995
That must be why those who aren't blessed...

863
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:55,795
get plastic surgeries to enjoy that kind of benefit,

864
01:02:57,954 --> 01:03:00,565
harming the ones who were born pretty.

865
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,905
Harm?

866
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:05,645
I mean,

867
01:03:05,695 --> 01:03:07,760
pretty faces become less rare...

868
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,645
because of plastic surgeries.

869
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,995
I thought I was mistaken...

870
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:26,325
and that I was at fault for judging you in a bad way.

871
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:28,935
But I wasn't mistaken.

872
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:34,635
You've hated me...

873
01:03:35,725 --> 01:03:37,005
from the beginning.

874
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,005
