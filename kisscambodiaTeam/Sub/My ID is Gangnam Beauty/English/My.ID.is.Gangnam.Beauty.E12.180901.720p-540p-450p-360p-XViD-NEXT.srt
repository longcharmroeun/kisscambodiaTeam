1
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:13,145
Mi Rae.

2
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,095
If...

3
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:30,905
something like that happens to you again,

4
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:36,605
I'll get involved without punching someone.

5
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:41,275
That will be okay, right?

6
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:49,185
If you keep saying things like that,

7
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,025
I'll get the wrong idea.

8
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,525
About what?

9
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,765
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

10
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,535
Never mind.

11
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,605
Get going. I'm going to head in.

12
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:24,885
Do you have...

13
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:31,195
any feelings for me?

14
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:33,495
What?

15
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:49,015
No, it's not that.

16
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:52,785
If...

17
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:57,385
If you're offended by how I jumped to conclusions like that, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:57,507 --> 00:02:01,070
But I've never thought of you more than a friend, so don't worry.

19
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,525
What? "Worry"?

20
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:04,680
That's not what I meant.

21
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,195
We're friends, you know.

22
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:09,735
I really think of you just as a friend.

23
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,535
100 percent.

24
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:17,805
Hey.

25
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,415
By any chance, do you...

26
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,515
Do you have a crush on someone else?

27
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:30,455
No, I don't have a crush on anyone.

28
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:37,025
See you tomorrow. I'm going to head in.

29
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,085
Do you have...

30
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,825
any feelings for me?

31
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,655
No.

32
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,765
No, don't think about it.

33
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,435
I've already given up.

34
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:51,505
I can't date Kyung Seok.

35
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,775
I don't want my life to get messed up again.

36
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,175
Did something happen? You seem upset.

37
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,605
There's no alcohol.

38
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,730
Oh, I noticed you didn't clean today.

39
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,585
I did it for you, so don't forget from now on.

40
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:41,655
I'll just pay the full rent going forward,

41
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:43,855
so let's divide the housework.

42
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:49,995
Your part-time job must pay you a lot.

43
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:57,065
What's with him?

44
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,385
We're friends, you know.

45
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:16,285
I really think of you just as a friend.

46
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:18,955
100 percent.

47
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:32,435
(Episode 12: Don't you have feelings for me?)

48
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,590
What's wrong?

49
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,215
What? No, it's nothing.

50
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:49,555
What am I going to do if I run into him?

51
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,055
What am I supposed to say?

52
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,670
- Hey, it's a special lecture. - It must be held by Kelun.

53
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:56,740
When's the lecture?

54
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:58,395
It doesn't say.

55
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:01,350
Does that mean we can meet Ms. Na Hye Sung in person?

56
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,680
I can't wait.

57
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,020
It sounds fun.

58
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,180
I'm glad I didn't enroll for classes during the summer vacation.

59
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,405
Do you think Woo Young will be attending as well?

60
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,105
If you like him so much, you should doll yourself up like me.

61
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,430
That's not my true self.

62
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,130
I don't want to seduce him by putting on an act.

63
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,615
Did you just say "seduce"?

64
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:22,785
That word really doesn't suit you.

65
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,325
Hey.

66
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,170
You put up a banner for me?

67
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:30,095
Of course. It was the least I could do for someone so great.

68
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,425
I didn't think I'd be nervous.

69
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,495
But I am now that I'm here.

70
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,435
Are you going to sing?

71
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,150
Will they make me sing?

72
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,205
Of course. Kids these days are very difficult to deal with.

73
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,415
Hearing you say that actually made me pull myself together.

74
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,330
I wish you good luck.

75
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,685
Good luck.

76
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,515
What should I do?

77
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:00,855
Are you sure Woo Young's going to be here?

78
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:04,025
Gosh, stop talking about him. I'm sure he'll be here.

79
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:19,905
("A Scent That Will Make People Turn Their Heads and Remember You")

80
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,685
I guess the power of genetics really is incredible.

81
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:28,185
My mother-in-law's so beautiful.

82
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:31,255
Since when did she become your mother-in-law?

83
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:35,095
Since today.

84
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:39,825
I can see where Kyung Seok got his handsome looks.

85
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,695
His mom's beautiful,

86
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,635
but Kyung Seok isn't that good-looking.

87
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,850
He and I are pretty much on the same level.

88
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:48,375
We're both tall as well.

89
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,635
Do you have any conscience at all?

90
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:58,630
I'm sure you all know who she is, but I'll still introduce her to you.

91
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,500
She's a proud graduate of Hankook University's chemistry department...

92
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:03,585
and the CEO of Kelun Korea. She's Ms. Na Hye Sung.

93
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,825
I'm glad to meet you all. My name's Na Hye Sung.

94
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:19,035
Where's Kyung Seok?

95
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:20,820
His mom came to school...

96
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:23,435
to do a lecture, but he's not even here.

97
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,060
Our manager desperately waited for you to come,

98
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,455
but he went to a seminar abroad.

99
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:38,400
I might not be as good as him, but can I still give it a try?

100
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:41,195
I don't care as long as you pay me.

101
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:43,595
Thank you for trusting me.

102
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:44,940
Do I get paid right away?

103
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:47,225
Yes, you'll get paid as soon as you're done.

104
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,135
Let's begin.

105
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,035
You have a girlfriend, right?

106
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:57,405
I hope she'll like it.

107
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:01,130
But then again, it must not matter since you're so good-looking.

108
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,845
Even an afro would look like a fashion trend on you.

109
00:09:07,103 --> 00:09:10,200
What I meant to say is that a person's look...

110
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:13,500
is what actually completes the hairstyle.

111
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,295
I won't do an afro on you. I'm not crazy.

112
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:19,665
Perfume always comes last.

113
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:22,710
Let me explain. When you get ready to go out,

114
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:25,250
you put on your clothes, do your hair, and put makeup on.

115
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:28,435
And nobody puts on perfume before doing any of those things.

116
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:31,490
However, there are times when this invisible last step...

117
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:34,115
ends up lingering in people's memories for a very long time.

118
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:37,130
It's hard to remember a certain person's hairstyle...

119
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,185
or outfit from a long time ago.

120
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,370
But you do remember their smell,

121
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,555
and that stays in your head along with that person's image.

122
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,895
This is yours, isn't it?

123
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,135
You can wear that perfume.

124
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:59,305
When you smell the steam coming from a new batch of rice,

125
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:01,535
you're reminded of your mother who lives back home.

126
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,960
And when you smell the perfume you used to wear a long time ago,

127
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:07,175
you're reminded of how you used to feel back then.

128
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:10,090
I'm not sure...

129
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,085
how you'll remember me...

130
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,865
That's Kyung Seok.

131
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:29,395
I have to say, he kind of puts himself in the spotlight.

132
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:50,655
I'm not sure how you'll remember me after this lecture.

133
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:53,440
- Don't ever dye your hair like him. - But I hope...

134
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:54,540
you'll at least remember...

135
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:57,355
- It doesn't look good on him. - what I told you about scent.

136
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,210
If you wish to take part in our company program,

137
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,935
please send in your applications.

138
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,165
I'll end my lecture here.

139
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,290
- Thank you for the lecture. - Thank you for the lecture.

140
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,615
Thank you.

141
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:24,170
Your finals are coming up, right?

142
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:25,200
Yes.

143
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:27,555
Is everything okay?

144
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:29,455
What do you mean?

145
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,525
Well...

146
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:33,395
What's your plan for the summer?

147
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:35,035
Are you going to apply for the program?

148
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,505
I'll think about it.

149
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:41,805
Okay, but I hope you do apply.

150
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,175
I'll see you.

151
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,545
Is he going through late adolescence?

152
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,885
What's up with him?

153
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:00,355
Girls get their hair done after they go through a break up.

154
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,025
I wonder if it's something similar.

155
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,535
Sorry.

156
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,045
You dyed your hair.

157
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,445
Yes.

158
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,745
- It looks pretty. - I didn't do it to look pretty.

159
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, sorry. It looks great.

160
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,685
I didn't do it to look great.

161
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:34,840
Oh, really? Then I guess you just did it for no reason.

162
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,395
Not exactly.

163
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:40,810
Well, okay.

164
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:43,765
I'll go now. See you. Good luck on your exams.

165
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:48,875
Why did I wish him good luck? The exams haven't even started yet.

166
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:51,005
This is driving me crazy.

167
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,815
Do you think he's getting ready to become a celebrity?

168
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,000
His personality isn't fit to be a celebrity.

169
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,155
What's wrong with Kyung Seok's personality?

170
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:04,040
It's not normal.

171
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,925
He'll never do as he's told.

172
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:08,340
With Kyung Seok's good looks,

173
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,855
his manager should be the one following Kyung Seok's orders.

174
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:15,465
Do you still like Kyung Seok?

175
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,435
To be honest,

176
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,905
I gave up on him.

177
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:23,775
I'm done.

178
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:29,745
But he's too good-looking to erase from my heart.

179
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:34,585
I know you guys also have a small crush on him as well.

180
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,355
Aren't I correct?

181
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:54,475
Be honest with me. My cooking was terrible, wasn't it?

182
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,145
You can be honest with me.

183
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:03,275
It wasn't that bad.

184
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,685
By the way, Kyung Hee. Will you take a look at this?

185
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,555
- Is that Kyung Seok? - Yes.

186
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,980
I didn't want to sound too nagging,

187
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,225
so I couldn't ask him why he dyed his hair.

188
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:23,465
He's not the type who cares about how he looks.

189
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:25,065
I wonder what's gotten into him.

190
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:27,350
Maybe he's dating someone.

191
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:28,875
Do you think so?

192
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,445
Or maybe he got his heart broken by someone.

193
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:36,545
By whom?

194
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,755
Thanks.

195
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:47,655
I want you to write me a receipt.

196
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:51,225
You said a verbal agreement wouldn't be effective.

197
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,650
I see you've gotten used to the life in the society now.

198
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,410
Didn't I say that I learn everything quickly?

199
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,220
It's partly thanks to my useful tips.

200
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,805
It's not cool to take credit.

201
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:05,345
- How cool of you. - Aren't you writing me a receipt?

202
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,215
Did you do a modeling for a hair salon?

203
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,285
How did you know?

204
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,470
I told you I've done almost every part-time job.

205
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,040
(Do Kyung Seok has paid...)

206
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,940
I thought you wouldn't do such a thing with your personality.

207
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,625
Did you not like doing house chores that much?

208
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,595
Or did you have a change in mind?

209
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:35,175
Don't act like you know everything about me.

210
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,205
He changed his hair color again.

211
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,690
I got this question wrong.

212
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:56,815
The finals are finally over!

213
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:02,155
The finals are over, so how about we go play games?

214
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,955
Deal. Let's get it.

215
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,785
Let's go.

216
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:08,025
I'm free.

217
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,710
Why don't we go eat something delicious?

218
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:13,510
Let's not eat near school. I want to go somewhere far away.

219
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,465
Let's go.

220
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,165
Let's go.

221
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,535
Hello, Ms. Na.

222
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:28,915
Yes, I'm done with my finals.

223
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:33,645
Okay.

224
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,255
Didn't I gain weight?

225
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,285
I ate too much because I was stressed out during the finals.

226
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:40,885
No, you didn't.

227
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,095
You say that all the time.

228
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,695
How did you do on your finals?

229
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:46,995
- Hello. - Hi.

230
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:50,695
About going on a field trip to Kyung Seok's mother's company...

231
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,705
Are there senior applicants?

232
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:55,475
- Not that I know of. - Is that right?

233
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,250
It might be quite awkward then.

234
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,805
Are you going to apply for it?

235
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:02,975
Never mind, it wouldn't look good for me to be there.

236
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,145
Are you still sulky?

237
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,585
Goodness. Bye.

238
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:12,025
Bye.

239
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,855
- What did you just do? - What?

240
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,010
Don't you know that he spoke ill of me for being fat?

241
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:20,240
How could you talk with him like nothing happened?

242
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,895
But it's not like I'm never going to see him again.

243
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,865
Kyung Seok turned him into a mop.

244
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,490
Even classmates care for each other.

245
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,975
What's up with you?

246
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,105
Tae Hee.

247
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:35,145
Tae Hee, let's go eat something delicious.

248
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,415
Tae...

249
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,415
Gosh, it's tiring.

250
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:49,695
Dong Won, you must've been really hungry.

251
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,995
Sorry I couldn't take care of you because I was busy with my finals.

252
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:56,895
Is it good?

253
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:03,735
Hi, Dong Won.

254
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:08,660
Guys, I think...

255
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,145
the beauty in my department really has a crush on me.

256
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,945
That's only your delusion.

257
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:16,355
No, I'm telling you. The name of her cat...

258
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,185
is the same with my name.

259
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,655
Maybe your name is Na Bi or Kitty.

260
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,110
It's rarely used to name a cat.

261
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,525
It's for people.

262
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:27,725
Can this be a coincidence?

263
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:29,850
Can you still say that she doesn't like me?

264
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:33,235
(Can you still say that she doesn't like me?)

265
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,375
It must've been hard studying for your finals.

266
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:42,015
Eat up.

267
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:43,975
Thank you.

268
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:47,900
Let me do it.

269
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:50,400
Moms usually do this kind of stuff.

270
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:51,785
Eat up already.

271
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,525
Thank you.

272
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,995
By the way, didn't you want to say something to me?

273
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:06,335
Actually, I have a question.

274
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:10,975
Nothing special has happened to Kyung Seok, right?

275
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:17,375
I don't think so.

276
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,715
Then why did he do that to his hair?

277
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:23,785
According to Kyung Hee, he isn't interested in his looks.

278
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:26,555
I'm not so sure about that,

279
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:29,210
but he's dyed his hair back to black.

280
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:30,525
Really?

281
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:32,280
I was worried...

282
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:35,365
I might come off as being nosy if I asked about it directly to him.

283
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:37,765
I see.

284
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:45,475
I guess you're the one in trouble.

285
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,720
What?

286
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,845
Are you worried about something?

287
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:00,185
You must not want to share it with me. Sorry.

288
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,255
Well...

289
00:22:05,113 --> 00:22:06,565
That's...

290
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:11,705
Woo Young, I want to apply for the field trip.

291
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:13,105
Okay.

292
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,135
Let's see.

293
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,760
(List of Field Trip Applicants)

294
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,245
Your name is Hyun Soo A, right?

295
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:21,875
Yes.

296
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,600
(Ko Ye Na, Kim Tae Hee, Yoo Eun, Jang Won Ho,)

297
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,945
(Lee Ji Hyo, Kim Sung Woon, Jung Dong Won, Hyun Soo A)

298
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:29,655
It's done.

299
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:32,400
Thank you. Goodbye.

300
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:33,725
Bye.

301
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:37,525
Kyung Seok, are you here to apply...

302
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,795
What's up?

303
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:46,435
Don't tell me you're here to call off the rent issue.

304
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:48,005
I'm here to apply for the field trip.

305
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,675
- To Kelun? - Yes.

306
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:57,530
Do better for your mother.

307
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,245
That's my business, not yours.

308
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:05,255
Are you mad at me?

309
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:10,495
It's done, right? Bye.

310
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:19,035
He's acting the opposite from the way he seems.

311
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,560
You like him,

312
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,630
and he seems to like you too,

313
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,315
so why do you have to give up?

314
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:35,615
I think it's because I'm scared.

315
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:41,485
He's beyond my league.

316
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:43,370
He's too perfect for me.

317
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:45,465
Still, you two like each other, so why?

318
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,835
The thing is,

319
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,435
a girl who's super pretty has a crush on him.

320
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:57,005
And everyone says that they'd make a cute couple.

321
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:02,075
As you know, I got plastic surgery all over my face. If he dates me...

322
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:05,685
instead of that girl, what will people say? I'm just so scared.

323
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:07,785
I see.

324
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:11,185
I must sound like an idiot.

325
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:16,055
But still,

326
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:18,895
what matters is the fact that you two like each other,

327
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:20,595
so don't think about other people.

328
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:26,435
That's what everyone will say though.

329
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,035
I understand.

330
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:32,575
I'm sure many girls will feel that way in your situation.

331
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:35,730
I'm getting angry at the people...

332
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:38,645
who made you think that.

333
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:42,070
I don't know the details,

334
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,385
so I can't really give you advice.

335
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:47,985
But perhaps, that pretty girl...

336
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:52,125
isn't much different from you.

337
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:57,835
I just don't want you to have any regrets later on.

338
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:04,620
You've applied for the lab experience, right?

339
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:05,945
Pardon?

340
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:12,315
Let's eat.

341
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,900
Have this too. Help yourself.

342
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,715
Thank you for the food.

343
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,265
Soo A may not be...

344
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:31,865
that different from me?

345
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:41,105
Hi, Woo Young.

346
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,430
I'm on my way home now.

347
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:45,715
Mi Rae.

348
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:49,800
My gosh.

349
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,085
Good timing.

350
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,625
Hello.

351
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:55,925
Can we talk for a minute?

352
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:58,725
Sure.

353
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,995
I noticed that you haven't applied. Have you forgotten about it?

354
00:26:03,718 --> 00:26:04,995
No.

355
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:08,735
I'm thinking of visiting my family during summer break.

356
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:12,390
But it's not for the whole summer.

357
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:13,975
You can visit them after it's done.

358
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,000
I just thought you'd definitely apply...

359
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
because you're very interested in perfume.

360
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:23,430
And most importantly, I think...

361
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:26,140
it'd be a good chance for you to find out how suited you are...

362
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:27,825
to pursue a career in the perfume industry.

363
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:32,440
Besides, there may not be another opportunity to get...

364
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:35,065
a first-hand experience at a perfume lab until you graduate.

365
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:42,535
Can I still apply for the program?

366
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:46,005
Of course. I'll add your name to the list right away.

367
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:49,945
- Shall we go? - Yes.

368
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,285
Wait, Woo Young.

369
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:57,185
Thank you.

370
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:01,585
Then are you free on Wednesday?

371
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:02,710
Sorry?

372
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:04,895
Let's watch a movie. We can get a discount that day.

373
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:08,495
Then I'll let Hyun Jung know as well.

374
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:10,995
Just the two of us.

375
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:14,935
I have something to tell you.

376
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:18,775
Okay.

377
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,145
Let's go.

378
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,055
I've gained a bit of weight.

379
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,515
Hey, wait.

380
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:08,485
Dong Won.

381
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:11,655
I heard...

382
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,610
that canned tuna is high in sodium.

383
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,180
You shouldn't give it to cats.

384
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:19,220
If you still want to, you should rinse it in water...

385
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,565
to remove the oil and sodium before giving it to them.

386
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:24,775
Hey, Soo A!

387
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,905
Oh, hi.

388
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,760
- Have you eaten yet? - Yes. What about you?

389
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:31,375
I've eaten too.

390
00:28:42,577 --> 00:28:44,110
Hi, Mi Rae.

391
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:45,825
- Hi. - Hi.

392
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,425
Let's sit over there.

393
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:50,265
Hi.

394
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:51,695
Hi.

395
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:56,475
Do you guys still work there part-time?

396
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,075
No, we quit.

397
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:00,905
Kyung Seok too?

398
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,515
Yes.

399
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,345
Hi, Kyung Seok.

400
00:29:12,273 --> 00:29:14,155
I heard you quit your part-time job.

401
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:22,035
He shouldn't have gotten involved in that thing. I feel bad.

402
00:29:32,961 --> 00:29:33,990
Nice to meet you all.

403
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,375
I'm Chief Director Lee Soo Hyun.

404
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:38,600
This is Ms. Yun Soo Kyeong,

405
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,915
who will be your guide.

406
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:42,315
Hello, everyone. It's nice to meet you all.

407
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,100
While getting your first-hand experience at our lab,

408
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:50,140
you'll also learn about theories and the history of perfume.

409
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,440
If you have any questions or suggestions,

410
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,510
you can speak to Ms. Yun here.

411
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:56,195
- Okay. - Okay.

412
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,165
Yes, come in.

413
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:04,620
Why did you come to school today?

414
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:05,760
I'm taking a summer class.

415
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,405
Oh, I see.

416
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,375
What brings you here?

417
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:12,045
There's something I want to tell you.

418
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,845
Me?

419
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:16,230
I'm not an eloquent speaker,

420
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:19,455
so I wrote down what I want to tell you.

421
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:32,135
Okay, bye.

422
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:45,415
Dear Woo Young.

423
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:48,085
I'm Kwon Yoon Byul in second year.

424
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:50,615
I have a crush on you.

425
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:52,700
You're very responsible and have a strong sense of ethics.

426
00:30:52,707 --> 00:30:53,940
You also respect women.

427
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,295
I like everything about you.

428
00:30:56,778 --> 00:31:00,265
I wrote this letter because I'm too shy to tell you in person.

429
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:02,710
With warm regards, Kwon Yoon Byul.

430
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:05,235
Shy, my foot. She's so brave.

431
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:08,505
My gosh, what should I do about this?

432
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:16,190
First, go ahead and smell the undiluted scents.

433
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:18,830
Then please write down which scents...

434
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,445
are in the perfume I gave you guys.

435
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:33,810
Because I've been smelling all these different scents,

436
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,110
I can't even smell anything now.

437
00:31:35,116 --> 00:31:38,535
You'll have to reset your sense of smell here and there.

438
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:40,080
You can either take a short break...

439
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:43,035
or try smelling coffee beans here. It'll help.

440
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:08,295
I think it has these scents.

441
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:13,465
You're right. You guessed every scent in the perfume correctly.

442
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,235
That's impressive.

443
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:20,960
Are you Kang Mi Rae? You're the one who sent us that perfume.

444
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:22,930
Everyone in our lab loved that perfume.

445
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:24,675
We've been wanting to meet you in person.

446
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,215
Thank you for the compliment.

447
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,655
My gosh, you're a perfume expert.

448
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,275
It wasn't supposed to rain today.

449
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,585
Woo Young.

450
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:06,485
Woo Young.

451
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:09,395
Wait, Woo Young.

452
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:12,625
What were you pondering?

453
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:15,425
Well, just some things.

454
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:19,880
Have you had dinner yet?

455
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:22,890
Oh, right. Come to think of it, I didn't even have lunch today.

456
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,790
Are you saying you didn't eat all day?

457
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:27,575
That's bad.

458
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:29,275
Thanks for your concern.

459
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,685
Well...

460
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:37,115
Do you want to grab dinner with me?

461
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:39,385
Sure, what should we eat?

462
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:42,570
Then... Since it's a hot day,

463
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,425
let's just go somewhere close.

464
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,095
- Sure. - Great.

465
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,050
- Welcome. - Hello.

466
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:53,765
- Hi. - You can sit over there.

467
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:04,330
He's still here.

468
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:06,830
He's a part-timer now, not the owner.

469
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,115
Really?

470
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,125
- He must've gone bankrupt. - Exactly.

471
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:15,895
Hey.

472
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,525
What do you want? Beer?

473
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:21,395
I don't think I'm good with perfume.

474
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,010
I can't even smell anything anymore.

475
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:25,250
I enjoyed it. I wasn't interested in perfume,

476
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,650
- but it was really fun. - I know.

477
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,235
- Right? - Yes.

478
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,690
Mi Rae, you looked really excited.

479
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:32,575
You must really like perfume.

480
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,630
- I'm hungry. - But you already ate.

481
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:43,315
Why are you sitting here alone like a loner?

482
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:46,000
I was a loner all my life.

483
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,925
What would you have done without me?

484
00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:49,525
I know, right?

485
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,070
Do you guys all want beer?

486
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,695
- Beer sounds good. - Sure.

487
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:56,095
Kyung Seok, what are you doing there?

488
00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:58,235
You should go.

489
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,065
I can't be bothered. I'm going to leave after I'm done with this.

490
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:04,350
Kyung Seok, get over here.

491
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,560
- Kyung Seok. - Come on.

492
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:09,115
- Come sit here. - Just go.

493
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,375
You're practically volunteering to be a loner.

494
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,785
I thought things were getting better, but you're doing it again.

495
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:19,770
- Kyung Seok. - Come on.

496
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:22,425
Gosh, he's so cold-hearted.

497
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:33,565
Is there something going on?

498
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:37,575
There's something on my mind.

499
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,005
What is it?

500
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:48,615
Well, the thing is, someone confessed...

501
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:51,300
their feelings for me today.

502
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:52,585
What?

503
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,685
Why are you so startled?

504
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:56,440
Is it that shocking?

505
00:35:56,444 --> 00:35:58,655
No, it's not shocking.

506
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:01,425
Gosh, you're really popular.

507
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:02,995
I'm not popular.

508
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:07,335
What are you going to do?

509
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:13,245
I'm just thinking about how I'm going to turn her down.

510
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:17,290
Have you already made up your mind?

511
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:19,930
Yes, I can't suddenly like someone...

512
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,985
just because that person likes me.

513
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,955
I guess you're very clear with what you want.

514
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,885
I just know what kind of women I like.

515
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:33,525
Don't be too harsh though.

516
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:39,405
Some people say you should be cold when you reject someone.

517
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:42,265
But if she's a decent person,

518
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:46,775
she'd appreciate it if you reject her politely.

519
00:36:48,996 --> 00:36:50,375
I guess you're right.

520
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:54,285
I feel like it'll scar her for life if the guy she likes...

521
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,915
says harsh things to her.

522
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,585
That's never happened to me, but still.

523
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,170
You must know well even without experience...

524
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,725
because you're a psychology major.

525
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,935
Isn't Hwang Min Hyun so good-looking?

526
00:37:12,787 --> 00:37:14,105
I'm not sure.

527
00:37:14,322 --> 00:37:16,575
I think Ong Seong Wu is handsome.

528
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:19,405
I like guys who look cold-hearted.

529
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:22,975
What about you, Soo A? Who's your favorite celebrity?

530
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:26,415
Me? I don't know much about celebrities.

531
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,255
I'm just into guys who like me.

532
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,525
What about you, Mi Rae?

533
00:37:36,143 --> 00:37:37,455
What?

534
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:40,795
I've never heard you talk about guys.

535
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:42,795
What kind of guys do you like?

536
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:49,935
I haven't really thought about it that much.

537
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,975
Do you like guys who treat you a little coldly?

538
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:56,575
You're the first girl to treat me this way.

539
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:57,760
Or...

540
00:37:57,765 --> 00:38:00,145
Let me become your firefighter.

541
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,715
Do you like guys who are warm?

542
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,315
Which kind of guy do you prefer?

543
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:05,985
I just like normal kind of guys.

544
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,355
What's the standard of normal?

545
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:11,025
This is so frustrating.

546
00:38:11,112 --> 00:38:13,895
Fine, let's just say you don't have an ideal type.

547
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:17,435
I like warm-hearted guys.

548
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:20,505
- I'm going to leave. - Kyung Seok.

549
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,775
See you, Kyung Seok.

550
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:25,435
Bye.

551
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:28,545
It seems like he's becoming more arrogant.

552
00:38:29,096 --> 00:38:30,915
It bothers me.

553
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:02,120
Take it.

554
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,315
It might start raining again.

555
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:09,585
Okay.

556
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:12,755
- Thanks. - No.

557
00:39:13,908 --> 00:39:15,685
I'm the one who should thank you.

558
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,705
Is that for Mi Rae?

559
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:35,420
It's not for me, is it?

560
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:36,745
I told you...

561
00:39:37,698 --> 00:39:39,285
to cut it out.

562
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:40,930
What are you talking about?

563
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:42,915
Stop pulling tricks I don't understand.

564
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:46,285
Why do you talk to me that way?

565
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,155
I'm trying my best to become friends with you.

566
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:53,110
I sincerely like you.

567
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:55,065
Even if I hated you,

568
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:58,635
I still wouldn't have treated you like this if you were sincere.

569
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,885
Do you still not feel anything?

570
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:35,005
Wait.

571
00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:41,845
Did you really feel nothing?

572
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:47,585
You must be mentally ill.

573
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:18,475
Why didn't you answer my calls?

574
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:23,145
And why did you run away?

575
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:29,245
Because I saw you with her.

576
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:31,555
Are you okay?

577
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,685
Did it upset you?

578
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:39,155
I already told you...

579
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,165
that I'm not interested in her.

580
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,575
You'll get wet.

581
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:00,515
Don't change the subject.

582
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:02,645
Do you really not know?

583
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:05,915
What?

584
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:08,925
That I like you.

585
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:13,765
Let's start dating.

586
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:16,765
Don't try to avoid me and answer me this time.

587
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:22,975
Why?

588
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:27,545
Why would a guy like you have feelings for someone like me?

589
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:29,745
What do you mean by a guy like me...

590
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:33,985
and a girl like you?

591
00:43:37,771 --> 00:43:39,155
You know already.

592
00:43:44,678 --> 00:43:47,665
Can't you imagine what people will say if we're together?

593
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:52,795
They'll wonder why such a guy goes out with such a girl.

594
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,305
So?

595
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:56,875
What do you think about me?

596
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:03,215
You're someone...

597
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,785
who can't be nothing more than a friend.

598
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,285
Forget about what can or can't be done.

599
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:13,655
What do you think about me?

600
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:19,565
I think...

601
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:24,235
you and I can't be together.

602
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:30,175
I told you the other day...

603
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,760
that people would say you're cool even if you live your way,

604
00:44:34,762 --> 00:44:36,105
but it's not the same for me.

605
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:39,275
I was bullied because of my ugly face throughout my school life.

606
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:42,460
And now, people gossip about my plastic face.

607
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:43,755
Hey.

608
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:46,725
All I want to know is what you think about me,

609
00:44:47,574 --> 00:44:48,800
not what others say.

610
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:51,195
Others' opinions are important to me.

611
00:44:53,981 --> 00:44:57,235
You think I'm obsessed with appearances, don't you?

612
00:44:57,818 --> 00:45:01,505
But you don't know how hard it has been for me.

613
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:03,875
If I'm with you,

614
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:07,975
my life becomes a torture.

615
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:12,775
Ever from the start,

616
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:19,055
I didn't have a chance?

617
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:21,985
No.

618
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:19,275
At last,

619
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,885
it has ended this way.

620
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,640
- Hi. - Hi.

621
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,125
Hi.

622
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:36,810
What?

623
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,095
(To Soo A)

624
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:41,095
Thank you for the drink.

625
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:43,365
What?

626
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,975
Here's what happened with my flirt today.

627
00:47:52,392 --> 00:47:54,845
She enjoyed the drink I gave her.

628
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:57,445
We're flirting with each other for real, right?

629
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:00,685
I think it's true that you get a girlfriend when they enter college.

630
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:03,755
But I had no idea it'd be such a pretty girl like her.

631
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:06,840
It must be true how pretty girls don't go for the hot guys.

632
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,525
What is he saying?

633
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,810
Soo A, I thought you might not be able to finish all the food you got,

634
00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:20,235
but you've actually finished it all.

635
00:48:20,621 --> 00:48:22,905
She usually doesn't leave any of her food.

636
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,235
And she's that skinny?

637
00:48:27,361 --> 00:48:29,545
I don't easily gain weight no matter how much I eat.

638
00:48:29,763 --> 00:48:32,975
She says that stresses her out.

639
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:36,200
Why would you get stressed out by that?

640
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:38,170
She's so annoying.

641
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:39,430
Seriously.

642
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:41,625
Hey, lower your voice.

643
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,325
Let's talk for a second.

644
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,925
Have you had lunch?

645
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:25,735
No.

646
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:33,135
If you're going through a hard time because of me,

647
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:36,615
I should stop doing that.

648
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,455
But if by any chance,

649
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:50,425
you think we can go back to being friends...

650
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:54,565
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

651
00:49:58,452 --> 00:49:59,905
Still,

652
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:04,975
I'll wait.

653
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:28,365
You look pretty, so stop looking in the mirror.

654
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:33,035
It's been a long time since I heard you say I'm pretty.

655
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:35,220
Back in the days when you wanted to date me,

656
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:36,990
you said it every time you opened your mouth...

657
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,450
as if that was all you had to say.

658
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:41,660
I told you so because you were pretty.

659
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:43,730
You were the most beautiful woman in our neighborhood.

660
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,990
Tell me about it.

661
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:48,585
When I said I was getting married with you, everyone got shocked...

662
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:51,970
for choosing a man by his personality instead of backgrounds.

663
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:53,955
They said even my heart was pretty.

664
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,110
Come on. I was a successful business man back then.

665
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,680
And they got shocked once again...

666
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,280
because this pretty woman was living a bright life...

667
00:51:02,282 --> 00:51:03,750
even after her husband's business...

668
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,110
went completely bankrupt.

669
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:08,205
All right, you're going through a lot thanks to your pretty looks.

670
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,135
Let's stop by that senior's house first and go to Mi Rae's.

671
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,915
It must be hard for you to carry two watermelons alone.

672
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,615
I'm fine.

673
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,885
I can't make my pretty wife carry them even if it's hard.

674
00:51:28,508 --> 00:51:32,095
Do you think I look like Mi Rae?

675
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:34,580
Do I look like a mom of the Gangnam beauty?

676
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:38,335
Yes, you guys look very much alike.

677
00:51:38,352 --> 00:51:41,605
Goodness gracious.

678
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:44,775
What do you think about your brother's house?

679
00:51:45,258 --> 00:51:46,945
I'd like to take a look inside his house too.

680
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:51,215
I'm glad you two grew up as affectionate siblings.

681
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:53,275
Let's go.

682
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,425
Who are you?

683
00:52:02,442 --> 00:52:03,810
Are you Woo Young's mother?

684
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,980
No, I'm the mother of Woo Young's junior.

685
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:10,165
She lives near here.

686
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,335
Near here?

687
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:15,605
Are you Mi Rae's mother by any chance?

688
00:52:18,558 --> 00:52:21,760
Hello, I'm the mother of a boy named Do Kyung Seok.

689
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:23,860
He lives with Woo Young.

690
00:52:23,864 --> 00:52:25,430
He and Mi Rae are colleagues in school.

691
00:52:25,432 --> 00:52:28,600
Do Kyung Seok?

692
00:52:28,602 --> 00:52:30,770
Oh, that pretty young man?

693
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,030
Do you know him?

694
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:34,270
- Yes. - Yes.

695
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:36,300
We know him. It's good to meet you.

696
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:38,655
It's nice to meet you.

697
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:42,040
I didn't think...

698
00:52:42,048 --> 00:52:44,995
I'd meet with other parents once my girl entered college.

699
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:48,205
I'm happy we met like this.

700
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:54,075
Unfortunately, I couldn't be there for my kids when they were younger.

701
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,790
Watching Mi Rae grow must've made you very happy.

702
00:52:57,798 --> 00:52:59,590
She's kindhearted and smart.

703
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,300
She also knows how to have fun. She's a great dancer as well.

704
00:53:02,302 --> 00:53:03,855
Oh, really?

705
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:05,955
I must say,

706
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,685
I wondered who gave Kyung Seok his good looks.

707
00:53:09,843 --> 00:53:11,895
He sure got it from you.

708
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,165
You look so young for your age.

709
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,835
You really are a Gangnam beauty.

710
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,305
My mom didn't get any plastic surgery.

711
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,450
Sorry?

712
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,690
That remark about Gangnam.

713
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:28,145
People say that to those who got a lot of work done on their faces.

714
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,605
Gosh.

715
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,560
All right. Great work, everyone.

716
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:04,730
What you did today will take up most of your time...

717
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:06,500
if you do join a perfume lab down the road,

718
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,660
so don't forget what you learned. Write down everything, okay?

719
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:10,085
- Okay. - Okay.

720
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,455
(Koo Tae Young)

721
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,865
Can we meet up later today? Just the two of us.

722
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,885
Hey, Woo Young.

723
00:55:22,142 --> 00:55:24,525
- Hey, are you done? - Yes.

724
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:26,495
Where are you now?

725
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:29,865
I'm near the Kelun lab.

726
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,535
Where shall we meet today?

727
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:33,735
Why don't we eat something good after the movie?

728
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,305
Today?

729
00:55:38,858 --> 00:55:40,135
Right, okay.

730
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:09,120
Do you have a reservation?

731
00:56:09,122 --> 00:56:11,075
- Yes, under Yeon Woo Young. - Just a moment, please.

732
00:56:15,662 --> 00:56:17,845
Wasn't the movie so good?

733
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,900
That man's dance was hilarious.

734
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,385
Yes, it was funny.

735
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,955
Shall we have a drink too?

736
00:56:25,171 --> 00:56:28,625
You want to drink? You know that I'm a lightweight.

737
00:56:28,942 --> 00:56:30,225
Right.

738
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:33,495
I'm actually worse than you.

739
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,465
I can't drink more than two shots of soju.

740
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:38,850
Seriously? I had no idea.

741
00:56:38,852 --> 00:56:40,805
There are many other things that you don't know.

742
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:43,605
I don't like pork belly,

743
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,275
and I get cold very easily.

744
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:48,205
I hate studying,

745
00:56:49,129 --> 00:56:50,615
and I like you.

746
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:02,740
I was worried that things might get awkward for you...

747
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:04,910
at school because of me, so I've been hesitating.

748
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:06,195
But...

749
00:57:09,783 --> 00:57:11,735
I've had a crush on you since we first met.

750
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:19,235
I guess you really had no idea.

751
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:26,915
- But why? - What?

752
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,245
Why do you like me?

753
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:34,825
Because you're pretty.

754
00:57:38,812 --> 00:57:41,525
You always look grumpy as if you're bothered by something,

755
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:43,425
but I notice the subtle differences.

756
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:47,735
Today, it must be something super serious.

757
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:51,790
If it's that serious, it must be about...

758
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:53,675
something that's never happened before.

759
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:56,905
It's about a girl, right?

760
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,345
It must be. Hey, are you seeing someone now? Who is it?

761
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,555
It's none of your business.

762
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,540
I wonder who it is.

763
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,425
Who's the girl that melted this cold guy's heart?

764
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:12,610
By the way, what's the problem?

765
00:58:12,612 --> 00:58:14,110
She said she can't date me.

766
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:16,025
What? She even rejected you?

767
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:19,535
She said she "can't", not that she doesn't want to date me.

768
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,905
I don't get it.

769
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:26,875
Is she ugly?

770
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,345
- No. - She's pretty?

771
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:30,815
You don't like pretty girls.

772
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:33,815
She's neither pretty nor ugly.

773
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:35,985
She's just herself.

774
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,955
You like me just because I'm pretty?

775
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:43,685
All guys like pretty girls.

776
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:45,255
And you're totally my type.

777
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:49,525
Are you that surprised to hear all this?

778
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,635
Yes.

779
00:58:55,522 --> 00:58:57,475
I didn't know that you were that kind of person.

780
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:01,405
What?

781
00:59:01,728 --> 00:59:04,815
Did you start liking me just because of my looks?

782
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,585
What's wrong with being attracted to good looks?

783
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,255
Are you not attracted to handsome guys?

784
00:59:12,872 --> 00:59:14,785
It doesn't have to be about good looks.

785
00:59:15,642 --> 00:59:17,895
Some like girls with double eyelids.

786
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:21,425
Some are attracted to skinny girls or girls with fair skin.

787
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,325
Everyone has a type, you know.

788
00:59:26,052 --> 00:59:28,605
I told you that I got plastic surgery all over my face.

789
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:32,350
I used to be very ugly,

790
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:34,245
to the point that you can't even imagine.

791
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:37,415
So what?

792
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:39,915
So why...

793
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:44,270
I have no idea why you're attracted to someone like me.

794
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,755
"Someone like me"?

795
00:59:47,674 --> 00:59:49,385
Because you are attractive.

796
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:57,025
It is partially because you're physically attractive,

797
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,295
but my feelings for you keep growing with time.

798
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:01,505
I just like you as who you are.

799
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:24,295
To me,

800
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:26,855
you're just yourself.

801
01:00:31,751 --> 01:00:33,635
Coming home together after that confession...

802
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,805
makes me feel so awkward.

803
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:42,945
Go in.

804
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,615
Okay.

805
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:47,885
Good night.

806
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:27,725
Woo Young!

807
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:31,195
Woo Young.

808
01:01:32,178 --> 01:01:33,495
Mi Rae.

809
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:38,035
- Woo Young. - Yes, catch your breath first.

810
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:40,605
Well...

811
01:01:43,923 --> 01:01:46,375
You told me to think about it,

812
01:01:48,628 --> 01:01:50,045
but I...

813
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:54,985
I'm sorry.

814
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,225
All right.

815
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:04,995
I got your point.

816
01:02:06,112 --> 01:02:07,410
I'm sorry.

817
01:02:07,413 --> 01:02:10,325
To be honest, I was mentally prepared for this.

818
01:02:11,951 --> 01:02:14,605
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

819
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,705
You did nothing to be sorry for.

820
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,735
To tell you the truth,

821
01:02:19,892 --> 01:02:22,545
I'm not sure if I can do this to you.

822
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:25,630
Who am I to reject you?

823
01:02:25,631 --> 01:02:26,975
You're at it again.

824
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:32,155
It's not like some people don't deserve to be loved...

825
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:35,185
or aren't allowed to be attracted to someone.

826
01:02:36,142 --> 01:02:37,495
There are no such rules.

827
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:39,895
And no one has the right to laugh at you.

828
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:42,765
Also,

829
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,635
when you're attracted to someone,

830
01:02:45,818 --> 01:02:47,705
you can't control your feelings.

831
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:55,145
Good luck...

832
01:02:55,762 --> 01:02:57,045
with Kyung Seok.

833
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:02,885
I figured out a long time ago that you two like each other.

834
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,655
But...

835
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:07,425
I still...

836
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,125
wanted a chance tell you how I feel about you.

837
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:15,665
Kyung Seok is a good guy, and he's handsome.

838
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:18,935
No, it's not that.

839
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:23,005
You're handsome too.

840
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:25,475
That's really not the reason.

841
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:29,505
You're such a wonderful person.

842
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,585
I'm fine. Don't cry.

843
01:03:49,282 --> 01:03:51,635
Just go with your heart, Mi Rae.

844
01:03:53,152 --> 01:03:55,965
So don't cry, okay?

845
01:04:26,018 --> 01:04:30,265
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

846
01:04:43,102 --> 01:04:45,455
(We'd like to thank Han Hyun Min for his special appearance.)
