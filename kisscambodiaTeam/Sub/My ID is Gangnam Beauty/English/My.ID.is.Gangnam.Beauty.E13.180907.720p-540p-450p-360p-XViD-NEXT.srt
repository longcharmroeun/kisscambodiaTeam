1
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:21,825
Just go with your heart, Mi Rae.

2
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:26,265
So don't cry, okay?

3
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,170
You don't have to walk me to the door.

4
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:28,095
All right, go in now. Don't come back out like you did last time.

5
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:30,295
Okay.

6
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:34,835
Get home safely.

7
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,220
Hey, you're home.

8
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,420
Yes.

9
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,675
I'm going to take out the trash.

10
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:16,075
Okay.

11
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,825
What? Why are you back?

12
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,535
Do you have soju?

13
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,345
Did something happen?

14
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:53,715
Is it because of that girl you like?

15
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:01,985
Gosh, your first love is really giving you a hard time.

16
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,095
But then again, everyone becomes a fool for their first love.

17
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:08,910
You just end up liking a great person...

18
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,440
instead of liking the person that has a chance of ending up with you.

19
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,710
How can anyone differentiate that?

20
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:14,280
It's hard at first.

21
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:18,350
But once you get heartbroken a couple of times,

22
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,750
you start having better judgment.

23
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,390
You're able to stop yourself...

24
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,745
from liking the person that you don't have a chance with.

25
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,515
You'll continuously stop yourself from thinking of that person.

26
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,835
Are you sleeping already?

27
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:55,275
Are you sick?

28
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:37,515
Good luck with Kyung Seok.

29
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:45,695
I thought no one would ever root for me.

30
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:59,775
I need to go home now.

31
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,620
Let me stay here tonight.

32
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,015
Hey, do you think I'm still the owner of this place?

33
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,485
Fine, do whatever you want.

34
00:05:13,236 --> 00:05:14,825
I'll come in early tomorrow morning.

35
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,525
See you.

36
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:41,345
(Episode 13: It's my first love.)

37
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,455
Did he leave already?

38
00:05:58,147 --> 00:05:59,995
Or did he not come home?

39
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,220
- Hey, Soo A. - Hey.

40
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:13,475
Let me take a photo of you wearing a lab coat.

41
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:15,815
Why only me?

42
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,455
You should take a photo of Dong Won as well.

43
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,500
Let me take a photo of you first.

44
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:21,855
Here we go.

45
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,370
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

46
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:30,595
How much did you drink? You normally drink really well.

47
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,850
I guess everyone reeks of alcohol if they drink too much.

48
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,505
It's quite humane.

49
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:40,705
Is there something wrong?

50
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:47,060
If you're too tired, you can take some rest at the medical office.

51
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,185
I'll explain to the assistant manager.

52
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,315
Thanks.

53
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,735
You can rest here.

54
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,475
Okay.

55
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,165
(Woo Young)

56
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,420
Why didn't Tae Hee come today?

57
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,475
I don't know. She won't pick up my calls.

58
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,885
Someone should check up on Kyung Seok.

59
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,170
Shouldn't he have some soup?

60
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,270
Just let him rest. He'll sober up after a while.

61
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,625
But I'm sure he'll feel sick until he sobers up.

62
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,140
He should've just stayed home.

63
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,265
If you're so worried, why don't you go check up on him yourself?

64
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:15,835
Do you know where the medical office is?

65
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,635
Are you really going to go?

66
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,975
Do you like Kyung Seok?

67
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,505
What?

68
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:28,845
Gosh, I was just joking.

69
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:30,785
Are you angry?

70
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:35,830
No.

71
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,955
It seems like you really like him.

72
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,035
You're right.

73
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,365
I like Kyung Seok.

74
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:54,275
You said you didn't like him when I asked at the festival.

75
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:56,790
I know.

76
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,145
Are you guys dating?

77
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,915
See? I knew this would happen.

78
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:03,560
They're dating for sure.

79
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,655
No, we're not dating yet.

80
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:27,135
Are you okay?

81
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:30,575
Soo A's so weird.

82
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:33,160
She told us that she doesn't have high standards.

83
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,630
But did you see how she confessed that she likes Kyung Seok?

84
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,755
What a joke.

85
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,385
To be honest, it's not like Kyung Seok has a good personality.

86
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,595
Soo A's just the same. She likes good-looking guys.

87
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,025
Hey.

88
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:53,095
You already got rejected at the welcome party.

89
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,550
Stop making a fuss about it.

90
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,105
I know that.

91
00:09:57,153 --> 00:10:00,905
But she didn't have to tell me that she likes someone else.

92
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:07,175
Yes, I guess.

93
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,145
It just means...

94
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,285
that she totally made a fool of me.

95
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,495
About the girl that I like...

96
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:23,465
Apparently, she likes someone else.

97
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,535
This makes no sense.

98
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,835
She made it seem like she liked me as well.

99
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:32,075
Was she just having fun with me?

100
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,405
I'm so angry.

101
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:41,845
Ms. Na.

102
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:48,000
What's wrong?

103
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:51,025
Ms. Yoon just came by...

104
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:54,625
and told me that Kyung Seok is in the medical office right now.

105
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,525
What?

106
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:57,910
Is he sick?

107
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,565
Not exactly.

108
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,480
He's hungover.

109
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,535
I think he drank too much.

110
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,985
Are you okay?

111
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,265
What happened?

112
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,935
Is there something wrong?

113
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,205
No.

114
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:38,680
Then why did you drink so much...

115
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,505
that you even had to come here?

116
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,905
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:48,685
Is there really nothing I should be worried about?

118
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:51,615
Everything's fine.

119
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:55,455
How much did you drink?

120
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:59,725
I don't know. I think I drank about 5 to 6 bottles.

121
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,365
No,

122
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:04,025
seven bottles.

123
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,195
Do you want to die?

124
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:10,805
Well...

125
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,035
Sorry, that was too mean.

126
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:22,445
You shouldn't drink that much.

127
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:24,045
Don't ever do it again.

128
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:34,225
You really...

129
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:36,595
can't smell, can you?

130
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:40,065
Everyone else has avoided me because I reek of alcohol.

131
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,435
Don't think your mom is an excuse for everything.

132
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,935
No one will go easy on you even if you're the CEO's son.

133
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:48,590
If you do this again,

134
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,705
I'll kick you out from the team.

135
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,015
Okay.

136
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,445
Did you treat your hangover?

137
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,330
- No. - Gosh.

138
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:03,555
Whom do you take after to drink so much like this?

139
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:10,965
Why would you smile? You did nothing good.

140
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:13,065
It didn't feel real,

141
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:16,105
but now, I feel like I really have a mom.

142
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:28,415
Stay here. I'll go get you some honey water.

143
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:44,080
Why don't you go visit him in the infirmary?

144
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,195
I might wake him up.

145
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,665
- Who cares? - It could be irritating.

146
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:50,950
No one will be irritated when you visit them.

147
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:53,280
Just go in there,

148
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:54,920
and ask him, "Kyung Seok, are you okay?"

149
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,650
Then he'll answer, "Soo A, you're here."

150
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,990
That's how you'll go out with him.

151
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,090
Go already.

152
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:01,590
What's going on?

153
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,645
She only said she had a crush on him,

154
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,455
but it feels like they've already become an official couple.

155
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,785
I'd go if I were you.

156
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,195
- You really should. - It's hard to understand.

157
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:15,095
What?

158
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:16,795
Nothing.

159
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:24,035
(Woo Young)

160
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,445
Hello?

161
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,875
- We should go too. - Should we?

162
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,245
Tae Hee.

163
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,515
What's wrong? What happened?

164
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:45,125
What is wrong?

165
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:48,125
I broke up with my boyfriend.

166
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,765
What?

167
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:53,665
Stop crying for now.

168
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,805
Stop crying.

169
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,375
Don't cry.

170
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:07,960
Yes, Kyung Seok is here. Why do you ask?

171
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:10,860
He wasn't home in the morning, so I was wondering if he never came home.

172
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,915
He didn't go home yesterday?

173
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:16,155
No. Well, I'm relieved to hear that he's there.

174
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,395
You're okay, right?

175
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:24,665
Yes.

176
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,805
I'll hang up then.

177
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,265
Bye.

178
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,775
I'm not okay.

179
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:49,555
All of a sudden over the phone?

180
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,470
Why?

181
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:53,740
We had an argument because of Chan Woo.

182
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,995
But that can't be the reason to break up.

183
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,765
Maybe he has another reason.

184
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:02,410
Did he feel ashamed to be with a fatty girlfriend too?

185
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,575
Hey, what are you saying?

186
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:07,905
I can't believe that's the only reason.

187
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,615
Did her boyfriend dump her?

188
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,015
Is that why she cried?

189
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:17,930
People say it's fine as long as you love each other,

190
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,200
but I guess you can't ignore what others say.

191
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:23,770
Right, a lot of them said Tae Young was too good...

192
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,325
for the chubby girl like her.

193
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:29,070
I don't know why people gossip about others' love affairs.

194
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:30,465
Goodness.

195
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:34,495
I'll say.

196
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:02,765
- Go in. - Okay.

197
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,265
Cheer up, Tae Young.

198
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:07,665
Remember I'm always on your side.

199
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,085
You always brush your teeth right after having a meal.

200
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:34,495
It's become a habit of mine. I feel uncomfortable when I don't do it.

201
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,425
I'll be back.

202
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:49,075
Did you hear?

203
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,215
Tae Young and Tae Hee broke up.

204
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,630
- What? - Everyone talked about...

205
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:57,490
how she didn't deserve him.

206
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,385
It must've been stressful.

207
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:02,955
I'm worried too.

208
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:06,295
People might say I don't deserve Kyung Seok if we go out.

209
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,295
Kyung Seok doesn't like you.

210
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,165
Some men do this.

211
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:20,205
They date girls because they like them,

212
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,345
but they also want to show them off.

213
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:27,975
- Excuse me. - Thanks for that day.

214
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,915
Things were awkward between me and Kyung Seok,

215
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:33,985
but you walked away as if you didn't see us.

216
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:51,235
Soo A, you know about everything,

217
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,005
so why are you doing this to me?

218
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,585
Since when were you there?

219
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:44,425
Did you...

220
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:46,925
throw up?

221
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:48,170
What?

222
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:50,465
It sounded like you did.

223
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,595
I felt sick.

224
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,835
I gagged a little, but I didn't throw up.

225
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,885
What is it?

226
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,285
I saw you earlier during lunch,

227
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:14,955
and you didn't look like you were feeling sick.

228
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:18,085
What?

229
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,325
Don't tell me...

230
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:27,365
you habitually throw up after eating.

231
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,805
That's ridiculous. Why would I do that?

232
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:37,175
Do you see me as a person who'd do such a thing?

233
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:47,615
She's flustered.

234
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:50,425
She obviously is flustered.

235
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,125
You woke up.

236
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:59,235
I was told to come check your condition.

237
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,505
How many bottles does a heavy drinker like you need...

238
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,535
to become that drunk?

239
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:12,875
Do I still reek of alcohol?

240
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:17,585
You do.

241
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,115
Still, it's gotten better than a while ago.

242
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,095
What's that?

243
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:30,065
Is that honey water? Who made you that?

244
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,295
Did Soo A come see you?

245
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,265
Why would she come here?

246
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:40,275
We had a crazy incident during lunch earlier.

247
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:42,805
We were having lunch together,

248
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:46,275
and Soo A announced that she likes you.

249
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:48,385
What?

250
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,885
Kyung Seok, you're unbelievable...

251
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,060
for making a girl like her have a crush on you.

252
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:55,355
I'm so jealous.

253
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:00,355
You had no idea?

254
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:03,525
Is she out of her mind?

255
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:06,265
Gosh, hey.

256
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:09,705
Hey, Kyung Seok. Do Kyung Seok!

257
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:23,245
I've done it too, even though it was only for a short while.

258
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:30,825
I've always been too skinny, and I never liked it.

259
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:35,725
Why? Why did she lie that she never puts on weight?

260
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,195
That pretty friend of yours...

261
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:41,705
may not be much different from you.

262
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,035
Even with that pretty face,

263
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:48,875
you're unhappy?

264
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:52,815
Hey, Kyung Seok.

265
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:58,045
Kyung Seok, Do Kyung Seok!

266
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,655
Are you feeling better now?

267
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:05,640
We need to talk.

268
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:08,495
Oh, okay. I'll see you in a bit.

269
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:46,535
Tae Young, where are you?

270
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:49,950
Do you want to grab a drink with me later?

271
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:51,635
A drink, not food?

272
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:53,475
Yes.

273
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:56,445
What's gotten into you? You rarely drink.

274
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,875
I know, right?

275
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,115
I'm surprised that I'm craving alcohol.

276
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:05,955
All right, bring other guys too. I'll treat you all.

277
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:09,925
Okay. I'll see you there, then. All right.

278
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,110
Those who aren't here today and those who were late.

279
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,010
If you're late again or miss another experiment,

280
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,335
you won't be able to get your certificate.

281
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,860
Where shall we go to talk?

282
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:35,915
We don't need to go anywhere. Let's just talk here.

283
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,415
Here?

284
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:47,255
Guys, shall we leave? Let's go.

285
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:48,410
Come on. Let's go.

286
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,825
Mi Rae, let's go.

287
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,215
Kyung Seok is so manly.

288
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:09,415
He should still take her to somewhere romantic.

289
00:25:09,998 --> 00:25:12,830
Manly? I don't think so. He seemed angry.

290
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,030
No way. What's there to be angry about?

291
00:25:15,036 --> 00:25:16,985
I mean, Soo A likes him.

292
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,995
I'm telling you. They'll start dating today.

293
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,335
I told you to stop.

294
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:27,540
Stop what?

295
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:29,705
I heard you told everyone that you like me.

296
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,605
You're really something.

297
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:36,020
I've never hated anyone this much.

298
00:25:36,024 --> 00:25:38,915
Why are you so cold to me?

299
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,690
Just because you don't like me...

300
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:44,045
doesn't mean you should doubt me when I say I like you.

301
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,125
I pity you.

302
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:52,525
All right, fine.

303
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:55,665
I never knew having a crush on someone was this hard.

304
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,465
This is really exhausting.

305
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:00,595
That's not what I meant.

306
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:04,265
I pity you as a person.

307
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:07,480
What?

308
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,605
If I date someone else,

309
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,775
will it ruin your reputation of being the most popular girl?

310
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,955
Kyung Seok will reject her.

311
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:28,055
But it'll only distance me further away from him.

312
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:32,340
Everyone will think that he'll date someone who's prettier than Soo A.

313
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:33,965
They'll have high expectations.

314
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,265
Soo A can't date Kyung Seok,

315
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:41,635
and he doesn't like her.

316
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,245
I'm sure she knows too.

317
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:48,115
Then why did she tell everyone that she has a crush on him?

318
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,930
Some men do this.

319
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:54,055
They date girls because they like them,

320
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,085
but they also want to show them off.

321
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:07,165
Soo A does not like Kyung Seok.

322
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:13,480
Then just like how you told everyone about having a crush on me,

323
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:16,145
shall I go ahead and tell everyone whom I like?

324
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:20,045
Shall I tell people that I like Mi Rae?

325
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,085
Well, if you do that,

326
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:26,315
Mi Rae will become so famous.

327
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:32,425
People will wonder why a guy like you has fallen for Mi Rae.

328
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,995
Do you think all the gossip and rumors will benefit her?

329
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:49,105
Mi Rae.

330
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:56,045
Kyung Seok, let's go.

331
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:04,085
Mi Rae.

332
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,965
Kyung Seok, let's go.

333
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:22,020
Well, we're talking about something important now.

334
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:24,805
I also have to talk to him about something important.

335
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:26,775
What do you think you're doing now?

336
00:28:27,362 --> 00:28:28,815
Soo A.

337
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:31,185
What do you think you're doing now?

338
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,955
I'll talk to her.

339
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:38,185
Let me talk to Soo A for a minute.

340
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,775
I know that you don't like me.

341
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,185
I also know you can't stand the fact...

342
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:05,315
that Kyung Seok likes me.

343
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,615
But...

344
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:09,725
you'd better not use him.

345
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:14,595
Do not meddle in his life.

346
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:17,965
I'm meddling in his life?

347
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:20,410
What are you talking about?

348
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:23,465
Everyone knows that he's the most handsome, competent guy.

349
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:27,375
If he dates someone else, you won't be in the spotlight anymore.

350
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:30,020
That's why you're trying to make sure...

351
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:32,615
he can't date anyone if he's not going to go out with you.

352
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:38,585
Are you in your right mind now?

353
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,085
Yes.

354
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,025
I've come to my senses.

355
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:47,295
I can see exactly what you're trying to do.

356
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,170
Even with Chan Woo,

357
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:52,995
I bet you told him you can't date him because I like him.

358
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:56,465
And I also know that you approached Park Yong Chul first.

359
00:29:56,618 --> 00:30:00,050
You must've wanted to make me admit that I was born ugly.

360
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:02,705
That I'm no match for you.

361
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:11,085
That's right.

362
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,155
From the moment I was born,

363
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:17,255
and for the rest of my life, I'll be different from you.

364
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:22,265
I'm different from girls who want to fix their faces for a better life.

365
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,035
I'm not sure about that.

366
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,405
I think we're a bit similar in some ways.

367
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:35,335
What?

368
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:40,315
Are you being like this because of what you saw?

369
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:44,615
Let me make it clear to you again. I wasn't forcing myself to throw up.

370
00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:47,155
I was just nauseated, that's all.

371
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,885
The fact that you're bringing it up now...

372
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:57,795
tells me that you were in fact forcing yourself to throw up.

373
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:00,395
Hey!

374
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,975
I've never seen you like this before.

375
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:15,885
Do you know...

376
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:19,755
that this is your first time being honest with me?

377
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:24,055
I think it's my first time...

378
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,225
seeing the real you.

379
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,635
That brat.

380
00:31:42,557 --> 00:31:44,145
She should know her place.

381
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,235
What was it?

382
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,505
- What do you mean? - You said you wanted to talk to me.

383
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:15,075
What was it that you wanted to say?

384
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,475
Well...

385
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,415
The things is...

386
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:24,585
Are you sober now?

387
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:29,685
I'm so disappointed.

388
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:32,755
Is that the important thing you had to say to me?

389
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,425
Yes.

390
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:41,565
I was worried about you.

391
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:54,875
Do you want to eat?

392
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,885
What?

393
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:15,835
(Gangnam beauty)

394
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:26,515
You're home early.

395
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:29,345
I'm going to rest for a while.

396
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:32,030
I don't feel like dealing with customers.

397
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:34,315
- Did you eat? - No.

398
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:37,300
I bought you some dumplings. You should have some.

399
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,595
I don't feel like eating anything.

400
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:42,640
My gosh, stop acting like someone died.

401
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:44,225
What's wrong with you?

402
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:49,065
It's all my fault.

403
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:52,205
I told her to get a full makeover.

404
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,650
She should've just gotten a few surgeries.

405
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:57,575
What's the use of saying that now?

406
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,515
Here. Let's eat.

407
00:34:02,864 --> 00:34:04,285
Do you think...

408
00:34:04,565 --> 00:34:07,885
people say that to her face?

409
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,155
They're probably just saying that behind her back, right?

410
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:19,140
I feel so sorry for her.

411
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:21,980
Gosh, I told you to stop acting like someone died.

412
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:23,505
Why are you crying?

413
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:26,905
I feel apologetic toward you too.

414
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:30,045
There are a lot of people who like Mi Rae as well.

415
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:33,045
She seemed really popular at the orientation.

416
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:34,475
Right?

417
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:36,730
There has to be more people that like her, right?

418
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:40,285
Of course. People who call her names are the ones who don't know her.

419
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:42,925
The ones who know her well wouldn't call her that.

420
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:45,600
Eat up.

421
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,325
Yes, you're right.

422
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,735
Were you really going to ask if I was sober or not?

423
00:34:59,854 --> 00:35:01,305
What?

424
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:03,605
Well, that and...

425
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:07,515
Why didn't you go home last night?

426
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,630
How did you know?

427
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:12,885
Woo Young called me earlier.

428
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,685
He told me that you didn't come home and asked if you came to the lab.

429
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:18,055
I didn't go home because I didn't want to see him.

430
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:19,695
Why?

431
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:25,065
Did you fight with him?

432
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:28,135
I would've fought with him if it was something worth fighting.

433
00:35:28,149 --> 00:35:31,565
If it wasn't worth fighting, then why don't you want to see him?

434
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:40,075
That's weird. He's a nice guy.

435
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:46,530
Okay, fine.

436
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:48,855
- I don't want it. - Okay, I get it.

437
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:52,525
Woo Young, is there a something wrong?

438
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:55,910
No, there's nothing wrong.

439
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,210
You bought us food a lot of times,

440
00:35:58,212 --> 00:35:59,795
but it's your first time buying us drinks.

441
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:04,110
This is so fun. Let's clink glasses.

442
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,580
Come on. Cheers.

443
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,205
Cheers.

444
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:08,935
Cheers.

445
00:36:13,928 --> 00:36:15,575
Gosh.

446
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,300
Are you guys dating anyone?

447
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:22,400
He's dating Tae Hee.

448
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:24,925
And we're not dating anyone as usual.

449
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:29,695
Did I ask you to come when you have to meet Tae Hee?

450
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:32,480
No, we don't meet that often.

451
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,695
Why? You just started dating.

452
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:36,710
Don't couples normally meet each other every day at first?

453
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:39,080
Then why do you always get dumped so quickly?

454
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:41,020
Hey, don't say that. I've dumped someone as well.

455
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:42,690
When? I don't ever recall that happening.

456
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,490
My gosh, you don't know me.

457
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,815
Then tell me. Who did you dump?

458
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:50,245
- Min Jung. - Oh, come on.

459
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:53,260
- My gosh. - Who's Min Jung?

460
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:56,485
The pretty girl in the biology department.

461
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,240
That's absurd. Why did you dump her?

462
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,770
Well, she's pretty, but she's not very curvy.

463
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:05,640
- My gosh. - He's lying.

464
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:07,040
I'm not lying.

465
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:08,880
Do you want me to call Min Jung?

466
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:10,810
- Yes. I'll call her. - Fine.

467
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:12,575
Where's my phone?

468
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:14,505
Why did you...

469
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,975
suddenly show up at the lab when Soo A and I were talking?

470
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,560
What?

471
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,315
You could've asked if I was sober after I was done talking to her.

472
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:25,585
You're right.

473
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,755
I guess I'm really impatient.

474
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:30,755
Was it because...

475
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,695
you were worried that something might happen between me and her?

476
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:38,125
No.

477
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,395
I already know that you don't like Soo A.

478
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:51,305
- Are you done eating? - Yes.

479
00:37:57,598 --> 00:38:01,615
To be honest, I went there because I didn't want anyone bothering you.

480
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:04,770
I didn't want her to anger the guy I like.

481
00:38:04,772 --> 00:38:06,225
Aren't you coming?

482
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:08,895
Okay, I'm going.

483
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:39,425
I've never seen you like this before.

484
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,895
I think it's my first time...

485
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:46,565
seeing the real you.

486
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:29,235
I tried so hard.

487
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:01,275
- Hello? - Hey, Soo A.

488
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:03,445
It's me, Tae Young.

489
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,975
Hello?

490
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:11,945
Yes.

491
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:14,755
I...

492
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:17,655
had a couple drinks.

493
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,025
I'm busy right now.

494
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:23,725
Soo A.

495
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:45,960
My gosh.

496
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:47,855
- Let's put him over there. - Okay.

497
00:40:50,504 --> 00:40:52,055
My goodness.

498
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:57,640
You're the guy he lives with?

499
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,365
- Let's go, I'm about to pass out. - Okay.

500
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:02,635
Please take care of him.

501
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:05,780
He's acting strange today. I'm sure he's up with something.

502
00:41:05,786 --> 00:41:07,475
- Right. - I can tell.

503
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:16,915
Woo Young.

504
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,155
Wake up.

505
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:23,100
It's you, Kyung Seok.

506
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,230
Sleep in your bed.

507
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:26,340
Okay, I will.

508
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,170
I won't sleep out.

509
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:29,210
You're home.

510
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,325
Okay, I will go.

511
00:41:35,483 --> 00:41:37,105
Sit up first.

512
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,235
Gosh, why...

513
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,405
It's you, Kyung Seok.

514
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:49,375
I need to brush my teeth before going to bed.

515
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:01,925
Gosh, take it easy.

516
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,475
Here.

517
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,345
Thanks.

518
00:42:28,936 --> 00:42:30,425
Thanks.

519
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:43,335
Gosh, I almost threw up.

520
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,835
My gosh.

521
00:42:46,654 --> 00:42:48,120
This tastes weird.

522
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:49,505
Give me that.

523
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:58,845
Open up.

524
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,915
It's all over his face.

525
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:07,725
This is it.

526
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,425
Please brush the other side too.

527
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:13,110
There, there.

528
00:43:13,113 --> 00:43:14,765
Open up wide.

529
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:20,475
I can't believe I'm doing this.

530
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:27,875
Thanks.

531
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:40,870
It's tougher than I thought.

532
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,995
So why did you drink more than you can handle?

533
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:48,865
I got rejected by Mi Rae.

534
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:56,645
What did you just say?

535
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:00,445
Woo Young.

536
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:05,385
Woo Young. Woo Young.

537
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:19,565
Mi Rae.

538
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:21,180
Yes?

539
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,705
Aren't we going to go on blind dates?

540
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:25,950
Why do you ask?

541
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:29,550
I thought I'd have a cool boyfriend when I entered college.

542
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:31,205
But nothing is happening.

543
00:44:33,027 --> 00:44:34,915
(Kyung Seok)

544
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:46,740
Hello?

545
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,255
Come out for a second.

546
00:44:48,575 --> 00:44:49,925
Now?

547
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:51,925
Yes.

548
00:44:52,012 --> 00:44:53,735
It's not something to talk about tomorrow.

549
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:56,865
Anyway, come out now.

550
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:59,035
Okay.

551
00:45:51,238 --> 00:45:53,695
Go ahead and ask what you have to.

552
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:57,965
What did you do with Woo Young yesterday?

553
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:04,165
Why do I have to tell you that?

554
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:10,205
I heard you rejected him.

555
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:13,260
- Is that right? - Who told you that?

556
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,875
Did Woo Young say that to you?

557
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:16,815
Yes.

558
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:20,960
I didn't think he'd be that kind of a person,

559
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:22,985
but he's such a big mouth.

560
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,565
By the way,

561
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:34,635
did you call me out to ask me that?

562
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:42,905
Yes.

563
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,955
Shall we go?

564
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:06,895
Aren't you going to go?

565
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:10,335
I'll tell you why I turned him down.

566
00:47:14,254 --> 00:47:17,105
I have someone I like.

567
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:22,745
I...

568
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,315
like you.

569
00:47:37,244 --> 00:47:39,095
I like you.

570
00:48:15,082 --> 00:48:17,335
I know it's shameless of me...

571
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:22,475
to say this after rejecting you twice.

572
00:48:23,223 --> 00:48:24,645
It's fine.

573
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,315
I told you I'd wait.

574
00:48:50,117 --> 00:48:52,380
So now, we're...

575
00:48:52,386 --> 00:48:53,835
We're going out, right?

576
00:48:54,288 --> 00:48:56,405
- What? - No?

577
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,015
Yes, right.

578
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,495
Shall we go now?

579
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,895
It's pretty much the same.

580
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,635
Right?

581
00:49:57,818 --> 00:49:59,335
Shall we hold hands, then?

582
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:05,975
Well...

583
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:08,515
We could.

584
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:41,445
We're already here.

585
00:50:44,264 --> 00:50:45,615
I know.

586
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,285
I should let go of your hand now.

587
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:10,145
Thanks. Get home safely.

588
00:51:10,857 --> 00:51:12,905
All right. Go in.

589
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:14,775
Okay.

590
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,215
Bye. Get home safely.

591
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:50,130
- Hey, you're back. - Yes.

592
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,890
Why did he want to see you? Was it about something urgent?

593
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:54,485
No, nothing urgent.

594
00:51:57,003 --> 00:51:58,525
Hey, do you...

595
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,155
still have a crush on Kyung Seok?

596
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:03,695
What?

597
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:07,265
I mean, feelings can change.

598
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:11,235
You may fall for someone else, you know.

599
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,405
Someone else? Gosh, what are you talking about?

600
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:16,845
No.

601
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:27,985
Both you and I need to fall for guys who will like us back.

602
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:41,925
Did something happen yesterday?

603
00:53:43,477 --> 00:53:45,995
You drank a lot last night. Have some of this.

604
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:52,950
And make sure you take this before you drink.

605
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:54,650
(No More Hangovers)

606
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:57,405
- Hey, what's gotten into you? - Why?

607
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,255
I must've made a drunken mistake.

608
00:54:09,436 --> 00:54:11,170
Are you being all nice to me...

609
00:54:11,171 --> 00:54:13,170
because you're going to move out?

610
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:14,955
Why would I move out?

611
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:25,050
- Did you make this? - Yes.

612
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,650
You're a pretty good cook.

613
00:54:26,653 --> 00:54:28,605
You can find all sorts of recipes online.

614
00:54:29,022 --> 00:54:30,445
Right.

615
00:54:32,726 --> 00:54:35,245
- I did make a mistake, didn't I? - You did.

616
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:40,755
Don't tell me that I... I didn't cry, right?

617
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:44,485
I think you did tear up a little.

618
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:47,570
Did I actually cry?

619
00:54:47,574 --> 00:54:50,225
If you jab the back of your throat with a toothbrush like this,

620
00:54:50,277 --> 00:54:52,325
you could tear up.

621
00:54:54,714 --> 00:54:56,835
I'm glad I brushed my teeth before I crashed.

622
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:12,415
I told Mi Rae how I feel about her, but she rejected me.

623
00:55:13,066 --> 00:55:15,415
I thought that she'd at least think about it,

624
00:55:15,802 --> 00:55:17,325
but she said no right away.

625
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:23,355
I know that you have feelings for her too.

626
00:55:23,977 --> 00:55:25,465
Good luck.

627
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:30,435
I'm trying.

628
00:55:30,951 --> 00:55:33,065
You'll have to make a lot of effort.

629
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:36,920
Mi Rae is quite reserved...

630
00:55:36,923 --> 00:55:39,945
and cautious, so it won't be easy.

631
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:44,690
Don't tell her about me getting drunk last night.

632
00:55:44,698 --> 00:55:46,245
She'll feel bad.

633
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:50,825
Did you like her a lot?

634
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:57,295
Yes, I guess so. More than I realized.

635
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:16,145
Am I dreaming now?

636
00:56:22,235 --> 00:56:23,630
(Kyung Seok)

637
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:25,125
Are you up yet?

638
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:28,255
No, this isn't a dream.

639
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:35,565
(Are you up yet?)

640
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,480
(Yes.)

641
00:56:38,485 --> 00:56:39,935
Let's go to the lab together.

642
00:56:43,456 --> 00:56:45,575
- What are you doing? - What?

643
00:56:45,992 --> 00:56:48,015
Did you hear some bad news or what?

644
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:49,515
No.

645
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:54,755
I have to get ready.

646
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:09,665
What's with her?

647
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,105
Should I have done a facial mask last night?

648
00:57:18,224 --> 00:57:21,015
Why is my face so puffy today?

649
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,865
- Hi. - Hi.

650
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:15,665
- Did you have a good sleep? - Yes. What about you?

651
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:17,465
I did too.

652
00:58:20,053 --> 00:58:22,705
This sounds like a conversation in an English textbook.

653
00:58:22,856 --> 00:58:24,245
What do you mean?

654
00:58:24,924 --> 00:58:26,450
Good morning, how are you?

655
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:28,445
I'm fine. And you?

656
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,385
Oh, the bus is here.

657
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:44,895
Go ahead.

658
00:58:46,546 --> 00:58:47,935
Okay.

659
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:58,975
Did you...

660
00:58:59,526 --> 00:59:00,975
have breakfast?

661
00:59:01,294 --> 00:59:04,085
No, I just had a glass of water.

662
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:06,785
Do you usually skip breakfast?

663
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:11,325
Well, you know. I eat breakfast sometimes.

664
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:13,555
What about you?

665
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,655
I had breakfast with Woo Young.

666
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:23,095
- Did you tell him? - Tell him what?

667
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:27,105
Did you tell Woo Young that we're seeing each other now?

668
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:30,435
No, not yet.

669
00:59:31,157 --> 00:59:32,545
I see.

670
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,475
Shall I tell him?

671
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:40,415
No, if he finds out that I started seeing you right away...

672
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:43,085
Do you feel bad?

673
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,325
Yes, a little.

674
00:59:48,074 --> 00:59:49,495
I guess you're...

675
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,125
worried about Woo Young.

676
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:53,595
No, I'm not.

677
00:59:54,747 --> 00:59:58,105
It's just that he was the first person who rooted for us.

678
00:59:58,518 --> 01:00:01,275
Who? Woo Young?

679
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:02,875
Yes.

680
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:05,205
He wished me good luck with you.

681
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,945
I guess I made it pretty obvious that I like you.

682
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:14,885
He deserved to get his teeth brushed.

683
01:00:14,968 --> 01:00:16,315
What?

684
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:18,025
Nothing.

685
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,195
By the way,

686
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:28,965
I'd prefer not to tell people.

687
01:00:29,082 --> 01:00:30,465
Why?

688
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:33,165
Are you scared they might say something?

689
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,075
Yes.

690
01:00:35,688 --> 01:00:37,475
I must sound so dumb now.

691
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:42,775
If anyone says anything, I won't let it slide.

692
01:00:45,765 --> 01:00:48,655
Do whatever you want. It doesn't matter to me.

693
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,065
But no one on this bus knows us.

694
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:03,865
What?

695
01:01:15,962 --> 01:01:16,990
Forget it if you don't want to.

696
01:01:16,996 --> 01:01:19,445
No, I want to.

697
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:50,745
Let's stay like this until we get off.

698
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:53,615
Okay.

699
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,435
Are they coming together?

700
01:02:10,016 --> 01:02:11,710
You mean Kyung Seok and Soo A?

701
01:02:11,718 --> 01:02:12,850
Yes.

702
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:15,250
But Kyung Seok was quite upset yesterday.

703
01:02:15,254 --> 01:02:16,450
He seemed a bit angry.

704
01:02:16,456 --> 01:02:18,020
Haven't you watched any romantic comedies?

705
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:19,920
Bickering can make the heart grow fonder.

706
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:22,520
That's true. I wonder why we're still not fond of each other.

707
01:02:22,528 --> 01:02:24,730
Oh, what happened yesterday?

708
01:02:24,731 --> 01:02:26,985
- With what? - With Kyung Seok.

709
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:29,415
Drum rolls.

710
01:02:31,637 --> 01:02:33,500
I think he likes someone else.

711
01:02:33,506 --> 01:02:34,895
What?

712
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:41,580
Hey, where are you now?

713
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:42,680
I'm almost there.

714
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:45,310
I have big news for you.

715
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:46,935
What is it?

716
01:02:48,354 --> 01:02:49,975
He rejected Soo A.

717
01:02:51,524 --> 01:02:53,305
That serves her right.

718
01:02:53,326 --> 01:02:55,390
Apparently, Kyung Seok likes someone else.

719
01:02:55,395 --> 01:02:57,175
Gosh, who could it be?

720
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:01,060
She must be prettier than Soo A, so it can't be someone at our school.

721
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:02,915
- Hey. - What?

722
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:04,825
Soo A isn't that pretty.

723
01:03:07,473 --> 01:03:09,595
Goodness gracious.

724
01:03:10,076 --> 01:03:12,695
You should've given up like that a long ago.

725
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:16,295
Who could it be?

726
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:20,365
Are you going to keep it from Hyun Jung too?

727
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,475
No, I should tell her.

728
01:03:29,662 --> 01:03:32,290
You go in first. I'll go in a bit later.

729
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:35,200
No, I'll go in later. You go ahead.

730
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:36,230
No, you go in first.

731
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:39,385
No, you go ahead. It's really okay.

732
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:40,895
What are you guys doing?

733
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:44,195
Hey, Eun.

734
01:03:44,844 --> 01:03:46,695
What are you two doing here?

735
01:03:47,947 --> 01:03:50,040
We just ran into each other here.

736
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:51,465
What?

737
01:03:55,021 --> 01:03:57,475
That answer didn't even make any sense.

738
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:01,945
I'll head in first.

739
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:09,315
Did Kyung Seok...

740
01:04:09,836 --> 01:04:11,830
tell you what happened with Soo A yesterday?

741
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:13,225
Sorry?

742
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:17,595
I don't think their talk went well.

743
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:19,865
I knew it.

744
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,310
How?

745
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:24,150
I think he has feelings for you.

746
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,535
What?

747
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,175
Gosh, Eun. What on earth are you talking about?

748
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,545
You said Jung Boon is taking a summer class, right?

749
01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:38,115
Yes, let's visit her at school soon.

750
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:41,355
My gosh, I miss Jung Boon.

751
01:04:42,802 --> 01:04:44,725
I feel bad for Soo A.

752
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:46,985
She should've just kept it to herself.

753
01:04:47,607 --> 01:04:51,125
Hey, why didn't you feel bad for me?

754
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:55,110
Everyone knew I had a crush on Kyung Seok. I was so embarrassed.

755
01:04:55,114 --> 01:04:58,265
Because you were hitting on him left and right.

756
01:04:58,518 --> 01:04:59,905
What?

757
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:02,275
What the...

758
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:04,975
Hey, Tae Hee.

759
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:15,315
Kyung Seok.

760
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:33,605
Shouldn't we finish our conversation from yesterday?

761
01:05:34,353 --> 01:05:36,205
I told you everything I had to say.

762
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:40,375
I've told everyone...

763
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,345
that you rejected me.

764
01:05:45,898 --> 01:05:47,555
- Eun. - Yes?

765
01:05:49,202 --> 01:05:51,525
I have to use the restroom quickly.

766
01:05:51,771 --> 01:05:53,885
- Okay. - All right.

767
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:01,495
I won't be like that again.

768
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:04,335
I'm sorry if I annoyed you.

769
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:09,105
We'll have to see each other at school,

770
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:12,445
so we'll both be uncomfortable if we're on bad terms.

771
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:14,520
Let's at least say hi to each other.

772
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:16,175
If you behave yourself.

773
01:06:19,265 --> 01:06:20,815
You're so cold to me.

774
01:06:23,002 --> 01:06:25,255
So are you and Mi Rae seeing each other now?

775
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,755
Are you two dating?

776
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:34,225
Yes.

777
01:06:40,253 --> 01:06:41,735
We're seeing each other now.

778
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:06,240
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

779
01:07:06,245 --> 01:07:07,810
You've gotten so brave, Mi Rae.

780
01:07:07,813 --> 01:07:09,110
How dare you.

781
01:07:09,115 --> 01:07:10,340
I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

782
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:13,180
We won't run into people from our department here, right?

783
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:15,950
It looked like Tae Young was confessing his feelings to her.

784
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:18,390
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

785
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:19,650
Hey, isn't this Soo A?

786
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:20,660
What is this?

787
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,960
I happened to see it while surfing the web.

788
01:07:22,962 --> 01:07:24,160
Who took the photos?

789
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:25,690
You'll hide it from people in your department?

790
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:28,060
"Whom is he seeing after rejecting Soo A?"

791
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:29,660
If people find out that it's me...

792
01:07:29,669 --> 01:07:31,000
Don't feel bad for me.

793
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:32,925
That's what Soo A wants.
