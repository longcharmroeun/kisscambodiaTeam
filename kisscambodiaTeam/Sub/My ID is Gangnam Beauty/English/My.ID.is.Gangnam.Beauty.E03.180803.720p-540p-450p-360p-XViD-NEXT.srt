1
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:22,815
Hey, gosh.

2
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:39,500
Hey, you flirted with me first.

3
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,540
How dare you act like you don't know, wench?

4
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:44,010
Did you think things would work out for real because I was nice to you?

5
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,835
Don't make me laugh. People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

6
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,845
Gosh, you plastic monster.

7
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:01,055
How dare you swear at me?

8
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:03,555
What did I do so wrong?

9
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,825
What did I do?

10
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,870
Why that crazy... Do you want to die?

11
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:10,625
That crazy witch. Hey!

12
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:28,745
It's you, Mi Rae.

13
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,215
Why are you sitting here alone?

14
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,885
Did you drink a lot?

15
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:39,955
Don't you remember me?

16
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:44,965
The TA?

17
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:50,635
Hello.

18
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:52,805
Is the fresh week party already over?

19
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:54,575
No.

20
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:58,645
Did something happen?

21
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,975
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

22
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:06,345
Do you want some water?

23
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:17,840
Have some water.

24
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,340
You're really pretty.

25
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:22,535
Gosh, you plastic monster.

26
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,505
It's okay.

27
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:29,335
Kang Mi Rae.

28
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,605
What are you doing here?

29
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:34,675
I'm heading home.

30
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:37,215
All right, then.

31
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:40,145
- Let's go. - What was your name again?

32
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:42,685
Come on, let's go.

33
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,500
- What are you doing now? - Mind your own business.

34
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,840
Why are you going with her? I don't get what this is about.

35
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:55,335
What are you trying to do with a girl who's drunk?

36
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:00,405
What on earth are you thinking?

37
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,635
You're the one who's trying to take her.

38
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:08,345
I don't know what kind of relationship you have with her,

39
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,645
but do you know this can be considered violence?

40
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,430
Cut it out. Let's go.

41
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,925
Let go.

42
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,295
I never told you you could grab my hand.

43
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:36,175
(Episode 3: You Don't Even Know)

44
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:47,485
Thank you.

45
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,255
You didn't have to get me home.

46
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:56,725
We must make sure all freshmen get home safely.

47
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:02,370
Why did you guys come? I'm totally fine.

48
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,510
Come on, we freshmen must look after each other.

49
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:07,880
Hey, we came with her. You had no reason to worry.

50
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,675
That's exactly why we were worried.

51
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:15,615
Then get home safely. Thank you.

52
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,215
- Guys, get home safely. - Okay.

53
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:21,485
- Go on in, Soo A. - Bye.

54
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,555
Bye.

55
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,695
She lives here?

56
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,895
I thought she seemed very well-off.

57
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,065
Her family must be rich.

58
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:57,655
Don't make me laugh. People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

59
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:00,425
Gosh, you plastic monster.

60
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:04,895
I just wanted to be normal.

61
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,695
All I wanted was a normal life like everyone else's.

62
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:12,335
Is it something that I can never have?

63
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:17,875
- What are you doing here? - My gosh!

64
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,590
Why are you so surprised?

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,245
It's me. Don't you remember me?

66
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,215
Do I know you?

67
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,515
What are you talking about?

68
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,830
We met yesterday at the club in Cheongdam-dong.

69
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,585
I guess you were really drunk.

70
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:34,970
I have no idea what you're talking about now.

71
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,465
What's going on? Who is this guy?

72
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,995
I don't know.

73
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:47,605
Well, aren't you Yu Ri?

74
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:50,075
No, you got the wrong person.

75
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm sorry. You look so much like this girl I know.

76
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,945
Look carefully, will you?

77
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,290
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

78
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,785
My apologies.

79
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,155
What was that about?

80
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:07,755
Mi Rae, are you all right?

81
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,635
Someone called me a plastic monster.

82
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:21,435
What?

83
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,875
He said that girls like me are everywhere in Gangnam.

84
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,215
Who said that? That jerk?

85
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,935
Hey, you should report him.

86
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,210
But I hit him too.

87
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:32,875
The one who attacks first should be punished.

88
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,875
What started the fight though?

89
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:38,485
Him calling me a plastic monster? Or the remark about Gangnam?

90
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:41,230
I'll just end up with another mean nickname.

91
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,885
This is crazy.

92
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:47,400
I got plastic surgery done to enjoy what everyone else enjoys.

93
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,825
What's so wrong about it?

94
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,295
Do you think I was too greedy?

95
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,110
You know what? Was her name Hyun Soo A? She's ridiculous too.

96
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:59,640
You said you two are close.

97
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,705
How could she say such a thing in front of everyone?

98
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:06,445
She said she didn't know.

99
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:07,945
Whatever.

100
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,815
What if someone else asks me if I got work done on my face?

101
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,390
I should just tell the truth, right?

102
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:16,585
If you lie and say that you got nothing done...

103
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,455
You'll look obnoxious.

104
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:22,400
Then shall I tell people that I only got my eyes and nose done?

105
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:26,965
Gosh, no. That makes it sound like you wanted to get more done.

106
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:30,410
Take out "only". Just say you got your eyes and nose done.

107
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,565
My, you sure are a psychology major.

108
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,150
How about I tell them about the face contouring surgery and all else?

109
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:39,805
No, that's not necessary.

110
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:42,215
Right?

111
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,190
Getting plastic surgery isn't something to brag about.

112
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:48,060
Hey, you should still be confident.

113
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,160
Just don't overreact.

114
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,785
Yes, I know.

115
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:55,295
They'll probably look down on me if I cause a fuss about it.

116
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,170
People looked down on me because I was ugly.

117
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:00,365
And now, they'll look down on me because I got plastic surgery.

118
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:05,205
I'm not ugly nor pretty.

119
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,935
But then, I'm not normal either.

120
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:13,905
I don't even know myself anymore.

121
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,390
I don't know which category I should adjust myself to.

122
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:20,390
If you have to choose, you should adjust yourself to being pretty.

123
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,660
Don't you remember?

124
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:24,955
Some guy told you that you're his ideal type at the orientation.

125
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,095
That's probably because he thought I was easy.

126
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,925
Forget it.

127
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,025
Drink up.

128
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,575
Mom.

129
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:51,345
Goodness, you came to pick me up.

130
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,030
Hello?

131
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,200
Ma'am, are you back in Korea?

132
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:01,870
You said you'll be back tomorrow.

133
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:04,540
We were going to go pick you up.

134
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,670
That's why I came early.

135
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:08,810
You need to let us do the least we can do...

136
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,810
to make us feel comfortable.

137
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,735
There's no need.

138
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,605
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

139
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,800
- Do Sang Won... - Do Sang Won...

140
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:39,565
- will support your future! - will support your future!

141
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,740
You should play these kind of songs to attract young people.

142
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:46,505
Trot songs are no longer effective in Seoul.

143
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,450
Are you telling me to dance like you just did?

144
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:50,880
No. If you dance throughout the entire song,

145
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,550
people will think you only practiced dancing...

146
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,290
instead of focusing on making policies.

147
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,750
So you just need to dance to the highlight.

148
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:59,520
You can start dancing from this part...

149
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:02,060
until this part.

150
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:05,225
You only need to dance throughout the chorus.

151
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,655
Do you guys think this is a good idea?

152
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:14,865
I'll leave the dancing to the promoters.

153
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,020
It'd be nice to have Kyung Seok stand beside you.

154
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:27,845
But his birthday hasn't passed yet.

155
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,190
Ah Reum is known for being pretty among all the politician's children.

156
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,690
But compared to Kyung Seok, she's more like a squid.

157
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,260
Can you refrain from using those kind of terms?

158
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:39,230
I'm saying you need to focus on the young voters in order to win.

159
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:42,630
If you become the mayor, your next goal will be to become a governor.

160
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:44,095
And then...

161
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,370
Congressman Do, you have a phone call.

162
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,540
Who's calling?

163
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:50,935
She's the head of Hankook Kelun.

164
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:01,350
Hello?

165
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:04,815
It's been a while. I'm back in Korea.

166
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,160
I know.

167
00:12:06,162 --> 00:12:10,085
I know we're not close enough to ask each other how we've been doing.

168
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,660
So I'll just cut to the chase.

169
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,095
Please tell Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee...

170
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,370
that I wish to meet them.

171
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:20,170
Why would you meet them? You don't deserve to see them.

172
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,410
I didn't call to ask you for your permission.

173
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:26,880
I'm only trying to keep my manners since you raised the kids until now.

174
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,475
I'm going to meet my kids, so just keep that in mind.

175
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:35,545
She must be out of her mind.

176
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:15,830
Can you get up for a second?

177
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,230
There are so many men who wish to date you.

178
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:20,925
So I figured I should make you mine as soon as possible.

179
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,025
Because you're my girl.

180
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,565
- Do you want to die? - I'm sorry.

181
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,865
I was out of line, right?

182
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,505
Should I take a break this semester?

183
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:35,475
What? Are you going to go to the army?

184
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,420
Didn't I tell you last time?

185
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:42,145
You're the type who goes to the army after breaking up with someone.

186
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:46,085
But you didn't even date anyone yet. So why would you take a break?

187
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:49,585
Hi, you guys.

188
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,855
Why aren't you guys heading to class?

189
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,340
You have really long legs.

190
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:00,795
What?

191
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,110
I'll see you later.

192
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,635
Okay.

193
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,805
I guess...

194
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,720
nothing really happened between you and Soo A last night.

195
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,215
Am I correct?

196
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:19,520
Why do you think she said, "I'll see you later"?

197
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,855
She meant she'll see us in class.

198
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,925
I do have long legs.

199
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,225
When did she have the time to notice that?

200
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:33,065
I think you should go to the army to get to your senses.

201
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,775
I don't understand Soo A.

202
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,950
She should've gotten the message...

203
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:49,090
when she saw Mi Rae hesitating to answer.

204
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,885
Mi Rae obviously got her eyelids done and a nose job.

205
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,885
Soo A's so slow-witted.

206
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,185
Don't you want to know...

207
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,825
how Mi Rae used to look in the past?

208
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:03,895
Ye Na.

209
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:05,940
Hello.

210
00:15:05,941 --> 00:15:07,910
Hi.

211
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,335
Kyung Seok.

212
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:13,005
Can we talk?

213
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:15,775
He's talking with me right now.

214
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,650
I'm sorry. I need to talk to him regarding a class we're taking.

215
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:24,815
We're in the same research team. He's the leader. I'm the assistant.

216
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:27,985
Okay, then. I'll see you later.

217
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,585
By the way, Ye Na.

218
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:35,455
You have chili powder stuck in between your teeth.

219
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,775
Gosh, what am I going to do?

220
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:59,615
Don't you want to know how Mi Rae used to look in the past?

221
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,995
Shouldn't we resolve our misunderstanding?

222
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,165
We're in the same research team.

223
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,805
I apologized to Mi Rae yesterday.

224
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,935
Mi Rae told me that she was fine.

225
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,305
But I still felt really sorry.

226
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:28,345
She must've been so flustered.

227
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:33,085
Every time I saw Mi Rae,

228
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:37,355
I was always envious of how pretty she looked.

229
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,995
I said that because I didn't know she had received plastic surgery.

230
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,670
I'm so slow-witted.

231
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,695
Then why did you ask?

232
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:49,640
What?

233
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,635
If you didn't know she got plastic surgery,

234
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:54,235
why did you ask her if she did or not?

235
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,745
I just...

236
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:02,520
said that without really thinking much about it.

237
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:04,945
You don't seem that dumb.

238
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:10,155
Did you tell Chan Woo that you like him without thinking as well?

239
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:15,295
But then again, you might actually like him.

240
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,795
Well...

241
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,135
I just wanted the seniors to like me.

242
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:23,995
Do you have more to say?

243
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,305
What are you guys doing?

244
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,905
We were talking about last night.

245
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,415
What happened? Did Kyung Seok apologize?

246
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:42,085
Yes, kind of.

247
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,655
I guess he was bothered by how he treated you.

248
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:50,625
I told him that I'm okay and that he shouldn't worry.

249
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,695
Something's fishy.

250
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,340
What?

251
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:58,035
He could've purposely caused trouble so that he can see you in private.

252
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:01,005
Do you think he's just pretending to be cold?

253
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,505
You know how people sometimes act cold just so they could be nice?

254
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:05,505
Why would he do that?

255
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:08,175
I guess you're right. He's not Won Ho.

256
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,490
But if Kyung Seok asks you out,

257
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,490
I don't think you'll be able to reject him.

258
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:14,630
- You're the one who's weird. - What?

259
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,730
You seem very interested in Kyung Seok.

260
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,525
Do you like him?

261
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:21,970
What are you talking about?

262
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,895
I prefer guys who are more nice and approachable.

263
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:29,435
Kyung Seok is way too cold-blooded. He's ice cold.

264
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:35,980
But seriously, why are you so slow-witted?

265
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,375
How can you think Mi Rae didn't get plastic surgery?

266
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:41,715
It's so obvious.

267
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,265
- Didn't she get too much done? - I know, right? It's a bit much.

268
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,565
- Seriously? - She just stared at us.

269
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:08,605
- Gangnam Beauty. - Yes, the typical Gangnam face.

270
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,315
So this happened again.

271
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:17,345
Again.

272
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,755
(Kang Mi Rae)

273
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:40,635
Why are you here?

274
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,005
What? I'm in this class.

275
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,245
Are you the overly self-conscious type?

276
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:13,335
Spare me a minute.

277
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:15,875
Let's talk.

278
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,515
You somehow keep getting involved in my problems.

279
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,085
I hope you can stop overreacting.

280
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,985
With the TA and Soo A too.

281
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,825
Don't get the wrong idea about Soo A. She really didn't know.

282
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:47,335
Anyone could tell that I got work done on my face, but anyway...

283
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,105
Why did you do it?

284
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:51,575
What?

285
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:54,045
Why did you get plastic surgery...

286
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,075
on your face?

287
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,160
It's okay, Jung Boon.

288
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,700
I can do it by myself.

289
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:09,270
Don't be like that. We should take turns.

290
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:12,065
It's not like being top of the class is a penalty.

291
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:20,265
Hey, you're the freshmen representative, right?

292
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:21,905
Yes.

293
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,645
What do you mean why I got plastic surgery?

294
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,075
Why are you even asking?

295
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:31,415
You know that I had no choice but to get plastic surgery.

296
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:36,285
What exactly do you mean by that?

297
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,155
Who says plastic surgery is a must for some and not for others?

298
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,525
Well, I just meant that...

299
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:50,365
You know what I used to look like.

300
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:55,975
I never even dreamed of becoming as pretty as Soo A is.

301
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:59,445
Not even Ji Hyo.

302
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:02,445
I would've been happy with looking like Jung Boon or Eun.

303
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,985
Had I looked like them, I would've never gotten anything done.

304
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:09,885
But my face was far below the average, you know.

305
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,455
Do you...

306
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,825
grade other people's faces?

307
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,305
It sounds like what needed surgery was your unhealthy mindset.

308
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:36,145
What did you just say?

309
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,615
It's none of your business.

310
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:44,315
Why do you even care about what I think?

311
00:22:56,745 --> 00:23:00,705
That jerk. What does he even know? He has no clue.

312
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,885
It sounds like what needed surgery was your unhealthy mindset.

313
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,825
What did you say?

314
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,825
Kyung Seok, where are you going? Are you headed home?

315
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:28,370
Yes.

316
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:30,240
I must say, you're so gutsy.

317
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,935
The seniors told us to gather, but you totally ignored it.

318
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:34,965
You're brave.

319
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:38,645
- Why do they want us to gather? - You didn't know about it?

320
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:41,220
Don't you check the group chat?

321
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:43,520
Kim Chan Woo told all freshmen to assemble.

322
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,245
I wonder what he's up to this time.

323
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,215
Did one of us do something wrong yesterday?

324
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,955
He must've told the girls to assemble too, right?

325
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:55,255
I wonder if Soo A is coming.

326
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:58,170
Gosh, he should be embarrassed that he hasn't graduated yet.

327
00:23:58,173 --> 00:24:00,025
Why did he come to the frosh week party?

328
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:03,795
I'll say something to him. Gosh, what a hassle.

329
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:08,950
Hey, you flirted with me first.

330
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,150
How dare you act like you don't know, wench?

331
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:13,675
Did you think things would work out for real because I was nice to you?

332
00:24:13,722 --> 00:24:16,545
Don't make me laugh. People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

333
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:23,955
It must be because of me.

334
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,555
I bet he wants to get back at me.

335
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:31,755
(Choi Jung Boon)

336
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:37,135
Hey, Jung Boon.

337
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:42,375
Yes, I saw it.

338
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:44,750
He said that he'll teach us a serious lesson.

339
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:46,650
I have no idea what it's about.

340
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:49,615
Well, Eun didn't do anything wrong.

341
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:04,795
Do you guys think I'm a joke?

342
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,365
Where's everyone else?

343
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,310
Well, many have already gone home.

344
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:13,980
You guys are the rudest freshmen in the school's entire history.

345
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:15,675
Do you know that, you jerks?

346
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:21,345
Is Do Kyung Seok not here?

347
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,490
I told you that it's all of your responsibility.

348
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:30,130
Get ready for some real punishment. You're all dead meat.

349
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:33,325
Gosh, has he lost his mind? Why do we have to get punished?

350
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,125
All of you, in push-up position.

351
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,895
- Sorry? - I said, in push-up position!

352
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:39,665
Do I have to repeat myself?

353
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,040
Gosh, you little...

354
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,165
Chan Woo, Chan Woo!

355
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:48,205
- What is it? Why are you here? - What are you doing now?

356
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,105
What will you do if someone records and posts a video of this?

357
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,975
All of you, run over there in 10 seconds. Now.

358
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:01,315
And all of you must give your phone to Jung Ho with no exception.

359
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:03,215
Hold on to my bag and be on the watch.

360
00:26:08,003 --> 00:26:10,895
- That crazy jerk. - He'll hear.

361
00:26:14,743 --> 00:26:16,235
Hurry up!

362
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,505
Assume push-up position!

363
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,045
What?

364
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:29,145
Is the space too tight?

365
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:35,160
All of you girls can leave.

366
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:37,355
I never punish girls.

367
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:39,255
Get out!

368
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:50,965
Except for you, Kang Mi Rae.

369
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:56,910
Girls, who think they're pretty despite all the work they got done,

370
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:59,245
need a serious lesson.

371
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,215
Your face is a reflection of your heart.

372
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:05,175
Am I wrong? Answer me.

373
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:09,055
Then I'll stay too.

374
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,085
What?

375
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:16,330
I'll stay here with her.

376
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:17,755
Soo A, why...

377
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:21,710
This has nothing to do with you. Why would you do that for her?

378
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,765
Then what did I do wrong?

379
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,805
What did you just say?

380
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:28,365
And what did these guys do wrong?

381
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:31,875
Guys, leave us.

382
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,675
Get out!

383
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:47,485
You should really be begging me for forgiveness.

384
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:49,925
How dare you say that you've done nothing wrong?

385
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:54,525
Shall I make your face go back to how it used to look?

386
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:56,440
- Don't do this, Chan Woo. - Get lost!

387
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:58,340
- Chan Woo, calm down. - Gosh, shut your mouth.

388
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:00,065
- Chan Woo, please. - Hey.

389
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:03,235
Get out, all of you. Get lost!

390
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,015
Hey.

391
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:14,185
You're the one who told all freshmen to call me SOJ, right?

392
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,885
It was you, wasn't it?

393
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,585
I know it was you!

394
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:25,095
You and Do Kyung Seok are the most arrogant ones in your year.

395
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,535
Fine, I'll punish you for Kyung Seok not showing up as well.

396
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,235
Hey.

397
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:34,035
Hey.

398
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:40,715
You crazy jerk.

399
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:45,515
Hey.

400
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:52,255
You crazy jerk.

401
00:28:54,703 --> 00:28:56,595
You must be out of your mind.

402
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:01,765
I'm going to kill you today.

403
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:04,365
Let go of this. Let go!

404
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,585
Are you okay?

405
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:42,980
- Hey, give me your cell phone. - My gosh.

406
00:29:42,984 --> 00:29:44,675
Hurry.

407
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:49,615
(Chemistry Department Office, TA: Yeon Woo Young)

408
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,285
Come in.

409
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,785
Hi. Please sit down.

410
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:02,725
It's hard being the head of all the freshmen, isn't it?

411
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:05,255
No, it's okay.

412
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:11,065
I just heard that something happened.

413
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,435
Can you tell me everything including all the details?

414
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,345
Yes.

415
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,975
Yes, I think I'll be sleeping there.

416
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:28,385
Make sure to lock your door before you sleep.

417
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:31,915
Okay, bye.

418
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:16,835
It's been four months.

419
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:21,105
Tae Sik, you've done enough.

420
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:24,710
If you want a child to look exactly like you,

421
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,775
I'll give birth to another baby.

422
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:31,690
- Mom. - What are you doing here?

423
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:32,990
Don't you have class tomorrow?

424
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:35,485
I'll just get up a little early.

425
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,485
Here. I bought you dumplings.

426
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:41,325
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

427
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,295
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

428
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:46,965
Where's Dad?

429
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:50,935
He went to the funeral of his friend's father.

430
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:53,480
Does that mean he's not coming home?

431
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:55,105
Probably.

432
00:31:57,185 --> 00:32:02,715
He's feeling a lot better now, so don't worry too much.

433
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,085
Really?

434
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:09,785
Yes, he's almost over it.

435
00:32:11,232 --> 00:32:13,625
Are you here because something bad happened?

436
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:16,995
No, everything's fine.

437
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:18,695
I'm going to take a shower.

438
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:20,565
Okay.

439
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:28,580
Why did you bring your car? We're going to drink.

440
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:29,950
I'll just call a chauffeur service.

441
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,520
Gosh, you live nearby. That's such a waste of money.

442
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,320
Please give us a lot of side dishes.

443
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:37,990
He'll be buying tonight because his daughter goes to Hankook University.

444
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:38,990
Okay.

445
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:41,120
Show me some photos of Mi Rae's entrance ceremony.

446
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,860
She goes to the most prestigious university in the neighborhood.

447
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:44,230
I don't have any photos.

448
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:45,855
Didn't you take any?

449
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,700
My wife took photos with her cell phone.

450
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:50,300
Then ask her to send them to you.

451
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,495
Let's just drink. Here.

452
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:57,110
Isn't Mi Rae going to take us on a tour around the campus?

453
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,580
That's a good idea. We should pay her a visit.

454
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:01,980
We should use this chance to take a look around Hankook University.

455
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:03,750
University students are busy.

456
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:06,175
She doesn't even have time to come home.

457
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:07,880
My gosh, you punk.

458
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:11,550
Look at how arrogant he's being just because Mi Rae's back in Korea.

459
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,360
You used to always boast about her.

460
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:15,785
But now, you're not even talking about her as much.

461
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,130
- I'm going to leave. - Gosh, stop.

462
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:20,725
- Look at him. - I was kidding.

463
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,570
- Let's drink. - He gets upset so easily.

464
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,070
I'm buying you drinks. Come on, let's just drink.

465
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:28,810
- Come on. - Congratulations.

466
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,010
I can't believe she's a student at Hankook University.

467
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:34,135
I knew she'd get in.

468
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:43,545
You're a star, Mi Rae.

469
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:48,385
Gosh, stop watching it and sleep.

470
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:52,455
I'm going to watch it again by myself tomorrow.

471
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:03,535
Are you having fun at school?

472
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,610
It's not bad.

473
00:34:06,614 --> 00:34:08,105
My gosh.

474
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,175
I guess the money was worth it.

475
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:14,020
They're finally seeing...

476
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:17,145
your true value now that you look pretty.

477
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:21,885
What's my true value?

478
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:26,300
You're cute, bright,

479
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:29,495
nice, and cheerful.

480
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,425
You were cheerful ever since you were a baby.

481
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,035
On your first birthday, you danced the night away.

482
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:43,505
Everyone thought you'd grow up and become a celebrity.

483
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:49,345
Now,

484
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,785
you should make a lot of friends...

485
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,285
and have lots of fun.

486
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,385
Enjoy your life.

487
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,755
It'll be the best years of your life.

488
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:08,425
Mom, I'm sleepy.

489
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,105
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

490
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:16,675
You need to wake up early for school tomorrow.

491
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:38,495
Look at you acting like a baby after hearing about your first birthday.

492
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:44,735
Mom, you must've had a hard time because of me until now.

493
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:49,205
Life...

494
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:53,575
is all about fighting through your struggles.

495
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,215
People might seem like they're living a worry-free life.

496
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:02,285
But they're all just trying their best to keep living.

497
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:11,295
I like how you smell, Mom.

498
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,795
Gosh, you're so sensitive to smell.

499
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,665
My cute little baby.

500
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:22,105
I'm so glad to hear that you're doing well in school.

501
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:35,885
Sir, you can't enter because you drank alcohol.

502
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:40,925
You have one new message.

503
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:44,695
Tae Sik, you've done enough.

504
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:48,140
If you want a child to look exactly like you,

505
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:51,265
I'll give birth to another baby.

506
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:55,180
- Mom. - What are you doing here?

507
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:56,480
Don't you have class tomorrow?

508
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:58,975
I'll just get up a little early.

509
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,175
Here. I bought you dumplings.

510
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:05,015
How nice. I was feeling hungry.

511
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:08,945
She even bought dumplings for her dad.

512
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:10,485
Where's Dad?

513
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:17,895
(Voice message)

514
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,120
Do you know a freshman beat up his senior who's five years older?

515
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,090
Really?

516
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:40,660
The senior flew from the first bathroom stall to the last.

517
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:41,920
That means he at least flew...

518
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,660
- for about 8m. - Exactly.

519
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:46,130
- The fight ended in two seconds. - Come on.

520
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,300
He dodged the mop...

521
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:50,170
and did a full 360 turn, then kicked him.

522
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:51,570
- Have you heard? - What?

523
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:53,340
His jaw and ribs are all broken.

524
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:54,840
- Seriously? - Isn't it crazy?

525
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:56,565
- That is crazy. - My gosh.

526
00:37:57,211 --> 00:38:01,005
Shouldn't we persuade him to transfer to our department?

527
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:02,705
What's his name?

528
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:06,350
What was it? Was it Do Kyung Seok?

529
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,145
- Do Kyung Seok? - Do Kyung Seok.

530
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:13,515
Why did he show up when I was just about to kick him?

531
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:16,255
Just enlist in the military.

532
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,300
(Here's a mop flower.)

533
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:23,195
If I were him, I'd drop out of school.

534
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:26,795
Get it out of my face.

535
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:31,010
By the way, why did he do that to Kang Mi Rae?

536
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:33,410
It's not like SOJ does things like that for reasons.

537
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:36,305
I guess he wanted to have some fun with her, but it didn't go well.

538
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:38,950
But still, how could Kyung Seok do that to a senior?

539
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,320
Do you call a mop your senior?

540
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:41,880
He does not deserve our respect.

541
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,290
So is Mop his new nickname now?

542
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,290
Let's be honest. Isn't it so gratifying?

543
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:49,885
My, I'd love to be as gutsy as Kyung Seok is.

544
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,755
Even everything he does melts my heart.

545
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:59,995
Is she not coming to class today? Shall I try calling her?

546
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:04,035
We still have some time until the class starts.

547
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:10,205
What if worse things happen?

548
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,475
What if Kyung Seok gets in trouble because of me?

549
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:15,845
Mi Rae!

550
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:22,755
Are you okay?

551
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:29,200
Everyone thinks that Kim Chan Woo is a total jerk,

552
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,695
so don't worry.

553
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:34,565
I shouldn't have told everyone to come.

554
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:36,835
I'm sorry.

555
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,810
I deeply regretted just standing there and doing nothing.

556
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:42,565
I should've spoken up no matter how scared I was.

557
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:46,175
Don't say that. I know that you had no choice.

558
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:49,790
I'm the one who should apologize. It was all because of me.

559
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,415
Hey, that is not true.

560
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:55,485
It's my fault for not doing a good job as our representative.

561
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,655
I'm sorry, Mi Rae.

562
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:02,185
You must've been terrified.

563
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:05,770
I felt so bad that I couldn't even sleep last night.

564
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:08,600
Kim Chan Woo, that jerk. We should have taught him a real lesson.

565
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:12,905
That's what I'm saying. We should've rubbed the mop all over his face.

566
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:16,205
- I'm Kim Sung Woon. - 80 out of 100.

567
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:17,680
I'd give her 85...

568
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:19,335
- when she's dressed up. - I'm Lee Ji Hyo.

569
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,545
Gosh, I told you guys to just talk casually.

570
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,720
- I'm Choi Jung Boon. - 70 out of 100?

571
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:26,515
- She has a cute, friendly face. - Are you the one that created...

572
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,455
Totally.

573
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:33,725
They're such nice people. What on earth was I thinking?

574
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:38,195
I judged them by their looks and graded their faces.

575
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,495
I'm sorry.

576
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,235
For what?

577
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:50,775
And thank you both so much.

578
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:56,415
I just did what anyone would've done in that situation.

579
00:40:56,524 --> 00:41:00,985
It's not easy to volunteer to stay behind with me in that situation.

580
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:05,155
I couldn't leave you alone in there. We're friends, you know.

581
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,695
To tell you the truth, I felt like I owed you an apology.

582
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,795
I wondered if Chan Woo was taking things out on you...

583
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:16,365
because of me.

584
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:21,235
He actually told me that he likes me,

585
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:24,105
but I rejected him because it made me so uncomfortable.

586
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,350
The thing is, he asked me if it was because of you.

587
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,845
He totally jumped to his own conclusions.

588
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:34,160
Then did you babble on to Soo A to hit me in the back?

589
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,285
She says she can't go out with me because you like me.

590
00:41:37,531 --> 00:41:40,325
- What did I do? - What did you do?

591
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,870
Hey, you flirted with me first.

592
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,055
How dare you act like you don't know, wench?

593
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,535
That's why I thought he was taking it out on you.

594
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:54,905
I felt so bad.

595
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:59,135
No, you did nothing wrong.

596
00:41:59,153 --> 00:42:01,545
You obviously had to reject a jerk like him.

597
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:06,090
Now, everyone calls him Mop instead of SOJ.

598
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:09,685
Really? I think that nickname suits him better.

599
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:14,100
I must say, Mi Rae is quite brave. She spoke up in that situation.

600
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:16,525
Whatever. Soo A was the brave one.

601
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:20,665
I'm impressed that she stood up for Mi Rae in that situation.

602
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:24,565
My gosh. She's pretty, and she's such a loyal friend as well.

603
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,335
She's pretty and thoughtful.

604
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,365
I didn't even do much.

605
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:33,645
Frankly, Kyung Seok was the one who really came to your rescue.

606
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:44,385
I must say, it seems like he gives you special treatment.

607
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:47,025
- Aren't I right? - What do you mean?

608
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,995
Are you two going out by any chance?

609
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:51,555
What?

610
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,565
Hey, I heard Kang Mi Rae came to school today.

611
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:57,165
- Seriously? - Yes.

612
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,935
I thought she'd take a few days off.

613
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,605
She's much stronger than I thought.

614
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,960
The time when I made that mistake at our fresh week party...

615
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:15,745
and this time too.

616
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,300
It's almost as if he can't stand seeing you in difficult situations.

617
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,325
Well, that's...

618
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,370
Are you two still testing the waters?

619
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,770
What? It's really not what you think.

620
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:29,440
No? But I've seen the two of you talking about your secrets.

621
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,910
Secrets? When?

622
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,080
That day in front of the vending machine.

623
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,675
When you were with Eun and Jung Boon.

624
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:40,945
- Thanks for this. - Mi Rae.

625
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:48,945
Let's have a quick talk.

626
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,385
What's going on? A secret chat between just the two of you?

627
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,170
That was about my perfume container...

628
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:01,965
Kyung Seok must've confessed his feelings for you.

629
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:07,710
Does he have a one-sided crush on you?

630
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:09,780
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

631
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:12,135
That's because we're alumni...

632
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:14,075
I must be out of my mind.

633
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:19,015
Alumni? Did you guys go to the same school?

634
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:23,155
- Yes. - Oh, really?

635
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:24,955
I had no idea.

636
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:27,330
Which school? High school, I assume?

637
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,125
No, middle school.

638
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:32,795
I asked Kyung Seok not to tell anyone...

639
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:35,565
and ended up exposing my past myself.

640
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,420
Well, I told you that wench, Kang Mi Rae, hit me first.

641
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:50,645
Do you believe the freshmen's words over my words?

642
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:52,215
Hey, Chan Woo.

643
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,355
Regardless of the reason,

644
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,725
if you bother freshmen once again,

645
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,885
I'm going to do my best to ruin your future.

646
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,625
You got that?

647
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,640
I'm going to talk to every single freshman...

648
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,365
and expose every bad deed you've done.

649
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:12,270
I'll make sure you get no reference letter when you graduate.

650
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:14,180
Even if you manage to get a job without a reference letter,

651
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:18,175
I'll tell our alumni in the field about everything you've done,

652
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:20,675
so brace yourself.

653
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:23,145
You know I can do anything I set my mind to.

654
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:27,160
Hey, but still... We're friends.

655
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:28,885
The fact that we're friends...

656
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:33,055
embarrasses me so much.

657
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,125
I really can't stand it.

658
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:40,365
I'm sorry.

659
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:43,465
You can leave now.

660
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:13,040
- Hey. - Have you eaten yet?

661
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,170
- All right. - What?

662
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,595
What?

663
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,635
Shall we eat together?

664
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:36,730
- Hey. - Have you eaten yet?

665
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,860
- All right. - What?

666
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:39,285
What?

667
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,325
Shall we eat together?

668
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:44,855
Yes.

669
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:51,095
It's on me.

670
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,205
Why?

671
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:55,180
Because I owe you.

672
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:56,605
You owe me?

673
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,720
I'll have stir-fried spicy pork. What will you have?

674
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,505
You just pressed a button for pork cutlet.

675
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:06,745
(Stir-fried spicy pork)

676
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,200
- Awesome. - Goodness.

677
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:17,300
Did you find out just now?

678
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:19,440
I didn't know either.

679
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,670
It's not a big issue, so why didn't she tell us about it?

680
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,195
I know.

681
00:47:25,546 --> 00:47:27,810
- Hi. - Guys, check this out.

682
00:47:27,815 --> 00:47:30,280
Mi Rae and Kyung Seok came from the same middle school.

683
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:31,280
Is that right?

684
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:33,105
I knew it.

685
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:37,475
That must be why Kyung Seok got all worked up yesterday.

686
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:39,390
But I don't think they were that close.

687
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:42,115
I heard he transferred to another middle school.

688
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:43,960
It's not like they aren't close either.

689
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,930
I saw them have a meal together.

690
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:46,930
By themselves?

691
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:49,100
Yes, I just saw them in the cafeteria.

692
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:51,230
Seeing how he's so attentive towards her,

693
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:54,595
I guess Mi Rae wasn't that bad even before her surgery.

694
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,510
Maybe he had a crush on her in the past.

695
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,470
No way.

696
00:47:58,479 --> 00:48:00,865
- What? - What?

697
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,380
I'm 100 percent sure about it.

698
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,045
You have a point.

699
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:14,745
Are you forcing yourself to eat pork cutlet when you don't want to...

700
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:16,060
because of me?

701
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:17,515
No.

702
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:26,295
When you said you owed me... Was it about Kim Chan Woo?

703
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:28,565
Yes.

704
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,965
Thank you.

705
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,675
I thought you'd be mad.

706
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:39,305
What is it that you want to say?

707
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:44,275
I hate myself for being like this too.

708
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:47,190
Judging people by their looks...

709
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:48,845
and labeling them.

710
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,990
People like you who are considered cool...

711
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:54,555
even when they don't follow the rules...

712
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:57,055
wouldn't understand a life like mine.

713
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,035
I'm sorry...

714
00:49:05,345 --> 00:49:07,165
for talking harshly to you.

715
00:49:09,983 --> 00:49:12,475
You know, what I said about your mindset.

716
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:15,505
I'm sorry about that.

717
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,715
Well...

718
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,845
What you said about me wasn't wrong.

719
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:27,555
By the way, do people think I'm cool?

720
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,455
Who said that?

721
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:36,295
Is that what you think?

722
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,935
No.

723
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:41,410
Let's be honest. You were popular back in middle school.

724
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:43,005
Don't you know?

725
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:45,405
I guess I was.

726
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:49,320
You're annoying.

727
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:51,190
- Hey. - What?

728
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:53,690
Have you usually thought I was annoying?

729
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:55,960
No, sorry.

730
00:49:55,963 --> 00:49:57,585
I was just asking.

731
00:49:57,998 --> 00:49:59,930
- Are you intimidated again? - What?

732
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:02,155
You keep getting intimidated for nothing.

733
00:50:04,037 --> 00:50:05,955
When did I?

734
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:09,165
I'm not the type who easily gets intimidated.

735
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,365
Then live the way you originally are.

736
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,345
(Recruiting part-timers)

737
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:27,090
I've got my health certificate.

738
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,745
I can start working right away.

739
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:35,160
It's great. Everything is nice,

740
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:38,570
but your dialect is a bit...

741
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:41,270
I can fix it right away.

742
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:43,970
It's quite hard to fix your dialect.

743
00:50:43,977 --> 00:50:47,410
No, I'm very good at speaking in Seoul dialect.

744
00:50:47,414 --> 00:50:48,980
- Look. - Yes?

745
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:51,280
Isn't there a pretty girl in your department?

746
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,310
Who?

747
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,380
Was her name Hyun Soo A?

748
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,605
Soo A?

749
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:59,745
Isn't she interested in working part-time?

750
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,600
I'm Hyun Soo A, and I'm a freshman of chemistry major in Hankook.

751
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,155
I see.

752
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:12,255
I might not be good at working since it's my first time.

753
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:14,700
But I'll work hard and learn quickly.

754
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,510
There's nothing much to learn.

755
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,595
Right now is good enough.

756
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:22,065
- What? - Just...

757
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:23,705
as you are.

758
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:27,975
Can you start working from tomorrow?

759
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:30,815
Oh, thank you.

760
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,660
Getting scholarship is the best thing you can do for your parents.

761
00:51:38,665 --> 00:51:41,055
Let's go out.

762
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,510
Really? Kyung Seok apologized to you first?

763
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:51,935
Yes.

764
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:26,135
Hey.

765
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:29,335
Are you wearing perfume?

766
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:33,845
Maybe you were mistaken about him.

767
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:36,350
He might not have laughed at you.

768
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:38,790
Even if that's the case,

769
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:41,460
he definitely asked me about the perfume to pick on me.

770
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:43,755
I guess he became nice as he grew up.

771
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:48,085
He didn't tell others that you came from the same middle school, either.

772
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:52,825
Let's go in.

773
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:57,440
I don't fully get the situation, but I'm sure he's on your side,

774
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:59,635
judging by how he taught the senior a lesson.

775
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,650
What is it?

776
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:09,175
Is this for real?

777
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:11,850
I won a ticket to the perfume sampling event.

778
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:13,460
Gosh, I thought it was about something serious.

779
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,685
Hey, it's awfully hard to win this ticket.

780
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,030
I can bring another person with me.

781
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,230
- Let's go together. - No.

782
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,060
"Guest performance by Junoflo"?

783
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,695
Are you serious? Give me that.

784
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,870
It's for real. Hey, take me there.

785
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,970
You must go with me, okay?

786
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:32,710
You have no one else to go with anyway.

787
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:34,610
- You said you wouldn't go. - Yes, I must go.

788
00:53:34,614 --> 00:53:36,780
Take me for certain, okay?

789
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:38,705
I'll be good to you.

790
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,645
Kyung Seok.

791
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:44,875
I heard you and Mi Rae went to the same middle school.

792
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:48,490
Who said that?

793
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,185
Mi Rae.

794
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:54,085
Soo A said that she heard it from Mi Rae.

795
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:58,325
Why? Is it a secret?

796
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:05,435
What was that? Does he think I speak to him because I like him?

797
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,935
Pay for this one too.

798
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,805
Did he just force us to pay for him?

799
00:54:15,822 --> 00:54:17,320
Why that little...

800
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:20,215
He hasn't come to his senses yet.

801
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:23,685
Should I teach him a lesson?

802
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:27,025
I can teach him a better lesson than Kyung Seok.

803
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:30,795
Please wait.

804
00:54:31,037 --> 00:54:33,155
Didn't you say you'd treat me?

805
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:38,165
- Hello. - I'll pay for theirs too.

806
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:45,680
Thank you for the food.

807
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:48,445
- Thank you. - No problem.

808
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:51,945
That's the true example of a senior.

809
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:03,625
Annoying punk.

810
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,600
A heated flask is extremely hot.

811
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:09,870
You must not touch it with your hands.

812
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,540
One student almost went blind...

813
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:13,240
by having heated acid splattered on his eye in the past,

814
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:15,165
so be extra careful.

815
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:18,905
A member of each group should come out and take the equipment now.

816
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:24,620
Those female students with long hair must tie it up.

817
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,075
Okay.

818
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:05,785
Didn't you ask me not to tell others?

819
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:07,585
What?

820
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:10,655
They know that we went to the same school.

821
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:15,165
I know. They somehow found out.

822
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:20,510
We converted the volume of Reactant A...

823
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:23,080
to the mole of A.

824
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:26,110
Don't you think Soo A and Kyung Seok look great together?

825
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:29,375
Then we calculated the volume of Reactant B that's needed.

826
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:32,345
Watch what you say in front of me.

827
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:50,835
Heat it in the boiling water.

828
00:56:54,514 --> 00:56:56,005
Goodness.

829
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:02,275
- Did you burn your hand? - No.

830
00:57:02,522 --> 00:57:03,975
Let me see.

831
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:08,345
- I'm okay. - And why are you hiding it?

832
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:10,590
Are you hurt?

833
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:13,585
- No, I just brushed up against it. - Let me see.

834
00:57:14,901 --> 00:57:16,785
- What happened? - Did she get hurt?

835
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:18,200
Oh, no.

836
00:57:18,204 --> 00:57:20,695
- You have to be careful. - Oh, no.

837
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:28,035
It seems okay, but make sure you cool it down with cold water.

838
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:29,080
Okay.

839
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:31,735
I clearly told you not to touch the hot flask directly with your hands.

840
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:33,875
I'm sorry.

841
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:37,415
It applies to the rest of you too. Focus and be careful.

842
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:39,175
- Be careful. - Okay.

843
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:54,240
Good job today.

844
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,110
Put the equipment in each basket and return them safely.

845
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,765
- Okay. - Okay.

846
00:57:59,546 --> 00:58:01,665
Please check if we missed anything.

847
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:07,920
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

848
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:09,505
No, I'm okay.

849
00:58:09,856 --> 00:58:11,345
Give me the flask.

850
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,215
Thank you.

851
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,315
- Give me that too. - Okay.

852
00:58:23,703 --> 00:58:25,555
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?

853
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:29,670
What is it? Is it hydroxide solution?

854
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:32,535
Yes, I'm sorry.

855
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:34,940
Go wash it off quickly and head to the dispensary right away.

856
00:58:34,948 --> 00:58:36,405
Okay.

857
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,505
Watch the glass.

858
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:47,345
How many more times do I have to tell you to be careful?

859
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:49,945
I'm sorry.

860
00:59:20,026 --> 00:59:24,430
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

861
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,530
What if it splattered on her face?

862
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:28,060
Are you sure you dropped it?

863
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:29,600
Is it because of the earlier mistake?

864
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:31,570
I'm impressed by how you're always difficult to deal with.

865
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:33,300
I'm more impressed by you.

866
00:59:33,306 --> 00:59:35,070
I've got surprising news. Ta-da.

867
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:37,865
It's strange. She isn't in the group picture either.

868
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,340
I wonder why.

869
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:41,810
- Mi Rae. - Some people make it obvious,

870
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:44,580
but those who help you without your knowledge are truly nice people.

871
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:46,550
How's Dad? He doesn't pick up my calls.

872
00:59:46,553 --> 00:59:48,775
Tae Sik!

873
00:59:48,822 --> 00:59:50,320
I'm at the perfume sampling event.

874
00:59:50,323 --> 00:59:53,450
I searched everywhere. Kyung Seok nor Kyung Hee is here.

875
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:55,160
Dad wants to send me off to the States.

876
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,360
I might not miss Dad, but I'll miss you.

877
00:59:58,364 --> 01:00:00,900
It is essential you and Kyung Seok serve at the bar.

878
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,730
I heard a strange sound on my way home again.

879
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:04,730
It felt like someone was following me.

880
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:06,470
President Na Hye Sung of Kelun.

881
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:08,300
- She was also a Chemistry major. - What?

882
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:11,165
She's that woman.

883
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:12,870
I have something to tell you.

884
01:00:12,879 --> 01:00:15,110
Are you okay? I was worried about you.

885
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:16,440
It's none of your business.

886
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:17,980
I also hate those...

887
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:20,605
who vent their anger on other people.
