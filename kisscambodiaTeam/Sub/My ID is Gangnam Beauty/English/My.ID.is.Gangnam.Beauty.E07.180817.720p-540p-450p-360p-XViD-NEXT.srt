1
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,205
Are you done?

2
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:20,335
No, I'm not done. I haven't even taken off...

3
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,375
Tell me when you're done.

4
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,715
What is this situation?

5
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,595
This is like...

6
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,455
going to an island together...

7
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:45,895
and missing the last ferry back.

8
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:57,905
But there's only one room. Isn't that what this situation is like?

9
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:07,255
I must be going crazy. Why do I have such a dirty mind?

10
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:13,855
Turn around in 20 minutes.

11
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:16,855
- What? - Stay like that for 20 minutes.

12
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:19,495
- Hey! - Is this a punishment or what?

13
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:22,195
- Why should I? - Okay, fine. Just 10 minutes, then.

14
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:26,165
I don't want you to know exactly when I got changed.

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,420
Turn around and stare at the wall.

16
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:32,205
- I'll give you 20 seconds. - What?

17
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:35,575
- Hey. - Start.

18
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,670
By the way, how will you know when 20 seconds are up?

19
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,155
12.

20
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,155
13

21
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:51,525
14.

22
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,135
15.

23
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,105
16.

24
00:01:58,488 --> 00:01:59,765
17.

25
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,335
18.

26
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,305
19.

27
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,745
20.

28
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:33,235
I'm done.

29
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,425
I think you're wearing it backwards.

30
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:58,925
What?

31
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:06,865
I'll give you 30 seconds.

32
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,175
Hey, don't do that.

33
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,675
Just don't turn around until I tell you that I'm done.

34
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,055
Will you leave without watching it?

35
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:29,155
You can stay and watch it.

36
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:33,025
Why are you suddenly in a bad mood?

37
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:36,295
I'm not in a bad mood. I'm just tired.

38
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:39,165
Soo A.

39
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:43,705
Why did you only call Soo A? Ji Hyo is here too.

40
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:45,220
Hi, Ji Hyo.

41
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:46,975
I do not need you to call my name.

42
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,390
Are you not going to watch the performance?

43
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,360
No, I want to leave because I'm tired.

44
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,215
Already? You should stay for a little longer.

45
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,285
Hey, he's been looking for you all day long.

46
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,640
At least take a photo with him before you leave.

47
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:04,325
- Hey. - Just be quiet, okay?

48
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,195
Let's take a photo together.

49
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:11,165
Oh, my goodness. It's your lucky day, man.

50
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:14,335
Then... Do you guys want to go stand over there?

51
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:16,435
A little further back.

52
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:23,275
Oh, my. What a nice scenery.

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,945
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

54
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,460
- Get out. - Me?

55
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:27,885
Yes, get out of the frame.

56
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:33,155
Soo A, you look so pretty. This is great.

57
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:35,255
Hey, Won Ho. Smile a little.

58
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,010
All right, I'm going to take it now. 1, 2...

59
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:40,995
- Hey! - Hold on! Just a second.

60
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,810
Let's take it together. All of us together.

61
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,080
Hey, what is this about? Gosh, seriously.

62
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,835
Why? Can't we be in this photo?

63
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,835
All right. You can eat this. Here.

64
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,120
- Let's take it together. - See? She wants us in the photo.

65
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:52,720
Sung Woon, send the photo to us too.

66
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,375
Sure, no problem.

67
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,075
All right, here we go.

68
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,845
1, 2, 3.

69
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,000
- Shall I take another one? - Yes.

70
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,415
Okay, sure.

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,685
All right. Here we go!

72
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,340
- Perfect. - Is it perfect?

73
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,625
It's perfect.

74
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,540
Why are you always so serious?

75
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,025
- Have fun, guys. - Okay.

76
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,195
- Did you finish it? - Was it not good?

77
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:26,275
You were...

78
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,575
cool yesterday.

79
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:31,645
What you did to that jerk.

80
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,115
What's cool about it?

81
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,085
Because of it, everyone knows that nickname now.

82
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:43,840
It probably wasn't a surprise to you since you already knew.

83
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,125
I didn't know.

84
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,665
What?

85
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,665
That nickname of yours. I didn't know.

86
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:56,735
You didn't know what everyone else in our school knew?

87
00:05:58,528 --> 00:05:59,975
Was I an outcast?

88
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,145
Nobody made you an outcast. You probably wanted to be alone.

89
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,430
I know that everyone wanted to be friends with you.

90
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,585
With me? Why?

91
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,185
Because I'm handsome?

92
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,855
If you...

93
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:19,625
hadn't gotten the wrong idea,

94
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,265
could we have been friends?

95
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:34,875
You'd never have wanted...

96
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:37,545
to be friends with me.

97
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:42,385
There were many pretty girls in our school.

98
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,155
Looks aren't everything.

99
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,695
I don't like...

100
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,095
pretty girls.

101
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,005
So are you saying...

102
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:09,545
I'm ugly?

103
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:14,100
Well, you're funny.

104
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:17,855
What... Do you think I'm funny because I'm ugly?

105
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,255
No.

106
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:24,325
I just thought your dance on the chair was funny.

107
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:28,995
I liked that you were funny.

108
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,775
Let's head inside.

109
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:58,125
What? Were you guys in here together?

110
00:07:58,915 --> 00:07:59,910
Yes.

111
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,395
What are you guys doing here?

112
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,480
I came here to get changed.

113
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:06,765
What?

114
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,605
Thank you.

115
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,075
Thanks.

116
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,445
She came to get changed?

117
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,715
I guess I'm no longer a loner...

118
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,700
since I have a friend now.

119
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,025
What?

120
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:30,155
I have you.

121
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:36,695
I never had a guy friend before.

122
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,565
I can't believe I'm friends with Do Kyung Seok.

123
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,175
That's so pretty.

124
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,885
In 1, 2, 3.

125
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:53,005
(Episode 7: A Guy Friend)

126
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:13,725
You should go now. You don't need to walk me home.

127
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:15,995
It's not like I'm not allowed to.

128
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:21,535
My bus is here.

129
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,505
I'll go now. See you.

130
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,310
I have a friend now.

131
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:49,595
What?

132
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,835
I have you.

133
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:03,375
(First stop: Youngrang Park, Last stop: Sanggu Public Garage)

134
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,115
Sir.

135
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,525
Soo A.

136
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:23,395
Look at this.

137
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,635
He's Kyung Seok's dad.

138
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:34,890
("I should meet the merchants in order to know how they feel.")

139
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,575
("Candidate Do Sang Won Goes Campaigning for Votes")

140
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:42,930
(Meanwhile, Do Sang Won's ex-wife is Na Hye Sung, the CEO of Kelun,)

141
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,855
(and the two got divorced 10 years ago.)

142
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,735
What are you doing?

143
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,205
Kyung Hee came in 23rd out of 26 students.

144
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,960
The other three apparently didn't take the test,

145
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,415
and they don't even come to school.

146
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:38,105
I know I did something wrong,

147
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:41,175
but this is just way too much.

148
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,075
You didn't do anything wrong.

149
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,315
Getting bad grades isn't a bad thing.

150
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,385
Right?

151
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,850
Kyung Seok, stop crying right now.

152
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:09,735
A man shouldn't cry over something so petty.

153
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,890
What's wrong with you?

154
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,290
The least you could do is try to console him.

155
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,460
Guys need to be raised with a strong mindset.

156
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,260
You're not a girl. Why do you cry so easily?

157
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,100
What does gender have anything to do with crying?

158
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,385
He can cry if he feels upset.

159
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:27,055
I gave him everything he wanted, and now he's just weak.

160
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:33,025
Don't even think about coming inside.

161
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,895
He's so mean.

162
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,050
- Dad's so mean. - Why did you cry?

163
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:41,005
Did something upset you?

164
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:42,520
Yes.

165
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:43,835
It's okay.

166
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,845
Guys can cry if they want to.

167
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,415
That doesn't mean you're weak.

168
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,030
That's not what Dad says.

169
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,055
A true strong person...

170
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:01,270
is someone who makes sure...

171
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:04,155
they don't hurt the people who are weaker than them.

172
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,910
Kyung Seok, you're healthy...

173
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:11,250
and very handsome.

174
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,035
So you'll have to be extra careful.

175
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,970
- According to the freshmen, - Yes?

176
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,555
Kyung Seok's dad used to be a congressman.

177
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:39,825
- Really? - Yes.

178
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:41,695
Who?

179
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:44,195
His name was Do something.

180
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,535
Well, of course, his last name is Do.

181
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:49,850
- Gosh. - Do...

182
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:51,205
What was his name?

183
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,320
I heard his mom's the CEO of Kelun.

184
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:54,590
- The CEO of Kelun? - Yes.

185
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:57,660
Gosh, if my mom was the CEO of Kelun,

186
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,760
I would've beat Chan Woo up as well.

187
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,360
Chan Woo must've known.

188
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,800
Otherwise, he wouldn't have let him get away with what he did.

189
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:06,470
But I haven't seen him around for a really long time.

190
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,370
You're right. You're the one who should know.

191
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,570
- What are you talking about? - He's your best friend.

192
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,325
- What are you saying? - You didn't have to hit me.

193
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:36,315
Don't skip your meals.

194
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:44,395
I'll visit you on Saturday.

195
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:48,895
- His dad used to be a congressman. - Really?

196
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:51,165
The perfume company.

197
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:53,335
- I use their perfume. - I love their products.

198
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,575
They're probably talking about me.

199
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,825
His mom's the CEO of Kelun.

200
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,370
He's apparently really rich.

201
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,725
- My gosh. - He comes from a great family.

202
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:21,980
I heard his parents got divorced.

203
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:23,710
- Really? - No wonder he's so cold.

204
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:24,850
Hey, Soo A.

205
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,150
- Hi. - Hey.

206
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,135
He's so good-looking.

207
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:31,205
- He really is. - He's so handsome.

208
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:34,875
Hey, Mi Rae.

209
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:36,290
Hey.

210
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:39,530
Kyung Seok's dad is a congressman.

211
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:41,130
And his mom's the CEO of Kelun.

212
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,215
- Really? Who? - Yes.

213
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,670
He's from a rich family.

214
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,600
No wonder he's so rude.

215
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:47,740
- I get it now. - Yes.

216
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:49,755
He lacks nothing.

217
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,925
Did you tell everyone?

218
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:54,695
Well...

219
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:01,735
Hey.

220
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,515
Give me Kyung Seok's cell phone.

221
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,165
You dropped this yesterday.

222
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:35,835
You're coming to the afterparty later, right?

223
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,505
You really are the worst.

224
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,445
What?

225
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:52,400
Hello.

226
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:54,655
- Hello. - Hello.

227
00:17:56,979 --> 00:18:00,795
Let's talk about the assignment you must submit before the final exam.

228
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,280
Watch one of the movies that are currently playing at theaters...

229
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:09,820
and submit your report on that movie.

230
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:12,905
There isn't any format or guideline, okay?

231
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,775
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

232
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,245
Hey, let's go watch a movie together.

233
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,055
Did you get shot in the head?

234
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,155
Bang, bang.

235
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,495
Kyung Seok.

236
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,810
Are you going to the afterparty?

237
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:38,265
- What about you? - I think I'm going.

238
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:41,335
I'll think about it.

239
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,235
Okay.

240
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:47,890
You took the wrong bus yesterday, didn't you?

241
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,175
No.

242
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:52,645
I had to go somewhere yesterday.

243
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:02,755
Hello, Woo Young.

244
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,695
You're here.

245
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,010
Hello.

246
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,895
- Come sit here. - Okay.

247
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,320
Why did you want to see me?

248
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:54,390
I have to visit the office of Kelun regarding our partnership with them.

249
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:56,675
The chief director wants you to come together if you have time.

250
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,160
Me?

251
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,485
She wants to know how you made the handmade candles.

252
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,185
It seems like you did a great job.

253
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,855
How about today? What are you doing after school?

254
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:10,655
We're having the festival afterparty today.

255
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:16,480
I think I can go there late after visiting the office with you.

256
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,080
- Really? - Yes.

257
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,265
- Then I'll see you later. - Okay.

258
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,105
Mi Rae.

259
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:25,875
How do you do this?

260
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:28,975
Wait, that's...

261
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:33,730
I can follow the choreography except for this part.

262
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:35,615
Can you teach me how to do it later?

263
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:38,600
- Well... - Well, later.

264
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,385
- I'll see you later. - Okay, bye.

265
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,040
Why are you here already?

266
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:48,495
I have no part-time work today, so I came in case you'd struggle alone.

267
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,565
Thank you.

268
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:05,445
By the way, aren't you hiring any part-timers?

269
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:10,115
What is it?

270
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,055
- None of them are pretty enough? - That's not it.

271
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,655
I have no money.

272
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:16,255
What?

273
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,525
I think my business is going bankrupt.

274
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,695
I might have to take out my house deposit to pay for the rent.

275
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,795
Let me take a look at the ledger.

276
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,265
Ledger?

277
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:30,150
Even elementary school students would do a better job than this.

278
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,405
You have to organize this kind of stuff with Excel.

279
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:33,805
Excel?

280
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:37,075
You're pretty smart.

281
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,715
You don't even know such a thing?

282
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:42,500
If you lack experience, you should hire an experienced part-timer.

283
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:44,115
Business isn't a joke.

284
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:50,025
Pass.

285
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:52,425
You're hired.

286
00:21:58,453 --> 00:21:59,965
Did you think I'd be excited?

287
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,935
This isn't time to play around.

288
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:08,175
1, 2.

289
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,115
Who taught you that dance?

290
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:14,530
I just watched video clips...

291
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:16,530
You managed to learn this only by watching videos?

292
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:18,700
- Stop it. - Why? It's cool.

293
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,785
I respect those who are good at dancing.

294
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:23,425
How did you...

295
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:27,795
Amber Five?

296
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:30,995
But it smells a bit different.

297
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:32,465
You're right, it's Amber Five.

298
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:37,350
I knew you were interested in perfume too.

299
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,105
Well, I'm the teaching assistant of the chemistry department.

300
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:46,245
But it smelled a bit different from the familiar scent of Amber Five.

301
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:47,830
People all have their own body scent.

302
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:50,115
The scent of perfume changes when it touches their skin.

303
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:54,725
Just like how you dance this move is different from how I do it.

304
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,325
That's not how you do it.

305
00:22:58,347 --> 00:22:59,625
This.

306
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:04,165
All right, look. Stand still like this.

307
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,335
Put your arms like this.

308
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,635
- Like this. - Like this?

309
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:13,105
I respect that, seriously.

310
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:24,615
I plan to hold a housewarming party this Saturday. What do you think?

311
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:29,155
I'm going to see my parents this Saturday.

312
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:32,225
Then how about Sunday?

313
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:36,080
I'm fine with that, but I'm not sure about Hyun Jung.

314
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:37,395
Really?

315
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:40,350
How about we create a group chat to talk together about it?

316
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:42,835
Sure, I'll make it.

317
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:45,920
Let's not make it grand like a real housewarming party.

318
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,690
Let's just gather up and eat delicious food.

319
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,275
Oh, right. Kyung Seok said he'd come too.

320
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:52,215
- What? - Why?

321
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,115
It's nothing.

322
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:01,925
We're friends. Friends.

323
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:09,880
(Group chat room)

324
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:11,310
(Woo Young wants to know if we have time this Sunday.)

325
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,680
(I'm good. What about you, Kyung Seok?)

326
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:14,065
Kyung Seok.

327
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:16,905
Well...

328
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,860
- I'm sorry. - For what?

329
00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:24,945
I didn't mean to look at your phone on purpose.

330
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:28,185
It's just that a message popped up on the screen.

331
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:30,730
I told only a few of my friends,

332
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:34,055
but word got out in the entire department.

333
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,295
Sorry.

334
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,165
I heard it from Ji Hyo.

335
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:48,850
I'm sorry that I was mistaken about you.

336
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:50,605
It's nothing new.

337
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:52,675
I'm fine.

338
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,845
I was shocked more by...

339
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,545
how you sounded like you expected this from me.

340
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,915
I realized how you thought of me.

341
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:09,055
You must've kept misunderstanding if it hadn't been for Ji Hyo.

342
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:17,595
You think all my behaviors are intentional.

343
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:25,505
How you think about me is up to you.

344
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,945
But it was a little upsetting for me this time.

345
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,115
I...

346
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,825
don't have a mom either.

347
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:50,765
That's why I know how it feels to have my hurtful experience...

348
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:53,565
revealed to others.

349
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,135
No one knows about it.

350
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,375
You're the first.

351
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:05,545
You know what it means, right?

352
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,395
(What about you, Kyung Seok?)

353
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:22,265
Okay.

354
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:24,965
Okay.

355
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:30,450
The CEO got taken to the emergency room just a while ago.

356
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,520
The chief director went with her.

357
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:35,360
- What? - Why was she taken to the hospital?

358
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:36,975
I'm not sure.

359
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,260
- Let's go. - Okay.

360
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,745
Thank you. Goodbye.

361
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:44,385
All right, guys.

362
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:49,455
These two have something to tell you.

363
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:51,925
What are you waiting for?

364
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:58,435
I think I made mistakes to you during the preparation period.

365
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:01,635
I didn't know you guys were that sensitive. I'm sorry.

366
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:04,875
- Me too. - What are you sorry about?

367
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:08,660
Well, for criticizing you about your looks.

368
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:09,975
I can't hear you.

369
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,115
I'm sorry that I criticized you about your looks...

370
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,855
and forced only the female students to wait tables.

371
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:22,725
What about making them wear those uniforms?

372
00:27:23,478 --> 00:27:25,095
I'm sorry.

373
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:27,125
I'm really sorry too.

374
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:30,295
We'll never do that again. We're sorry.

375
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:35,505
Stop being mad at us. I scolded these two harshly.

376
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:39,520
We have to see each other around. Will you keep being this awkward?

377
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,120
They can sound mean and rude,

378
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,590
but you know that they're not bad guys. Aren't I right?

379
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,245
- Yes. - Yes.

380
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:49,415
Since you're saying sorry, we will accept your apology.

381
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:51,815
But how you behave from now on matters more.

382
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,300
Thanks, Yoon Byul.

383
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,470
Then let's raise our glasses, everyone.

384
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:57,170
Good work with the festival.

385
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,540
And we're sorry again.

386
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,440
My, what a beautiful sight!

387
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,910
- Cheers, everyone. - Cheers!

388
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:05,235
Good work, everyone.

389
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:14,205
Have the two of you been hanging out often lately?

390
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,490
Seeing the two of you together is a bit weird.

391
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:20,345
What's weird about it? We're close.

392
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,485
Aren't I right, Kyung Seok?

393
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,385
Yes.

394
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:29,355
- Does it mean we have a new couple? - Does it mean we have a new couple?

395
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:34,740
What did she eat?

396
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,995
She must've eaten spoiled food without knowing it's gone bad.

397
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,835
Thankfully, she's okay this time.

398
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:40,820
The doctor said she can be discharged tomorrow.

399
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,835
Has something like this happened before?

400
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:46,605
She has been in the ER after eating spoiled food.

401
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,775
Whatever she ate must've smelled very bad.

402
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:52,745
She probably hasn't told either of you,

403
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:57,115
but she can barely smell anything at the moment.

404
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,955
- Sorry? - Pardon?

405
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,600
She was in a big accident,

406
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,555
and her olfactory nerve was severely damaged.

407
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,040
My goodness.

408
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:08,210
That's why she ends up eating spoiled food at times.

409
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:11,250
Then Kelun... What about perfumes?

410
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:12,965
She's very impressive.

411
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:15,220
It's like a singer losing her voice...

412
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:17,875
and a painter losing her sight.

413
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:24,075
Excuse me for a moment.

414
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,145
Yes, sir.

415
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,415
Something urgent came up. Yes, I apologize.

416
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,285
I'll call you in a bit.

417
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,985
Okay.

418
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,870
You can go if you have to take care of something.

419
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:39,040
I'll stay here.

420
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:40,925
Would you really do that for me?

421
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,410
I can be back in 2 to 3 hours.

422
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:46,265
Yes, I'll stay right by her side.

423
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:48,165
You can get going too.

424
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,750
Gosh, how could I...

425
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,790
It's okay. You can go.

426
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,605
Then please look after her while I'm gone.

427
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:09,055
Oh, does Ms. Na have no family?

428
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,295
Didn't Professor Park tell you?

429
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:13,540
About what?

430
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:15,395
It was in the newspapers too.

431
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:18,735
She got divorced years ago. She lives alone now.

432
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:20,935
I see.

433
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:25,235
I actually wanted to get in touch with her son earlier,

434
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:28,775
but I didn't because she'd probably get mad at me if she found out.

435
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:31,615
He's in the chemistry department at Hankook University.

436
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,130
He's in our department? What's his name?

437
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:35,785
His name is Do Kyung Seok.

438
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:37,870
Please pretend you know nothing.

439
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,955
Ms. Na hasn't seen him in years.

440
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,455
Oh, okay.

441
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:45,140
This has to stay between us. You know that, right?

442
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,495
Yes.

443
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:31,275
- So... You see, - Yes.

444
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,560
I just wanted to help you.

445
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,160
- I know. - I wanted our bar to be a hit.

446
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:37,775
I heard you, so stop drinking already.

447
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:41,715
You should have it.

448
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,015
No, you should eat the drumstick.

449
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:53,440
By the way, why isn't Woo Young joining us today?

450
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,065
I'm not sure. Why do you ask?

451
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:59,465
What is it? Why do you want to know that?

452
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:02,505
What's going on? Are you interested in him?

453
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:03,935
What are you talking about?

454
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:07,205
I was just wondering. Just have your drink.

455
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,175
Something's fishy.

456
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:14,145
Hey, what is that? That thing.

457
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:17,115
My gosh...

458
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:22,725
Hey, it's just a bean.

459
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:24,825
- It's not a bug? - No.

460
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:44,145
Your cold eyes are killing me

461
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,430
Ko Ye Na!

462
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:50,415
The fire in your heart was growing, why are there only ashes now?

463
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,200
- They say time heals everything - I'll help you.

464
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,385
But I'm getting weaker by the day

465
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:59,525
I'm even getting numb to the heartbreaking pain

466
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:04,310
Fine, I'm going to forget you now

467
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,850
I'm going to get myself back and live like a flower

468
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:11,635
Can't nobody stop me now, no, try me

469
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:14,220
Everyone wants my scent

470
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:15,575
Thanks.

471
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:21,015
I didn't want to tell anyone about it.

472
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:25,115
But I do feel much better now that I've told someone.

473
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:33,610
- Are you leaving me? - Are you leaving me?

474
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:36,110
- How could you leave me so easily? - How could you leave me so easily?

475
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:39,050
- You promised me - You promised me we'd go together

476
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:42,205
- But you're leaving me - Hey, just sing it alone.

477
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,705
No. Hey, come on.

478
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:48,075
Ye Na. Hey, what's wrong?

479
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:50,845
What was that?

480
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:52,460
Do Kyung Seok and Hyun Soo A.

481
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:54,730
They're both good-looking and from rich families.

482
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,315
Is it like the parallel lives theory?

483
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,770
Parallel lines never meet.

484
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,685
Look at you. You sound so confident.

485
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:03,340
Just go and grab the microphone.

486
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,695
The microphone?

487
00:34:11,986 --> 00:34:13,465
(Kang Mi Rae)

488
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,825
Ladies and gentlemen.

489
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:37,070
Next up is the star of Hankook University.

490
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:39,040
The most beautiful angel,

491
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:42,295
Hyun Soo A, will sing for us!

492
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:44,795
Please give her a big hand!

493
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:49,335
- Hyun Soo A, Hyun Soo A! - Hyun Soo A, Hyun Soo A!

494
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,505
Where are you?

495
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:56,590
You're at a hospital?

496
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,645
Ms. Na is hospitalized...

497
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,445
because of food poisoning.

498
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,585
She ate food that had gone bad.

499
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:11,725
I heard she can't smell things anymore due to an accident.

500
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,465
Did you know about it?

501
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,635
I'm staying with her now because she has no one else.

502
00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:23,735
Will you come?

503
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,175
No.

504
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:36,515
Well, there's something I have to tell you.

505
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:41,425
I actually saw her back in middle school.

506
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:47,225
I'm saying I saw your mom in our neighborhood.

507
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:50,595
She must've come to see you.

508
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:53,835
I have to go.

509
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,925
Room 1013 at Hankook University Hospital.

510
00:36:17,345 --> 00:36:20,295
I'm sorry. I won't meddle in your business anymore.

511
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,990
- Are you okay, Ms. Na? - Are you okay, Hye Sung?

512
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:37,275
Yes. I'm so sorry that you had to stay here.

513
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:40,445
Soo Hyun, please drive Mi Rae home.

514
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:42,930
No, that's not necessary. I can take the bus home.

515
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,230
I'll call a cab for you.

516
00:36:44,238 --> 00:36:47,785
Director Lee, I want you to go home as well.

517
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,010
I can't leave you alone.

518
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:52,880
Don't worry. I'm not a kid.

519
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,925
You're more stubborn than a kid.

520
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,765
I'll be off now.

521
00:36:58,486 --> 00:37:01,265
- Bye. - Mi Rae.

522
00:37:03,157 --> 00:37:04,535
Thank you.

523
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,205
No problem.

524
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,975
Goodbye. Take good care of yourself.

525
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:31,665
Hey, Woo Young.

526
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,835
Ms. Na woke up. Don't worry.

527
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:38,835
Bye.

528
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,605
- Woo Young came as well? - Yes.

529
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:44,375
What am I going to do?

530
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,260
I caused everyone so much trouble.

531
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,215
That's why you should hire an assistant.

532
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:51,630
What kind of a CEO doesn't have an assistant and drives herself?

533
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,985
I really hate it when someone keeps...

534
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,755
following me around.

535
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:01,225
Gosh, what if you get into an accident?

536
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:03,295
I never got into a car accident.

537
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,195
Then at least date someone.

538
00:38:29,477 --> 00:38:32,940
Isn't it sad that I'm the only one who's here to take care of you?

539
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,610
You're not really caring for me right now.

540
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:36,210
Gosh, stop nagging and leave.

541
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:37,880
Are you going to miss your kids all your life...

542
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:40,165
and grow old all by yourself without dating anyone?

543
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,390
You're the one who should stop dating and start settling down.

544
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,920
If I meet a few more of your girlfriends, it'll add up to 100.

545
00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:46,720
What are you talking about?

546
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,175
You should leave now.

547
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:50,515
I'll get discharged on my own, so you don't need to come.

548
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:00,825
Kyung Seok.

549
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,440
- Do Sang Won! - Do Sang Won!

550
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,435
- I'm a fan. - Do Sang Won!

551
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:12,665
- Have some. - Do Sang Won!

552
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,105
- Here. - Do Sang Won!

553
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,550
- Do Sang Won! - Do Sang Won!

554
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:18,735
Goodness, have a drink.

555
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,320
- You should take a drink. - Okay, thank you.

556
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:22,730
Drink up.

557
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,790
- Do Sang Won! - Do Sang Won!

558
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,375
Gosh, that's nice.

559
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:27,085
- Sir. - Yes?

560
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:29,830
Kyung Seok and your ex-wife are together right now.

561
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,415
- Do Sang Won! - Do Sang Won!

562
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,600
I'm sorry. I'll report to you later.

563
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:36,095
- Do Sang Won! - Do Sang Won!

564
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,655
Thank you.

565
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:42,395
I never even imagined that you might come.

566
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:47,865
I'm so grateful toward Mi Rae.

567
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,575
You too.

568
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:56,175
I missed you so much.

569
00:39:57,298 --> 00:40:01,245
But now that you're here, I don't know what to say.

570
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,285
I can't even bring myself to apologize.

571
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,285
If you're sorry,

572
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,325
you should apologize.

573
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:16,595
What are you sorry about?

574
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,565
For leaving you and your sister.

575
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:27,975
I regretted it a lot.

576
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:33,445
I figured I should've tried to think things differently.

577
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,485
You should quit work. You don't need to earn money.

578
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,055
Money isn't the problem.

579
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:47,725
It's my life-long dream to become a perfumer.

580
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:55,465
I told you that I'm working overtime today.

581
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:58,235
Why do you always have trouble putting the kids to bed?

582
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,305
I looked after the kids every time you had a gathering...

583
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:04,015
or went to play golf during the weekdays.

584
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:07,645
But I still managed to become the youngest head researcher.

585
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:10,015
I can't quit now.

586
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:13,240
What are you trying to become by working so hard?

587
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,095
Everyone else dreams of becoming a stay-at-home mom.

588
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:20,125
You know the typical question that everyone asks actresses?

589
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:24,095
"What's more important? Your work or your family?"

590
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,335
I never thought there'd come a day when I had to answer that question.

591
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,705
Is that all?

592
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:43,615
I also went through a lot after I got into an accident...

593
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,025
and lost my ability to smell...

594
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:50,395
because I could no longer work as a perfumer.

595
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:04,835
(Dad)

596
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:10,875
Kyung Seok isn't picking up.

597
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:17,785
But is there a reason why Kyung Seok shouldn't meet his mom?

598
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:21,000
Is there something he shouldn't know about...

599
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:25,225
that might make him leave you and run off to live with his mother?

600
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,965
Never mind. I'm sorry.

601
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,905
Cut the nonsense, and just focus on giving me reports.

602
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:35,435
Yes, sir.

603
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:51,085
It's late. You should go home.

604
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,185
You should sleep.

605
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,755
I'll go a little later.

606
00:44:31,238 --> 00:44:32,585
Stay healthy.

607
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:04,685
Kyung Seok.

608
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,585
Did you sleep outside?

609
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:08,785
Yes.

610
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:11,425
Kyung Seok, come inside.

611
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,435
Sit down.

612
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,745
Where were you?

613
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,005
I met Ms. Na.

614
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:36,815
Okay. I'm sure you missed her. I understand.

615
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:38,915
But it's hard to understand her.

616
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,100
She never reached out to you for 10 years,

617
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,485
and now she brazenly shows up.

618
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,055
She once came when I was in middle school.

619
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:48,295
But of course, I didn't get to meet her.

620
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,735
Did she tell you...

621
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:52,495
that I didn't let her meet you?

622
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:00,705
Okay, fine. I didn't let her meet you.

623
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:04,075
How dare she show up when she left after having an affair?

624
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,745
- That's not true. - What?

625
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:10,815
She didn't have an affair.

626
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:16,085
Why did you lie?

627
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:19,355
Why did you do that?

628
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:25,495
I can't believe she made up an excuse to meet you.

629
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:29,875
Did you even...

630
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:31,935
have me followed?

631
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:34,405
Or did you do that to her?

632
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:38,875
That wasn't an excuse.

633
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,245
You must know it was food poisoning...

634
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,915
and that she hurt her olfactory nerves due to an accident.

635
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,215
What?

636
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:55,095
That was a mistake.

637
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,295
Just once.

638
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,465
I hit her just one time by mistake.

639
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:11,475
Putting this matter aside,

640
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,715
it was natural for a woman to be responsible for her family.

641
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:18,715
What kind of man would like his wife to keep staying outside?

642
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:22,585
Every time, work came first before family for her.

643
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:31,595
I told you to stay home comfortably, so why wouldn't you listen?

644
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,805
What's comfortable for me?

645
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:36,835
I have no intention of living the way you want.

646
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:39,050
I'm doing my best here.

647
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:41,090
There you go talking back again...

648
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,960
to your husband. You think you're that great?

649
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,475
How pathetic.

650
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,045
What?

651
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:50,415
It's pathetic how you're trying to have control over me this way.

652
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,885
Did you really just say that?

653
00:47:58,078 --> 00:47:59,455
Why you...

654
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:09,650
Hye Sung.

655
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:11,705
When I found out that her olfactory sense was paralyzed,

656
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,745
I begged as hard as I could.

657
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:17,675
I promised her thousands of times that I'd make her happy...

658
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,745
even after she resigned from being a perfumer.

659
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:23,615
But she cared only for her job.

660
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:26,525
That was why she went out of control like a crazy woman.

661
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,785
You ruined someone else's life,

662
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,625
and you said you'd make her happy?

663
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:35,310
What?

664
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:38,365
You even ruined our lives with your lies until now.

665
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:42,765
And you cared about your family?

666
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:45,705
Watch what you say.

667
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:47,620
I'm the one who raised you until now.

668
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:50,275
I wouldn't have let you raise me if I had known sooner.

669
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:51,460
Kyung Seok.

670
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,145
I would've chosen to grow up alone instead.

671
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:56,245
Then get out.

672
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,955
You must've kicked my mom out...

673
00:49:05,979 --> 00:49:07,425
this way, right?

674
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:09,425
What?

675
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:19,335
Kyung Seok. Stop right there.

676
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:36,670
Does anyone not like pork?

677
00:49:36,677 --> 00:49:37,670
I love it.

678
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:39,455
I can't eat it because there isn't any.

679
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,040
Is pork belly okay then?

680
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:42,425
Good.

681
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:44,595
Me too.

682
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,635
(Group chat room)

683
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:54,305
(Dad)

684
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:56,675
Hey, Dad.

685
00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:01,045
I'm almost there. I'm getting off at the next stop.

686
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,215
Okay.

687
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:15,795
Wait. Dad.

688
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:21,280
You didn't have to come all the way here.

689
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:22,765
I could've walked there.

690
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:25,505
Get in.

691
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,995
It's amazing.

692
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,825
You're pretty...

693
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:51,035
however I take pictures of you.

694
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:54,280
Let her have her meal.

695
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:56,820
I know you're still awkward with her looks.

696
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:57,820
What do you mean?

697
00:50:57,824 --> 00:51:00,990
You worried about her every day, but now, you can't even see her face.

698
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:02,575
What do you mean, I can't?

699
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,170
It's still awkward, isn't it?

700
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:17,595
No, no.

701
00:51:21,548 --> 00:51:22,995
It's pretty and nice.

702
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:25,810
Are you not angry anymore?

703
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:29,035
He blew off his anger a long time ago. He's just awkward.

704
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:32,105
Stop it already. I'm not awkward.

705
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:33,920
How about we go to a karaoke then?

706
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,590
- Karaoke? - Yes.

707
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:37,815
How about we go for a round?

708
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:40,445
That sounds great.

709
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:42,700
- Hurry and eat up. - Okay.

710
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:44,315
Mom, you should hurry up too.

711
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:45,855
Okay.

712
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:47,455
Dad.

713
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,555
I think Kyung Seok ran away from home.

714
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:56,735
I'll call you. Take care.

715
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:09,990
Who are you?

716
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:11,560
Is Ms. Seo Yoo Jin there?

717
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:12,975
Mom.

718
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:15,545
Who is it?

719
00:52:16,937 --> 00:52:18,500
Isn't it Seo Yoo Jin's house?

720
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:21,985
No, it's not. We just moved in here.

721
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,605
Why did you fight with your father?

722
00:52:42,095 --> 00:52:43,860
You think it makes sense to bring a bed in this room?

723
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:45,660
But it costs money to throw it away.

724
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:48,815
And I can't sleep on the floor. My back will hurt otherwise.

725
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,030
You're just as pathetic.

726
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:54,325
How could you move out of the house without any plans?

727
00:52:56,076 --> 00:52:57,455
Do you have money?

728
00:53:00,914 --> 00:53:03,180
Gosh, the summer season is coming up soon.

729
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:05,595
I'm not sure if I'll be able to turn on the air conditioner.

730
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:09,935
I'm not that sensitive to heat.

731
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:12,290
Don't act up and move back in.

732
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,305
Living alone isn't easy.

733
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:16,560
You'll be just like me if you miss the timing.

734
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:17,875
No, I won't.

735
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:32,825
Soo A.

736
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:36,865
Hey, Yoo Eun.

737
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:39,110
What brings you here?

738
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,520
Do you live in this neighborhood?

739
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,805
Yes.

740
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,120
Didn't you say you live in Dogok-dong?

741
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:48,390
I moved out recently.

742
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,590
Oh, really?

743
00:53:49,596 --> 00:53:51,215
It hasn't been a few days.

744
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,030
I'll leave you then. See you at school.

745
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:56,615
Okay, bye.

746
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,965
Yes!

747
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,665
Yes!

748
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:21,845
Even though

749
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:24,560
You look uncertain

750
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:28,200
My love will

751
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:31,900
- Bring you back to me - You're so cool.

752
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:33,485
I know

753
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:38,995
You ended up dumping me

754
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:45,150
Don't call me a determined woman

755
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:48,820
She makes me ill, and I like her so much

756
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:51,590
I like the girl who always sits on the same spot

757
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:54,790
- It's too ideal - It's too ideal

758
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:57,490
I know you'll like me more

759
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:00,100
I'll act indifferent

760
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,870
I'm the best tonight

761
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,240
I waited only for you

762
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,055
Yes!

763
00:55:11,111 --> 00:55:12,595
Goodness, I'm tired.

764
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:14,225
Mi Rae.

765
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:15,725
Let's...

766
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,395
add some more time now.

767
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:21,520
Give us...

768
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:24,505
- 1 more hour! - 1 more hour.

769
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:26,945
Let's go!

770
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:30,875
Mom, wait up.

771
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:33,045
I need to go home and lie down.

772
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,815
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

773
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:38,815
We did all the singing. Why is she exhausted?

774
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,555
Dad, you sang twice more than I did.

775
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:45,395
I hadn't been to a karaoke lounge in so long. There were many new songs.

776
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,645
Dad, you still got it.

777
00:56:09,669 --> 00:56:11,555
I'm sorry about everything.

778
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:15,455
No, don't be.

779
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:18,095
Just because I adore you,

780
00:56:18,678 --> 00:56:20,425
it doesn't mean you can be happy.

781
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:23,935
I was too self-centered.

782
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:38,875
You're still pretty,

783
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,815
my dear daughter.

784
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:46,685
It must've been very hard for you, Dad.

785
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:49,625
I'm sorry.

786
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,065
It's okay.

787
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:06,675
You'll look ugly if you cry.

788
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:13,145
Let's go.

789
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:18,115
Oh, right. I forgot about BTS.

790
00:57:18,338 --> 00:57:19,700
What? BTS?

791
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:21,870
Our encounter is

792
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,555
Like a mathematic formula

793
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:26,725
Like religious commandments

794
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:28,165
The universe...

795
00:57:29,382 --> 00:57:30,795
I forgot the lyrics.

796
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:01,725
Where did he go?

797
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:06,995
Honey.

798
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:11,335
Where on earth did he go?

799
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:26,015
Where is he?

800
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:40,995
What are you doing out here so late?

801
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:09,985
I wish I had a chance to say goodbye...

802
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:13,155
to Mi Rae's old face.

803
01:00:18,184 --> 01:00:19,535
I'm sorry.

804
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:47,365
Let's go back inside.

805
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:51,995
I'm really sorry.

806
01:00:55,822 --> 01:00:57,105
Let's go back in.

807
01:01:57,183 --> 01:01:58,495
- Hello. - Oh, my.

808
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,835
Your place is so nice.

809
01:02:01,321 --> 01:02:02,735
It looks really nice.

810
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,475
My gosh, you have such a nice place.

811
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:10,830
Woo Young, take this. It's my housewarming gift for you.

812
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,775
Mi Rae made it.

813
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:18,855
Oh, it's a Chypre cologne.

814
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:20,955
Thanks, I'll use it often.

815
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,155
I thought the scent would suit you. That's why I chose it.

816
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:29,365
Ms. Na was right. You really have the talent.

817
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,775
The view from here is incredible.

818
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,660
What do you think? Isn't it pretty good for the rent I'm paying?

819
01:02:42,662 --> 01:02:44,115
Your place is amazing.

820
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:47,915
It's like a penthouse.

821
01:02:48,835 --> 01:02:50,500
Woo Young, can we come over often?

822
01:02:50,503 --> 01:02:51,855
Yes, of course.

823
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,070
This is the first time I'm having girls over.

824
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:58,025
- Seriously? - Yes.

825
01:02:58,144 --> 01:02:59,670
Are you quite conservative?

826
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,695
No, not really.

827
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:04,580
There were times that I couldn't because I was living in a dorm.

828
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:07,265
When I had a basement apartment, I thought they'd be uncomfortable.

829
01:03:08,521 --> 01:03:10,135
You're very honest.

830
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:13,005
By the way, isn't Kyung Seok coming?

831
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:17,775
I'm not sure. I haven't heard from him.

832
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:21,715
(Group Chat)

833
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:25,685
(Then is everyone okay with pork belly?)

834
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:43,535
It's not brand new,

835
01:03:44,057 --> 01:03:45,635
but I bought it very recently.

836
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:11,465
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

837
01:04:11,617 --> 01:04:14,880
Could Do Kyung Seok have a crush on you?

838
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:16,680
Mi Rae, we should watch a movie too.

839
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:19,050
She'll watch a movie with a guy for the first time in her life.

840
01:04:19,058 --> 01:04:20,760
With a super handsome guy.

841
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,990
No, it's just an assignment.

842
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:24,390
Why do I miss him?

843
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:25,990
Do you want to go to the movies with me?

844
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:27,300
I'm going with someone else.

845
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,630
You want to be...

846
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:29,830
- my roommate? - Yes.

847
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:31,270
What on earth is this about?

848
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:33,155
Are you trying to get back at me or what?

849
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:35,385
Is it possible?

850
01:04:35,675 --> 01:04:38,895
To just think of a guy like that as a friend.
