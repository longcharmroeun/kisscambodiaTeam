1
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:24,275
Screen doors are opening.

2
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:34,015
Screen doors are closing.

3
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:43,125
Double eyelid surgery and all-round canthoplasty.

4
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,420
A nose job, face contouring surgery,

5
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,835
fat injections, and lip fillers.

6
00:00:57,193 --> 00:00:58,475
75 out of 100.

7
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,480
Double eyelid surgery, epicanthoplasty,

8
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,895
a nose job, and the V-shape face contouring surgery.

9
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:24,305
(It's obvious that she got work done on her face, but she's satisfied.)

10
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:25,805
70 out of 100.

11
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:34,275
Screen doors are opening.

12
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:42,930
(85 out of 100)

13
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,240
(The beautiful face you dream of)

14
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,625
(All pretty girls know!)

15
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,040
I'd be happy even with an average face.

16
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:53,880
(65 out of 100)

17
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:57,065
75 out of 100. Will I be able to get there?

18
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:02,805
I'll go through what you and the doctor discussed.

19
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,275
Double eyelid surgery through incision and all-round canthoplasty.

20
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,590
Also a nose job with a noble surgery along with full face contouring...

21
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,145
and fat injections all over the face, right?

22
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,715
83 out of 100.

23
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,465
Noticeable puffiness and bruises will last for about a month.

24
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:36,375
Post-procedural complications may result in bleeding or infections.

25
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:38,120
Such cases are rare, but if it is necessary,

26
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:39,805
she can receive a blood transfusion.

27
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:43,715
Well, that doesn't happen often, does it?

28
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,760
No, not often.

29
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,900
- It's rare, but it can happen. - I see.

30
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:50,340
It usually doesn't happen, so please don't worry.

31
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,525
- The surgery will go well. - I see.

32
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:00,780
(Surgery Consent for a Minor Requiring Parental Approval)

33
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,480
(Na Eun Shim, mother)

34
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:06,005
(As a mother, I agree to the surgery specified in this consent.)

35
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,200
Don't worry about the surgery costs.

36
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,230
(Surgery Center)

37
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,015
It'll be a whole new world when you wake up.

38
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:24,855
Yes.

39
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:32,065
So this is the last time I can see this face of yours.

40
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,365
Mom...

41
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:40,405
Don't cry.

42
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:45,205
- You know that I love you, right? - Yes.

43
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,775
- I love you very much. - I know.

44
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,375
Please come in.

45
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,545
Go on in.

46
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:59,355
You can't cry during the surgery.

47
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,155
You got this, Mi Rae!

48
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,465
You'll start feeling sleepy.

49
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:02,215
- Hey, Fatty! - Hey, Fatty!

50
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,455
- You pig! - You pig!

51
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:15,935
- Mi Rae is a pig! - Mi Rae is a pig!

52
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:57,805
(What are you looking at?)

53
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,915
(Look at the pig.)

54
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:25,505
What are you looking at? Look at the pig.

55
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,490
That was seriously so funny.

56
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,505
She really looked like a pig earlier.

57
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,255
- No, wait! - Stop it!

58
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:45,570
- Stop! - Don't do this!

59
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,425
- Come on! - It hurts!

60
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,995
I was a brave girl,

61
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:54,365
and I didn't stay quiet when the other kids made fun of me.

62
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:58,280
- But every time I fought back, - Open the door!

63
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,250
- they'd always do something worse. - Hurry up and open the door!

64
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:03,620
- Open it! - You're strong.

65
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,845
Just break the door open.

66
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,445
Open the door!

67
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:10,915
Open it!

68
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,085
I said, open the door!

69
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,825
Winning the fight...

70
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,625
isn't what victims want.

71
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,735
All they want is to stop being the victim.

72
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,435
They just don't want to be victimized.

73
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,525
I'm not going to eat. I said, I'm not going to eat!

74
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,005
But I took out all the bones for you.

75
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,650
You can't leave with an empty stomach.

76
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:13,105
Up until then, I thought I still had a chance to become pretty.

77
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,890
Because I heard the best kind of makeover is to lose weight.

78
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,315
You'll only end up gaining weight again!

79
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,155
But I didn't gain my weight back...

80
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:32,225
because I was very determined.

81
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:38,365
Someone in our class got the highest score in the entire grade.

82
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,875
Mi Rae, congratulations.

83
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,615
No one made fun of me for a while,

84
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,645
so I thought I had finally become a normal student.

85
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:10,905
What is it that you need to say?

86
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,675
Here. I made a list of questions that might come out on the exam.

87
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,475
I'm only giving this to you.

88
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:20,175
Why?

89
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:21,875
Because...

90
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:24,660
I like you.

91
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,945
What?

92
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,555
Are you crazy?

93
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:30,655
What?

94
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:32,785
What do you mean?

95
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:41,665
Hey, Kang Orc.

96
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,335
I'm talking to you, Kang Orc.

97
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,605
Don't you know your nickname?

98
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:52,045
You were joking, right?

99
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:54,145
Tell me you were joking.

100
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,290
- Yong Cheol. - Hey, Kang Orc.

101
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,885
I'm going to kill you if you tell anybody else that you like me.

102
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:00,645
You better keep it a secret.

103
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:11,165
I never...

104
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:15,395
ended up becoming pretty.

105
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:31,630
Why don't you just do her a favor and go out with her?

106
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,830
You go out with her, you jerk.

107
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:35,130
- What are you talking about? - Hey. Kang Orc.

108
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,100
Yong Cheol told me that he changed his mind.

109
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,955
What are you saying?

110
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,580
Okay, let's take a photo.

111
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:52,035
In 1, 2, 3.

112
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:55,835
- Okay, that was great. - Nice.

113
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:59,260
Okay, it's time for Group Three. Get over here and pose.

114
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:02,490
Hey, hurry up. Okay, nice.

115
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm going to take a photo now. Everybody, pose.

116
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:08,170
Okay, nice. Let's do this in one go. In 1, 2, 3.

117
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,085
Okay. No, wait.

118
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,970
Hey, you over there. You need to show your face.

119
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:18,080
- My gosh. - What's wrong with her?

120
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,780
She's embarrassed to show her face because she's ugly.

121
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,550
Gosh, it's so hot. This is so annoying.

122
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,520
Okay, let's take one more photo.

123
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,820
Everybody, smile. Let me see your teeth.

124
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:29,835
Okay, let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

125
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,645
I never got to...

126
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:37,245
lead a normal life.

127
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:05,075
I can't even love anyone like everyone else...

128
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:09,115
because...

129
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,315
I'm an orc.

130
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,805
This place really must be famous.

131
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,935
Look at all these people.

132
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,655
Don't worry about anything else...

133
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:25,325
and just focus on resting here before you start school. Okay?

134
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,855
Mi Rae, you just need to...

135
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:33,195
focus on taking in all the good energy from this mountain...

136
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,235
and becoming pretty.

137
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,275
Let's take in all the good energy from this mountain...

138
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:50,775
so that Mi Rae can become pretty!

139
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,300
Just like how the bear hid in a cave for 100 days...

140
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:55,055
and ended up becoming the beautiful woman,

141
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:58,985
I also started becoming pretty while staying here.

142
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,010
Here's your new ID.

143
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,395
(Episode 1: I'm Pretty Starting from Today.)

144
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:07,595
Thank you.

145
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:54,815
Are you looking for any specific perfume?

146
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:58,230
I'd like to get this one, Pomelo.

147
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:01,385
You're feminine and beautiful, so it'll suit you very well.

148
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,425
I guess you have a date today.

149
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,125
Pardon me?

150
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,255
Well...

151
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,695
I have to attend college orientation tomorrow.

152
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:22,435
I've become pretty.

153
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,645
The difference is really amazing.

154
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,830
But the thing is...

155
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:29,890
(Big, round eyes)

156
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,400
(Well-defined, feminine nose)

157
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,445
It's a bit obvious that I got plastic surgery.

158
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,770
I'd say 79 out of 100?

159
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,655
(Total Score: 79)

160
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:44,195
(Taxicab Driver's Permit, Kang Tae Sik)

161
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,995
Hasn't the weather gotten much nicer?

162
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,165
Yes.

163
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:55,220
That must be your daughter.

164
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:57,475
Yes, she's majoring in chemistry at Hankook University.

165
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:58,790
She's a freshman.

166
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:00,460
I see. She must've had good grades.

167
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:03,330
When I tell people that she never had a tutor...

168
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:06,585
or took after-school classes, no one believes me.

169
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,285
I bet you don't believe me either.

170
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:10,370
Kids who just aren't cut out for studying...

171
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,200
must find different paths early on.

172
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,855
Many parents make their kids go through such tough ordeals.

173
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:19,095
My daughter studied all by herself and graduated top of her grade.

174
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:22,535
Top of the school, not just her class!

175
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:25,580
Anyway, she always studies so hard.

176
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,420
Right after the college entrance exam,

177
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,335
she went to the Philippines to study English.

178
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:37,945
Frankly, I always thought it'd be nice for her to become a model.

179
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,345
She's tall and slim.

180
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:44,400
She's not that pretty,

181
00:16:44,406 --> 00:16:46,285
but she has such a cute face.

182
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,895
What was her name? Doesn't she look like the actress, Kim Go Eun?

183
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,325
Kim Go Eun?

184
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,880
Some say that my daughter is ugly,

185
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:01,205
but she's prettier than Kim Tae Hee in my eyes.

186
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,045
You sure love your daughter a lot.

187
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,995
A new face and a new life.

188
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:27,965
I want to be really happy during my undergraduate years.

189
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,805
Hey, university student.

190
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,105
What's up, my fellow university student?

191
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,375
Shall we take a photo together to commemorate this historic moment?

192
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:53,225
Shall we?

193
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,410
I brought my selfie stick for this very moment.

194
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:59,365
- Nice. - Hey, come closer.

195
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:02,095
1, 2, 3!

196
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:05,035
Hyun Jung and I have been best friends...

197
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,920
since middle school, but we didn't have a single photo together.

198
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:09,235
Let's take it again.

199
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,075
1, 2, 3.

200
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:13,975
Isn't it so nice here? Come on.

201
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:15,515
Let's take one here.

202
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:20,815
Because my ugly face looked even uglier in photos.

203
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:22,915
1, 2, 3.

204
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,500
1, 2, 3.

205
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:27,140
What are you doing? Get it right.

206
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:29,270
Hey, you look so pretty in photos now.

207
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:30,770
Look, you're so pretty. One more time.

208
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,765
1, 2, 3.

209
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,080
What are you doing? Come on.

210
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,965
- Okay. - Look at the camera, okay?

211
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,745
Don't you think people keep looking at me?

212
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:52,730
I hope it's not because I still look ugly.

213
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:55,900
Gosh, do you want to hear me saying it's because you're pretty?

214
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,215
Coming from me?

215
00:18:57,806 --> 00:18:59,125
Excuse me.

216
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,695
Can I get your number if that's okay with you?

217
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,095
You're totally my type.

218
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:09,665
Here.

219
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,805
You're totally my type.

220
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:16,335
You're totally my type.

221
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,505
- Hey. - Yes?

222
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,275
What are you going to do? He's asking you for your number.

223
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:27,885
Well...

224
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:31,015
Well... The thing is,

225
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,925
I don't have a phone number.

226
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:39,325
Gosh, she can just say no.

227
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,435
That was so embarrassing.

228
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,665
You idiot.

229
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:47,165
You don't have a phone number? What kind of nonsense is that?

230
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,605
I know.

231
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,290
That didn't make sense at all.

232
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:54,505
Hey, do you know what he just said to you?

233
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,815
He said you're totally his type.

234
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:00,530
What type am I?

235
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:04,285
What do you think? You're the pretty type.

236
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,025
Gosh, you needed some time to adjust yourself to your new, pretty face.

237
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,640
Hey, Kang Mi Rae. Pull yourself together, okay?

238
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,165
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

239
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:17,135
Let's go!

240
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,905
Hey, are you going to give that guy your number?

241
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:29,815
Come on.

242
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,985
- Why did you go that way? - I don't know.

243
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:40,700
(Freshmen Orientation)

244
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,295
Hello, my name is Kang Mi Rae.

245
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,665
Thank you.

246
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,475
You are chemistry major.

247
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:01,445
I have to say hi to her. You're Yoo Eun, right?

248
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:04,345
- The repeater. - Yes, for three years.

249
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,160
Feel free to talk casually to me.

250
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:07,600
(Natural double eyelids and well-defined nose)

251
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:08,630
What's your name?

252
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:09,930
(Flawless skin and round face)

253
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,455
- I'm Kim Sung Woon. - 80 out of 100.

254
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,100
I'd give her 85...

255
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,155
- when she's dressed up. - I'm Lee Ji Hyo.

256
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:18,595
Gosh, I told you guys to just talk casually.

257
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,965
I'm Choi Jung Boon.

258
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:24,265
Are you that... Oh, my goodness.

259
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,520
- I didn't even recognize you. - Whatever.

260
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,675
- I look just like my photo. - 70 out of 100?

261
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,220
- She has a cute, friendly face. - I guess you want to argue with me.

262
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,320
My goodness.

263
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,760
Kim Sung Woon, you're one to talk. You look nothing like your photo.

264
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,460
(Double eyelid surgery, filler in her nose, but slim face)

265
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,630
- 90 out of 100. - I was famous for my handsome face.

266
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,970
She's pretty. She'd be popular among guys.

267
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,485
- You little... - What? You jerk.

268
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:59,035
Hello, I'm Kang Mi Rae.

269
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:00,635
Are you a freshman too?

270
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:02,605
- Yes. - Kang Mi Rae?

271
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:05,145
Oh, are you the one with no profile photo?

272
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,745
Well...

273
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:08,545
- Yes. - No, that can't be.

274
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:10,645
She must be X Man.

275
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,485
Hey.

276
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,200
You are X Man, aren't you?

277
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,370
"X Man"? What is that?

278
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:19,285
Those in senior year fool freshmen at the beginning of the semester.

279
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:21,695
You are, right? I bet you are X Man.

280
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,240
No, I'm not. I am a freshman too.

281
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:25,780
Then what's your Chinese zodiac sign? 1, 2, 3.

282
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,495
I was born in the Year of the Rabbit.

(Social Security Card, Kang Mi Rae)

284
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:39,105
Gosh, she was born in 1999 indeed.

285
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:42,590
I guess I look older than my age.

286
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,830
No, it's not that. We just think you're drop-dead gorgeous.

287
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,785
No girl in first year is this pretty and slim.

288
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,270
- Aren't I right? - Yes, you're right. Totally.

289
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:52,425
What is this awkward tension?

290
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:54,240
Will I be an outsider?

291
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,855
Hello, this is the chemistry department, right?

00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,225
I'm Hyun Soo A.

293
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:04,865
You're all better-looking in person. I almost didn't recognize anyone.

294
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,735
I'm Jang Won Ho.

295

- I'm Yoo Eun. - 100 out of 100.

298
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:17,360
A super rare natural beauty.

299

(A perfect natural beauty)

300
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:21,985
She really is divinely beautiful.

00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,070
Yes. Hi.

This can't be from perfume.

She's pretty and cute. All guys will fall in love with her.

308

Hey, what are the girls in first year like?

Take a look for yourself. Those two are drop-dead gorgeous.

Those girls. Those two over there. The one on the right and...

315
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,795
Who is that guy?

I remember my first day...

327
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:06,400
of orientation in university.

328
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:09,310
I'm sure you all entered this university...

329
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:13,410
with a specific dream of your own.

330
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:16,510
Don't ever give up even though things might get difficult.

331

This is all because I was able to learn Korean...

343
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:48,080
and Korean culture at Hankook University.

344

(Freshmen Orientation)

356
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:38,715
Now, you'll all be spending time with the students of your major.

357
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,545
Let's move to the next location.

358
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:44,155
You're so skinny. I envy you.

359
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,300
You're skinny too.

360
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,240
I need to gain a bit more weight to look pretty.

361
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,955
I have the body of an elementary school kid.

362
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:52,825
Do you not gain weight?

363
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:55,010
I don't know, but I really enjoy eating.

364
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:56,335
Hey, hey.

365
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:58,665
He has something to say to you.

366
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:02,775
I was wondering if you'd like me to carry that for you.

367
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:05,575
No, it's okay. Thanks, Won Ho.

368
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,520
You remember my name?

369
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,960
Of course. You're Jang Won Ho.

370
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:12,045
You had a nice voice when you said hi to me earlier.

371
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,685
Do you not remember my name?

372
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:19,000
What are you talking about? Of course, I remember.

373
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:21,455
You're Soo A. Hyun Soo A.

374
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,770
You have good memory.

375
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:27,710
Gosh, don't waste your time. I'm sure she's fussy about guys.

376
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:30,180
Are you talking about me? That's not true.

377
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:32,380
Everyone says that.

378
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:35,150
I'm telling the truth. Why would you think that way?

379
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:36,835
Okay, just bring that over.

380
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:43,045
Gosh, he's so good-looking.

381
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:45,185
He's extremely handsome.

382
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:46,915
What?

383
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:48,785
Yes, you're right.

384
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:55,555
I'm Ko Ye Na, and I'm a sophomore.

385
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:59,795
I really like watching movies.

386
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:04,480
And I can always treat you to a meal, so call me.

387
00:28:04,486 --> 00:28:05,835
Next.

388
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:09,905
Hello, I'm Noh Min A, a sophomore.

389
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:14,145
Hello, I'm Song Jung Ho, a sophomore.

390
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:19,530
I'm Kim Chan Woo. I entered this university in 2013.

391
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:22,855
I know I may be hard to approach since I'm way older than you,

392
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:25,500
but you can always come to me if you have anything on your mind.

393
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,925
I'll give you advice as your senior.

394
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:34,340
Lastly, I'm Koo Tae Young, the student president.

395
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,895
And I'd like to welcome all of you...

396
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:37,480
to the chemistry department.

397
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,105
- Hello. - Hello.

398
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:43,720
Now, the freshmen can start introducing themselves.

399
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,075
Please come out and say hello.

400
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm so nervous to introduce myself.

401
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:49,345
Me too.

402
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:01,125
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

403
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:02,995
Do Kyung Seok?

404
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,395
I like working out, and I like drinking.

405
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:09,910
Please call me when you're drinking.

406
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:12,465
- You're good-looking. - How handsome.

407
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:17,505
No way.

408
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,145
He can't be the Do Kyung Seok I know.

409
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:27,845
That's enough.

410
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:30,715
I'm really nervous.

411
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:33,900
Hello, I'm Hyun Soo A, a freshman.

412
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,870
My gosh, she's the prettiest girl I've never seen.

413
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:38,195
She's going to be the most popular girl this year.

414
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,150
I know it's important to study hard as a university student,

415
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,320
but I also want to make a lot of friends.

416
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,220
I hope we can all get along well.

417
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:49,550
I'll become your friend.

418
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,375
I hope we can become really good friends.

419
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:54,760
I have a question. Do you have a boyfriend?

420
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:58,330
No, I don't. This is embarrassing, but I've never dated anyone before.

421
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,560
- Come on. Don't lie. - No way.

422
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:03,300
- That's such a lie. - Unbelievable.

423
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:04,970
No way. That can't be true.

424
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:07,840
The next girl is really pretty,

425
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:09,495
so I'll just end it here.

426
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,495
Mi Rae, it's your turn.

427
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,265
Me?

428
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,365
Okay, let's move onto the next pretty girl.

429
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,175
"The next pretty girl"?

430
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,175
That makes it sound like I'm as pretty as her.

431
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:32,515
This is my first time seeing someone who had plastic surgery done.

432
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,830
I like girls like her.

433
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:36,115
I see.

434
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:40,385
I'm so nervous.

435
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:43,725
Hello, I'm Kang Mi Rae.

436
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:52,750
I also hope that we'll all get along.

437
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,165
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

438
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:56,750
- No. - Come on.

439
00:30:56,758 --> 00:30:58,235
Let's be honest.

440
00:30:58,593 --> 00:30:59,920
I really don't have a boyfriend.

441
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:02,145
Do girls think those kind of faces are pretty?

442
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,845
I look forward to getting to know all of you.

443
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,285
It's nice to meet you.

444
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,410
Let's move onto the next pretty girl.

445
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:18,695
Who's next?

446
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,150
Come on. Cheers.

447
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:24,835
- Cheers. - Cheers. You too.

448
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,980
Soo A, which part do you like?

449
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:28,080
- Do you like drumsticks? - Me?

450
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:30,275
Let's see. Here's one.

451
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,360
Here you go, Soo A.

452
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,660
No, it's okay.

453
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:34,790
Can you drink, Soo A?

454
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:38,045
Yes, I can. Let me pour you a drink first.

455
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:41,415
- Thanks. - What's she doing?

456
00:31:42,837 --> 00:31:44,300
I'll pour you a drink too.

457
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:46,185
Gosh, thank you.

458
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,900
You can call me by my name.

459
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:50,510
Give me that. I'll pour you a drink too.

460
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:51,740
Thank you.

461
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,540
She seems to have a great personality.

462
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:56,365
- I know. She's really friendly. - Cheers.

463
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,310
- Let's all clink our glasses. - Okay.

464
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,420
- Welcome. - Bottoms up.

465
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,950
- Cheers. - Let's do this.

466
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:02,090
Let's get along well.

467
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,375
- Welcome. - Okay.

468
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,220
What did you do after taking the college entrance exam?

469
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:07,260
I had fun.

470
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:08,545
With your girlfriend?

471
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,075
No.

472
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:13,245
Why? Don't you have a girlfriend?

473
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:15,815
- No. - Did you break up with her?

474
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,555
How long has it been since you broke up?

475
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:20,155
I'm not interested.

476
00:32:21,676 --> 00:32:23,570
Do you drink well?

477
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,565
I enjoy drinking. What about you?

478
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:50,955
It's him.

479
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,385
I think it's him.

480
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,225
Mi Rae, I envy you so much.

481
00:32:58,346 --> 00:32:59,980
- What? - Your name is as pretty...

482
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,265
as your face.

483
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:04,865
My name is Jung Boon. It's so tacky.

484
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:06,865
How am I supposed to respond to this?

485
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,950
What am I supposed to say?

486
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,150
No, you're prettier. Don't say that.

487
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,345
Gosh, come on. That's too big of a lie.

488
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:16,390
You look like an actress.

489
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:17,775
Right?

490
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,915
You kind of look like an announcer too.

491
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:25,030
Can you guys drink? We should start drinking as well.

492
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,385
Okay.

493
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,670
What?

494
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,670
- What? - What's this?

495
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,340
- Will you look at that? - My goodness.

496
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:36,395
How dare a freshman drink water?

497
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:39,450
If I catch you acting all shy, I'm going to have to scold you.

498
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:40,780
You're so manly.

499
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:42,890
- Let's fill our glasses. - Yes, let's fill our glasses.

500
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,220
Yours is empty.

501
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,205
Jung Boon, I'll pour you a glass.

502
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:49,815
Mi Rae, you too.

503
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,260
- Bottoms up. - I like that.

504
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:54,545
Bottoms up.

505
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,485
Mi Rae, do you really not have a boyfriend?

506
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,655
What? No.

507
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:07,425
Then can I be your boyfriend?

508
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:08,965
Pardon?

509
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:14,065
Love, love, love

510
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,490
Chan Woo, you're not as energetic as you used to be.

511
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,960
Let's all fill our glasses. Come on.

512
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,905
- Let's fill them up. - Pour the drinks.

513
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:24,475
Now, it's time for the games.

514
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,085
Ready, go.

- Kim Sung Woon! - Kim Sung Woon!

518
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:45,435
You can do it!

519
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,315
Even if he's that Kyung Seok... So what?

520
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,145
He won't recognize me anyway.

00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:19,927
Don't you have anything to help her sober up?

710
00:49:21,028 --> 00:49:22,462
She says she's drunk.

711
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:28,202
- Soo A. - Drink this.

712
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,237
- It's best for sobering up. - Get on my back.

713
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:31,905
- I'll carry you on my back. - It's really effective.

714
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:34,408
- Drink this. - Hold on.

715
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,520
What choreography did you do? Red Velvet's?

716
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,689
(From Hyun Jung)

717
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,091
Psy.

718
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,593
Seriously?

719
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:55,862
Yes.

720
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,981
Gosh, it's cold.

721
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,750
What are you doing?

722
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:52,119
I'm outside.

723
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:54,388
They keep telling me to drink when I'm in there.

724
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:59,092
Do you remember Do Kyung Seok?

725
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,295
In our department...

726
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:02,963
Goodness.

727
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:05,932
Hello?

728
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:16,777
Hello?

729
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:22,082
Hello?

730
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:24,651
I'm sure I called my daughter's number.

731
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,721
Who's there?

732
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:29,656
Oh, well...

733
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:35,162
I'm Mi Rae's senior.

734
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:39,866
I see. Why do you have her phone by the way?

735
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:41,868
Well, that's...

736
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,274
Newbies are not allowed to use their phones during the event.

737
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,543
So we collected them for the time being.

738
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,678
Oh, I see.

739
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:53,580
I'm sorry.

740
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,848
Not at all.

741
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:57,484
I'm sorry.

742
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:59,953
Well, goodbye then.

743
00:52:04,324 --> 00:52:05,926
Dad...

744
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:17,237
You're home early. Have you eaten dinner?

745
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:22,209
What's wrong? Did something happen?

746
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,645
She was just like Mi Rae.

747
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:30,183
Did you talk to her on the phone?

748
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:32,152
She looked pretty...

749
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,421
with round eyes and a sharp nose.

750
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:37,691
Well, that's...

751
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:40,927
Ever since she graduated middle school,

752
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:43,764
she wanted to do a plastic surgery on her eyelids.

753
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:44,765
What?

754
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:47,501
She got so stressed out because of her face.

755
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,636
There you go again.

756
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:52,639
What's wrong with her face that you keep stirring up her mind?

757
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,041
I already said no.

758
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:58,445
Did I mishear because I miss my daughter?

759
00:52:58,578 --> 00:53:01,448
Her female senior took my call.

760
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:05,185
Her voice sounded exactly like Mi Rae's.

761
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,621
No way.

762
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,591
She should've visited us after coming back from her studies abroad.

763
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:13,527
Why did she have to go straight to the school orientation?

764
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,710
Are you okay?

765
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,679
What?

766
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:36,483
Yes.

767
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,719
I'm okay.

768
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:42,389
I just feel a little sick.

769
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,126
Drink this.

770
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:50,697
Thank you.

771
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:04,244
Well... Do you want to go rest if you're too drunk?

772
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:06,546
You might have to drink again if you go back inside.

773
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:09,182
There's a lounge with a sofa over there.

774
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:12,786
Is there a place like that?

775
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,455
Thank you.

776
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,568
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

777
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,092
I should get some rest too.

778
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,235
Why are you standing there? Sit down.

779
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:40,206
Okay.

780
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:57,857
Isn't it uncomfortable?

781
00:55:58,892 --> 00:56:00,427
Sit down here comfortably.

782
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:02,729
I'm okay.

783
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,633
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable around me?

784
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,768
Should we change seats then? I'll sit over there.

785
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:10,637
No, there's no need to.

786
00:56:11,905 --> 00:56:13,373
Then I'll sit here.

787
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:41,501
You're very pretty.

788
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:47,841
Are you okay?

789
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:49,909
I'm okay.

790
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:55,115
I'm curious,

791
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:57,917
but you really don't have a boyfriend?

792
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,888
- No. - Why?

793
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:06,393
I just don't have one.

794
00:57:06,626 --> 00:57:07,994
I see.

795
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:16,636
Then can I like you?

796
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:19,339
Looking at you playing games and dancing earlier,

797
00:57:20,206 --> 00:57:21,708
I fell in love.

798
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:29,449
Is this a profession?

799
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,853
Don't think too seriously about it though.

800
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:39,359
Oh, right.

801
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,364
People might look for me if I leave my place for too long.

802
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:49,202
Who?

803
00:57:52,672 --> 00:57:55,809
No one else is more interested in you than I am.

804
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:05,919
Who?

805
00:58:09,422 --> 00:58:12,592
No one else is more interested in you than I am.

806
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:20,934
They're busy having fun,

807
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:23,036
so don't bother.

808
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:37,617
Hey.

809
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:40,687
Raise me up already.

810
00:58:48,628 --> 00:58:52,599
What are you doing?

811
00:58:55,668 --> 00:58:57,270
It's none of your business.

812
00:58:58,404 --> 00:59:01,775
You went this way, so I wondered what kind of place it was.

813
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:05,979
What do you mean? It's no special place.

814
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:09,983
She seemed too drunk, so I took her so that she could rest for a while.

815
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:14,754
Why would you open the door all of a sudden when I was leaning on it?

816
00:59:16,823 --> 00:59:18,658
You were stopping the door.

817
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:24,597
Are you drunk?

818
00:59:25,031 --> 00:59:27,133
Look at you being rude to your senior.

819
00:59:33,406 --> 00:59:36,309
I'm letting it go because you're drunk, all right?

820
00:59:41,447 --> 00:59:42,849
Mi Rae. Let's go.

821
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,574
Are you okay?

822
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:12,512
Yes, I'm good.

823
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:22,288
Rest here if you want to.

824
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,466
Kang Mi Rae.

825
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:50,083
By any chance,

826
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,153
did you go to Jadong Middle School?

827
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:06,532
What?

828
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:08,601
(We thank Lee Young Ae, Um Hong Gil, and Lucky...)

829
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:10,136
(for their special appearances.)

830
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:23,783
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

831
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:26,853
Kyung Seok treats you differently from others.

832
01:01:26,853 --> 01:01:28,021
Do you go out with him?

833
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:29,956
- She's already so famous. - She's really pretty.

834
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:30,957
Mi Rae.

835
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:33,927
You and Mi Rae might get along with each other very well...

836
01:01:33,927 --> 01:01:35,628
though I feel a little bad.

837
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:37,430
I haven't done any plastic surgery.

838
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,365
Mi Rae hasn't either.

839
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:40,566
You think it's funny?

840
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:42,035
Do you go to this university?

841
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:43,937
I'm your daughter, Mi Rae.

842
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:45,805
Gosh, you plastic monster.

843
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:48,107
What have I done?

844
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:50,643
Are you on one-sided love?
