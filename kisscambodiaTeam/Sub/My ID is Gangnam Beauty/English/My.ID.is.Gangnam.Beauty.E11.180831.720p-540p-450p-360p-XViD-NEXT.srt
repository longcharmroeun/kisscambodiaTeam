1
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:12,235
Do you...

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,305
have a crush on him too?

3
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:20,175
No way. Do you?

4
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:25,315
What's the problem? Am I not allowed to like him or what?

5
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:30,285
You won't need my help.

6
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,330
You're bright,

7
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,100
active, and pretty.

8
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:35,965
You're pretty too.

9
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,065
What?

10
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,640
Are you guys going out?

11
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:41,610
Why do you think so?

12
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:44,535
You're popular among guys as well...

13
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,535
because you're pretty.

14
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:51,275
I think...

15
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,785
it's a blessing to be pretty, don't you think?

16
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:57,315
People naturally like you.

17
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,290
That must be why those who aren't blessed...

18
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:04,295
get plastic surgery to enjoy that kind of benefit,

19
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,995
harming the ones who were born pretty.

20
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:11,335
Harm?

21
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,270
I mean, pretty faces become less rare...

22
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:17,675
because of plastic surgery.

23
00:01:26,823 --> 00:01:29,015
I thought I was mistaken...

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,325
and that I was at fault for judging you in a bad way.

25
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,855
But I wasn't mistaken.

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,595
You've hated me...

27
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,135
from the beginning.

28
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:59,245
No, don't get me wrong.

29
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:01,890
There are just so many pretty girls these days, you know.

30
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,215
That was my point.

31
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:07,255
I'm sorry if I offended you.

32
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm well aware of the fact...

33
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,355
that you had to get plastic surgery out of despair.

34
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:17,735
I really wasn't talking about you.

35
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:21,735
That's a lie.

36
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:25,205
In any case, what you're saying is...

37
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:27,705
that you don't like girls who got plastic surgery.

38
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:32,820
(Episode 11: Your ID is Gangnam Beauty)

39
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:34,390
That's ridiculous.

40
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,485
She said she wasn't talking about you?

41
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,590
I get that she hates me,

42
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:40,825
but what bothers me more is how she thinks that I'm dumb.

43
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:44,130
I told you that girl is weird.

44
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:45,530
Park Yong Chul too.

45
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,395
She definitely has it out for you.

46
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,470
Hey, I hope you're not...

47
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:53,295
thinking that you should help her so that she can date Kyung Seok.

48
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:56,465
No, I'm not. I told her I won't help her.

49
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,475
What should I do?

50
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,780
Kim Chan Woo found out that we're going out.

51
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:04,315
What?

52
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:05,620
How did that happen?

53
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:08,185
What? Are you seeing someone?

54
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,385
Actually...

55
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,885
- Hello. - Hi, Mi Rae.

56
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,270
So who's the guy you're seeing?

57
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:23,070
Hey, why are you so slow-witted?

58
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,565
What's wrong?

59
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,635
Why Kim Chan Woo of all people?

60
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,710
Love is in the air.

61
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:34,580
I think Tae Young's girlfriend is somewhere in this room.

62
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,445
It's not funny.

63
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:38,620
Tae Hee, is it true?

64
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,515
Were you really doing this with Tae Young?

65
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,690
Hey, come on. It's not like you two are in an improper relationship.

66
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,460
Why hide it? Everyone will congratulate you guys.

67
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,490
Look at us now.

68
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:51,695
Is that your way of congratulating her?

69
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,700
I guess that's Tae Young's type.

70
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:58,640
Because he's so skinny, he must've wanted a girlfriend who's...

71
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,195
Hey, stop it.

72
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,240
- What did you just say? - What did I say?

73
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,475
Didn't you hear about what happened at the festival?

74
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:09,950
We said we won't let it slide if you mock someone's looks ever again.

75
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:11,950
I didn't even say anything offensive. What did I say?

76
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,690
- Well, I'm not sure. - We heard it.

77
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,745
I could hear it from here.

78
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,955
Your hearing is too good.

79
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:22,490
I'll keep my voice down from now on.

80
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,560
Let's talk quietly.

81
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,825
That scumbag deserves no respect.

82
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,300
What?

83
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:29,800
- Hey. - What?

84
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:32,295
How dare you talk so rudely to a senior?

85
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,005
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

86
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,105
Apologize to her.

87
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,045
Hey, come on.

88
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,820
What did you say?

89
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:53,220
I said, you should apologize...

90
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:56,125
for offending your juniors instead of being obscure about it.

91
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,605
If I tell people that I like someone,

92
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:18,545
and if that someone was Kyung Seok...

93
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,915
No.

94
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,145
They'll definitely make fun of me.

95
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:30,860
You must've been hungry.

96
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,125
I'll give you more next time.

97
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,275
(Jang Won Ho)

98
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,785
Soo A.

99
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,885
I'm sorry for reacting that way...

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,485
regarding the report and taking your photo without permission.

101
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:01,860
No, it's oaky.

102
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:04,260
I felt bad about having reacted...

103
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,055
so sensitively toward you.

104
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:07,330
I'm sorry too.

105
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,630
You're so nice.

106
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,700
You're even nicer for apologizing to me about something so small.

107
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,370
The weather's nice today.

108
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:15,970
I brought my camera.

109
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,440
Do you want me to take a photo of you?

110
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:18,935
Sure.

111
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:22,680
If you see her, call me right away.

112
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:23,720
Please do me a favor.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Okay, sir.

114
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:27,115
Have a good day.

115
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,625
(Jung Young Mo)

116
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,025
You look just like Kyung Seok from the neck down.

117
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:44,435
Hey, don't you feel sad about wearing the exact same outfit?

118
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,465
This is too expensive for me to feel that way.

119
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,180
Plus, why is that important?

120
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,405
What matters is that Soo A's no longer mad at me.

121
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:03,945
Hey, Won Ho.

122
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:06,655
Yes?

123
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,560
Where did you get that shirt?

124
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:11,155
Where do you think? I bought it.

125
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,605
Is that a fake?

126
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,380
It's the real deal.

127
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,775
It's from the 2018 spring and summer collection.

128
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:38,255
I'll send it to you as soon as you wire me the money.

129
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:39,815
Okay.

130
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:59,635
(Kyung Seok)

131
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:04,920
Hello?

132
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,120
Did you sell my clothes?

133
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:08,350
Yes, I needed some money.

134
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,750
But how did you find out?

135
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,685
You need money? Is there something going on?

136
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,665
That was quite impressive.

137
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:25,335
Why didn't you behave that way before?

138
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:30,465
Thanks for standing up for me earlier.

139
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,480
I know I'm always mean to you.

140
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,945
No, it's because Chan Woo crossed the line.

141
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:38,920
I mistreated you a lot, didn't I?

142
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,450
- No. - Don't lie.

143
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:41,620
You never mistreated me.

144
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,550
I always criticize you and look down on you.

145
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,885
I can already think of so many things.

146
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,655
Just eat your food.

147
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:04,010
Ye Na.

148
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,535
Yes?

149
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,075
You know I like you, right?

150
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,315
It would've been nice if I confessed my feelings a bit earlier.

151
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,125
I'm leaving for the military.

152
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,855
What?

153
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,430
When?

154
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,295
As soon as we're done with the finals.

155
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,865
Hey.

156
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,175
I wanted to tell you how I felt...

157
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:44,045
before I actually left.

158
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,245
I...

159
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,185
liked you...

160
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,385
a lot.

161
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,200
Hey.

162
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:00,695
What?

163
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:04,065
Why are you telling me that now?

164
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,810
Why are you reacting this way?

165
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,665
My gosh.

166
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:15,410
- This is so annoying. - Hey.

167
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:18,580
Ye Na, what... What's wrong?

168
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:21,090
That's what I should be asking you. What's wrong with you?

169
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,450
I can't believe she's crying because of a guy like him.

170
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,555
He must be really rich.

171
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:28,655
Okay, don't cry.

172
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:30,760
What's wrong?

173
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,795
When people refer to a beautiful couple,

174
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:36,265
that means the guy is handsome and the girl is pretty.

175
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,365
Kyung Seok is handsome.

176
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:42,305
But I'm not pretty.

177
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:46,035
We don't look good together.

178
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,415
Did you eat?

179
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,055
Yes.

180
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:05,525
Soo A looks much better with Kyung Seok than me.

181
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:16,205
Kyung Seok takes this class. Why isn't he coming?

182
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:54,305
Kyung Seok, is that you?

183
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,845
Yes.

184
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,650
How could you move out like this?

185
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,445
What?

186
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,060
Pack your things.

187
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:09,830
Why? You moved out as well.

188
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,555
I said, pack your things.

189
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,370
It'll take some time to see if we can do a joint program...

190
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:20,735
with your school and provide internships.

191
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,470
Meanwhile, we suggested Professor Park...

192
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:26,340
that we could pick a few students who are interested in this field...

193
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:29,180
and let them take a tour around our laboratory.

194
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:30,720
That'd be great.

195
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,545
It's always good for students to experience new things.

196
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:37,020
I know they won't be able to learn much in such a short period of time,

197
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,855
but it's always better to see things in person.

198
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,570
- I'm not going to go home. - Go home.

199
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,600
- No. - I said, go home.

200
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:51,170
No, I'm never going to go home.

201
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:52,540
Then are you going to live in that tiny room forever?

202
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,040
Of course not. Are you dumb?

203
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:56,235
Then why did you move out?

204
00:12:56,912 --> 00:13:00,475
You're so mean and selfish.

205
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:02,980
You left home as soon as you found out, so why can't I?

206
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:05,450
Do I need to stay home because I'm just a little kid?

207
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:08,390
Why didn't you tell me anything?

208
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:09,985
I hate all of you.

209
00:13:10,026 --> 00:13:13,355
I hate Dad, I hate you,

210
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,655
I hate that woman,

211
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:17,725
and I also hate myself.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,595
I hate everyone.

213
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,465
What am I supposed to do now?

214
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,275
I'm the only one who didn't know anything.

215
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:34,905
I said so many mean things to her.

216
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:38,745
Let's go.

217
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,520
I said, I'm not going to go. I don't want to see Dad.

218
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:45,315
I'm not taking you there.

219
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,755
Then where?

220
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:51,355
She'll probably cry out of happiness...

221
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:52,955
if I tell her that you're coming.

222
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:00,570
I'm sorry that we can't accept that many students.

223
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:01,610
No, it's okay.

224
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,670
Some students already applied for other activities,

225
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,140
and some already are going abroad, so there won't be a lot.

226
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:08,745
Ms. Na, wait. Ms. Na.

227
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:14,075
I guess it's nothing bad.

228
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,750
How do you know that?

229
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:18,190
No one runs like that if it's bad news.

230
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:19,815
People normally run because they're excited.

231
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,425
- Let's go. - Okay.

232
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:27,030
You have a dinner meeting with Ms. Yoon of Korea Cosmetics.

233
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,470
Cancel it.

234
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:30,770
- Then what about Director Shin... - Cancel it.

235
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,295
- Then... - Just cancel everything.

236
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,210
No, that's not what I was going to ask.

237
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:36,670
Where should I drive you?

238
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,205
To my house.

239
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,105
To your house?

240
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,465
I'll just go.

241
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,100
Why are you so stubborn?

242
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,070
This isn't right. It's too late to...

243
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,335
It's not late at all.

244
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:13,935
We can make things work from now on.

245
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:18,445
- She might hate me. - Why would she?

246
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:22,415
I don't know. She might hate me.

247
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,160
Do you know what I said to her?

248
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,185
- I... - Why would I hate you?

249
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:57,515
Thank you for coming.

250
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:26,845
Excuse me.

251
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:30,085
Do you know a freshman named Do Kyung Hee?

252
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:34,930
What's wrong?

253
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,860
Help, there's a pervert here.

254
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,695
- Help. - What, me?

255
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:44,865
Stop right there.

256
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,375
Where did he go?

257
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,725
Hello?

258
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,425
Oh, yes.

259
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:17,325
Thank you so much.

260
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:26,635
Here.

261
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,985
You can stay here.

262
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:39,385
Tell me if you need anything.

263
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,785
You must be tired.

264
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,385
Do you want to wash up?

265
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,325
Yes.

266
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:12,355
Actually, I like Kyung Seok.

267
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,425
Can you help me out?

268
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:30,835
You look dazed.

269
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,975
I'm not.

270
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:42,420
What are you guys doing?

271
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:43,520
(From Woo Young)

272
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,520
(What are you guys doing?)

273
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,620
Nothing much.

274
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,260
(From Hyun Jung)

275
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:48,490
How about we gather up today?

276
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:49,890
(How about we gather up today?)

277
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:50,990
I'm in.

278
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,030
(From Hyun Jung)

279
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:54,330
How about the rest of you, Mi Rae and Kyung Seok?

280
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:57,165
(How about the rest of you, Mi Rae and Kyung Seok?)

281
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:09,945
From its interior design to every single prop,

282
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:11,350
(How about the rest of you, Mi Rae and Kyung Seok?)

283
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:13,245
I feel so heartbroken.

284
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,590
Kyung Seok, are you listening?

285
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:21,515
- No. - Coldhearted punk.

286
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,360
Right, you wouldn't know how I feel.

287
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,630
I decorated each and every thing at my precious bar,

288
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:30,630
and I have to say goodbye to it, but you wouldn't know how that feels.

289
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,865
So why did you call me out instead of someone who'd understand?

290
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,110
Try to feel pity on me...

291
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,275
for having no one else but you to have a drink with.

292
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,685
What are you going to do?

293
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,685
I don't know.

294
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,990
If we hang out, should we eat fried chicken and beer, watch a movie,

295
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:57,030
go to a karaoke room, or play indoor baseball?

296
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,430
Indoor baseball?

297
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:01,095
That sounds good. I'll be able to blow off steam.

298
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:04,130
- How about we do it then? - Deal.

299
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,300
We'll go near your house right now.

300
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,405
(We'll go near your house right now.)

301
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,535
Let's go, Mi Rae.

302
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:19,145
What are you doing? Get ready.

303
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:31,230
Even my mom can't go against my dad's will.

304
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,995
He says he'll get divorced if she gives me money.

305
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,095
Then work part-time.

306
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,365
Should I ask if I can work part-time here?

307
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:43,705
You should move in to your mother's house too.

308
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:46,205
Or get some financial help from her.

309
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:48,050
You can't earn your living expenses and tuition...

310
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,805
only by working part-time.

311
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:52,915
If I can't, I should take a break or something.

312
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:55,985
It's good to be realistic,

313
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:59,015
but you should give her a chance to be your mother.

314
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:07,855
And be good to Mi Rae.

315
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,200
Why are you bringing her up here?

316
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,970
If it hadn't been for her, you'd neither have been able to...

317
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,995
meet her nor make up with her.

318
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,345
Hold on.

319
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,475
What was that smile just now?

320
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:28,650
What do you mean?

321
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:31,385
I'm sure there's something.

322
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,615
You know, I'm quick-witted.

323
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,085
In that sense, let me go to the toilet.

324
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:42,025
Gosh.

325
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,625
Hello.

326
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,965
Hello.

327
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,475
Indoor baseball?

328
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,455
Let's see. It's Hyun Jung's.

329
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:07,890
It's Mi Rae's.

330
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:10,585
Isn't this for elementary school students?

331
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:17,070
You don't have to hold the end. Just hold wherever feels comfortable.

332
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:19,200
Instead of trying to swing it hard,

333
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:22,205
just try to hit the ball when it approaches.

334
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:24,305
Stand in position.

335
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:28,175
Hold the bat.

336
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,975
Then swing.

337
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,420
(Do Kyung Seok)

338
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:35,015
You're good.

339
00:22:42,497 --> 00:22:44,160
Finish it up. Let's go out.

340
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,895
Why?

341
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,625
I have somewhere to be.

342
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:52,400
You want to go home when your friend is lost in grief?

343
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:53,870
Yes.

344
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,210
You'll abandon me here and leave?

345
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:59,835
- Finish your drink. - Goodness.

346
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,575
It's Jung Boon.

347
00:23:07,956 --> 00:23:10,115
What are you doing here?

348
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,985
It's making me feel bad.

349
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:15,055
There are a lot of people who care for me.

350
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:18,160
Were you consoling him?

351
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll leave him to you.

352
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,330
I only have this amount of money. Bye.

353
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:24,070
No, we have to clear the table for other customers. Kyung Seok.

354
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,195
Kyung Seok.

355
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:30,265
Were you smooching off of your younger friend?

356
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:34,605
- Jung Boon. - Wait a second.

357
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,650
Who's that?

358
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:38,320
- It's my boyfriend. - What?

359
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,280
I mean, my male friend.

360
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,885
Oh, okay.

361
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,290
Why? Who are you to get surprised by that?

362
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:48,385
When did I do that?

363
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,540
- Oh, my! - It's been hit! Great.

364
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,040
Nicely done.

365
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:03,640
Woo Young is very good at this.

366
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,380
I'm no match for him.

367
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,935
Totally.

368
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,380
Hey, isn't it nice to be out?

369
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:11,980
Isn't it? Aren't you happy?

370
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,750
Yes, it is nice. It's your turn now. Go and do a good job.

371
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,315
Okay.

372
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:18,515
- Good luck. - Thanks.

373
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:27,155
What do you think? Aren't I pretty good?

374
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:29,900
I didn't know you could be a show-off.

375
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:31,400
Gosh, is this fair?

376
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:32,440
Shall I only use one arm?

377
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,665
You never know though. Don't speak so soon.

378
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,435
You can do it!

379
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:40,105
Strike!

380
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,715
- Go for it! - Go!

381
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,225
Hello.

382
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,650
Excuse me. Are you a celebrity by any chance?

383
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:22,215
No, I'm not.

384
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:24,415
And you're this handsome?

385
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,655
My goodness.

386
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:29,330
Wait. Just a second, please.

387
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:33,225
I'm the owner of Charbain Beaute, Jeno.

388
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:34,560
Please visit my salon.

389
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:35,800
If you model for us,

390
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:38,635
I'll give you a free haircut and pay you 200 dollars.

391
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,235
Here.

392
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,740
Here's how you can get to my salon. It has my number too.

393
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:46,235
Could I get your number by any chance?

394
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:48,110
No.

395
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:51,175
Oh, wait! I'll pay you 250 dollars, then.

396
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,215
How about 300 dollars?

397
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,785
Hey!

398
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:13,535
My gosh, Mi Rae has a great posture.

399
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,910
Strike!

400
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:18,535
This is too fast.

401
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:21,710
You can do it, Mi Rae. Go for it! You got this.

402
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:23,305
Go for it.

403
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,215
That's great. Keep it up!

404
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,190
What just happened?

405
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:38,025
- Did you see that? - What happened?

406
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:41,955
What's going on here? I might win at this rate.

407
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:51,365
(Indoor Batting Cage)

408
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:53,680
It's been hit.

409
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:55,650
- Great. Nicely done. - What is happening?

410
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,550
I've caught up with you. It's a tie!

411
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:00,080
Are you sure she's never done this before?

412
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:03,015
I told you that she's very athletic.

413
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,730
- My gosh, how can she be so good? - Oh, my.

414
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:18,625
Amazing.

415
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,735
My goodness.

416
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:23,905
- I'm so impressed. - I won!

417
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,785
Hey, where were you? We couldn't get a hold of you.

418
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:38,090
What are you doing here?

419
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:39,560
You said you were going to a batting cage.

420
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:41,120
Oh, I'm glad you came.

421
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,260
How about we split up into two teams for the next round?

422
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:44,830
The team that loses has to pay for this.

423
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,300
Sure.

424
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:47,700
Are you good at baseball?

425
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,595
I wouldn't be here if I weren't good.

426
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,445
Why didn't you answer my call?

427
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,745
I didn't know you called.

428
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:14,185
Good luck!

429
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:25,665
- Oh, my! - Nice.

430
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:56,695
One point gained.

431
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,715
- One point gained. - He's good.

432
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:28,525
- Another point. Home run! - Oh, my!

433
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:32,840
Gosh, how can he hit two home runs right off the bat?

434
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:34,440
He's really good.

435
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:36,135
Let's play one more time.

436
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:37,665
Shall we do it together?

437
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:44,110
What's our total?

438
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,650
- It's 56 dollars. - Okay.

439
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,080
- We'll pay. - No, it's okay.

440
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:49,750
I was going to pay for this anyway. I asked you to meet up with me.

441
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,520
But still... Then let's split it in half.

442
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,585
No, it's really okay.

443
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,485
I'll pay with this.

444
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:00,055
You're frugal, but you can be generous when you spend.

445
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:01,930
Thank you. We had a great time.

446
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,425
You're welcome.

447
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:07,840
- You can discard the receipt. - Okay.

448
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:09,410
- Let's go. - Thank you.

449
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:10,610
Goodbye.

450
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,375
- Bye. - Bye.

451
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:19,780
Kyung Seok, is there anything you can't do?

452
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:22,750
Being so perfect makes it hard for people to approach you.

453
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:24,285
Aren't I right?

454
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,385
Yes, that's right.

455
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,630
I'm sure he has at least one shortcoming.

456
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,555
Hey, are you good at soccer too?

457
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:37,625
He obviously is, judging from how he's not answering.

458
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:39,235
No, not really.

459
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:45,910
Mi Rae, why are you all quiet?

460
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:47,775
Did all the batting tire you out?

461
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,380
Oh, she's actually quite competitive.

462
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:54,075
She's probably upset because she lost the game.

463
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,315
Is that really why you're upset?

464
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:02,860
Couldn't you have played it half-heartedly?

465
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:04,985
Mi Rae was so stoked earlier.

466
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:08,995
Mi Rae.

467
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,825
Are you...

468
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:13,135
really upset because I beat you?

469
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:18,405
Yes, I was having so much fun. What is this now?

470
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:22,275
Mi Rae, Mi Rae...

471
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,320
Gosh, she's just fooling you guys.

472
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:29,520
You probably couldn't tell because she's a good actress.

473
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:31,320
Woo Young, I'll be off, then.

474
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,520
Hey, I'll see you again soon.

475
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:34,355
Mi Rae, wait up.

476
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,425
I think she's really upset.

477
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:43,465
Did you do something to upset her?

478
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:49,510
It's important to experience being broke...

479
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,070
and getting dumped by a girl.

480
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,380
Everyone goes through that.

481
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,880
That's how you really grow up.

482
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:56,575
You're a full-fledged adult now. You're all grown up.

483
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,375
You can really live on your own now.

484
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:16,795
You said Kyung Seok isn't your type.

485
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:18,825
Yes, what about it?

486
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,310
I should wash these.

487
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,905
Then why are you being like that to Kyung Seok?

488
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,005
What did I do?

489
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:30,805
Like you said, I'm just annoyed because he beat me.

490
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,315
I'm not an idiot.

491
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:39,055
You have feelings for Kyung Seok, don't you?

492
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,455
Hey.

493
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,895
Be honest, will you?

494
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:01,835
You see,

495
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:04,575
I hate being talked about.

496
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,375
I hate it so much.

497
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:10,245
I say that because it's never been about anything good.

498
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,290
People will say that a plastic surgery monster...

499
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:16,455
has a crush on that handsome guy.

500
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:19,995
I can't put up with all the bad-mouthing and gossiping.

501
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:23,465
I just want to live a quiet life.

502
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,875
Kyung Hee has moved into my mom's place.

503
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,115
I see.

504
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,415
Hey.

505
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,630
Why are you angry?

506
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,060
What? I'm not angry.

507
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,230
Then why are you acting this way?

508
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:55,600
How was I supposed to react? Was I supposed to...

509
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:59,365
get all excited and comment on how happy your mom must be?

510
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:05,335
Hey, guys.

511
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:14,980
I did an interview yesterday, and I passed.

512
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,815
I heard you introduced her to this job.

513
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:21,260
Look at these two beautiful ladies.

514
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,455
We won't need to decorate the interior thanks to you two.

515
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,855
They're not materials.

516
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:30,965
What are you saying?

517
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:32,865
Soo A, let's go.

518
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:34,565
I'll see you later.

519
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,190
Did something happen between you and Soo A?

520
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,685
No.

521
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,655
Did she say something about us being friends?

522
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,955
No.

523
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:02,125
I guess she did say something.

524
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,365
Why is he so quick-witted?

525
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:14,005
Can you let me eat with Kyung Seok in private later?

526
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,365
(Ballot Box)

527
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,445
Hello. Thank you.

528
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:55,620
Hello. Hi.

529
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:57,285
Hello.

530
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,615
Hi.

531
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,290
I didn't tell you this yesterday because I was afraid...

532
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:06,060
that you might get angry and not be able to sleep.

533
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:08,395
But Kyung Hee moved into Ms. Na's place.

534
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,025
Why are you telling me that now?

535
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:13,070
I would've slept better if you told me that last night.

536
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:14,565
Pardon?

537
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,235
It's safer for her to be there.

538
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:25,045
Yes, you're right. It is safer there.

539
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,115
Did you sleep well?

540
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,045
Come sit down.

541
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:34,155
Okay.

542
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,900
I haven't cooked in a while, but I made what I could.

543
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:44,695
Did I cook too many stuff?

544
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,195
No.

545
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:51,765
Thank you for the meal.

546
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:06,385
It doesn't taste good, does it?

547
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:09,755
It tastes okay.

548
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:13,555
You don't have to lie. It's obvious that I can't cook.

549
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:16,965
I can't really taste food,

550
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,435
so I rarely cook for myself.

551
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:23,105
But I tried my best by searching the recipes online.

552
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:30,745
It's okay. You don't need to force feed yourself.

553
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:33,915
It doesn't taste so bad.

554
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:39,685
And this tastes better.

555
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:52,970
What should we eat?

556
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,970
There's a nice pork cutlet place nearby,

557
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,805
and there's also a restaurant that sells cold noodles and dumplings.

558
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:58,805
Soo A, what do you prefer?

559
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,535
I want...

560
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,235
Hey, Hae Sung.

561
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,080
Can you work during lunchtime?

562
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:07,145
We have more customers than usual today.

563
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:08,620
Sure.

564
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:11,685
I'd like one more volunteer.

565
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,530
I can eat lunch a little later.

566
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:26,395
Okay. Thank you. Let's go.

567
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:40,575
I'm going to order pork cutlet. What about you?

568
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,645
Me too.

569
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:45,385
- Two pork cutlets, please. - Okay.

570
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:51,060
I really like the working environment here.

571
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,900
The people are nice as well.

572
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,495
Why did you come here?

573
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,300
I heard you guys are working together,

574
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:59,265
so I figured it'd be nice to join.

575
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:02,765
Why are you so interested in us?

576
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,640
What do you mean?

577
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,805
I know you're not that slow-witted.

578
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,280
What?

579
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:12,010
As for this product,

580
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:15,650
the sink is facing the living room, not the wall.

581
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:18,150
So it enables you to talk to your kids...

582
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,715
or watch TV as you do the dishes.

583
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,660
And on both sides...

584
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:26,525
I know you didn't really like me at first.

585
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:29,330
But we resolved our misunderstanding,

586
00:39:29,337 --> 00:39:31,995
so I thought we were slowly becoming close friends.

587
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:33,865
Was that not the case for you?

588
00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:35,935
That's enough.

589
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:39,480
I want to be good friends with you.

590
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,175
I know you don't like me.

591
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,715
What do you gain from doing this?

592
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:49,815
I don't understand.

593
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,620
Are you going to act like you don't know anything again?

594
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,255
Kyung Seok.

595
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,560
Why do you always think of me so negatively?

596
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,325
Because that's how I perceive you.

597
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,165
That's sad.

598
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:08,335
I only behaved the way I did because I really wanted to be your friend.

599
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:12,735
But I guess you think I'm pretentious and a liar.

600
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,950
If you're annoyed because it feels as if...

601
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,945
I'm clinging onto you,

602
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,375
I get it.

603
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:24,915
I won't come to work starting from tomorrow.

604
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,455
Enjoy your meal.

605
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,675
Mi Rae.

606
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,710
What's your relationship with Kyung Seok?

607
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,550
- Pardon? - I mean,

608
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:55,345
you guys look really close.

609
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:57,890
We're just friends.

610
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:00,555
Then is Soo A his girlfriend?

611
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:02,215
No.

612
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,455
Are you dating anyone?

613
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,525
No.

614
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,895
Eat up.

615
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,810
The seventh local election will soon...

616
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,670
come to an end at 6pm.

617
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:20,240
- Did you vote? - Yes.

618
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:22,910
Many young people participate actively in voting these days.

619
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,680
- Here's... - It's a good thing.

620
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:26,120
the current status.

621
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,080
I wonder who'll win for Gangnam-gu.

622
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,320
Let's first look into the overall voting rate.

623
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:32,520
Everyone's so crazy about Gangnam.

624
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:35,615
Gangnam should always set a good example for everything.

625
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,560
People call my daughter "Gangnam Beauty".

626
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:41,095
And that makes me more interested in Gangnam.

627
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,970
Now, let's move onto the local voting rates.

628
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,840
She's my daughter.

629
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Let's check out the district with the highest voting rate.

630
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,670
Daejeon City has a voting rate of 64 percent.

631
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:51,805
It exceeded 60 percent.

632
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:55,135
That's the estimated amount of votes for that area.

633
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:59,050
Now, let's move onto the traffic.

634
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:01,375
In the morning, it will...

635
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:09,315
- Did you eat? - Yes.

636
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:14,995
Excuse me.

637
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,225
Yes.

638
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:20,535
I want a Gangnam-style haircut.

639
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:23,405
What are you talking about?

640
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,165
What kind of style is that?

641
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:28,175
You're the hairdresser, so you should know.

642
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,150
But why do you want that all of a sudden?

643
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:33,245
Has something gotten into you?

644
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:36,545
Well, to be honest, yes.

645
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:41,385
People call Mi Rae "Gangnam Beauty".

646
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,885
And I kind of want people to think she takes after me.

647
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:47,460
She's tall and slim just like you.

648
00:42:47,468 --> 00:42:50,425
Bring her here sometime. Let's see how much she's changed.

649
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:54,235
Okay, I'll bring her over next time.

650
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,445
It must be tiring to be so good-looking.

651
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:07,515
It seems like Soo A has a thing for you.

652
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:10,515
But do you prefer girls like Mi Rae than Soo A?

653
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:14,655
I'd definitely choose Soo A over Mi Rae.

654
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:21,925
But then again, some people care more about the physique.

655
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,425
If a girl had Soo A's face and Mi Rae's body, she'd be perfect.

656
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,945
I didn't get to eat with Kyung Seok.

657
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:42,650
What?

658
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:45,585
He must've felt uncomfortable to eat with me without you.

659
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:00,465
By the way,

660
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:03,265
I'm curious about something.

661
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:08,080
Mi Rae seems like she's done plastic surgeries on every part of her face.

662
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,805
Is her chest fake too?

663
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:16,135
I'm curious about something.

664
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,960
Mi Rae seems like she's done plastic surgeries on every part of her face.

665
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,675
Is her chest fake too?

666
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:31,685
Hey.

667
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,625
Are you crazy?

668
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:37,625
Have you gone insane?

669
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:45,280
Scumbag.

670
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,550
What's wrong with what I asked?

671
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:50,090
What's wrong with talking about her plastic surgeries?

672
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,135
Let me go.

673
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:56,745
What's going on?

674
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:01,345
Be quiet.

675
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:07,040
Kyung Seok, don't.

676
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:11,055
And I'm not interested in someone who looks so cheap.

677
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,410
- Kyung Seok. - Gosh.

678
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:17,250
Goodness.

679
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:18,835
Kyung Seok.

680
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:22,520
- Kyung Seok. - Kyung Seok.

681
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:24,220
- You punk. - Kyung Seok.

682
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,505
- Kyung Seok. - What's wrong with you?

683
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:29,020
This punk hit me first.

684
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:31,130
I got beaten up by him.

685
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:32,900
If you have hit back at least once,

686
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,245
it's both to blame though you may have a different degree of charges.

687
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:37,530
You all seem like students,

688
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:39,440
so talk it out and make up.

689
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,555
I said I wouldn't...

690
00:45:42,543 --> 00:45:46,340
unless he bows his head and apologizes.

691
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:50,050
Unless he bows and apologizes sincerely,

692
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,510
I'll sue him.

693
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:54,750
It seems like you've hit him a lot more,

694
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,975
so why don't you apologize and settle it out?

695
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,945
I'm sorry.

696
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,285
I should've killed him so that he couldn't even run his mouth.

697
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:14,740
Has he gone crazy or what?

698
00:46:14,742 --> 00:46:16,440
- Sit down. - Hey.

699
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:19,025
Do you want to be an ex-convict?

700
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:24,935
You jerk.

701
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:28,005
Shouldn't you be apologizing to me?

702
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:30,390
If you have at least the slightest sense of guilt,

703
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,575
let him go.

704
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:37,060
I don't want to.

705
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,545
What?

706
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:42,315
I was going to tell you,

707
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:45,215
but he tried to hit on me too.

708
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:49,385
Don't worry. The company will take care of this matter.

709
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,840
Go back to work.

710
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,395
Okay.

711
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:55,925
I should've fired him sooner.

712
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,575
Yes, I thought the room could use a bit more decoration.

713
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,775
Tell me if there's a specific design in mind.

714
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:10,175
Okay, bye.

715
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:26,525
("Na Hye Sung Appointed as the CEO of Kellun")

716
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:30,135
Are you looking for something?

717
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,150
I'm just looking around.

718
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:35,665
Take a look around and tell me if you have any questions.

719
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,530
- Excuse me. - Yes?

720
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,560
Doesn't a guy named Do Kyung Seok work here?

721
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:48,715
Kyung Seok?

722
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:53,385
Yes, but he's not here right now. What's the matter?

723
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,870
I'm his mom. Did he go somewhere?

724
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:59,125
Oh, hello.

725
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:02,725
I'm Hyun Soo A, his friend in college.

726
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:05,465
Is that right?

727
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:08,905
But he's...

728
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,245
Why? Did something happen?

729
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:15,175
Yes.

730
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:19,060
He was taken to a police station because he got into a fight.

731
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,585
What?

732
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,685
Why would he?

733
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:24,685
Whom did he fight with?

734
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,485
With another part-timer here,

735
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:31,940
he got into a fight because of a girl named Kang Mi Rae.

736
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:33,540
Mi Rae?

737
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:35,395
Do you know her?

738
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:37,295
Yes.

739
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:40,135
She lives in Kyung Seok's neighborhood.

740
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,005
I see.

741
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,990
How impressive, Mi Rae.

742
00:48:46,994 --> 00:48:50,215
Do you know which police station it is?

743
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:52,415
Please give me a minute.

744
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:59,085
Good.

745
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,970
I've hurt you with words, so I'll apologize the same way.

746
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:05,070
Mi Rae, I'm sorry, satisfied?

747
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:07,440
That's not an attitude of someone who's apologizing.

748
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,265
This punk hit me, so he should kneel down.

749
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:12,750
Or let me punch him 10 times.

750
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:15,550
All right. Do as you want because I'll go by the law too.

751
00:49:15,556 --> 00:49:17,035
What?

752
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:22,945
Hello, sir. This is Mi Rae.

753
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,615
I'm still at the police station, but I have a favor to ask you.

754
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,455
What?

755
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:35,085
I see.

756
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:37,795
Okay, thank you.

757
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:42,795
He said you're fired.

758
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,250
The manager says he'll testify...

759
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:49,520
how you sexually harassed me if he has to.

760
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:52,350
Should I file a lawsuit?

761
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,860
No.

762
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,375
Hold on.

763
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:57,775
What are you going to do?

764
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:02,015
Kyung Seok.

765
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,555
Do you hit people?

766
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,195
Ms. Na.

767
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:16,325
I went to the store and heard about it.

768
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:20,805
How could you not even call me in this kind of situation?

769
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:30,130
Next is the exit poll in Daejin.

770
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,885
66.7 percent for Candidate Number One Do Sang Won.

771
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:37,130
- Yes! - 23.2 percent for...

772
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:40,200
- Do Sang Won. - Do Sang Won.

773
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:43,510
- Do Sang Won. - Thank you.

774
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,110
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor. - Thank you.

775
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:47,340
Now, take some rest in your house while they count all the votes.

776
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:48,910
All right.

777
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:52,150
I was worried your children might cause trouble before the election,

778
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:53,380
but I'm glad they didn't.

779
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:55,420
I didn't raise them like that.

780
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,450
They wouldn't cause trouble.

781
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:58,450
- Sure thing. - Mayor of Daejin,

782
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,120
- See you. - Do Sang Won.

783
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:06,130
- Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang Won. - Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang Won.

784
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:08,245
- Mayor of Daejin... - Mayor of Daejin...

785
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,185
He did deserve a beating.

786
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,800
Still, you shouldn't punish him...

787
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:17,755
in a way which could harm you as well.

788
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:20,965
Mi Rae must've gotten hurt a lot.

789
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:22,965
Are you okay?

790
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,735
Yes?

791
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,320
Yes.

792
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,465
You must've been really startled.

793
00:51:34,528 --> 00:51:37,130
I thought I'd be okay...

794
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,915
if I thought I was.

795
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:46,015
I guess I wasn't okay.

796
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,565
Mi Rae.

797
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:58,395
You haven't done anything wrong today.

798
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:01,135
People like him are wrong for having such thoughts.

799
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,675
Right.

800
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,745
Please excuse me now.

801
00:52:16,036 --> 00:52:17,855
I'm okay.

802
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,995
Don't go alone.

803
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:27,295
Let's eat and go together.

804
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:29,725
Right, Mi Rae.

805
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:31,595
Go home together.

806
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,275
Let's go.

807
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,385
Hey, Kyung Hee.

808
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,655
It looks like you'll have to have dinner alone. I'm sorry.

809
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,825
There's some fried rice in the fridge.

810
00:52:56,076 --> 00:52:57,695
I'm sorry.

811
00:52:58,445 --> 00:52:59,980
(Where did Lovely Do go?)

812
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,410
(Will she finally reveal her face?)

813
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:02,510
Ta-da.

814
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:04,010
(She's so cute. Is that really Lovely Do?)

815
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,610
(Why has she been hiding her face?)

816
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,020
(She's pretty enough to join a girl group.)

817
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,380
Yes, that's right.

818
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,935
I had no choice but to do this because I don't have my mask today.

819
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:14,490
And I won't be eating in my room today.

820
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:16,060
As you can see, I'm outside now.

821
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:19,015
I'll host my show while enjoying this night view here.

822
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:20,700
What's for dinner today?

823
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,200
(Don't wear the mask from now on.)

824
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:23,330
I'll have fried rice.

825
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:25,070
(This feels like a totally different show today.)

826
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,740
(That fried rice looks so good.)

827
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,685
This fried rice is special.

828
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:30,695
My mom made it.

829
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:34,665
Then I'll dig in now.

830
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:36,850
I'll take a big spoonful and...

831
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,750
(Is there lobster in the fried rice?)

832
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:40,680
(Has your mom never cooked for you before?)

833
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:42,480
(I bet. Her mom probably never does any housework.)

834
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:44,290
This is my first time tasting my mom's fried rice.

835
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,850
(Mom's fried rice is the best.)

836
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:47,020
I'd rate this...

837
00:53:47,027 --> 00:53:48,390
(I want to see what her mom looks like.)

838
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,860
(No, frozen fried rice is the best.)

839
00:53:49,863 --> 00:53:50,890
100 out of 100.

840
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:52,945
(This is making me crave my mom's food.)

841
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:57,515
There's a lot of meat in it.

842
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,815
There are raisins too.

843
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:33,815
Thank you for the dinner.

844
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:37,300
Mi Rae, could you wait for us in the car?

845
00:55:37,304 --> 00:55:40,115
I have to talk to Kyung Seok about something.

846
00:55:40,273 --> 00:55:41,785
Sure.

847
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:51,295
You got yourself in trouble,

848
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:54,465
but I could act as your guardian for the first time because of that.

849
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:56,805
I must say, it doesn't feel that bad.

850
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:01,020
From now on, make sure you call me if anything happens.

851
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:03,575
- Okay. - And...

852
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,575
about your tuition...

853
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:09,345
Could I take care of it for you?

854
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:12,300
It's not like I'm a stranger to you.

855
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:13,825
I'm...

856
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:16,485
your mom after all.

857
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:19,025
I hope you let me pay it.

858
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:26,135
Okay.

859
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,265
Seriously?

860
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:31,835
I was so anxious, thinking you'd say no right way.

861
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:39,845
- Thanks. - For what?

862
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:42,415
I'll...

863
00:56:43,436 --> 00:56:45,015
make sure I pay you back.

864
00:56:55,715 --> 00:56:57,265
Thanks for today.

865
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:01,405
But from now on, don't punch people because of me.

866
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:04,675
Don't worry.

867
00:57:07,627 --> 00:57:09,505
I'm not mad at you.

868
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,400
I'm just frustrated that all I can do is punch people.

869
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:20,215
I don't understand why those jerks have to gossip about you.

870
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,855
You must still be all shaken up.

871
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:28,365
You should go in.

872
00:57:31,217 --> 00:57:32,895
Okay, thanks.

873
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:36,205
You should get going. I'll head in, then.

874
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:42,905
Mi Rae.

875
00:57:57,711 --> 00:57:59,295
If...

876
00:58:01,915 --> 00:58:04,095
something like that happens to you again,

877
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,665
I'll get involved without punching someone.

878
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:14,475
That will be okay, right?

879
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:22,345
If you keep saying things like that,

880
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:26,285
I'll get the wrong idea.

881
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:29,655
About what?

882
00:58:30,977 --> 00:58:32,925
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

883
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:41,805
Never mind.

884
00:58:42,188 --> 00:58:44,705
Get going. I'm going to head in.

885
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:57,955
Do you have...

886
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,395
any feelings for me?

887
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:06,655
What?

888
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:35,240
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

889
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:36,870
Mi Rae, are you free on Wednesday?

890
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:38,640
Just the two of us. I have something to tell you.

891
00:59:38,645 --> 00:59:41,180
If you think that we can go back to how we were before...

892
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,480
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

893
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:43,680
Is something bothering you?

894
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:45,810
I think I'm just scared.

895
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:48,380
He's way too good for me.

896
00:59:48,388 --> 00:59:49,620
He's too perfect.

897
00:59:49,622 --> 00:59:52,135
Hey, I told you that enough is enough.

898
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:54,490
Why must you mess everything up for no reason?

899
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,220
You still don't feel anything?

900
00:59:56,229 --> 00:59:58,515
If you're having a hard time because of me,

901
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:00,530
I shouldn't do it.

902
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:02,685
But I'll wait for you.
