1
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:15,995
I know that it won't be easy. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,135
But do it for me, please.

3
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,475
She's Kyung Seok's mom?

4
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:25,175
Yes.

5
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:28,445
I guess good looks are genetically inherited.

6
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,875
Are his parents divorced, then?

7
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:38,155
Why doesn't he want to see his mom though?

8
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:40,655
I don't know.

9
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:45,095
So what are you going to do?

10
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:51,535
I'd do it if I were you.

11
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:54,705
She saved your life, so what's there you can't do for her?

12
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,705
Don't say that.

13
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,045
It's hard for me to say no to her as well.

14
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,175
So don't say such a thing.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,615
It's none of my business.

16
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,725
Who's there?

17
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:22,895
Hey!

18
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:33,105
Hello? Someone's been following us.

19
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,820
(Police)

20
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:01,105
Stop.

21
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:03,305
Stop right there!

22
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:05,335
Stop!

23
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:27,480
You're one fearless young lady. Why did you follow him like that?

24
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,780
What if he was actually a bad guy?

25
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:32,350
Someone has been following me for the last few days,

26
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,105
but there was no one whenever I turned around.

27
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:38,405
That wasn't me.

28
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:40,605
I saw her for the first time today.

29
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,975
I thought she could be a celebrity, so I just wanted to check.

30
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:46,515
Then why did you run away?

31
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,845
She started chasing me, so I got scared.

32
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,555
He's cowardly.

33
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:56,025
He'd never harm anyone.

34
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,480
In any case,

35
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,280
he followed her at this late hour and gave her the wrong impression.

36
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:02,525
She must've been so scared.

37
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,265
You punk, aren't I right?

38
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,335
I apologize.

39
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,205
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:15,275
All right. It's okay, so don't cry.

41
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:17,515
Who is it?

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,975
What kind of jerk did it?

43
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:21,615
How can I help you, sir?

44
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:23,485
Dad.

45
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,585
He's your dad?

46
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,310
(Police)

47
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,780
- Take care. - Don't do that ever again.

48
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,065
- I'm sorry. - I apologize.

49
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:40,365
- Goodbye. - I'm sorry again.

50
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:49,405
Yes, my dad is here.

51
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,675
Yes, don't worry.

52
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:53,615
Okay.

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,985
Sir, are you saying you're the one who has been tailing her?

54
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:09,265
I just wanted to make sure she gets home safely every night.

55
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:14,405
Is he really your father?

56
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:17,305
- Yes. - Sir, I need your ID, please.

57
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:19,475
I must confirm that you are indeed her guardian.

58
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,245
Bring it over here now.

59
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,025
Have you had dinner yet?

60
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:38,055
Of course. It's late.

61
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,965
Mr. Kang Tae Sik, you've been reported missing.

62
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:44,895
- Pardon me? - What?

63
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:47,935
Well, this is...

64
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,705
(Name of Missing Person)

65
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:52,775
The report...

66
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:57,275
was filed by someone named Na Eun Shim. It looks like she's your wife.

67
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,075
- Dad. - Goodness.

68
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,855
Don't you dare run away again.

69
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,585
If you do, I'll really divorce you.

70
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:23,065
Why did you run away from home?

71
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,505
Mom said you were doing fine.

72
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:30,475
I am doing fine.

73
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,415
Go in.

74
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,170
You should come in.

75
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,955
No, it's okay. It's getting late, so you should go in.

76
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,895
Mr. Kang!

77
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,995
- Long time no see, Hyun Jung. - You should come up.

78
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,350
It's okay. Next time.

79
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:53,690
Come on, you're already here. You can't leave like this.

80
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,805
Please come in for a cup of tea. Let's go.

81
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:17,455
Hey, go and have a seat.

82
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:22,295
Go.

83
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,945
You girls keep your place clean and neat.

84
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:43,585
You will go home, right?

85
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:46,715
All right.

86
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,925
- It's still hot. - Oh, okay.

87
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:51,655
Thanks.

88
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:55,495
It's hot!

89
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,095
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

90
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:00,720
She told you that it's still hot.

91
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:02,535
Mr. Kang, are you okay?

92
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,705
I'm... I'm okay.

93
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,805
- I'm fine. - You don't seem okay.

94
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:21,985
I should get going.

95
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,695
You're leaving already?

96
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,810
Mom.

97
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,450
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:32,050
My goodness.

99
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:34,020
Let's go. Come on.

100
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:36,320
You made me worry so much. What happened?

101
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,305
Let's talk later.

102
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:42,560
- You should follow them outside. - Okay.

103
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,175
Go on.

104
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,300
Call me when you get home.

105
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:52,085
Okay, go back inside.

106
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:56,410
I came all the way here, but you won't even let me...

107
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:57,995
talk to my own daughter or drink a cup of water.

108
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,340
Were you curious of Mi Rae?

109
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,865
Then you should've come home. What kind of nonsense is this?

110
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,220
And what was the 5,000 dollars? Was that my alimony?

111
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,350
Are we getting a divorce?

112
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,235
Why would I give you alimony?

113
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,105
It was for the hospital fee.

114
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:16,060
Where did you get 5,000 dollars?

115
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,375
Do you have a separate savings account that I don't know of? Honey!

116
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,035
Can we meet tomorrow?

117
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,675
Hasn't she called yet?

118
00:09:00,443 --> 00:09:01,885
Let's not talk about that.

119
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:17,105
(Genes of Hankook)

120
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,860
(Genes of Hankook)

121
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,405
I hope Twice comes.

122
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:24,415
Twice.

123
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:27,745
Soo A.

124
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,430
Hello.

125
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,240
You and Kyung Seok need to wait the tables at the street bar.

126
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:34,455
Pardon?

127
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,510
- We'll serve tables as well. - That's right.

128
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:38,655
I don't think they'll ask you guys to wait tables.

129
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,135
Why do I need to wait tables?

130
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,565
Because you're the face of our department.

131
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,520
I just volunteered to help out the face of our department.

132
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:53,005
Why would she hold me back?

133
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,400
Can you stop hitting on Soo A?

134
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,845
If you want to become like Kyung Seok, do it properly.

135
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:06,415
Did you do well on your test?

136
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,055
Yes.

137
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,235
Would you like to have a drink?

138
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,215
(Episode 5: The handsome guy's counterattack)

139
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:36,915
Here.

140
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,525
What's wrong?

141
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:53,995
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,520
For what?

143
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,205
It wasn't your fault...

144
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:01,245
that you had to meet her, but I took it out on you.

145
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:09,415
Weren't you mad?

146
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,755
I have quite a big heart.

147
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:53,925
What are you doing?

148
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:00,435
Please don't get angry.

149
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:08,145
Do you really not want to talk to your mom?

150
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,585
Is this why you asked me to drink with you?

151
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:28,065
I didn't know you meant that you're nosy...

152
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:32,195
when you told me that you have a big heart.

153
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,015
I know this can't compare to what you've been through,

154
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:50,015
but I wasn't able to see my dad for a long time as well.

155
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:53,585
My dad didn't want me to get plastic surgery.

156
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:56,240
But I lied that I'm going abroad for language studies...

157
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,725
and got surgery during that time.

158
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,465
And I met him on the day of our entrance ceremony.

159
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:09,805
Dad.

160
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:12,505
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,075
I don't know you.

162
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,875
But he got angry and just left.

163
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:35,425
The reason family members end up hating each other...

164
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,635
is because they feel upset.

165
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,065
Where's Dad?

166
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:45,905
Well,

167
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,445
just because. I miss you two.

168
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:59,185
Hello?

169
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:00,855
What's wrong?

170
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:04,025
No, it's nothing.

171
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:10,225
Okay, I'll call you again.

172
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:11,965
Bye.

173
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,975
He must've suffered a lot until now.

174
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,285
Way more than I did.

175
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,665
You've grown up so much.

176
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,675
How do I look?

177
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,900
I was going to doll myself up once I became pretty,

178
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:01,515
but I just didn't have the money.

179
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:06,985
I can't believe you kept that much money all to yourself.

180
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,555
Look at me. Do I look weird?

181
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:13,825
What about this one?

182
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:15,910
Do you not like this one either?

183
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,520
I reconciled with Mi Rae, not you.

184
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,520
That's seriously enough.

185
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:23,720
Would you have let her undergo surgery if I told you beforehand?

186
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:26,075
Even if I had to go back in time, I'd still let her get surgery.

187
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:29,975
Look.

188
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,245
Look at how cheerful she is.

189
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,285
See? Look.

190
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,615
New face, new face

191
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,255
She told me that everyone likes her...

192
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,425
and that she's having so much fun.

193
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,965
And that made me tear up.

194
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:59,535
Everyone ends up liking Mi Rae. Who wouldn't?

195
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,125
So are you satisfied?

196
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:21,525
- What? - You lied to get plastic surgery.

197
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,865
Well, not exactly.

198
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,005
Why?

199
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,975
Because it's so obvious that I got plastic surgery.

200
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,385
You also sneered at me.

201
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,215
I did?

202
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:47,985
When?

203
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,040
Forget it if you can't remember.

204
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:52,295
No, tell me.

205
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,195
You can't go home before you tell me.

206
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:00,235
Tell me. When did I sneer at you?

207
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:05,435
Back when...

208
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,705
we were at the bus stop.

209
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:26,895
You laughed at me.

210
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,420
You probably don't even remember it,

211
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,195
- but I was so... - I remember.

212
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:38,275
I remember that day vividly,

213
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:42,175
but I never laughed at you.

214
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,675
I was looking at your feet, not your face.

215
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:58,625
Your feet made me laugh.

216
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,095
I had never seen anyone dance like that.

217
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,635
That's why I asked you at the orientation.

218
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:08,105
I could tell it was you.

219
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:12,235
I think...

220
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:16,275
I smiled only once throughout my middle school years.

221
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:23,345
And it was because of you.

222
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:44,905
Mi Rae, can't you walk straight?

223
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:50,805
I'm walking straight.

224
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,545
You shouldn't drink if you're a lightweight.

225
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,700
I have to drink to find out how much I can handle.

226
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,485
How will I know if I never drink?

227
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,775
There was a car coming.

228
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:27,815
Right.

229
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:30,615
Thanks.

230
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:50,805
Are you all right?

231
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,705
Yes.

232
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:54,575
But...

233
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,945
can I see that again?

234
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,055
This.

235
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,995
I forgot how to do it.

236
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:14,725
Wasn't this it?

237
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:27,475
But the thing is,

238
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:30,445
even if I believe that you never laughed at me...

239
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,715
Why did you say something about my perfume?

240
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,815
When we were cleaning together.

241
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:42,625
You asked if I was wearing perfume. You wanted to pick on me, right?

242
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,325
That perfume...

243
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:50,325
It's the scent that I hate the most.

244
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,065
That woman's perfume.

245
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:57,805
Hey.

246
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,405
Are you wearing perfume?

247
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:03,975
She always stared at herself in the mirror...

248
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,875
and sprayed that perfume all over her.

249
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,415
Like a crazy person.

250
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:26,965
Then one day,

251
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,005
she abandoned her children and left.

252
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,555
I wasn't trying to pick on you.

253
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,475
But the thing is,

254
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:10,145
back then...

255
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:18,885
Shall I take you home?

256
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:20,715
No, it's fine.

257
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,455
Well, then I'm...

258
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,395
I'm off. Bye.

259
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:07,350
You're Kelun's very first Korean model.

260
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:09,520
Thank you very much for accepting our offer.

261
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:11,265
We're honored to work with the best actress.

262
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:12,660
The honor is mine.

263
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:15,705
And I really enjoyed the dinner as well. Thank you.

264
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:17,075
I'm glad to hear that.

265
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:20,160
To tell you the truth, my taste buds are quite dull.

266
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,615
Really? Why?

267
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:27,585
I guess I'm getting old. Many things aren't how they used to be.

268
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:34,525
How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?

269
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,565
- I'm 47. - My gosh.

270
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:39,295
I assumed you'd be much younger.

271
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:42,835
Don't say that. Now that you know, you'll think I look my age.

272
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:46,505
Which skincare clinic do you go to?

273
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:50,005
I don't go to any.

274
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:01,000
Find out which skincare clinic Ms. Na goes to.

275
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,125
- I'm going to go there from now on. - Okay.

276
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:08,895
(Soo Hyun, Professor Park, Ms. Kim Min Ji)

277
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:13,995
(Kang Mi Rae)

278
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:17,435
Hi, Mi Rae.

279
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,675
I'm sorry. I tried to talk to him about it, but...

280
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:26,375
No, it's okay. I asked you, knowing how hard it'd be.

281
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:27,815
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,585
Don't worry. Please just forget about it.

283
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:34,400
But we should meet up anyway.

284
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:35,855
You can visit me at my office.

285
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:39,225
- All right. - Okay.

286
00:24:40,382 --> 00:24:41,795
Good night.

287
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:05,355
Mi Rae, can't you walk straight?

288
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:10,525
I'm walking straight.

289
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:14,425
You shouldn't drink if you're a lightweight.

290
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,465
I have to drink to find out how much I can handle.

291
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:39,055
(To: Na Hye Sung)

292
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:42,825
Hey, Mi Rae. Mi Rae.

293
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,255
I have big news.

294
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,225
The rapper wants to see me.

295
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:48,510
- Seriously? - Yes.

296
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,180
I sent him the lyrics that I wrote,

297
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:51,695
and he asked me to visit his studio.

298
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:55,135
What should I do? I haven't had any time to practice.

299
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,435
Oh Hyun Jung!

300
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,260
Hey, are you mocking me now?

301
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:01,805
Of course not.

302
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:04,090
Gosh, I have to practice more.

303
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,515
I never laughed at you.

304
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,685
I was looking at your feet, not your face.

305
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:12,155
Your feet made me laugh.

306
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:15,485
I had never seen anyone dance like that.

307
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:19,195
I wasn't trying to pick on you.

308
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,565
I misjudged Kyung Seok.

309
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:47,355
Are you all right?

310
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,155
Hey.

311
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,025
Hey.

312
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:57,495
You crazy jerk.

313
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:03,205
Kyung Seok has never been...

314
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:05,635
mean to me.

315
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:22,085
I must be crazy.

316
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:25,455
I smiled only once...

317
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:28,155
throughout my middle school years.

318
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:31,295
And it was because of you.

319
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:47,230
A college festival is all about having crowded street bars.

320
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,070
Why won't they let us sell alcohol?

321
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,170
It was just a light notification, so can't we just sell it?

322
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:54,910
No, they even told us to buy food from nearby markets...

323
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,355
because they don't want us violating the Food Sanitation Act.

324
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:58,710
Hello.

325
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:01,095
Then how are we going to make money?

326
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:02,625
I know.

327
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:05,665
We need to make enough for the second half of the semester.

328
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:10,535
We'll just have to do a lot of PR.

329
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:11,875
Okay.

330
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:14,805
I heard there's a really pretty girl among our freshmen this year.

331
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,490
I think her name was Hyun Soo A.

332
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:18,915
Yes, she's one of a kind.

333
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:22,170
There's this good-looking guy named Do Kyung Seok as well.

334
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,685
- Do Kyung Seok? - Yes.

335
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:25,600
I don't think he'll do it.

336
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:28,610
Why? Is he the type that doesn't listen to his seniors?

337
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,540
He's the guy who beat Chan Woo up.

338
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:35,425
Oh, that's him? My gosh.

339
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,995
I love him already.

340
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:45,435
We can make Soo A and Kyung Seok wait tables.

341
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:47,305
Who else can we choose?

342
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:49,275
Ji Hyo?

343
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,160
We should add 1 or 2 more people.

344
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,200
Eun, you should notify them and bring them to the meeting later.

345
00:28:55,203 --> 00:28:56,485
Okay.

346
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,100
What do you think about Mi Rae?

347
00:28:58,106 --> 00:28:59,655
- Mi Rae? - Yes.

348
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:01,615
You know that girl.

349
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:04,585
- What? - New face.

350
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:07,610
Oh, her? She's beautiful.

351
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,725
- Gosh, of course. - Yes.

352
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,920
She's very pretty.

353
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,395
Then let's add Mi Rae to the list.

354
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,805
Nice.

355
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:38,025
What's wrong with me? He's not even that attractive.

356
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:42,925
All that's changed is that he wasn't such a jerk after all.

357
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,865
That's all. But why...

358
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:14,725
What's wrong with me? He's not even that attractive.

359
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:19,635
All that's changed is that he wasn't such a jerk after all.

360
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:23,565
That's all. But why...

361
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:35,445
- Be careful. - Watch out.

362
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:52,135
Did you get home safely?

363
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:54,295
Yes, of course.

364
00:30:55,023 --> 00:30:56,220
Did you sleep well?

365
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,805
I must be crazy. Why would I ask him that?

366
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:00,890
What are your plans for the festival?

367
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:03,030
- The festival? - Are you going to come to school?

368
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:06,575
I'm not sure. I'm a little busy these days.

369
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,030
You're busy?

370
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:11,145
Yes, everyone's busy. I'm sure you're busy as well.

371
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,015
I'm not busy.

372
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:15,185
I see.

373
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,795
Lucky you. I'll be off now.

374
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:25,335
Kyung Seok.

375
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,890
Would you like to wait tables on the day of the festival?

376
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,150
No.

377
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:31,465
Okay.

378
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,945
I was wondering if you'd like to wait tables at the festival.

379
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,760
Min A told me about that.

380
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,715
I guess I have no choice but to help out.

381
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,300
I heard it's mandatory for people who are pretty.

382
00:31:45,306 --> 00:31:48,270
The seniors asked if you could do it as well. Are you interested?

383
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:49,525
What?

384
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:52,410
Is the festival this week?

385
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,640
Isn't it next week?

386
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:55,365
Oh, is it next week?

387
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:57,765
Okay, I'll do it.

388
00:31:58,086 --> 00:31:59,880
What about Mi Rae?

389
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:01,635
I need to ask her.

390
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,465
Yes, she should join as well.

391
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:15,915
I was planning to sell scented candles at the festival.

392
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:20,255
Can you do that after you wait tables?

393
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:23,885
Can't you just put out an announcement and gather volunteers?

394
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:25,595
Well...

395
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:29,165
The seniors picked the candidates.

396
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,565
It's driving me crazy.

397
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:35,950
And they want me to do it?

398
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:39,005
Yes, they picked you, Soo A, and Ji Hyo.

399
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:42,545
Gosh, why can't we just get volunteers?

400
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,545
Hey, I'll do it.

401
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:51,100
What? How long were you in there?

402
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:54,485
I think it's been about 10 minutes. I have constipation these days.

403
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:03,410
They just want the pretty ones to wait tables,

404
00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:04,925
and I can't because I'm not pretty.

405
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,450
Hey, you guys.

406
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:10,735
Hey.

407
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,945
Did Eun ask you to wait tables at the festival yet?

408
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:23,200
Yes, I told her that I'll think about it.

409
00:33:23,204 --> 00:33:25,100
Come on, let's do it. I'll be doing it.

410
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,555
If you refuse, it'll only burden Eun.

411
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,855
Right.

412
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,640
I guess I should do it.

413
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:34,295
Yes. I think it'll be fun.

414
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,090
By the way, about you and Kyung Seok...

415
00:33:46,094 --> 00:33:47,290
Yes?

416
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:49,830
I thought you guys didn't know each other at first...

417
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:51,675
because you acted like total strangers.

418
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,075
Well...

419
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,345
We weren't that close.

420
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:58,815
- Really? - Yes.

421
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:03,085
Look at this.

422
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:05,225
My gosh, she's pretty.

423
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:07,740
I know her.

424
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:09,750
How do you know her?

425
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:11,810
I don't know her in person.

426
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,450
She's the prettiest girl in Hankook University.

427
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:14,665
What?

428
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:18,165
She really is pretty.

429
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,175
Why would someone like her like your photo?

430
00:34:22,297 --> 00:34:25,645
Because she liked the photo I uploaded, you punk.

431
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,330
I'm going to capture this.

432
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:29,600
The prettiest girl in Hankook University liked my photo.

433
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:31,330
I think she liked it by mistake.

434
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:32,815
No, she didn't.

435
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:34,570
Stop it.

436
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:35,940
- Hello. - Hello.

437
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,470
- Are you guys having a meeting? - Yes.

438
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:39,855
Woo Young, you need to bring a lot of friends to the festival.

439
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm not sure if I'll have time.

440
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:43,250
I need to go room searching when I don't have classes.

441
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,310
Are you moving?

442
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:46,920
Yes, the landlord wants to raise the deposit and monthly rent.

443
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,220
- Really? That's absurd. - Yes.

444
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:51,220
- Did you plan some stuff? - No, not yet.

445
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:53,260
- Hello. - Hey, you guys.

446
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:55,235
- Hello. - Hi.

447
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:56,930
- Keep up the good work. - Okay.

448
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,130
- Bye. - Bye.

449
00:34:58,132 --> 00:34:59,675
- See you, Woo Young. - Bye.

450
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:03,470
Gosh, the room brightened up as soon as you guys entered.

451
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:05,270
- Thank you. - My gosh.

452
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:06,970
Their names are Mi Rae, Soo A, and Ji Hyo.

453
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,325
- You met Eun before, right? - Yes.

454
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,510
- Hey, you guys. - Hello.

455
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:13,780
- You guys should sit down. - Okay.

456
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,525
- Take a seat. - Sit down.

457
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,965
She looks so cute.

458
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:21,695
Her eyes are round and big. And her face...

459
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,560
How could you come later than the waitresses?

460
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:28,220
Be easy on her. She flunked class to come here.

461
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:29,505
My gosh.

462
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,075
Some of you don't know each other, so let's all introduce ourselves.

463
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:34,815
- You go first. - Okay.

464
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:38,670
Hi, I'm Jo Jung Yeob, the head of the junior year.

465
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,000
- Hello. - Hello.

466
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:41,740
You guys all know me, right? I'm Ko Ye Na.

467
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,470
I'm Kwon Yoon Byul, the head of the sophomore year.

468
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:45,125
She was a girl?

469
00:35:47,348 --> 00:35:50,650
You guys all thought she was a guy, right?

470
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:53,920
See? Everyone who sees you for the first time thinks of you as a guy.

471
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,165
Next.

472
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,520
Why aren't you introducing yourself?

473
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:58,590
You're going to make fun of me again, aren't you?

474
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,405
No. Go on.

475
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:05,960
I'm a sophomore, and my name is Kim Tae Hee.

476
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,575
She's Fat Tae Hee.

477
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:09,645
Hey.

478
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:13,140
Why would you change her name like that?

479
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,515
- She looks just like Kim Tae Hee. - She's pretty.

480
00:36:17,245 --> 00:36:19,310
By the way, you guys must feel great.

481
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:21,455
You got picked as the prettiest girls in first year.

482
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:22,880
- Sorry? - Come on.

483
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:26,095
Don't act like you don't know. I heard you're number one.

484
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:29,490
Number one? But we don't have our marks yet.

485
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,435
We're talking about your face, not your grades.

486
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:35,475
Soo A, I think you're putting on an act when you know everything.

487
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,115
No, not at all. And I'm certainly not number one.

488
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,745
What about Do Kyung Seok? He won't do it?

489
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,485
- No. - You should've persuaded him.

490
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,100
He said no right away.

491
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:48,370
- Shall I try to lure him? - Sorry?

492
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:51,540
Hey, forget it. I'd be nice to have a good-looking guy too,

493
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,780
but we usually have girls wait the tables anyway, so it's okay.

494
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,025
You're right.

495
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,765
But why?

496
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,765
What do you mean? It's just our tradition.

497
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:04,050
I like how you put it. "It's just our tradition."

498
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,090
- Write it down. - Okay.

499
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,020
I should write it down. "Tradition".

500
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:09,445
- "Just our tradition". - What are you doing? Write it down.

501
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:11,390
- Gosh. - "Just our tradition".

502
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,575
(Hyunmoo Real Estate Office)

503
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,240
Many Hankook University students live in this neighborhood...

504
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,055
- because it's close to school. - I see.

505
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:32,435
The owner put up new wallpaper throughout the place recently.

506
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,780
- It's clean, isn't it? - Did he do it himself?

507
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:37,735
It's a bit damp because he put the wallpaper directly on the wall.

508
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:42,645
It feels fine to me.

509
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,575
Is your palm sweaty?

510
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,200
You don't even need to test the water pressure.

511
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:52,515
It's perfect.

512
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:59,355
If you want to take this place, you should hurry.

513
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:02,110
Another student will come by later in the day to see it.

514
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,925
- I'll check out a few more places. - All right.

515
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,380
It's you, right? Mi Rae's TA.

516
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:09,050
Oh, hello. You're Hyun Jung, right?

517
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:11,635
- Oh, you remember my name. - Of course.

518
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,705
- Do you live in this area? - Yes.

519
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:16,445
- Do you live around here too? - No, I'm checking out some places.

520
00:38:17,265 --> 00:38:19,230
Are you thinking of moving here?

521
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:22,615
There's a newly built low-rise multiplex down the street.

522
00:38:22,637 --> 00:38:24,445
There's a nice apartment in that building.

523
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:26,755
- I'd love to see it. - Then let's go.

524
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,285
Oh, that building.

525
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:33,025
I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand.

526
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:35,880
- Shall I keep you company? - Gosh, it's okay.

527
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:39,465
It's totally fine with me. I have nothing to do, and I'm free all day.

528
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:44,765
This time, we have to actively promote the event,

529
00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:47,275
so I'm thinking of changing the uniform to a skirt.

530
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:49,730
- I don't like that idea. - You won't even have to wear it.

531
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,260
Tae Hee won't wear it either.

532
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:53,330
Why drag me into this? I didn't even say anything.

533
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,600
You stand out even if you don't say anything...

534
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:57,115
because you're so chubby.

535
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:02,185
That's not "chubby".

536
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,870
Her weight is normal.

537
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,195
So all of you are against the skirt idea?

538
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:09,465
I can wear whatever.

539
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,325
Me too.

540
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,265
- I don't care either. - Are you going to do it too?

541
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:17,150
Why would a wilted flower serve when we have so many fresh ones?

542
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:18,320
What did you just say?

543
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:19,990
She's not a wilted flower yet.

544
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:22,630
- Do you still have a crush on her? - Do you still like me?

545
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,560
- My goodness. - All right, enough.

546
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:27,130
Jung Ho and Ye Na, pick out a new uniform within our budget.

547
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,930
Okay, then can you girls tell me your sizes? Soo A, you first.

548
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,885
Hey, I'll write the sizes down.

549
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:33,300
Soo A.

550
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,810
Small usually fits me well.

551
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,585
- Small. - Me too.

552
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,940
- Extra small. - No, just small.

553
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:41,355
Extra small.

554
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:44,550
I usually get large.

555
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:47,235
Large? But you're slim.

556
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm quite tall, you know.

557
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:52,775
Right, you're tall. One large size.

558
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:55,435
I must say, we picked the perfect servers.

559
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,905
Soo A and Mi Rae have contrasting charms, you know.

560
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,245
Contrasting charms?

561
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:02,985
Soo A has that innocent, pure look, whereas Mi Rae is sexy.

562
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:05,785
What?

563
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,400
You're saying I look immature and short compared to her, right?

564
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:11,225
Right, you're cute, and you have a baby face.

565
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:15,695
Let's wrap it up here if you're going to keep blabbering away.

566
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,935
Now, we should talk about...

567
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,720
For 400 dollars a month with a 5,000-dollar deposit,

568
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:26,705
you won't find a better apartment than this.

569
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:28,320
I see.

570
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,775
There are security cameras in the building, so it's safe too.

571
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,415
This means the passcode got leaked.

572
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:44,240
What do you say? Shall I tell the landlord to come meet us here?

573
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:45,640
Not yet. I'll see a few more places.

574
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:48,925
Gosh, You, young man, are very picky.

575
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:52,495
Hey, when will you be home?

576
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:58,135
I see. All right.

577
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:00,960
- Was that Mi Rae? - Yes.

578
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,930
She'll be home late as the meeting is dragging on.

579
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,545
- Do you two live together? - Yes.

580
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:07,745
- Oh, here you go. - Thank you.

581
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,530
Don't thank me for this. I feel so bad.

582
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:12,170
Gosh, please don't feel bad. I volunteered to accompany you.

583
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:14,755
No, don't say that. Thank you so much for your help.

584
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:18,125
- Do you want to grab a beer later? - Sorry?

585
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,455
Somewhere near school. Mi Rae can join us too.

586
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,965
- Sure. - Shall we go, then?

587
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:35,735
What? A wilted flower? And what's wrong with my style? That was crazy.

588
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:39,375
Had I not been a freshman, I would've caused a big scene.

589
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:43,715
Let's not be like that when we're in our senior year.

590
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,585
I don't even like the idea of having to wear skirts.

591
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,955
It'll be uncomfortable to work in a skirt.

592
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:52,440
It'd be a different story if all of us were against it,

593
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:54,625
but Soo A and Ji Hyo are okay with it, you know.

594
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,165
Yes.

595
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:05,905
Are you there alone?

596
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,075
Okay, all right.

597
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:14,530
Jung Boon is having a beer, and she wants me to come.

598
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:15,815
You should come too.

599
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:21,355
My roommate must be waiting for me to have dinner together.

600
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,025
Just a second.

601
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:33,865
Hey. Yes, it's done.

602
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,265
Who? Our TA?

603
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,345
Okay.

604
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,125
- Thank you. - Thank you.

605
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,035
Goodbye.

606
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:08,165
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

607
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:32,355
- Come with me for a second. - Why? What's up?

608
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,855
Hey, let go. Gosh, it hurts.

609
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,425
Hey, let go of my hand.

610
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:40,935
It hurts so badly.

611
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:43,505
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

612
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:47,675
- You see... - Jung Boon.

613
00:43:48,662 --> 00:43:51,490
I guess you got the wrong idea...

614
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:54,315
because I've been so nice to you.

615
00:43:56,904 --> 00:43:58,385
I have no feelings for you.

616
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:01,755
Gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt your feelings like this.

617
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,585
That's not what I'm trying to tell you.

618
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,695
Listen carefully, okay?

619
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:10,465
That girl is a thief.

620
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:12,765
What?

621
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:18,665
I saw her stealing money.

622
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:21,235
Don't set foot in my bar ever again.

623
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:24,460
I didn't want to get angry at you, but this is way out of line.

624
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:26,045
- Well... - Forget it.

625
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,145
I don't even want to see you again.

626
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:34,185
I didn't pay for my beer.

627
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,985
Don't worry. I'll just think that someone stole the beer.

628
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,765
Hey, Jung Boon.

629
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:46,435
Yes, forget it. We're through!

630
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:51,750
Was she going out with the owner of Berlin?

631
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:54,405
No. Hey, Jung Boon!

632
00:44:58,565 --> 00:44:59,815
Mi Rae.

633
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:05,745
Hello.

634
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:08,955
- Have you been waiting long? - No.

635
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,365
Have you had dinner yet?

636
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,635
Yes.

637
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:23,990
If you're getting hungry, come and have some lobsters.

638
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:26,220
I steamed them just now, so they're very good.

639
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:28,435
- You steamed lobsters this late? - Yes.

640
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:31,875
Kyung Hee asked me to steam some right at 9pm.

641
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,745
She took one and went upstairs.

642
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:44,025
(Do not enter, do not knock)

643
00:45:50,184 --> 00:45:51,565
You're back. How was your day?

644
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:01,605
Lobster is my favorite nighttime snack of the moment.

645
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:04,575
I've been eating one every night.

646
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:08,060
All right. I'll cut it up first.

647
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,630
(Lovely Do)

648
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:10,770
(It's the biggest lobster I've seen!)

649
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:11,930
(It's gigantic!)

650
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,655
Well, lobster is my staple,

651
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,855
so this is a piece of cake.

652
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:20,655
And to do this well, you need technique, not strength.

653
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,795
Here. Do you see how plump it is?

654
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,295
I'll try eating this now.

655
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:37,345
Tell Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee...

656
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:39,645
that their mom wants to see them.

657
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:47,285
Why are you standing there?

658
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,285
Come in if you have something to say.

659
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,865
Do you really have to send Kyung Hee off to the States?

660
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:02,180
Why are you asking that?

661
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:04,205
It's not like she wants to go.

662
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,035
She's being forced to go.

663
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:08,735
I should've sent her off sooner.

664
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,805
I postponed it not to cause a ruckus before the election.

665
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,600
I wouldn't send her there...

666
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:16,585
if her grades were high enough for good universities here.

667
00:47:16,804 --> 00:47:18,645
So it's not for her sake.

668
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:21,085
It's to save your reputation.

669
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:25,055
An American university sounds better even if it's not prestigious.

670
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:27,395
What did you say?

671
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:35,250
You must be saying this because you feel bad to send her away.

672
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:38,435
It's the best for her. She'll at least learn English there.

673
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:46,645
That woman came back to Korea.

674
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:50,785
She might shamelessly contact you after what she's done,

675
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,715
having an affair with a young punk and abandoning her children.

676
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:00,855
I don't think you'll let her see you,

677
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:02,625
but I'm telling you just in case.

678
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:29,585
(Kang Mi Rae)

679
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:40,065
- Cheers. - Cheers.

680
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:45,990
It's a rooftop house, but it has air conditioner.

681
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:49,475
The heating system works well in winter. I think it's a good deal.

682
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:52,330
When are you moving then?

683
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,460
I'll pack my stuff tomorrow and move the day after.

684
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:56,915
I have no class during the festival, so I'll get it done in the meantime.

685
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:59,770
Actually, if you invest a little more on the deposit,

686
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,485
you'll have a lot of better options.

687
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:03,955
Well, my budget is limited.

688
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:06,640
I earn less as a teaching assistant than my undergraduate times.

689
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,680
Do you pay for your living expenses too?

690
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:10,165
Even my tuition too.

691
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:13,335
- Awesome. - Even your tuition too?

692
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,820
I luckily got scholarships a few times.

693
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,935
I had so many various part-time jobs too.

694
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,790
That's amazing.

695
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:22,090
- Cool. - It's really cool.

696
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:24,875
Come on. You can't not do it when you're forced in such a situation.

697
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:27,615
- Let's clink. - Cheers.

698
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,140
I thought I needed to take a few breaks, but I was really lucky.

699
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,610
I tutored a student, and his grades suddenly went up dramatically.

700
00:49:37,611 --> 00:49:39,610
Words spread which helped me tutor some more students.

701
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:42,340
He didn't study, but he was actually smart.

702
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,880
It must've been because of your nice tutoring skills...

703
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:46,580
that helped his grades go up.

704
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:48,935
- No, no. - You're right.

705
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:51,035
- You want some more beer? - Sure.

706
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:55,490
It's okay.

707
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,630
I thought it'd take several days for me to decide on my new house,

708
00:49:57,631 --> 00:49:59,445
but I saved a lot of time thanks to you.

709
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,900
Can we have three more glasses of beer?

710
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:03,115
Sure.

711
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:06,915
By the way, please feel free to talk casually to us.

712
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:08,540
What?

713
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:12,210
I mean it's awkward to hear you talk to us so politely.

714
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:13,710
We're your juniors, you know.

715
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:16,695
Right, it'd be great if you talk to us casually.

716
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,310
Will that be comfortable for you?

717
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:20,595
- Yes. - Yes.

718
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,705
Then...

719
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,465
should I?

720
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:29,520
That's way better. It felt so suffocating.

721
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,230
In that sense, let's clink.

722
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:33,345
- Cheers. - Cheers.

723
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:35,875
Hi, there.

724
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:40,770
I came to help you, but you aren't busy at all.

725
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:43,240
Don't joke around with my means of living.

726
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:45,155
I'm not in the mood for your jokes right now.

727
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,995
It's usually hard for me to talk casually to others.

728
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,920
- There you go again. - Oops, sorry.

729
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,465
- Please don't be so polite to us. - I won't, for certain.

730
00:50:57,591 --> 00:50:59,450
- Eat up, guys. - Shall we?

731
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,860
- Let's eat. - Go ahead.

732
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:03,505
- It looks delicious. - It is good.

733
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,375
What are you doing?

734
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:21,480
I came to help you, but you aren't busy at all.

735
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,950
Don't joke around with my means of living.

736
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,865
I'm not in the mood for your jokes right now.

737
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:32,705
It's usually hard for me to talk casually to others.

738
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:34,620
- There you go again. - Oops, sorry.

739
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:38,175
- Please don't be so polite to us. - I won't, for certain.

740
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:40,160
- Eat up, guys. - Shall we?

741
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,560
- Let's eat. - Go ahead.

742
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:44,215
- It looks delicious. - It is good.

743
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:49,085
What are you doing?

744
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:01,150
Your order is two cups of Americano.

745
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:03,235
Gosh, this is crazy.

746
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,590
- She's prettier in person. - Right?

747
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:06,620
Hello.

748
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:09,890
Can I have one vanilla latte and caffe mocha each?

749
00:52:09,896 --> 00:52:11,630
You look intimidated.

750
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,045
No way.

751
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:16,885
Look at him.

752
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,615
Are you ready to order?

753
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:25,425
Should I help you with your order?

754
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,410
Three Americanos, please.

755
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,180
Three Americanos, right?

756
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:31,395
Ouch.

757
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:34,250
You want them to be hot?

758
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,495
Yes.

759
00:52:38,692 --> 00:52:40,005
Here.

760
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,105
Thank you.

761
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:45,275
Here you go.

762
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:47,175
Thank you.

763
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:00,825
Excuse me.

764
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:03,825
- Yes? - My name is Park Yong Chul.

765
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,820
You liked my photos on Instagram.

766
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,350
Oh, hello.

767
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:11,605
I was surprised that you didn't recognize me.

768
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,005
- She recognizes him. - Sorry.

769
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:16,875
She really is pretty by the way.

770
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:20,315
What are they talking about?

771
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,570
What did you guys talk about?

772
00:53:24,571 --> 00:53:26,955
She apologized for not recognizing me.

773
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,555
She'll leave work soon and she wants to grab beer with me if it's okay.

774
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:32,255
What should I do?

775
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:34,610
It must be a lie.

776
00:53:34,614 --> 00:53:36,025
Right?

777
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,635
- Let me in. - Me too.

778
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:47,905
This is what I'm capable of.

779
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,745
You transferred to another school after a year, right?

780
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:53,830
13 months.

781
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:55,615
But everyone knew about him.

782
00:53:56,036 --> 00:53:58,545
Are you aware that your nickname was Rain Kyung Seok?

783
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,140
What's that?

784
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,500
All the boys copied how you would walk in the rain.

785
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:03,510
Didn't you know?

786
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,970
Why would they copy such a thing?

787
00:54:04,978 --> 00:54:06,270
I walked in the rain because I had no umbrella.

788
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:08,155
Gosh, that's annoying.

789
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:11,365
Do you want me to say that they copied you because you looked cool?

790
00:54:11,651 --> 00:54:12,810
It's nothing cool though.

791
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:15,365
So Kyung Seok was really popular.

792
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:16,620
Didn't you guys like him?

793
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:18,050
No, I didn't.

794
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:21,575
It simply felt like I was seeing a handsome celebrity.

795
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:23,745
You might become better at drinking.

796
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,275
What?

797
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,815
Well...

798
00:54:32,706 --> 00:54:34,840
Mi Rae said she is going to wait the tables.

799
00:54:34,841 --> 00:54:36,070
What are you doing during the festival, Kyung Seok?

800
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:37,555
You're going to wait the tables?

801
00:54:38,078 --> 00:54:39,570
- Yes. - You said you were busy.

802
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:40,895
Did I?

803
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:44,380
Well, yes. I am busy.

804
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:47,765
But the department needs my help.

805
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,365
Are you coming to the festival?

806
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,190
I don't know if I'll have time to come by.

807
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:57,590
I'll go when I'm pretty much done unpacking.

808
00:54:57,597 --> 00:54:59,390
Do you want me to help you with the unpacking?

809
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:00,945
No, thanks.

810
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:03,430
I'll hold a housewarming party after I'm done, so come visit then.

811
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:04,785
Good.

812
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:06,870
Come with her if you have time too, Mi Rae.

813
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:08,085
Okay.

814
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:16,680
You want to come too?

815
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:17,880
Why are they going?

816
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:19,150
Because...

817
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:21,495
Because they live in the same neighborhood.

818
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:23,295
My new house is located near their house.

819
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:28,675
- Cheers. - Cheers.

820
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:30,175
- Cheers. - Cheers.

821
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:45,155
Hey, it's nervous to drink with those handsome guys...

822
00:55:45,178 --> 00:55:48,155
that it keeps me sober, don't you agree?

823
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:53,665
Hey.

824
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:55,595
When will you hold that housewarming party?

825
00:55:58,358 --> 00:55:59,735
Are you really coming?

826
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:05,045
You're more sociable than you look.

827
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,475
Or do you like either of them?

828
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,155
Let's set the date that's agreeable for all of us.

829
00:56:15,475 --> 00:56:17,025
I'm going this way. What about you?

830
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,555
Bye.

831
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:40,345
- Hello. - Hello.

832
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:46,515
Slow down.

833
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,485
Mi Rae, you're really slim.

834
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:53,825
- What? - I'm envious of your pretty looks.

835
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:55,155
Me?

836
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,850
You look way prettier though.

837
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:01,635
Don't be like that. Guys always tease me for being fat.

838
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,035
You aren't fat.

839
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,135
Right, you're not fat at all.

840
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,035
Guys and girls have different standards in being fat.

841
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:12,645
She should be considered average, don't you think so?

842
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:14,215
What?

843
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,515
She's rather chubby.

844
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:24,625
I thought you were cute and pretty when I saw you.

845
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:26,125
Don't say that.

846
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:29,795
To be honest, a lot of people say I might look pretty if I lose weight.

847
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:31,465
But losing weight isn't easy.

848
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:36,335
It's really hard to lose weight.

849
00:57:37,357 --> 00:57:39,065
Tae Hee.

850
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:41,075
There you go again.

851
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:43,505
I'll take this away for your sake.

852
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:46,090
You said you'd go on a diet.

853
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:48,645
Your whole life will change only if you lose weight.

854
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:51,145
Why would you do that when she was eating?

855
00:57:51,604 --> 00:57:55,500
I just feel sorry how she's wasting her pretty face.

856
00:57:55,508 --> 00:57:56,640
She's this cute even when she's fat.

857
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,725
Imagine how much prettier she'll be once she loses weight.

858
00:57:59,012 --> 00:58:00,280
You promised,

859
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,155
so make some effort.

860
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:03,550
- Hurry, guys. What are you doing? - Okay.

861
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,750
I never made that promise.

862
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:07,680
I'm grateful for your compliment about my face,

863
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:09,980
but let me take care of my life and my business myself.

864
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:12,405
You've been saying that for a year.

865
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:15,005
You can be as pretty as Soo A once you lose weight.

866
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,630
Please don't say that.

867
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,790
I'm not even pretty. People might criticize me.

868
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:22,200
I'm sure Soo A's also making efforts with or without others knowing.

869
00:58:22,202 --> 00:58:24,585
She must go on diets too, right?

870
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:29,315
My skinny body has been my concern since I was little.

871
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:31,325
I see.

872
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:33,425
Come on, Soo A.

873
00:58:33,446 --> 00:58:35,625
The girls might get annoyed.

874
00:58:36,783 --> 00:58:38,510
There are people who never gain weight.

875
00:58:38,518 --> 00:58:41,465
- There are that kind of people. - How's the preparation going?

876
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:44,850
Hey, I don't think we have enough tables,

877
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:46,190
so can we prepare a few mats just in case?

878
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:47,705
That'd be good.

879
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:49,260
Haven't the uniforms arrived yet?

880
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:51,275
They're here.

881
00:58:55,635 --> 00:58:57,715
What's taking the girls so long?

882
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:00,315
- They're getting changed. - Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

883
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:07,110
I wish I was born as a pretty girl so that I could take orders only.

884
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:08,495
It's a bar run by the chemistry department.

885
00:59:10,049 --> 00:59:12,510
Come visit our bar.

886
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:13,765
- Okay. - Okay.

887
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:17,935
I feel too apologetic to Jung Boon. What should I do?

888
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:19,350
You should apologize then.

889
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:23,035
I mean, I feel too sorry to apologize.

890
00:59:23,129 --> 00:59:24,875
Then you should apologize that you're really sorry.

891
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:27,675
Let's go.

892
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:29,315
Go where?

893
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,285
Our department's bar.

894
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:33,385
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

895
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:36,655
That's the uniform?

896
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,085
- I don't like it. - Me neither.

897
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:20,820
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

898
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,380
I can sense the breeze of success already.

899
01:00:22,388 --> 01:00:24,220
It's just as I imagined.

900
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:25,590
Why these punks...

901
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:27,720
Why do you nag me so much? You have someone you want to see there?

902
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:28,720
You're here.

903
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:30,560
- She's that pretty girl. - Kang Mi Rae?

904
01:00:30,563 --> 01:00:32,290
What's wrong? I'm just glad...

905
01:00:32,298 --> 01:00:34,200
- to see Kang Orc again. - Hey.

906
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,730
Park Yong Chul's profile shows which schools he went to.

907
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:39,300
Soo A, that girl, might have done it to mess with you on purpose.

908
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:41,570
She was cute. Mi Rae was cute.

909
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,370
Then again, I'm being careful these days. She's from our department.

910
01:00:44,377 --> 01:00:45,470
Can't we point to the person right away?

911
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:47,480
Who is it that you like?

912
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,725
This person.
