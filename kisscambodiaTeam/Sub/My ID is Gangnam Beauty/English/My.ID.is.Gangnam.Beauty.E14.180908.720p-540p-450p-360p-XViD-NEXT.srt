1
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:15,985
We're seeing each other now.

2
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:25,595
Congratulations.

3
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:27,725
I wish you guys all the best.

4
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:52,585
You wanted to keep it a secret.

5
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,685
She probably won't tell anyone.

6
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:59,595
You dating me right after rejecting her...

7
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,895
must've crushed her pride.

8
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:07,905
I'm glad that you're smartening up.

9
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,635
- What? - I also wanted to tell Soo A...

10
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:13,975
that we're seeing each other now.

11
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,385
I don't want to make you lie.

12
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:23,470
I'll be the liar.

13
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,300
You kept it from everyone because of me anyway.

14
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,585
It's all right. We should do everything together.

15
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:29,925
Don't do it alone.

16
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,235
Hey.

17
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:41,105
Have you been researching cool things to say to girls?

18
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,875
I just said what came to mind.

19
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:49,275
Should I do some research?

20
00:01:55,405 --> 00:02:00,785
(Episode 14: Start Secretly)

21
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:03,680
When you layer too many different scents,

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,940
the scents can clash...

23
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:08,895
and end up smelling awful or too strong together.

24
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,420
If you prefer feminine, sophisticated scents...

25
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,580
What should we do after this?

26
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:15,090
You should add a citrus note.

27
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,235
If you prefer sweet, girly scents,

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,190
you should add refreshing notes like grapefruit.

29
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,545
Well, I'll be fine with whatever.

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,775
(Kang Mi Rae)

31
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,755
I didn't think he'd be used to texting,

32
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,685
but he can text with one hand.

33
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,710
(Well, I'll be fine with whatever.)

34
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:37,910
Then let's grab dinner first.

35
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,910
(Then let's grab dinner first.)

36
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:40,950
Sure.

37
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,150
(Sure.)

38
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,180
Okay.

39
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:46,950
(Okay.)

40
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:48,335
I'll send you the address.

41
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:57,400
Mi Rae, are you still thinking?

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,615
Pardon me?

43
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:02,130
Oh, I'm thinking of going with something that'd be good for autumn.

44
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,545
For autumn?

45
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,555
What kinds of scents are you thinking?

46
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,285
Well...

47
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:13,495
I'm thinking of using woody, floral scents or something citrusy.

48
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,995
That will suit the pleasant autumn breeze.

49
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,665
Yes, thank you.

50
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,120
(I'll send you the address.)

51
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,575
Let's meet in front of the building.

52
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,260
That's risky.

53
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:31,830
(That's risky.)

54
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:33,200
Then shall we meet halfway there?

55
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,245
Where? On the street?

56
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:38,185
Or... Shall we just meet there?

57
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,315
Yes, that'd be the best.

58
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,310
Are we in a spy movie or what?

59
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:44,340
(Are we in a spy movie or what?)

60
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:45,855
Who keeps texting you?

61
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,425
What?

62
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:49,950
My mom.

63
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:52,195
Your mom? Is everything okay with your family?

64
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:54,965
Yes, they're fine. It's nothing serious.

65
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,275
Every family has problems, you know.

66
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:58,875
That's true.

67
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:25,965
(I have a crush on you.)

68
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,945
Yes, hello?

69
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,785
Hey, Yoon Byul. It's me, Woo Young.

70
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,325
- Just sit. Why did you get up? - Oh, okay.

71
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:59,320
- What do you want to drink? - It's okay. Let me order.

72
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,205
No, I should treat you since I'm older.

73
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,005
Then I'll get iced caffe mocha.

74
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:05,320
With whipped cream on top?

75
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,245
- Just a little bit. - Just a little bit?

76
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:11,275
Iced caffe mocha with just a little bit of whipped cream.

77
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,925
Thank you.

78
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,820
- Why were you at school? - I'm taking a summer class.

79
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,705
Oh, right. You told me that.

80
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:42,245
- What did you want to talk about? - What?

81
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,145
Well, it's about...

82
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,345
- The other day, you gave me... - My love letter?

83
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:52,685
Yes.

84
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,395
I did some thinking after reading that letter.

85
00:05:57,447 --> 00:06:00,395
It's okay. You can be honest with me.

86
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,625
Okay. I'll be honest.

87
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:06,835
To be honest,

88
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,605
I think you're very cool.

89
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:14,105
But I'm not your type, right?

90
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,345
What?

91
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:19,700
Yes.

92
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:22,385
Okay. There's nothing I can do about it.

93
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,440
I'll go after I finish this.

94
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,555
You can take your time.

95
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:28,955
Okay.

96
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:42,265
I've also been heartbroken a couple of times,

97
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,775
and I found out that time heals all wounds.

98
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:46,975
It's not always the same with everyone.

99
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:49,060
Some people take much longer to heal.

100
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,275
Yes, you're right.

101
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:57,600
Are summer classes fun?

102
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:59,100
No, they're not fun.

103
00:06:59,108 --> 00:07:00,685
Oh, I see.

104
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:08,910
I hope you don't get drunk and end up ruining your health...

105
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:11,395
because I made you upset.

106
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:14,265
I'll try not to.

107
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,275
I'm sure you'll do well.

108
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,130
I'll go now.

109
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,385
Okay.

110
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:33,315
- Bye. - Okay, bye.

111
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:41,850
Are you really over Soo A?

112
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,295
I'm not nuts.

113
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,595
Why would I like someone when she told me that she likes Kyung Seok?

114
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,105
Bye.

115
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,630
Okay, bye.

116
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:56,945
See you.

117
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:00,730
Won Ho must be upset...

118
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,715
after you told everyone that you like Kyung Seok.

119
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:06,155
Let's not talk about Kyung Seok anymore.

120
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,785
Sorry.

121
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,595
Let's go eat.

122
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,365
Sure. What should we eat?

123
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:33,645
What kind of perfume are you looking for?

124
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:35,870
Men's perfume.

125
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:37,500
We have a new product that we recently launched,

126
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,355
and it has a very neutral scent.

127
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,685
You should try this.

128
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:42,255
Okay.

129
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:57,220
It's nice.

130
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,390
- Should I get you one? - Yes.

131
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:01,875
It must be for your boyfriend.

132
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,215
Yes, it's for my boyfriend.

133
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:08,830
If you tell me his initials,

134
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:09,970
we can engrave it for you.

135
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,615
Oh, really?

136
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:14,925
Then...

137
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,695
please engrave D, K, S...

138
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,265
with a heart at the end.

139
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,725
Okay, I'll do that.

140
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:30,775
Welcome.

141
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:34,975
Here's your check.

142
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:37,145
It's 187 dollars.

143
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,775
Okay.

144
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,785
Please sign here.

145
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,285
Okay.

146
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:49,285
Thank you.

147
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:25,180
Do you think we'll run into our school friends here?

148
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,495
Mi Rae.

149
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,825
You stand out too much.

150
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:32,735
- Why? - It's like you're a spy.

151
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,490
Oh, really?

152
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,360
We already watched a movie,

153
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:41,775
ate dinner, and drank together once.

154
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:44,530
But we had a good excuse back then.

155
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,615
We had to do homework for a class.

156
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:48,870
Was it an excuse for you as well?

157
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:49,870
What do you mean?

158
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:52,785
I only used that as an excuse to watch a movie with you.

159
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:02,080
Should we order?

160
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:03,365
Yes.

161
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:10,490
I want spaghetti aglio e olio.

162
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:11,935
You must really like that.

163
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:13,790
That's what you ordered last time.

164
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:16,505
I always tend to order the cheapest menu.

165
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,945
That sounded so cheap.

166
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:22,845
To be honest,

167
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,455
I was worried that day because I didn't have a lot of money.

168
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:27,015
Really?

169
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,140
Then why did you insist on paying for everything?

170
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:31,725
Because I'm the one who suggested that we should eat.

171
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,465
Would you like to order?

172
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:38,435
Two spaghetti aglio e olios.

173
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:40,520
I want cola. What about you?

174
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,120
Me too.

175
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,565
Two glasses of cola, please.

176
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,205
Okay.

177
00:11:58,307 --> 00:12:00,615
I need to go to the bathroom.

178
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:01,885
Okay.

179
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,580
We should eat something nice and cheer up...

180
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:12,495
since we're both heartbroken.

181
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:14,950
Eating something doesn't exactly cheer me up.

182
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,165
Why not?

183
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:19,275
- Hey. - Kyung Seok.

184
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:23,805
Hello.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,230
What are you doing here alone? Did you come with someone?

186
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:28,245
No, I came here...

187
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,015
I came here alone.

188
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,240
Alone?

189
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,455
I came to eat.

190
00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:35,955
Okay. Enjoy your meal.

191
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,895
Bye.

192
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:13,725
My face is burning as if I drank alcohol.

193
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:19,295
My heart beats so fast even when we started to see each other.

194
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:22,335
This is driving me crazy.

195
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,915
I chose what I want.

196
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,545
I want this.

197
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,055
What about you?

198
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,785
Don't you think this would taste better?

199
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,725
I want this.

200
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:52,865
Gosh, what am I going to do? What should I do?

201
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:02,375
You're awfully obedient to someone who rejected you.

202
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:06,230
Did you decide not to drink because Woo Young...

203
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:07,360
told you to take care of your health?

204
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,970
I think so. He was really worried about me.

205
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,515
It felt like I should listen to him.

206
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,385
He's a great senior.

207
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:26,795
Excuse me.

208
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,705
Can you deliver this to the ladies'?

209
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,335
What?

210
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,030
Please hurry.

211
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,605
Oh, okay.

212
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,705
What should I do?

213
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,485
Excuse me.

214
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,010
That's my bag.

215
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,225
Your friend asked me to give this to you.

216
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:28,565
Thank you. Thank you.

217
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,465
My gosh.

218
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,330
Hello?

219
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,870
Tae Hee just went to the bathroom.

220
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:51,115
What?

221
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,080
Don't say anything, and just listen.

222
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:05,720
I'll try to distract the seniors.

223
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,035
You can use that chance to get out of here.

224
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,445
This really feels like a spy movie.

225
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,100
Bye.

226
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:26,855
Bye, see you.

227
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,525
We're seeing each other now.

228
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,865
How dare she...

229
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:43,605
(Tae Young)

230
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,345
Hello?

231
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:57,530
Now?

232
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:59,855
I have something important to ask you.

233
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,685
- What is it? - Let's talk in person.

234
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,895
Spare me a minute.

235
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,035
He must be eating those two dishes alone.

236
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,545
You can do that too.

237
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,715
Still, I don't come alone for two dishes...

238
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,545
unless I come with 2 other people and order 3 dishes.

239
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:34,525
Can I sit here for a second?

240
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:36,925
Sure, sit down.

241
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:41,765
What did you order?

242
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:44,665
- Us? - Yes.

243
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:47,250
I ordered rose pasta.

244
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,665
- I ordered spaghetti aglio e olio. - Me too.

245
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:54,875
- Just two of that? - Yes.

246
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:57,575
So you eat more than you look.

247
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,975
I eat a lot from time to time.

248
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:01,685
How much?

249
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:07,755
Let's be honest. The portions at barbecue restaurants are too small.

250
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:09,485
What?

251
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,225
Enjoy your food.

252
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,365
What was that? Did he come here to ask us what we're having?

253
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:19,120
That was strange.

254
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:21,190
I guess he's gotten the desire to communicate with the society...

255
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,965
after being immersed in his own world.

256
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,735
- You think so? - Yes.

257
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,875
Kyung Seok.

258
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,640
Are you okay?

259
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,825
I'm sorry. You couldn't eat any, could you?

260
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,655
You couldn't even have a bite.

261
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:47,255
I'm not hungry right now.

262
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,765
- Shall we go? - Where else should we go?

263
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,835
Are you a meerkat or what?

264
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:02,245
Oops, sorry. It's bothersome, isn't it?

265
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:12,840
- Let's go home for today. - What?

266
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,755
I'm worried you might keep being anxious.

267
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,155
Sorry.

268
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,455
We have a lot of time to spend together.

269
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,180
What did you tell them?

270
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:28,635
Did you tell them you came alone?

271
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,705
Yes.

272
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,675
I made you lie in the end.

273
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,405
It's nothing bad.

274
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,575
They must've thought you were strange...

275
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,315
for going to such a place alone.

276
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,715
It's okay. Don't mind it.

277
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,415
I wish I could live...

278
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:50,055
without minding others' attention.

279
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:56,665
I'm okay.

280
00:19:57,453 --> 00:20:01,435
I'm actually used to that.

281
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:06,705
I've lived that way throughout my entire life.

282
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,515
- Let's go. - Okay.

283
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:32,665
- Hello. - Hello.

284
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:38,490
- You look so cool. - Oh, thank you.

285
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:39,890
- Hello. - Mr. Mayor.

286
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:42,760
Please work hard to revive...

287
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:43,960
our economy.

288
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:46,715
I will work hard. My goal is...

289
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,110
What's this?

290
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,210
(Is she Do Sang Won's daughter?)

291
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,655
(It's been revealed Mayor Do's daughter is a famous streamer.)

292
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,595
I'm doomed.

293
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,950
I'll do my best. Thank you.

294
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,335
Thank you.

295
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,365
- Do Sang Won. - Go for it.

296
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:15,375
Please take a look at this, sir.

297
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,130
What is this?

298
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:21,715
She seems to have been streaming online.

299
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,000
Her nickname is Lovely Do.

300
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:25,840
The problem is, her broadcast is about...

301
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,415
showing off her wealthy life.

302
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,390
What is it that you want to ask?

303
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:51,675
First off,

304
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:54,575
I want to thank you.

305
00:21:57,406 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm usually indecisive.

306
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:01,315
But...

307
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,785
hearing your opinion that day...

308
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:06,455
gave me courage.

309
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,425
Thanks.

310
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:13,195
- What courage? - You told me...

311
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,465
to follow my heart.

312
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,375
So...

313
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,160
This.

314
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,845
I was reminded of you and bought it.

315
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:30,115
It's a necklace.

316
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:34,385
- Tae Young. - Yes?

317
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:36,770
Why would you be reminded of me...

318
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:38,525
and buy such a thing?

319
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,055
What?

320
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:44,225
It's uncomfortable. I don't understand why you're doing this.

321
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:50,235
From how I remember, I thought we were...

322
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,075
on the same page.

323
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,475
What do you mean by that?

324
00:22:56,498 --> 00:23:01,000
You asked me what I'd do if I found out...

325
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:04,085
that someone else had a crush on me.

326
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:08,755
Don't tell me you thought I had a crush on you.

327
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:15,465
What I was trying to say was that...

328
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,720
if you get swayed by someone else,

329
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,235
then you probably don't like the person you're seeing that much.

330
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:23,865
To be honest, I wanted you to be happy with Tae Hee.

331
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,445
What's wrong?

332
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,045
Please excuse me.

333
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,985
What is it?

334
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:58,475
What's going on?

335
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:00,875
What's going on between them?

336
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:21,125
You said you could be my drinking buddy if I was in trouble.

337
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,195
Of course. I'm a huge fan of yours.

338
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:28,965
I see.

339
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,405
Actually, I'm not so experienced with dating either.

340
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,075
I'm concerned with a lot of things about our relationship.

341
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:41,815
What exactly?

342
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,685
I'm not sure...

343
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:46,885
about my feelings for her.

344
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,085
Of course, she's a good girl.

345
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:54,795
She's cute.

346
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,835
It's right that I have positive feelings for her.

347
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:00,935
But...

348
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:04,365
I don't know.

349
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,175
How do you think you will feel...

350
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:13,115
if you find out that someone else...

351
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:15,585
has a crush on you?

352
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:21,115
What?

353
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,455
Do you think you'll be swayed?

354
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,625
Well...

355
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,125
I don't know.

356
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,465
I'm not sure,

357
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:38,135
but isn't it better to follow your heart than your thought?

358
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:45,315
Am I the weird one here?

359
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:48,915
Am I?

360
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,665
This is crazy.

361
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:06,665
What's so crazy?

362
00:26:06,688 --> 00:26:11,535
You and Kyung Seok held hands and...

363
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:15,260
You little brats. What's the next step?

364
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:18,200
- What do you mean? - I'm not ready for that yet.

365
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,100
- Ready for what? - It's too early for me.

366
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:22,715
What are you talking about?

367
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:24,470
You've gotten so brave, Mi Rae.

368
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:26,300
You said you could never date Kyung Seok.

369
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:28,255
Gosh, cut it out.

370
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,070
Don't tell anyone.

371
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:31,980
You'll hide it from people in your department?

372
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,695
Yes, of course.

373
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:37,680
People were already so interested in him, and it's gotten worse.

374
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:40,165
Everyone is wondering whom he's seeing after rejecting Soo A.

375
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:42,205
If people find out that it's me...

376
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:47,575
But what if they find out? What will you do then?

377
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:53,100
No idea. It's not like I thought about those things in advance.

378
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:56,530
Right, it's fine. Hey, don't think about anything else.

379
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:59,440
For now, just focus on your relationship with Kyung Seok...

380
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:02,840
- and lovey-dovey things you'll do. - My gosh.

381
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:05,210
Lovey-dovey, my foot.

382
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:08,465
- Stop it. Enough, okay? - You two will be all lovey-dovey.

383
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:10,910
- Hey, wait. Hang on. - What?

384
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,865
- Hang on a second. - What? What is it now?

385
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:15,335
Well... Does Woo Young know?

386
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,605
I guess you're busy.

387
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,175
Yes, I have to go over a thesis.

388
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:06,800
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

389
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,055
No, well...

390
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:12,395
Yes.

391
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:14,480
What is it?

392
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,080
We can talk another time if you're busy.

393
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:19,265
I am busy now, but go ahead.

394
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:23,105
It's about Mi Rae.

395
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,090
What's wrong? Are things not going well?

396
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:26,405
No, it's not that.

397
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:28,845
Things are...

398
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:30,805
going well.

399
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,145
It went well.

400
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,155
Is that why you wanted to talk?

401
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,525
Do you feel bad for me?

402
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:45,755
No, I don't really have...

403
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:48,550
- any reason to. - Right, you don't.

404
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,425
But why are you stammering now?

405
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:52,835
Congratulations.

406
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:57,865
But please don't tell anyone at school.

407
00:28:58,326 --> 00:28:59,420
Why?

408
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:01,035
Just because. Please don't tell anyone.

409
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:03,275
I'm going to bed.

410
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:06,445
Good night. I hope you have a dream about Mi Rae.

411
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,155
"Inorganic chemicals..."

412
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,085
What?

413
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:46,340
Did you drink all of them?

414
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:47,955
We had 10 bottles.

415
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:49,685
Yes.

416
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:53,225
Hey, you're not the only one who's trying to slim down.

417
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:57,110
Look at this. I only gained a tiny bit of weight,

418
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:59,665
but my belly is sticking out already. It's gross.

419
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:04,365
Let's become pretty together, okay?

420
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,635
I'll buy more.

421
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,730
Will you meet up with Kyung Seok and go with him?

422
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:11,005
What?

423
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,700
I'm sure you will. You two will be all lovey-dovey.

424
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,870
Look at this, okay? Lovey-dovey.

425
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,170
It's not funny at all.

426
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:20,300
I'm having fun.

427
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:21,640
I'm not.

428
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:22,885
What's your problem?

429
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,265
(Messages)

430
00:30:30,418 --> 00:30:33,095
I guess we're not going to the lab together today.

431
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:44,745
How long have you been waiting?

432
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:46,030
For about 10 minutes?

433
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,260
You should've called me.

434
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:48,885
You were going to come out anyway.

435
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:52,400
Let's stop by somewhere.

436
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:53,655
Where?

437
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:54,985
You'll find out.

438
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:02,365
(Mask)

439
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,995
Are you buying a mask? Do you have a cold?

440
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:10,605
No, I want to cover my face.

441
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,920
Why do you want to cover your face?

442
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:13,635
Because you're worried about people seeing us.

443
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:15,445
I'll just wear this.

444
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:17,705
It's too hot though.

445
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,785
Then I'll wear it.

446
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,630
No, I'll wear it.

447
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:27,115
No. It's because of me, so I'll just wear it.

448
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:30,485
Then let's both wear it.

449
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:40,995
Are you all right?

450
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:42,405
Yes.

451
00:31:42,891 --> 00:31:45,835
But I think we stand out more now because of these masks.

452
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,375
I told you that I'd just wear it alone.

453
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:50,660
Take it off.

454
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:52,200
No, it's okay. You should take it off.

455
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,645
No, you take it off.

456
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:57,415
"Take it off"? People may get the wrong idea.

457
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:02,255
You should take it off too. You'll get heat rash on your chin.

458
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,695
We can tell people that we commute together because we're neighbors.

459
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:09,595
As long as we don't hold hands, we'll be fine.

460
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,115
By the way, where do you want to go after?

461
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:32,455
Shall we go somewhere far?

462
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:34,615
Somewhere far? Where?

463
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,885
Let's think about it.

464
00:32:41,115 --> 00:32:42,250
Seriously.

465
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,795
But the thing is...

466
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:45,110
Hello.

467
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,195
Soo A must have something to do with it.

468
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,605
It looked like Tae Young was confessing his feelings to her.

469
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,930
There was a gift in front of Soo A,

470
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,445
and the two of them looked all serious.

471
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,715
She must've rejected him.

472
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:07,170
Has Tae Young ever met up with a girl one on one before this?

473
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:08,885
We all hung out together all the time.

474
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:12,340
All right. Let's just say...

475
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,840
that Tae Young likes Soo A now.

476
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,710
But you two just broke up.

477
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:18,650
When do you think it all happened?

478
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:22,135
I bet something was already going on when you two were together.

479
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:24,965
I knew it.

480
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:28,945
A few times, he was thinking about something else and couldn't hear me.

481
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,215
He also kept texting someone when we were together.

482
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:33,475
Right?

483
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:38,145
There's always a reason when guys break up with you out of the blue.

484
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:05,715
You're early.

485
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:08,315
Yes.

486
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:16,525
Soo A.

487
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:21,080
Do you want to have lunch with me today?

488
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:22,325
I'll treat you.

489
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,795
Why?

490
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:27,865
I figured you'd still be uncomfortable around Kyung Seok.

491
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:33,435
Thanks, Eun. You're the best.

492
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:44,915
Come in.

493
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:51,455
Woo Young.

494
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:53,355
Hey, Hyun Jung.

495
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:55,765
Are you busy?

496
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:58,380
No, I'm almost done. What brings you here?

497
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:00,635
Oh, I came to return some books.

498
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:04,720
Do you want to have coffee with me?

499
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:06,975
Sure, just a second.

500
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:13,845
You said someone confessed her feelings for you. What happened?

501
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:16,015
She was so cool about it.

502
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:19,255
I'm not sure how she actually took it though.

503
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,355
What about you? How do you feel?

504
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,210
I'm a little worried.

505
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:26,955
And I hope she'll quickly get over it.

506
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:31,095
I was asking about you, not her.

507
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:33,865
Me?

508
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:36,635
I know you liked Mi Rae.

509
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:38,365
Hey, how did you...

510
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,760
You knew that?

511
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:43,105
Of course. I'm a psychology major.

512
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:48,315
You know everything even without experience and words.

513
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:54,285
Then...

514
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:58,725
you must also know that I got rejected by her.

515
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:06,095
No, I didn't know that.

516
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:09,805
What?

517
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,005
I guess best friends don't always tell each other everything.

518
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,115
So you did ask her out.

519
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:22,715
Yes, of course.

520
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:26,355
I took my chances on that one percent probability.

521
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:30,155
I figured I should ask her out to not have any regrets.

522
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:33,695
I guess girls and guys are different.

523
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,850
I don't think I'd ever confess my feelings...

524
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,765
unless there was a 99 percent chance.

525
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,535
Why bother confess when you know it won't work out?

526
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:51,875
I have a lot to learn from you.

527
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,315
I've never dated anyone.

528
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:08,355
Sorry.

529
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,335
I guess everyone's eating outside today.

530
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:16,165
Dong Won's the only person here.

531
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:19,320
Won Ho went outside with Sung Woon...

532
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,135
because he's upset with Soo A.

533
00:37:21,395 --> 00:37:24,345
Tae Hee and Ye Na left to talk about some secret.

534
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:27,945
And Soo A left to eat with Eun.

535
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:33,385
He was starting to get friendly, but he's eating alone again.

536
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:44,895
What are you doing? Sit down.

537
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:01,460
Why are you sitting next to me...

538
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:02,885
instead of Mi Rae?

539
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,885
Kyung Seok doesn't always sit next to me.

540
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:12,480
There's a rumor saying he always follows...

541
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,655
his friend from middle school because he lacks social skills.

542
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:18,695
I lack social skills?

543
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:21,035
Yes. Didn't you know?

544
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,865
You really do lack social skills.

545
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:30,175
He's funnier than you think and speaks pretty eloquently.

546
00:38:30,698 --> 00:38:31,945
Really?

547
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:36,245
Then do you know who he likes?

548
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:40,955
Not really.

549
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:42,925
Are you dating her right now?

550
00:38:46,814 --> 00:38:49,325
- Yes. - My gosh.

551
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,965
- Who is it? - That's none of your business.

552
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:54,865
Why are you keeping it a secret?

553
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,605
Is it...

554
00:39:03,064 --> 00:39:05,205
- a celebrity? - No.

555
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:09,045
I can already tell that you're nervous.

556
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,615
I got it right, didn't I?

557
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:12,915
Didn't I?

558
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:17,425
Gosh, I wonder who it is. I'm so curious.

559
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,955
Why are you curious about whom I date?

560
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:22,825
Of course, I'm curious.

561
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:26,595
She was good enough for you to reject Soo A.

562
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,435
Do you really not know?

563
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:35,075
What? No.

564
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:42,645
I wonder if I can transfer schools even in college.

565
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,815
You really are funnier than I expected.

566
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,415
Are you going to transfer schools?

567
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:06,105
If only Soo A didn't tell everyone that she likes me.

568
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:10,075
It's all because of me.

569
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:12,815
It's because I care too much about what other people think.

570
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:18,185
- I'm sorry. - Don't feel sorry toward me.

571
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,315
That's what Soo A wants.

572
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,865
I'm not angry at you.

573
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:36,235
Kyung Seok.

574
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:40,035
What are you doing here?

575
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:51,615
Did I catch you guys?

576
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:03,295
My gosh, are you guys dating?

577
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:04,995
How cute.

578
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:08,965
Why aren't you saying anything?

579
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:10,905
Did I startle you that much?

580
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,905
So what if I know?

581
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:17,105
- Aren't you surprised? - Of course, I'm surprised.

582
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:20,215
I'm so surprised right now. I can't believe it.

583
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,800
To be honest, I always wanted you to become...

584
00:41:23,804 --> 00:41:25,985
Kyung Seok's girlfriend, Mi Rae.

585
00:41:26,173 --> 00:41:29,115
I can't believe things worked out the way I wanted them to.

586
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,225
I came to take some rest, but I guess I should leave.

587
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,665
I won't disturb you guys.

588
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,395
Have fun.

589
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:43,605
Bye.

590
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:48,505
- She's really down-to-earth. - Seriously.

591
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,605
Is it because she lived abroad for a long time?

592
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,515
- Are you okay? - What? What do you mean?

593
00:41:58,773 --> 00:42:00,115
The fact that she found out.

594
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,285
Yes.

595
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:07,395
I think I'm okay.

596
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,445
Do you have something to say to me?

597
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:36,825
Are you done eating?

598
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:39,055
Yes.

599
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:45,025
What is it?

600
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,065
To be honest, I saw you in my neighborhood a couple days ago.

601
00:42:51,992 --> 00:42:54,705
And I noticed Tae Young taking you home.

602
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:57,905
Oh, that?

603
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:00,975
We coincidentally ran into each other,

604
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:03,185
and he took me home because it was too late.

605
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:05,815
I kept saying he didn't have to, but he insisted.

606
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:09,855
Is there a problem with that?

607
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:12,955
Ye Na...

608
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:16,095
apparently saw you with Tae Young yesterday.

609
00:43:16,951 --> 00:43:18,610
I think she thinks Tae Young...

610
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:21,080
broke up with Tae Hee because of you.

611
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:22,335
I mean,

612
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,405
it's true that I met up with him yesterday.

613
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:28,605
But I only met up with him to tell him...

614
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:32,405
that he should try to work things out with Tae Hee...

615
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,615
because Tae Hee seemed to be going through a hard time.

616
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:40,885
If you have something to say, you can be honest and tell me.

617
00:43:48,415 --> 00:43:50,595
To be honest,

618
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:54,195
I think I was always misunderstood this way.

619
00:43:57,758 --> 00:44:01,605
I guess it's not easy for me to get along with other girls.

620
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:11,185
I'm pretty sure she's from our school.

621
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,985
Could it be...

622
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,095
What were you doing that made you jump?

623
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:27,365
Nothing.

624
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:29,035
You punk.

625
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:31,865
You were watching something nice, weren't you?

626
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,720
Gosh, give it back.

627
00:44:34,728 --> 00:44:36,035
Let me see.

628
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:40,275
(The 35th photo of the prettiest girl in our school)

629
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:44,145
- Give it to me. - Let me see.

630
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:52,040
(Comments)

631
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:54,710
Today's photo is too weak. Thanks though.

632
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:56,210
She has the physique of an elementary school kid.

633
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:58,325
Hey, isn't this Soo A?

634
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:00,565
I don't know.

635
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:03,405
Gosh.

636
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:07,535
She must be a little out of her mind these days.

637
00:45:07,895 --> 00:45:09,775
I heard she got rejected by Kyung Seok.

638
00:45:10,064 --> 00:45:11,130
What?

639
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:13,815
She publicly confessed that she likes him but got rejected.

640
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:15,345
Really?

641
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:20,815
We must've misunderstood her until now because of her looks.

642
00:45:24,244 --> 00:45:26,795
Should I call her out later and make her feel better?

643
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:30,480
You should call her.

644
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:32,150
Don't say that I'm here.

645
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:34,880
It might be uncomfortable for her...

646
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:36,050
since she and I flirted with each other before.

647
00:45:36,056 --> 00:45:38,535
Okay. I'll see you later.

648
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:42,460
Hey, just try it. Trying won't harm you.

649
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:44,805
You'll try calling her, right?

650
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,815
- Bye. - Bye.

651
00:45:58,145 --> 00:45:59,425
Kyung Hee.

652
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:03,580
Oh, hello.

653
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:05,625
Your dad wants to talk to you.

654
00:46:09,156 --> 00:46:11,705
What is it? Make it quick.

655
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:18,305
Delete all the videos you posted online.

656
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:21,515
Those Lovely Do videos.

657
00:46:23,103 --> 00:46:24,985
It's all over the internet, so I can't.

658
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:26,670
You can't?

659
00:46:26,673 --> 00:46:29,585
I may delete them on my account, but I can't do anything with the rest.

660
00:46:30,377 --> 00:46:31,625
You...

661
00:46:33,614 --> 00:46:36,665
My slogan is the mayor for ordinary people.

662
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,265
How could you show that expensive bag on your stream?

663
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:41,395
I never asked you for it.

664
00:46:41,688 --> 00:46:44,835
You gave it to me, and now, it's my fault for getting caught?

665
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:49,875
Fine.

666
00:46:51,765 --> 00:46:53,160
Isn't there any way?

667
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,645
No. I'll go, bye.

668
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:11,725
I guess we can only hold hands on the bus.

669
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:16,605
Where are we going by the way?

670
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,605
Somewhere far away.

671
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:21,335
Then you won't feel anxious.

672
00:47:29,403 --> 00:47:30,630
Hey.

673
00:47:30,637 --> 00:47:32,215
Can't you use the other hand?

674
00:47:41,181 --> 00:47:42,495
Hello?

675
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,195
Yes, I'm on my way to somewhere after school. What is it?

676
00:47:47,654 --> 00:47:49,350
Is that right? Okay.

677
00:47:49,356 --> 00:47:51,865
Be careful. Bye.

678
00:47:53,594 --> 00:47:55,405
- Was it Hyun Jung? - Yes.

679
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,445
She's going to her parents' house.

680
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:00,375
When is she coming back?

681
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,175
Tomorrow.

682
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:19,095
If you're...

683
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:21,835
uncomfortable being outside...

684
00:48:24,324 --> 00:48:26,035
I mean, you're always anxious.

685
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:36,845
Do you want to...

686
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:39,085
go to my house?

687
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:41,955
Well...

688
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,525
That's not a bad idea.

689
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:47,155
Okay.

690
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:49,225
Let's go then.

691
00:49:02,296 --> 00:49:06,475
If you have something to say, you can be honest and tell me.

692
00:49:15,142 --> 00:49:16,385
Hello?

693
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:21,825
Oh, hello.

694
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:23,125
Hey.

695
00:49:23,483 --> 00:49:25,665
You weren't expecting to get a call from me, right?

696
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:31,290
I had no idea I'd end up calling you either.

697
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:33,705
But I saw something strange,

698
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,835
so I thought I should tell you.

699
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:38,730
What is it?

700
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:41,245
Let's meet up if you have time.

701
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:42,945
Now?

702
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,585
We can do it later if you're busy right now.

703
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:47,985
I just thought you should know as soon as possible.

704
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:00,335
Hold on.

705
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:02,295
I'll stop by somewhere.

706
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:04,605
- Where? - Wait inside.

707
00:50:06,026 --> 00:50:07,590
- Okay. - I'll be right back.

708
00:50:07,594 --> 00:50:08,835
Okay.

709
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:17,045
- You're home. - Goodness.

710
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:18,830
Why are you so surprised?

711
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,155
Well...

712
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:25,385
- You're home. - Goodness.

713
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:27,180
Why are you so surprised?

714
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,495
Well...

715
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:31,150
What brings you here all of a sudden?

716
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:33,180
Mom missed you so much.

717
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:36,295
Come on. You're the one who wanted to come.

718
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:43,845
Everything...

719
00:50:44,364 --> 00:50:45,805
is fine, right?

720
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,760
Of course.

721
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:52,030
How's the relationship with your friends?

722
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,200
What are you talking about?

723
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:55,515
I mean...

724
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,470
We're wondering if you're doing great with your college friends...

725
00:50:58,478 --> 00:51:01,225
and if you have a boyfriend.

726
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,565
How many candles would you like?

727
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,950
Just one big candle is fine.

728
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:12,165
Okay.

729
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:26,815
This is alcohol-free, right?

730
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:28,715
Right.

731
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:36,565
Are these for sale too?

732
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,010
No, those are just for decoration.

733
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:40,665
Can't you sell these?

734
00:51:40,787 --> 00:51:41,995
Pardon?

735
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:44,405
I don't think there will be glasses for wine.

736
00:51:45,425 --> 00:51:47,935
I guess you're going over to your girlfriend's house.

737
00:51:48,628 --> 00:51:49,905
Yes.

738
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,060
I'll make it an exception then.

739
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:53,675
Just pay for the glasses.

740
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:55,475
Thank you.

741
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,825
(Mi Rae)

742
00:52:09,216 --> 00:52:10,780
My parents are here.

743
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:13,025
I'll call you back. I'm sorry.

744
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:23,405
You should've come with Hyun Jung to see us.

745
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,105
Why would you stay here alone?

746
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:28,075
I have a lot of stuff to do.

747
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:30,330
You have a lot of things to do in the summer break?

748
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:32,415
This and that.

749
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:37,625
There are a lot to do about the lab field study.

750
00:52:37,644 --> 00:52:39,170
Do they give you homework too?

751
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:43,465
Yes, so you should leave for today.

752
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,195
You said you didn't have dinner yet. Let's eat dinner together.

753
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:52,065
Now that I think of it, I ate with my friends on the way here.

754
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,460
No wonder why I felt full.

755
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:55,420
Your friends, who?

756
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:58,260
What do you mean? My college friends.

757
00:52:58,265 --> 00:53:01,130
Your college friends, who? Whom are you close with?

758
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:03,685
You wouldn't know even if I told you their names.

759
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:05,915
I wouldn't...

760
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:08,285
except for the boy named Do Kyung Seok.

761
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:11,940
It's because I'm curious to know...

762
00:53:11,945 --> 00:53:14,455
who are on my daughter's side.

763
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:18,595
- My side? - Stop the nonsense.

764
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:20,465
When will you visit our house?

765
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:23,195
Well, I'll visit soon...

766
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,265
when I'm done with the field study.

767
00:53:26,426 --> 00:53:29,930
So you should go for today.

768
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,090
Why do you keep trying to kick us out?

769
00:53:32,098 --> 00:53:34,000
I came here because I missed you.

770
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,485
What do you mean, I tried to kick you out?

771
00:53:37,604 --> 00:53:41,040
It's just that I don't want Dad to struggle from driving at night.

772
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,985
Driving is not hard. I can do it with my eyes closed.

773
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,095
You can't do that. How ridiculous.

774
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:49,710
I'm just saying.

775
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:52,510
No one can drive with their eyes closed. How ridiculous.

776
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:54,895
It's frightening just to think about it.

777
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:58,350
You always have to be careful in driving even if you're used to it.

778
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:01,405
Gosh, I'm aware of it more than you are.

779
00:54:02,295 --> 00:54:03,875
It's done.

780
00:54:04,498 --> 00:54:05,960
Do you need anything else to be fixed?

781
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:07,275
No.

782
00:54:14,808 --> 00:54:16,000
Hey.

783
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:19,355
You're here. Have a seat.

784
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,625
Well, do you want a beer?

785
00:54:27,554 --> 00:54:28,795
Sure.

786
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:31,665
- We'll get two pints of beer. - Sure.

787
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:35,005
What did you want to talk to me about?

788
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:40,975
It might be because I'm overly sensitive,

789
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:43,785
but actually...

790
00:54:44,437 --> 00:54:45,715
Jo Jung Yeob!

791
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:50,655
- Gosh, what's he doing here? - Hi, Soo A.

792
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:53,085
Gosh, you're such a backstabber.

793
00:54:55,815 --> 00:54:58,625
Chan Woo, I have to talk to Soo A about something.

794
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:00,665
- Excuse me. - Yes.

795
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,280
- A pint of beer, please. - Sure.

796
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:03,605
Chan Woo.

797
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:06,265
Soo A, you must be stressed out.

798
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:07,975
But you know what?

799
00:55:08,028 --> 00:55:10,190
Kyung Seok is handsome, but that's about it.

800
00:55:10,196 --> 00:55:11,975
He'll drive you crazy.

801
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:13,715
I think you're way too good for him.

802
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:16,245
Let's talk outside.

803
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,500
What's your problem?

804
00:55:17,504 --> 00:55:18,830
Just come with me.

805
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:21,485
What is this about? Soo A, I'll be right back.

806
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:25,670
- Let go! - Just come with me.

807
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,540
- Let go of me! - Come on, let's talk.

808
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:30,710
- What is your problem? - Gosh, seriously.

809
00:55:30,717 --> 00:55:32,710
- Leave, please. - What?

810
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:34,220
Didn't you see the look on Soo A's face?

811
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,195
You make her uncomfortable.

812
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:40,935
Hey, do you think you'll have a chance with her if I leave?

813
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:43,690
I have more of a chance than you do.

814
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:45,290
Let's be honest. Since the mop incident,

815
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:48,030
no girl at our school has been talking to you.

816
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:49,275
What?

817
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:51,370
Don't meddle in and cause a scene. Just leave.

818
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,300
- Leave already. Gosh. - That little...

819
00:55:54,307 --> 00:55:55,515
Hey!

820
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:10,405
(What's that photo? Is it Hyun Soo A?)

821
00:56:44,557 --> 00:56:46,020
Soo A, that was awkward, right?

822
00:56:46,026 --> 00:56:48,120
I should've asked him to leave right off the bat.

823
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:49,435
Gosh, what a nuisance.

824
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,675
What are these?

825
00:56:57,704 --> 00:57:01,315
That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.

826
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,555
I happened to see them while surfing the web.

827
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:07,055
By any chance,

828
00:57:08,248 --> 00:57:09,725
is that you?

829
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:14,895
- No. - It's not you?

830
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:16,395
No, it's not me.

831
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,565
Many girls in similar clothes would look like me from this angle.

832
00:57:20,326 --> 00:57:22,505
Well, that is true.

833
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:26,205
I'm just a little worried about you, that's all.

834
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,430
Hey, come out for a minute.

835
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:31,745
My gosh, what is the matter with you?

836
00:57:31,905 --> 00:57:33,640
I was just going to leave quietly,

837
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,000
but I can't because of your rude tone.

838
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:37,685
- Come out. - What is your problem?

839
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:40,525
Soo A. Hey, wait. Soo A!

840
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:43,040
You made her leave!

841
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:45,725
Soo A, you don't have to date me. Just don't date this jerk.

842
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:47,295
- What? You piece of... - Gosh.

843
00:57:47,654 --> 00:57:49,080
- What did you say? - Gosh, let go.

844
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:50,565
You jerk.

845
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,365
Hey. Hey, you little...

846
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:54,860
- Gosh, let go. - You'd better let go.

847
00:57:54,861 --> 00:57:56,135
You let go first.

848
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:02,975
Who could it be? Who took the photos?

849
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,845
What is this about?

850
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:06,955
Who on earth did such a thing?

851
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:29,935
They left. I'm sorry.

852
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:53,325
Yes, I'm coming.

853
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,985
I'm sorry.

854
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:19,285
What's that?

855
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,455
I got you something.

856
00:59:28,388 --> 00:59:30,605
Thank goodness you didn't bring a TV.

857
00:59:35,595 --> 00:59:37,345
This is how Hyun Jung and I live.

858
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:41,175
I know. I carried you home a little while ago, remember?

859
00:59:44,504 --> 00:59:46,145
I laid you down on your bed.

860
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,655
Why don't you have a seat?

861
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:01,465
Oh, no. Not there.

862
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:03,495
Sit over there.

863
01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:19,145
Did you make this?

864
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:20,770
Yes.

865
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:23,015
- At home? - Yes.

866
01:00:29,616 --> 01:00:31,680
- Aren't you hungry? - A little.

867
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:33,080
Shall we order some food?

868
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:35,495
Jjajangmyeon would get here the quickest.

869
01:00:35,688 --> 01:00:37,205
Let's eat whatever you have.

870
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:38,665
Whatever we have here?

871
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:41,735
- We can order if you have nothing. - Oh, well...

872
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:45,605
I do have some side dishes that my mom made.

873
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:50,075
This is just a feeling I'm getting,

874
01:00:50,937 --> 01:00:53,215
but I think Mi Rae is hiding something from us.

875
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,940
She's done it before, you know.

876
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:57,925
Even when something happened at school, she never told us.

877
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:00,525
We only found out later on through her teacher.

878
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:03,140
If her teacher knew that much,

879
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:05,180
I bet there were many other things that happened.

880
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:07,935
Don't be so negative.

881
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:10,150
That only happened because they were too young.

882
01:01:10,156 --> 01:01:12,520
I'm sure there's no bullying at colleges.

883
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:15,275
I just think it's strange that she kept trying to make us leave.

884
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:18,975
I wonder if she did that to hide her stress from me.

885
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:22,075
We should've stayed longer.

886
01:01:22,535 --> 01:01:24,645
Or we should've just brought her with us.

887
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:26,115
Shall we turn back?

888
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,315
Forget it.

889
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:31,925
Maybe she just wanted some alone time.

890
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:34,825
Let's just go home.

891
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:41,165
- Is it good? - Yes.

892
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:44,735
Eat up. There's more food.

893
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:48,260
Your mom made these for you though.

894
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:49,720
I can't eat them all.

895
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:52,305
It's okay. You can eat them all.

896
01:01:57,603 --> 01:01:59,145
This is the first time...

897
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:02,385
we're eating together since we started dating, right?

898
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:04,485
Yes, I think it is.

899
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:11,095
- I'm sorry. - Stop saying that.

900
01:02:11,784 --> 01:02:13,095
Sorry...

901
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:18,865
What should we do when we're done eating?

902
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:21,575
Shall we watch a movie?

903
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:26,605
It'll take a couple of hours to finish a movie.

904
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:30,075
Then we can do whatever you want to do. I don't care.

905
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:32,515
I can't really think of anything.

906
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:37,610
Do you want to try making a scented candle?

907
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,985
I'll teach you.

908
01:02:40,046 --> 01:02:41,255
Sure.

909
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,635
Stir this. I'll mix the scents.

910
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:56,335
Okay.

911
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:04,985
Like this?

912
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:07,115
Yes.

913
01:03:15,848 --> 01:03:17,195
By the way,

914
01:03:18,184 --> 01:03:19,825
when did you start liking me?

915
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,805
When I found out that you never laughed at me.

916
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:38,345
So it's been a while.

917
01:03:43,076 --> 01:03:44,325
What about you?

918
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:48,855
- Maybe at the frosh week event. - The frosh week event?

919
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,295
When I was dancing?

920
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,595
No.

921
01:03:57,623 --> 01:03:59,835
When Kim Chan Woo was giving you a hard time.

922
01:04:00,927 --> 01:04:02,335
It made me so angry.

923
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,555
All the pieces have to melt evenly. Keep stirring.

924
01:04:17,944 --> 01:04:19,185
Hey.

925
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:22,125
I'm fine.

926
01:04:22,815 --> 01:04:25,725
You're obviously not fine. Come here.

927
01:04:35,328 --> 01:04:36,635
Are you dumb?

928
01:04:36,996 --> 01:04:40,675
You should've been careful. Why did you touch it?

929
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:43,460
It wasn't that hot.

930
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:46,015
Still, you have to cool it down under cold water for a long time.

931
01:04:46,439 --> 01:04:48,585
Burns are so painful.

932
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:58,025
Do we have ice cubes?

933
01:05:27,413 --> 01:05:28,895
You're wearing that perfume.

934
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:34,935
I used to hate this scent so much.

935
01:05:38,357 --> 01:05:39,665
But I like it now.

936
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:28,315
