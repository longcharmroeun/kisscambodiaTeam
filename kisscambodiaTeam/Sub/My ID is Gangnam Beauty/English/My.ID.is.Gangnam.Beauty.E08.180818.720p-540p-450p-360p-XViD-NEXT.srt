1
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:14,535
This doesn't work.

2
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:16,635
It looks like your dad blocked the card.

3
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,690
To be honest,

4
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,515
I can pay you for all the help I've gotten from you.

5
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,560
But I can't hire you.

6
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,285
I really can't afford it.

7
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,385
Why did you have to pack up and leave the house?

8
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,095
I don't even know anymore.

9
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:40,125
Can I go to a housewarming party empty-handed?

10
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:45,465
Can you give me one of those instead of paying me?

11
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:50,835
Whose housewarming party are you going to?

12
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:52,675
A senior in my department.

13
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,415
It's not brand new,

14
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,585
but it was bought recently.

15
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,625
- What? Are you lending it to me? - No.

16
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:16,695
It's a gift.

17
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,305
- Isn't it good? - Yes.

18
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:32,490
We'll do it. You should have some too.

19
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,085
It's okay. I'll do it. Don't worry about me and eat up.

20
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:37,000
How manly.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,885
Thank you for the food, Woo Young.

22
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:46,370
- I'll do it. - Don't worry. It's okay.

23
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:47,725
Give me that.

24
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:51,640
Look at this.

25
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:54,135
He even cut the meat into bite-sized pieces. How thoughtful.

26
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,835
Yes.

27
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:13,615
Are you making japchae or what?

28
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,225
I'll just do it.

29
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:23,735
You should eat. Eat up.

30
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:34,090
I'll hold on to the TV for now. Take it back whenever you need it.

31
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,420
It's too much as a gift.

32
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,920
Woo Young, do you not watch TV?

33
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,290
I can watch shows on my phone. I don't want to pay the license fee.

34
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:42,060
Me neither. But Hyun Jung keeps saying we should get a TV.

35
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,515
What?

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,930
Mi Rae is thrifty to the point that it's annoying.

37
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:47,430
Even when we're buying daily necessities,

38
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:50,270
she has to buy them online at the cheapest prices.

39
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm the same way. I only buy things on hot deals.

40
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,765
Me too. There's a flash sale tomorrow morning.

41
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:56,340
The weekly special sale is cheaper.

42
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:59,140
Well, bulk deals are way cheaper.

43
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:00,980
A bundle of 2L-bottled waters is only 1.5 dollars.

44
00:03:00,984 --> 00:03:02,505
Are you serious?

45
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,350
Then let's place orders together to go over 30 dollars

46
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:07,250
when we don't have much to buy.

47
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:09,475
Great idea. Then shipping will be free.

48
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:13,015
You two are so excited.

49
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,290
Oh, if you want to watch a movie,

50
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:17,045
do it on the last Wednesday of each month. You'll get 50 percent off.

51
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,015
You're so impressive.

52
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,155
It's nothing to be impressed with. I'm broke, so I have to be frugal.

53
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:28,525
I go for buy-1-get-1-free deals at convenience stores.

54
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,035
When you buy one, you can get another one for free.

55
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,105
What a downer.

56
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:49,985
Isn't that a guitar?

57
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:54,730
Can you play the guitar?

58
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:56,185
A little. It's just my hobby.

59
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,525
- Show us. - Yes, please.

60
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,765
I'm not good enough.

61
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,110
- Show us. - Show us.

62
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:06,340
- Show us. Show us. - Show us. Show us.

63
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,435
I'll show you another time. I really mean it.

64
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:13,075
Show us, please.

65
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,720
(Episode 8: Basic Instinct)

66
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,145
That was great.

67
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,760
Just leave it. I'll wash the dishes later.

68
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:29,115
It's okay. I can finish this quickly.

69
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:37,895
I'll do it.

70
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:50,805
- Shall we take the garbage out? - Yes.

71
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:04,015
Kyung Seok is very different from what I thought he'd be like.

72
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,660
He gets along with people well.

73
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:07,630
Why? Was he quite prickly back in middle school?

74
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,795
I wouldn't say he was "prickly" per se. How should I put it?

75
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,995
Shall I say he was unapproachable?

76
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:16,640
I can't believe a guy like that remembered Mi Rae.

77
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,135
I was so surprised.

78
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:29,875
I get that he hates his mom, but she's hospitalized.

79
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,315
He could visit her at least once.

80
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,845
Why did he come here instead?

81
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,295
You still haven't opened that yet?

82
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:05,745
I'll do it.

83
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,685
Let's meet up often since we're neighbors now.

84
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,455
How about watching a movie on the last Wednesday of every month?

85
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:17,755
- I'd love that. - Me too.

86
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,595
Mi Rae.

87
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,435
We need to watch a movie as well.

88
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:32,235
It's our assignment for Studies on Pop Culture.

89
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,250
Oh, right.

90
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,645
Let's watch a movie together.

91
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:42,545
It's just an assignment, so it'd be weird to turn him down.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,115
Sure.

93
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,970
You need to watch a movie and write a report on it, don't you?

94
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:52,140
Write the report as long as you can.

95
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,440
The professor might act like he doesn't care about the length,

96
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,065
but he still gives long reports good grades.

97
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:57,380
Thank you.

98
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,765
I knew that.

99
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:01,735
I already heard.

100
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,445
Does he want to watch the movie with just me...

101
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,885
or with other friends?

102
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,695
See you.

103
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,365
Do you want to meet up after school tomorrow?

104
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,280
Okay, sure.

105
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:35,650
My class finishes at 4pm.

106
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,950
My last class is at...

107
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:38,580
Aren't you done by 5pm?

108
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:40,705
Yes, my class finishes at 5pm.

109
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,720
Then I'll wait.

110
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:44,760
Okay.

111
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:47,715
What? Is it going to be just the two of us?

112
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,390
Where do you guys live?

113
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,255
We live up there.

114
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:56,970
See you.

115
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:58,325
Bye.

116
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,595
Bye.

117
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:21,385
They live really nearby.

118
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:32,355
I'm so happy for you, Mi Rae.

119
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,610
It's your first time watching a movie with a guy.

120
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,840
On top of that, it's with a really handsome guy.

121
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,965
We're just doing our assignment.

122
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,165
Do you think...

123
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:44,135
Kyung Seok likes you?

124
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,305
What do you think about him?

125
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:49,420
Are you not interested?

126
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,120
Fine, I'm interested in him. Okay?

127
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,320
How about we just call today our first day of dating?

128
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:56,530
My gosh, you touched your feet with those hands.

129
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,085
Stop it.

130
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,025
- My gosh. - Move.

131
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, hurry up and wash up.

132
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,440
Stop touching me with your feet. Stop it.

133
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,925
Go and wash up.

134
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,095
I'll wash first.

135
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:24,875
Let meet at Sinchon Cinetown...

136
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,675
at 6pm.

137
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,385
What?

138
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,985
This really feels like a date.

139
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:51,105
I think my business is failing.

140
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:55,205
How about you skip class tomorrow and go to the beach with me?

141
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,375
I have plans to watch a movie.

142
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,660
A movie? With who?

143
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:02,245
I need to do my assignment for Studies on Pop Culture.

144
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,385
You must have money to buy movie tickets.

145
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,530
- No, I don't. - What?

146
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,800
I don't have money. Lend me some.

147
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:15,325
My gosh, how did you end up penniless?

148
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,465
Here.

149
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:22,950
Lend me 50 dollars.

150
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:24,550
What are you talking about?

151
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,480
I also need money for popcorn and dinner.

152
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:28,390
Popcorn, my foot.

153
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:30,375
Be honest with me. You're going on a date, aren't you?

154
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,515
- It's just an assignment. - Sure, it is.

155
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,155
Hey, stop it.

156
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:53,395
(My first time watching a movie with a guy.)

157
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:05,415
(It's a date.)

158
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,145
It's not a date.

159
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,785
It's just an assignment.

160
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:20,300
(It's a date.)

161
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,310
It's just an assignment.

162
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,825
Let's see how this looks.

163
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:37,960
Hey, I...

164
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,290
I need to go to the bookstore.

165
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:42,260
I forgot to buy some reference books.

166
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,290
Should I go with you?

167
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,815
No. No, it's okay.

168
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:48,500
You... You need to get to class.

169
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:49,900
You should go first.

170
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,670
Okay, I'll see you later.

171
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:53,055
Okay.

172
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,495
Oh, I almost forgot.

173
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:58,695
Will you be home late since you're watching a movie with Kyung Seok?

174
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:03,110
I'm going to go home as soon as the movie ends.

175
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,475
What?

176
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:07,235
Were you also planning to do some other stuff?

177
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:10,145
Gosh, just go.

178
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:16,760
Mi Rae, you can come home late.

179
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,815
Just go. We're only going to watch a movie.

180
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:34,765
Are you looking for something?

181
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,350
I'm looking for pink lipstick.

182
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:39,080
The lipsticks are placed over here.

183
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:41,890
And you know there are so many different kinds of pink, right?

184
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,520
There's salmon pink, coral pink,

185
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:45,660
rose pink, magenta pink, and cherry pink.

186
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:48,715
Coral pink comes with both pearls and no pearls.

187
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,060
I see.

188
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,700
Gosh, you look like a peach.

189
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,730
- Pardon? - Don't you know your fruit?

190
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:56,530
Joy from Red Velvet looks like an apple,

191
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:57,970
and Sulli looks like a peach.

192
00:13:57,973 --> 00:13:59,500
You also look like a peach.

193
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,955
Really?

194
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:03,510
But you must not have a lot of experience putting on makeup.

195
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:05,340
You have a warm undertone,

196
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:07,365
but your makeup is for people who have cool undertones.

197
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,565
I see.

198
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:13,575
Just wait here. I'll fix your makeup for you.

199
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:16,075
Okay, thank you.

200
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:28,385
Girls start wearing makeup as soon as they enter middle school,

201
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:31,895
and that's when they also start perming their bangs.

202
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,565
But I had never done any of that.

203
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:37,540
What's this brand?

204
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:40,035
Look at the case. It's so pretty.

205
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,855
I was scared that others would make fun of my looks...

206
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:07,295
even after I wore makeup and permed my hair.

207
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:13,280
Gosh, you look so pretty.

208
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:17,180
Let's finish up by putting some lip gloss on you.

209
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:20,535
Gosh, you look so pretty and cute. Have a look in the mirror.

210
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:25,575
Look in the mirror and smile.

211
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:30,585
How pretty. You really look like a peach.

212
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,115
You're so pretty.

213
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:37,100
The cotton pads are 10 dollars.

214
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:39,040
The cotton pads are 10 dollars?

215
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,470
They're quite pricey, aren't they?

216
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:43,270
But if you buy over a certain amount,

217
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,110
you'll be getting a travel kit for free.

218
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:49,010
This actually costs over 30 dollars,

219
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:52,675
so you'll be saving 15 dollars if you buy all this.

220
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:07,455
Why did I buy this?

221
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:13,095
How many perfumes do I need to sell?

222
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:17,780
- Hey. - Yes?

223
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,380
Can you not tell anyone about what you saw that day?

224
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:22,410
What did I see?

225
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:24,535
We had an afterparty on the day of the festival.

226
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:28,890
Tae Young and I are slowly getting to know each other.

227
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:31,720
So please keep it a secret for now.

228
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:33,075
What exactly are you talking about?

229
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,730
The fact that I'm dating Tae Young.

230
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,745
You're dating Tae Young?

231
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,785
Be quiet.

232
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:41,825
Really? Are you serious?

233
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:45,440
You... Do you not remember?

234
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,825
I cannot believe this.

235
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:51,495
Hey, it's a secret. Don't tell anyone.

236
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,365
How did that happen?

237
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:00,735
You make me look forward to it

238
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:04,660
- When you walked me home - Walked me home

239
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,120
Give me

240
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:08,385
- A warm embrace - A warm embrace

241
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,155
You make my heart flutter

242
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,365
I'm not drunk at all.

243
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,635
Okay. So what is this about?

244
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,865
I've never done this in my entire life.

245
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:31,105
Don't laugh at me after hearing me out.

246
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,175
Don't laugh.

247
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,515
I like you.

248
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,400
- I told you not to laugh at me. - I didn't laugh at you.

249
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,985
Yes, you did. You laughed.

250
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:51,795
- I didn't mean it like that. - My gosh.

251
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,225
That's not it.

252
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:57,825
You fool.

253
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,875
What are you two doing?

254
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:10,545
Hey, I can't see.

255
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,445
Ye Na.

256
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:13,875
Well...

257
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,015
- You can't tell anyone, okay? - I got it.

258
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,365
You saw everything.

259
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,265
Come on, hurry up.

260
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,180
- Did you get everything? - Yes.

261
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:36,135
- Soo A. - Hello.

262
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,735
Hey, come in already.

263
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,820
You're the best, Hyun Soo A.

264
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:44,390
Soo A. Don't get a boyfriend.

265
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,620
I mean it.

266
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,090
I'm begging you, okay?

267
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,290
Hey, let's go.

268
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,890
Pretty ones have to be everyone's, okay?

269
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:52,515
Bye.

270
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,355
- Hello. - Hi.

271
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:06,165
You got home safely that night, right?

272
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:08,935
Sorry? That night? Yes.

273
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:10,680
You got home safely too, right?

274
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:13,320
I was so busy trying to take care of the drunk students that night.

275
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:14,750
I didn't get to see you off.

276
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,345
Being the student president is hard, isn't it?

277
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:19,645
It's not that hard.

278
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:24,315
If there's anything I can help you with, please tell me anytime.

279
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,315
Okay.

280
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:30,685
Call me when you want to grab a drink too.

281
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:34,795
What?

282
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,995
I'm a huge fan of yours.

283
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:40,565
Okay.

284
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:43,035
I see.

285
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,590
Is she sick or something?

286
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:56,615
No, she's just hungover.

287
00:19:56,765 --> 00:20:00,015
She drank with her friends from her hometown over the weekend.

288
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:04,500
I'm about to die. They'd better not come visit me again.

289
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:05,870
Did a lot of your friends come?

290
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:08,965
Hey, she said six guy friends came to visit her.

291
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:14,080
You have a lot of guy friends.

292
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,310
I only have guy friends.

293
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:17,710
But I don't have a boyfriend.

294
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,450
Is there anyone you like?

295
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,545
I like all of them, but I don't want to date them.

296
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:25,645
If I want to date them, I can't stay friends with them.

297
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,455
Help me up, please?

298
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,455
By the way, you look nice today.

299
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,010
What do you mean?

300
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,370
Why didn't you come to the afterparty, by the way?

301
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,035
You said you'd come even if it was late.

302
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,505
Something came up that night.

303
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,465
I understand then.

304
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,205
Let's go.

305
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:59,615
("Making 500,000 Dollars with 50 Dollars")

306
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:12,055
Are you already preparing for the finals?

307
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:17,225
No, I just needed to read up on something.

308
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:22,350
You left the afterparty early without saying bye.

309
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,905
Must I say goodbye?

310
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:26,075
I just had to do something.

311
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:31,675
(Kang Mi Rae)

312
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:36,760
Like what?

313
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,985
Something I had to do.

314
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:46,125
I thought you and I had become friends.

315
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:53,495
Kyung Seok, do you want to go watch a movie with me?

316
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:57,965
Let's do the assignment for the Studies on Pop Culture.

317
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,635
I'm already watching a movie with someone else.

318
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:03,775
- Who is it? - Kang Mi Rae.

319
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:08,845
I see.

320
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:19,855
Right now, I'm on my way to meet a guy friend.

321
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:44,105
Mi Rae.

322
00:23:46,428 --> 00:23:47,915
What are you doing there?

323
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,515
I didn't see you there.

324
00:23:55,637 --> 00:23:57,085
Which movie do you want to watch?

325
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,125
- I bought the tickets. - You did?

326
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,365
Good job, buddy.

327
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,165
How much do I owe you?

328
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:08,195
That's fine.

329
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,420
How can I help you?

330
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:22,415
- One original combo, please. - That'd be 8 dollars and 50 cents.

331
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,700
Hey, why are you paying for everything?

332
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:30,870
That's fine.

333
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:32,725
It's not fine.

334
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:49,150
It's 13 dollars and 25 cents.

335
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,905
I'll give you 25 cents later.

336
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,390
I said, it's fine.

337
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:55,385
Quit saying that.

338
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:58,555
Take it. Friends usually go Dutch.

339
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:15,535
Is it too early to go in yet?

340
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:17,305
We have some time left.

341
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,490
Oh, right. Don't we have to attach the movie ticket on our report?

342
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:27,875
Do we have to?

343
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,785
Probably?

344
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,425
- Should I split it in half? - You'll split it?

345
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:46,465
Then how about one of us submits a photo of it?

346
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,605
I'll take a photo, then.

347
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,175
Mi Rae.

348
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:29,075
Let's get a good mark on the assignment.

349
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:30,745
We can do it.

350
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,795
Oh, Soo A.

351
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:51,270
What are you doing here?

352
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,480
I came to drop off the pickles I made.

353
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,465
I told you I can take care of myself.

354
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:06,445
Gosh, don't walk so fast.

355
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,495
The apartment in Dogok-dong...

356
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:29,265
Was it all a lie?

357
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,575
Don't move.

358
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:39,475
I said, don't move. Try to stay still.

359
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:51,785
What is the message the director wants to impart through the movie?

360
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,795
Which elements excite the viewers and can make this movie a hit?

361
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:59,495
I should pick the most memorable scene.

362
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:02,305
Which scene would I want to watch again...

363
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:24,955
Why do I...

364
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,095
keep wanting to look at him?

365
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,045
It must be an instinct.

366
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,445
A basic instinct.

367
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:58,355
Our eyes are always drawn to pretty things.

368
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,625
It doesn't mean we have an affection for them.

369
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:04,025
We just can't help but stare at them.

370
00:29:07,983 --> 00:29:09,435
Instinctually, that is.

371
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,635
You don't want any popcorn?

372
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:49,705
Oh, right.

373
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,175
In most romantic movies, this is when...

374
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:33,285
This is usually how the plot unfolds.

375
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:36,625
You're not going to have any?

376
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,025
I'm going to eat some.

377
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:54,305
This trick allows you to prevent such an incident.

378
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:08,685
What are you doing?

379
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:13,095
What? You told me to eat popcorn.

380
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:15,765
I'm eating it now.

381
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:34,845
It was such a fun movie.

382
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:37,045
There will be a lot to write about.

383
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:40,885
I know.

384
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:45,855
Is it now time to part ways?

385
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:48,970
Aren't you hungry?

386
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:50,365
What?

387
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:51,980
Do you like pasta?

388
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,365
Pasta?

389
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:57,865
Isn't that what people usually eat on a date?

390
00:31:58,686 --> 00:32:00,205
We can have something else if you want.

391
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,305
It's okay.

392
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:04,845
I like everything. I'm an omnivore.

393
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,075
All right, then. Let's go.

394
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,095
This restaurant is so nice.

395
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,470
Have you been here before?

396
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:26,080
No, I found it online.

397
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,695
He looked up restaurants online?

398
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,305
To take me?

399
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,590
(I currently have 37 dollars left.)

400
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:47,585
(2 of the most expensive pasta will come to 28 dollars in total.)

401
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:54,600
(2 of the most expensive beverage will come to 12 dollars in total.)

402
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:58,265
(The grand total will be 40 dollars.)

403
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:00,635
I'll get aglio e olio pasta.

404
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,705
(Aglio e olio: 11 dollars)

405
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
(2 servings of aglio e olio equal 22 dollars.)

406
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:10,375
(The grand total will be 34 dollars.)

407
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,245
Excuse me.

408
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:15,930
Yes, what would you like to order?

409
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,615
We'll each get aglio e olio pasta and...

410
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,685
What do you want to drink?

411
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:22,170
I'll just stick with water.

412
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,555
Get something else. I'll get the lemon-flavored soda.

413
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,840
Then I'll get the same.

414
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,295
We'll get two of it, then.

415
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,125
Sure, no problem.

416
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:34,280
(2 glasses of soda will be 8 dollars in total,)

417
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:36,280
(so the grand total will be 30 dollars.)

418
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:37,680
Did you take a lot of notes earlier?

419
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:38,680
What?

420
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,375
You took notes while watching the movie.

421
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,375
Show me what you wrote.

422
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,290
You have to write about what you thought about the movie.

423
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:50,130
You shouldn't be influenced by my opinion.

424
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,000
I never said I'd copy what you wrote. I'm just curious.

425
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:56,155
What's there to be curious about? I just wrote down obvious things.

426
00:33:57,372 --> 00:33:58,725
Your handwriting.

427
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,825
I want to see what it looks like.

428
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:03,395
But why?

429
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:06,765
I'm just curious.

430
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:09,205
Do I have to have a reason?

431
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,745
Excuse me for a moment. I have to use the restroom.

432
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,865
Is it possible?

433
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:42,365
To think of a guy like that just as a friend.

434
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:46,505
Can someone like me really do that?

435
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:56,790
Isn't that guy so handsome?

436
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,315
Totally. Oh, my.

437
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,715
His girlfriend must be super pretty.

438
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:06,740
- He's really good-looking. - He's unbelievably handsome.

439
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:08,425
I know, right?

440
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:18,680
Why didn't you eat?

441
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:20,175
Because you weren't here yet.

442
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,985
Hey,

443
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:35,855
when's your birthday?

444
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,655
We're friends, but I don't know your birthday.

445
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:44,425
You want to know so many things. Just eat up.

446
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,610
I won't ever let myself...

447
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:49,635
get high hopes by telling him my birthday.

448
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:57,975
Then don't tell Woo Young either.

449
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,815
- Don't tell him what? - Your birthday.

450
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:46,370
(Searching for a roommate, Monthly pay: 100 dollars)

451
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:47,570
(I'm searching for a roommate...)

452
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,125
(who wants to live at a rooftop near our school.)

453
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,765
- Let's split the bill. - It's 30 dollars.

454
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:59,575
- Here you go. - Hey.

455
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:03,375
Why didn't you pay for the pork belly that Woo Young bought?

456
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:04,750
- What? - You didn't pay for that.

457
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:06,275
So why are you trying to pay for this?

458
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:10,360
That's because he's the one who invited us.

459
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:12,245
I'm the one who suggested to watch a movie...

460
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:14,055
and eat dinner together.

461
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:18,825
Goodbye.

462
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:22,865
Bye.

463
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,975
The weather forecast didn't say it would rain today.

464
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,215
I have seven dollars left.

465
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:44,445
Will that be enough to pay for the cab fare?

466
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:53,855
Just a moment.

467
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,635
Hello.

468
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:12,545
Can I have one more of this?

469
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:14,815
That's the only one we have left.

470
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,805
- You can take this. - What about you?

471
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,275
I can run to the bus stop.

472
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:45,645
Let's go together. I'll walk you there.

473
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,130
Let's go.

474
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,715
No, it's okay. It's too small for two people.

475
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,585
You can take it.

476
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,725
Then you take it.

477
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:07,335
Hey. Hey.

478
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:19,645
You're getting all wet. Get under here.

479
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,275
Then you'll get wet.

480
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:24,285
You should come closer.

481
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:47,735
The umbrella is so small, isn't it?

482
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,045
Yes.

483
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,515
Are you wearing perfume?

484
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,455
No, I don't wear perfume that often these days.

485
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,495
Is it because I told you that I don't like it?

486
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,865
Well, not exactly.

487
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,205
I...

488
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,505
went to the hospital that day.

489
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,445
What?

490
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,755
I met her.

491
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,900
I see.

492
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:38,555
Don't you want to know how it went?

493
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:41,455
I figured you wouldn't want me to ask.

494
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:48,035
How did it go?

495
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,275
It went quite well.

496
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:56,905
Really?

497
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,775
You should wear that perfume.

498
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,425
I'll do what I want. I'm not going to do as you say.

499
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,755
Forget it, then.

500
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,195
I'm relieved.

501
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:26,105
About what?

502
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:28,775
I'm relieved that you don't hate your mom.

503
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:36,885
Thanks.

504
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:39,615
No problem.

505
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:50,270
Seo Yoo Jin moved out of his apartment...

506
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:51,925
and is living at his bar.

507
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,540
Seeing that he moved out,

508
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,495
I'm guessing his business isn't doing that well.

509
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,935
So I'm worried whether he'll even be able to buy meals for Kyung Seok.

510
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,680
The elections are coming up soon,

511
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,535
but your kids are only causing trouble.

512
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:05,775
You must be going through a lot these days.

513
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,345
Do you know where Hye Sung lives?

514
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,145
Let's go there.

515
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,755
Okay.

516
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:22,865
It's...

517
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:25,425
not raining anymore.

518
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,665
You're right.

519
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:34,620
You should go now.

520
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:36,290
It stopped raining.

521
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,205
Here. You bought this.

522
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:41,645
Okay.

523
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:47,615
- See you. - Bye.

524
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:53,855
Wait.

525
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,080
Take it.

526
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,305
It might rain again.

527
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,215
Okay.

528
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:19,285
Thanks.

529
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,185
No problem.

530
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:25,325
I'm the one who should thank you for walking me all the way here.

531
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:30,365
See you.

532
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:37,435
I'll get a heart disease at this rate.

533
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:56,885
I definitely realized it.

534
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,425
I can't...

535
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,465
think of Kyung Seok as just a guy friend.

536
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,015
Stay healthy.

537
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:37,940
Who is it?

538
00:44:37,945 --> 00:44:39,965
Hello, Ms. Na Hye Sung.

539
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,040
Who is this?

540
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,750
I'm sorry to visit you at this hour. I know we haven't met.

541
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,335
My name is Jung Young Mo.

542
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:50,005
It's me.

543
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:10,625
What do you think you're doing?

544
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,825
Is this your way of getting back at me?

545
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,995
How did you find me here?

546
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,935
Did you have someone look into me?

547
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:19,975
Do you still have no respect for me?

548
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,535
That you would barge into my home in the middle of the night?

549
00:45:28,629 --> 00:45:30,145
Send Kyung Seok home.

550
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:33,015
- What? - Are you pretending to be clueless?

551
00:45:33,934 --> 00:45:36,925
After Kyung Seok met with you yesterday, he left home.

552
00:45:39,707 --> 00:45:42,455
You told him that I hit you...

553
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,195
when you saw him again after 10 years?

554
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:48,865
I didn't tell him that.

555
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,805
You didn't?

556
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:55,705
Only two of us know what happened between us.

557
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:58,375
Then you told him.

558
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:05,745
Where is Kyung Seok now?

559
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,370
If you know where he is, will you take him?

560
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,755
That's up to Kyung Seok.

561
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:16,155
Get out if that's all you came to say.

562
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,320
It's been 10 years since you last met, right?

563
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,775
- Keep yourself under control. - Yes, sir.

564
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:56,365
What's up this weather?

565
00:46:57,618 --> 00:46:59,065
Let's go.

566
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,205
Gosh, it's so uncomfortable.

567
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,515
You're back.

568
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:09,245
What are you doing?

569
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:14,060
How did you sleep on the couch? I almost fell when I turned.

570
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:15,815
I don't move when I sleep.

571
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:18,385
You should take the room tonight.

572
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:21,525
That's fine. Don't make me call 911 after you fall off there.

573
00:47:24,778 --> 00:47:28,195
I might move back home.

574
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,780
If I move back in after using up the deposit,

575
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,835
my dad really might kill me.

576
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:36,350
When will you go back?

577
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,575
I don't know. I should ask my mom first.

578
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,075
You should move back in too.

579
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,990
- Stop being a rebel. - I won't move back in.

580
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:46,460
If you don't, how will you get by?

581
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,985
I'll get a part-time job. I'll get a place too.

582
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,185
Just put up with me until then.

583
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:55,600
Hey, you think you're better than me, right?

584
00:47:55,609 --> 00:48:00,195
Making a living in this world isn't that easy. Got that?

585
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:04,665
Get the lights. I'm going to sleep.

586
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,520
Is there a specific job you'd like?

587
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:11,650
No.

588
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:14,790
No questions regarding your family or your personal life.

589
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:16,390
You can't submit the copy of your family registry.

590
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:18,245
No jobs that require you to talk a lot.

591
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,660
You can't work every day or overtime,

592
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,070
but you want a job that pays well?

593
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,485
Yes.

594
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:27,155
I think...

595
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:29,965
it'd be better if you look for a job yourself.

596
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:31,640
Pardon?

597
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:33,340
There must be a lot of job postings...

598
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:35,895
on the recruiting website or the school website.

599
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,580
- I'll go a little later. - Okay.

600
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:45,805
(Job Placement Office)

601
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:52,015
Why is he coming out of this office?

602
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,115
Why are you coming out of here?

603
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,085
Why did he come out of this office?

604
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:01,455
- Thank you. - Sure.

605
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:08,195
Ta-da.

606
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,865
Isn't this cool?

607
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,665
Here.

608
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,005
- Jung Ho. - Yes?

609
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:20,375
You know the expression, "Little strokes fell great oaks"?

610
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:22,930
That applies to trees, not to people.

611
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,145
Then you should give up on Kyung Seok.

612
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:27,715
- Why? - He's a person too.

613
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:31,385
You little runt!

614
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,025
I saw Kyung Seok coming out from the job placement office.

615
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:40,835
Why would he go there?

616
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,195
A rich guy wouldn't need a part-time job.

617
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:44,780
He's polishing up his reputation.

618
00:49:44,785 --> 00:49:46,880
Like even a son of a congressman has a part-time job too.

619
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,780
He's not a congressman anymore.

620
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,645
He will be a mayor soon.

621
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:03,625
That jerk, Kyung Seok. That explains his behavior.

622
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:14,095
What's up with this jerk? Why does he order me around?

623
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:32,215
Let's put some distance. Put some distance.

624
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:36,215
It won't be awkward after some time.

(Studio in Prime Location, Cool Studio for 600 Dollars a Month)

626
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:46,340
(Rooftop house near school, looking for a roommate)

627
00:50:46,346 --> 00:50:48,595
(The rent is 100 dollars. We'll discuss details in person.)

628
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:50,465
What are you doing?

629
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:59,120
Was the movie you watched yesterday fun?

630
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:00,475
Yes.

631
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,615
I'm a bit busy right now.

632
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:20,395
Drink this, buddy. Goodness.

633
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:26,280
Look at that. I've never seen him walk that fast.

634
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:28,805
It always looked like he was annoyed by everything around him.

635
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,250
What? He's even running now?

636
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:33,120
Hey, Do Kyung Seok is running. He's running.

637
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:34,875
What's going on? What is this?

638
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,545
Just like any other day, I'm talking to myself.

639
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,185
What are you doing?

640
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,185
Hey, didn't Do Kyung Seok wear that the other day?

641
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:50,370
That's not 55 dollars. It's 550 dollars?

642
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:51,825
Come on.

643
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:54,665
Buddy.

644
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:59,535
No matter how great it is, don't copy someone else.

645
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,135
I didn't say I was going to buy it.

646
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:03,305
I won't buy it.

647
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,905
"I won't buy it." It's more like you can't afford it.

648
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,485
Hey, you drink it.

649
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:13,060
What do you know about my family's finances?

650
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:15,660
Oh, my. How are the finances?

651
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:18,355
How are they? Tell me.

652
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,255
We're better off than yours.

653
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:30,965
What do you know about my family's finances?

654
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:33,220
If you keep skipping classes, you can't graduate.

655
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,480
Do you want to stay one more semester?

656
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,990
It's just that it's embarrassing.

657
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:40,575
Could you come to classes after being humiliated by a freshman?

658
00:52:41,528 --> 00:52:43,790
Then apologize to him like an upper class and clear the air.

659
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:45,490
Don't avoid him.

660
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,985
I should've done that then. It's too late now.

661
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:55,500
Is it true? Is Do Kyung Seok...

662
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,825
What?

663
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:58,895
Nothing.

664
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,565
What is this?

665
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:05,235
Unbelievable.

(Office of Chemistry Department, Teaching Assistant: Yeon Woo Young)

667
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:29,155
Long time no see.

668
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,825
Yes.

669
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,110
You've been well, right?

670
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:36,465
Yes.

671
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:40,735
I've been wanting to see you.

672
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,080
Can we talk for a second?

673
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:43,605
I'm busy right now.

674
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:46,405
You're busy.

675
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:49,020
Then I'll see you later.

676
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,385
Okay.

677
00:53:58,205 --> 00:54:00,755
Had I known, I wouldn't have done that.

678
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:07,865
You want to move into my place?

679
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:10,210
- Why? - I moved out.

680
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:12,665
You moved out, but you don't have a place?

681
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:15,405
- No. - If you moved out, why don't...

682
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:17,805
Did you run away from home?

683
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,220
I don't want a short-term roommate.

684
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:24,715
It's not short-term. It's long-term.

685
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:28,515
Take a seat.

686
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:38,725
Did you read up on the terms?

687
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:41,795
But as for the first month,

688
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:44,165
could you accept the TV I gave you as my rent?

689
00:54:44,184 --> 00:54:46,935
- Come again? - A microwave or a coffee maker?

690
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:50,305
I saw that you don't have either.

691
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,905
Do you have no money?

692
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,890
- I'll pay as soon as I get paid. - So you did run away from home.

693
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:57,445
I said I moved out to live on my own.

694
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:05,685

No, not yet.

696
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:12,325

699

00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:25,750
(Agreement)

(Yeon Woo Young, Do Kyung Seok)

702
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:33,715
Well, just pay 30 dollars more if you don't want to do housework.

703
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:39,355
I'll do it. I'll take care of all the housework.

704
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:47,295
Oh, it must be that way.

705
00:55:47,547 --> 00:55:49,910
Put the side dishes in the fridge and come back out quickly.

706
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,710
I should cut up the watermelon at least.

707
00:55:51,718 --> 00:55:53,565
They won't eat it if I leave it like that.

708

I can't park on the street for that long.

709
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:59,805
All right. I'll be quick.

My gosh, it's so nice to run into you like this.

713
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,855
Do you remember me?

714
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,525
Oh, yes. Hello.

715
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:22,095
- Hello. - Oh, hello.

716
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,110
Thank you so much for everything the other day.

717

Where are you headed? Get in. We'll give you a ride.

718
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:29,605
Oh, it's okay. I live right there.

719
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:33,405
Mom.

720
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:35,775
- Are you getting home now? - What's up?

721
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:39,345
- Hello. - Hi.

722
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:44,255
- He's a senior in my department. - Really?

723
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,755
You and my daughter are in the same department.

724
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:50,465
Yes, hello.

725
00:56:50,777 --> 00:56:53,095
- It's nice to meet you. - Likewise.

726
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:03,705
Does he live alone too?

727
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,175
Yes.

728
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:08,575
How old is he?

729
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:10,845
I guess he's around 26?

730
00:57:11,164 --> 00:57:13,045
So he's six years older.

731
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:15,960
Take some of these side dishes to him.

732
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:17,585
Oh, take some watermelon too.

733
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:19,155
To Woo Young?

734
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:21,555
He probably never buys watermelons because he lives alone.

735
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,410
I'll cut it up for you. Take some to him.

736
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,325
- Okay. - Hurry up already!

737
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:29,195
Can't he just drive around the block if he can't park?

738
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:31,735
Make sure you take it to him.

739
00:58:04,617 --> 00:58:06,010
Yes, Ms. Na.

740
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:09,005
- How have you been? - Good.

741
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,005
How are you feeling? Are you better now?

742
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:15,975
Yes, I'm fine now. Thank you so much for your help that day.

743
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:17,485
No problem.

744
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:23,185
How's Kyung Seok? Is everything well with him?

745
00:58:23,536 --> 00:58:26,355
Yes, he's doing great.

746
00:58:30,076 --> 00:58:32,895
I heard that you two finally met.

747
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,395
Yes, thank you for that too.

748
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:42,305
Well, could you give me Kyung Seok's number?

749
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,145
I forgot to ask him that day.

750
00:58:44,157 --> 00:58:46,005
Sure, I'll send it to you right away.

751
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:50,485
Okay. Take care. Bye.

752
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:57,685
(Do Kyung Seok)

753
00:58:57,737 --> 00:59:00,755
(Kang Mi Rae)

754
00:59:21,928 --> 00:59:23,275
Who is it?

755
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:25,115
Hey, Mi Rae.

756
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:30,525
My mom wanted me to give you this.

757
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,155
- Your mom? - Yes.

758
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,825
Take the containers. Come in for a few minutes.

759
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:46,610
Make sure you tell your mom that I thanked her.

760
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,005
Okay.

761
00:59:49,189 --> 00:59:51,450
You should put everything in the fridge as soon as possible.

762
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,805
Oh, right.

763
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:55,075
Let's see.

764
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:04,985
Hey, what are you doing here?

765
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:07,155
I live here now.

766
01:00:14,647 --> 01:00:15,995
What?

767
01:00:31,364 --> 01:00:35,630
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

768
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:37,530
Exactly in a month from now, your rent...

769
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:40,485
and half of the utilities are due. Also, we'll buy our own food, okay?

770
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:43,270
Look at that. Woo Young is so sweet.

771
01:00:43,276 --> 01:00:45,740
Don't you think that guy, Woo Young, likes Mi Rae?

772
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:47,080
- Hello. - Hello.

773
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,110
Hi.

774
01:00:48,114 --> 01:00:49,710
Then do you live with your grandparents?

775
01:00:49,716 --> 01:00:51,810
You suddenly have a lot of questions for me.

776
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:55,250
Do Kyung Seok and Hyun Soo A. They look so lovely together.

777
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:56,580
You haven't found a part-time job yet?

778
01:00:56,589 --> 01:00:59,005
Shall I set up an interview for you at the place I work?

779
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:02,275
You owe Mi Rae an apology, not me.
