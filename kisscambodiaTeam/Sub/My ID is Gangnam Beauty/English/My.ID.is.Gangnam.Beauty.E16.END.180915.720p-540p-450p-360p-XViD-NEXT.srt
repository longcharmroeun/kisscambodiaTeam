1
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:28,265
Are you surprised?

2
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:30,565
What?

3
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,775
Yes, a little.

4
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:40,975
- I'm sorry. - No.

5
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,845
It's not that.

6
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,285
Shall we...

7
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:54,995
go to bed now?

8
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,595
What?

9
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:01,095
What?

10
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,865
Gosh, that's not what I meant.

11
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:09,675
I meant that we should get some sleep now.

12
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,045
I didn't say anything.

13
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:25,125
I'll sleep here...

14
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:28,525
and take the first bus in the morning, so you should go in.

15
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,865
No, I'll go with you.

16
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,110
It'll be uncomfortable to sleep here.

17
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,365
No, it's not uncomfortable. It's fine.

18
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:40,065
At least get changed...

19
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,705
My dad's clothes will be too small for you.

20
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,245
I'm fine, so just go in and get some sleep.

21
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,915
You won't even get that much sleep.

22
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:54,255
All right, then.

23
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:58,455
You'll probably get no sleep if I don't sleep.

24
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:01,495
Sweet dreams.

25
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,195
All right, you too.

26
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:29,255
This feels surreal for some reason.

27
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:32,825
It's not a dream, but I feel as if I'm dreaming.

28
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:44,165
I had my first kiss.

29
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:25,245
Oh, right.

30
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,365
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,695
It's okay.

32
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,735
Good night.

33
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,505
You too.

34
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:18,885
She left her phone here.

35
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,455
(Mom)

36
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:35,405
(Mom)

37
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:45,815
Is everything really okay? I'm worried.

38
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:23,670
(Everything is fine.)

39
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:25,155
(Mom)

40
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,365
(Mom)

41
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:39,565
Hello?

42
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,335
Mi Rae. Hello?

43
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,420
Yes, hello.

44
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:49,275
My gosh, who are you?

45
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,485
- Please don't be surprised. - Who are you?

46
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:56,015
I'm Do Kyung Seok.

47
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:00,200
(Call Ended)

48
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,425
(Mom, Video Call)

49
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:09,750
Hello.

50
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:12,565
Why are you answering Mi Rae's phone?

51
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:15,905
She's asleep now.

52
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,805
What? Where?

53
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:19,745
In her room.

54
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:21,745
I'm in the living room now.

55
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:33,225
Well... Why are you guys there?

56
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:35,225
We were hanging out in the area...

57
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:37,125
and missed the last bus to Seoul.

58
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:39,595
Is it just the two of you?

59
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:41,595
Yes.

60
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,205
What's your relationship with her?

61
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,875
I'm her boyfriend.

62
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,135
- You? - Yes.

63
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,345
You and Mi Rae are seeing each other?

64
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,215
Yes.

65
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:58,460
So you're saying you two are in a relationship, right?

66
00:07:58,468 --> 00:07:59,815
Yes.

67
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,685
I'm sorry to surprise you like this.

68
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,525
What are you doing out here?

69
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,595
Then good night.

70
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:11,595
(Video Call Ended)

71
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:17,805
Who was that?

72
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:19,965
Mi Rae's boyfriend.

73
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,790
What?

74
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,305
Do you know who it is?

75
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,475
That super handsome guy!

76
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,675
(Mom)

77
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:59,275
So it's true.

78
00:09:00,663 --> 00:09:01,945
Hello.

79
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:05,445
- You're Mi Rae's boyfriend? - Yes.

80
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:07,685
I'm just going to say one thing.

81
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,215
There are CCTV cameras at our place.

82
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,755
Everything is being recorded.

83
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:16,955
Then bye for now.

84
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,145
What time is it now?

85
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:17,585
Oh, no.

86
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,685
I have to wash my face quickly and put makeup on again.

87
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:29,965
I didn't wash my face last night. It must've wreaked havoc on my skin.

88
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:34,905
It's still much better than showing him my bare face.

89
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:58,795
Why is he sleeping sitting like that? It must be uncomfortable.

90
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,305
Where are the CCTV cameras?

91
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:09,650
You woke up.

92
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,560
Where are the CCTV cameras?

93
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,945
CCTV cameras?

94
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,345
What are you talking about? Why would we have that at home?

95
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:26,885
What's wrong?

96
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,025
Did you have a nightmare?

97
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,695
I'll sleep for 10 more minutes.

98
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:49,675
Gosh, slow down. They already left.

99
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,330
Why did Dad tell such a lie? Kyung Seok couldn't sleep a wink.

100
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:57,115
Does he feel guilty about something? Why couldn't he sleep?

101
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:01,025
What's there to feel guilty about?

102
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,465
I guess you can't really talk now because he's right beside you.

103
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:06,880
Yes.

104
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:09,180
Then let's talk later. Bye.

105
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,535
Bye.

106
00:12:18,494 --> 00:12:20,075
Do your parents not like me?

107
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:22,575
You weren't sleeping?

108
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:25,685
That wasn't an ideal way to meet them for the first time.

109
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,000
Judging from how your dad told me that there are CCTV cameras,

110
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:29,855
he probably doesn't like me.

111
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,200
Should I not have answered the call?

112
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,295
Why? Are you worried?

113
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:36,855
Of course I am.

114
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,995
I've never seen you worried about how strangers might think of you.

115
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:45,565
How can I not be worried?

116
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:47,265
They're not strangers.

117
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,935
I mean, they're your parents.

118
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:55,075
They're just fascinated that I now have a boyfriend.

119
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:58,045
- That's all? - Yes.

120
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,685
So stop worrying and just get some sleep.

121
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:08,455
You didn't get much sleep either.

122
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:10,125
Aren't you tired?

123
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:13,095
A little.

124
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:19,465
- Rest your head on my shoulder. - What?

125
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:21,305
Rest your head here and get some sleep.

126
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:36,585
You should rest your head on me too.

127
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,925
What?

128
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:54,605
(Episode 16: Even Though We Don't Know Much About Life Yet)

129
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:56,650
It was obviously taken without her consent.

130
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,490
Why can't you delete it?

131
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,320
Are you the person in the photo?

132
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:01,675
Gosh, that's...

133
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:11,100
Can't it be shut down if it's a domestically hosted website?

134
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:14,140
We've also categorized it as a harmful website,

135
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:16,110
but it won't be easy to shut it down.

136
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,665
We could block the domain to prevent people from accessing the site.

137
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,295
Then...

138
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,350
what about photos that have already leaked?

139
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,750
And what if those photos are posted elsewhere?

140
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:27,180
We are trying to track them down to get rid of them.

141
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:29,520
Anyway, you can file a report on behalf of the victim,

142
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,845
but the victim will still have to give a statement.

143
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:23,795
Hello?

144
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:38,245
Hello.

145
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,175
Hi, it's been a while.

146
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,255
Who told you that this is me?

147
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,840
Jang Won Ho? Or Jo Jung Yeob?

148
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,155
Jung Yeob knows about this too?

149
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,155
Gosh, Jang Won Ho.

150
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,640
I can't believe he's spreading such groundless rumours.

151
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,795
No, he's not. Won Ho came to see me because he's worried about you.

152
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,850
And he promised that he won't tell anyone.

153
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:05,535
How can I believe that?

154
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,605
Soo A.

155
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:11,305
I don't want to make you anxious for no reason,

156
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:13,905
but wouldn't it bother you if you didn't do anything about it?

157
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:17,245
Wouldn't it be better to find out who did it and get him punished?

158
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,360
The police can only launch an investigation...

159
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:21,900
once they recognize it as a crime.

160
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,130
But I looked into it,

161
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,425
and it'll be hard in this case.

162
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:28,255
The victim has to come forward and give a statement.

163
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:30,695
The victim?

164
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,165
What?

165
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:36,010
I don't want to do that. I don't want people to think I'm weird.

166
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,250
Why would people think that?

167
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,980
The person who took and posted these is weird.

168
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,450
It may be that person's fault,

169
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,705
but weird rumours will spread about me.

170
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:45,860
The victims often end up being criticized...

171
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,760
when you report cases like this. Haven't you seen it?

172
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,175
The photos will spread even more.

173
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:52,015
So the police must investigate it as soon as possible to stop it.

174
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,300
The police can track down and delete the photos.

175
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,855
Every download is recorded, so they can track them down.

176
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:58,985
And...

177
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:02,495
let's ask the police to make sure rumours don't spread in the process.

178
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,180
As soon as they find out who did it, they'll summon the suspect,

179
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,595
so don't worry too much.

180
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:09,465
I don't want to do it.

181
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:14,535
I don't want to do anything.

182
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,875
Just leave me alone, please.

183
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:21,515
Bye, then.

184
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,915
Soo A, wait.

185
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,425
She was still asleep when I got home.

186
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:39,595
She just thinks that I got home late.

187
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,535
Shall we have dinner together after getting some rest?

188
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,450
Sure, let's do that.

189
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:47,735
See you later, then.

190
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,105
Okay, bye.

191
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:57,915
- Are you still there? - Yes.

192
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:01,970
- You can hang up first. - No, you hang up first.

193
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,130
No.

194
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,425
Fine, then I'll hang up first.

195
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,525
- See you later. - Okay.

196
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,995
I didn't know hanging up was this hard.

197
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,005
Hey, Eun.

198
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:37,915
What's up?

199
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,455
Apparently, Eun needs to talk to me about Soo A.

200
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:43,255
Can we meet tomorrow?

201
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:46,665
What more is there to talk about her?

202
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:49,295
Soo A isn't in a very good condition right now.

203
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,065
I'll just hear what's going on.

204
00:18:56,425 --> 00:18:59,245
- Don't go. - Don't worry.

205
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,645
I'll call after I'm done.

206
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:54,710
I guess she ended up hating you...

207
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,595
because of what she's been through.

208
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,505
I know.

209
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,975
I'm pretty sure she was really mean to you.

210
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:05,945
I can already imagine.

211
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:11,645
It was hard to accept it at first because I actually liked her.

212
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:18,885
Every time I was with her, I got really nervous...

213
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:21,825
because of how she pretty she is.

214
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:25,265
And when she referred to me as her friend,

215
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,665
I got really excited.

216
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:31,395
It's a bit embarrassing,

217
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,805
but having someone so pretty as a friend...

218
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:38,645
made me feel like I was that pretty as well.

219
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,415
Anyway, there's nothing I can do to help Soo A right now.

220
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,315
Plus, I don't really want to.

221
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:54,855
It's only natural that you feel that way.

222
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:56,955
But I feel like...

223
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,765
Soo A's life will change completely...

224
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,335
if you guys end up being friends in the future.

225
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:11,975
I couldn't even be in control of my own life until now.

226
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:15,215
So how do you think I'll be able to change someone else's life?

227
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:18,245
The scars you get from other people...

228
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:21,115
can only be healed by people.

229
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,330
I don't quite get it either.

230
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:25,925
But one thing for sure.

231
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:29,955
The one person that can heal Soo A...

232
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:33,525
is neither Kyung Seok nor anybody else.

233
00:21:35,817 --> 00:21:37,265
It's you.

234
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,405
Soo A isn't in a very good condition right now.

235
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,405
I'll just hear what's going on.

236
00:21:49,197 --> 00:21:51,175
Can she be less nice?

237
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:13,665
Is there something going on?

238
00:22:15,424 --> 00:22:16,835
No, it's fine.

239
00:22:22,664 --> 00:22:24,175
Hey, Kyung Seok.

240
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:27,685
Do you know anyone who stalks Soo A at school?

241
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:31,315
Won Ho?

242
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:35,595
Never mind. It's nothing.

243
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:47,965
- Hello? - Where are you?

244
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:50,835
I'm in Eun's neighbourhood. What's up?

245
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:55,315
You don't need to come pick me up.

246
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:01,655
Okay.

247
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:10,710
(I won't forgive her.)

248
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:12,295
I won't forgive her.

249
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:15,435
I'm not going to let her play around with me.

250
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:18,735
That brat only thinks she's all that because she's pretty.

251
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:21,035
I even know where she lives.

252
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:23,050
I'm going to do it tonight and show it to everyone.

253
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:25,175
(I'm going to do it tonight and show it to everyone.)

254
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:34,670
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

255
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,785
- after the tone. - My gosh.

256
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:45,765
Next time, I'll get you cat food.

257
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,265
You eat so well.

258
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,915
Do you also live in this neighbourhood?

259
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:10,785
You looked down on me.

260
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:12,525
What?

261
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:31,235
I want an apology.

262
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,385
It seems like Kyung Seok likes you way more than you like him.

263
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:47,785
That's not true.

264
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,240
We both like each other a lot.

265
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:54,025
A couple can't always like each other equally.

266
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:56,980
The person who likes the other person more tends to call more,

267
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:59,050
asks to meet more often, and gets angry at times.

268
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:00,250
They get angry?

269
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:02,335
You guys haven't fought yet, have you?

270
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:06,975
I think we fought before we started going out.

271
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:09,275
But I'm not sure if you can call that a fight.

272
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,045
Hey, Woo Young.

273
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:17,785
Soo A?

274
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:22,395
Yes, I live in the same neighbourhood as her.

275
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,925
Have you seen Soo A today?

276
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:28,110
Why do you ask?

277
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:31,010
I want to ask something, but I can't get a hold of her.

278
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,280
I know where she lives. Should I go check up on her?

279
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:34,765
No, it's okay.

280
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,135
You don't need to go.

281
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:39,205
Okay, bye.

282
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:42,975
I don't want to put her in danger as well.

283
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:47,045
Gosh.

284
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,555
I called to file a report.

285
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:54,185
Was that Woo Young?

286
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:57,755
Yes, he asked if I've seen Soo A today.

287
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,625
He said he needs to ask her something.

288
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:05,565
Hey, Kyung Seok. Do you know anyone who stalks Soo A at school?

289
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,505
Never mind. It's nothing.

290
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:14,875
Do you know where Soo A lives?

291
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:16,775
Yes.

292
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:25,125
What did I do to you?

293
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:29,155
I thought I only had a crush on you.

294
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:31,270
I need to gain a bit more weight to look pretty.

295
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,810
I have the body of an elementary school student.

296
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:34,240
Gosh, you've never dated anyone?

297
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,465
- Come on. - Don't lie.

298
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,805
Are you okay?

299
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:48,775
So I was going to give up.

300
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:51,445
But you were interested in me too.

301
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,330
What?

302
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,015
You said hi to me first.

303
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,885
You smiled at me.

304
00:26:57,939 --> 00:26:59,285
I did?

305
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,455
Hi, Dong Won.

306
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:08,895
Come to think of it, you two have the same name.

307
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,095
His name is Dong Won too.

308
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:14,650
That cat's name is the same as mine too.

309
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:17,305
No one really uses it to name a cat.

310
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:21,275
You named the cat Dong Won on purpose to draw my attention.

311
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:25,045
You enjoyed drinking the beverage I gave you.

312
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:28,015
You wanted to take pictures with me too.

313
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:30,615
(To Soo A)

314
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,685
Thank you for the drink.

315
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,140
Let me take a picture of you in that gown.

316
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,595
Why just me?

317
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:42,095
Take one for Dong Won too.

318
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,995
And you said you liked Kyung Seok in front of me.

319
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:49,805
You looked down on me.

320
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:52,490
You actually didn't like Kyung Seok, did you?

321
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,905
What are you saying?

322
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,445
Now, just anyone is picking on me.

323
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:05,015
You're mistaken.

324
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:09,570
You flirted with me,

325
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:11,155
and why are you acting like you didn't?

326
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:16,495
Please help...

327
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,865
Apologize.

328
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,535
You won't?

329
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:33,815
You know what this is?

330
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:47,725
What's wrong?

331
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,095
I don't know, but I'm having a bad feeling.

332
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:56,535
I think it came from that side.

333
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,745
Isn't that Dong Won?

334
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,825
Kyung Seok.

335
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:45,955
What have you done?

336
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:48,695
She didn't apologize.

337
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:50,325
What?

338
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:08,475
Soo A.

339
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,045
Soo A, are you okay?

340
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:14,830
Are you okay?

341
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:17,515
He splashed something on me.

342
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,185
- What? - I don't know.

343
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,455
He splashed something on me.

344
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,195
It's nothing.

345
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:31,410
It's okay.

346
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:32,835
Don't come.

347
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:35,435
Don't come.

348
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:38,805
Don't come.

349
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:41,405
Calm down.

350
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:44,545
It's nothing.

351
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,460
It's just water. See?

352
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:47,760
Check it yourself. It's water.

353
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,485
I said, go away.

354
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:55,855
I'm going to kill myself.

355
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:58,055
Soo A!

356
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:02,965
Put that down.

357
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,975
Soo A. Check.

358
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:11,335
Soo A, check.

359
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,575
Check yourself.

360
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,575
You're fine.

361
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:19,215
You're okay.

362
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:24,015
It's fine.

363
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:26,885
It's fine, Soo A.

364
00:31:30,178 --> 00:31:31,625
Put that down.

365
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:40,235
Give it to me.

366
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,175
Are you hurt?

367
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,715
Try standing up slowly.

368
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:55,315
Let go of me.

369
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:00,955
Why are you here?

370
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:03,155
Why you of all people?

371
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,725
Why does it have to be someone like you who's helping me?

372
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:09,965
I didn't ask for your help.

373
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:12,565
Why do you keep acting like you're above me?

374
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:17,035
Why do you keep acting like you're happier than me?

375
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:23,245
You aren't even prettier than me.

376
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:30,785
Please...

377
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:32,955
Please stop it now.

378
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:37,855
Seriously...

379
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:42,010
I hate you so much too.

380
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,710
You're seriously annoying, you know that?

381
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:45,705
It feels like I'm talking to a wall.

382
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:49,050
Right, I'm not pretty.

383
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,320
I did plastic surgeries.

384
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,805
Like you said, I wasn't happy because I wasn't pretty.

385
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:54,475
But what about you?

386
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:56,675
Are you happy because you're pretty?

387
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,675
Are you happy?

388
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:02,455
Why does it have to be this way?

389
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,785
Why in the world do we have to be like this?

390
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:12,265
We lose weight when we aren't even fat.

391
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:15,695
We throw up and do plastic surgeries...

392
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:20,135
as if we'll die if we aren't pretty.

393
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,505
We give marks on people's faces...

394
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:32,175
and fight ourselves.

395
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:42,755
Why on earth do we have to be like this?

396
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:47,725
I...

397
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,365
I don't want to do it anymore.

398
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:55,435
I really don't want to.

399
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:57,635
I...

400
00:33:58,326 --> 00:33:59,605
I will...

401
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:03,675
think over about what will make me happy...

402
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:06,545
again from now on.

403
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:13,885
I will do that.

404
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,305
Yes, Soo A is all right.

405
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:36,945
She's surprised quite a lot, but she is fine.

406
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,445
She's asleep now, so don't worry too much.

407
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:43,915
Sure.

408
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:49,855
Are you okay?

409
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:53,225
Yes.

410
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,435
Look.

411
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:06,375
Can I keep Soo A's side for a while?

412
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:15,415
Don't you hate her?

413
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:18,515
I do.

414
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:21,985
You hate her too.

415
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:24,155
But you helped her a while ago.

416
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:28,325
- That's because... - Can I do that?

417
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:32,735
It's up to you. Do as you please.

418
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:37,135
Thanks.

419
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:44,875
- I'll call you later. - Okay.

420
00:35:57,745 --> 00:36:00,025
What a horrible punk.

421
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:02,395
What will happen to him?

422
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,480
What do you mean? After the police investigation,

423
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:05,950
he'll be kicked out of school.

424
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:08,235
We'll have to see how it'll be dealt with legally.

425
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:14,105
Are you waiting for Mi Rae?

426
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:16,875
No, I was waiting for you...

427
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:19,145
to go back together.

428
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:23,330
What's this sudden sweetness?

429
00:36:23,337 --> 00:36:24,715
It's not all of a sudden.

430
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,455
I even brushed your teeth when you were drunk the other day.

431
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:30,855
What?

432
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,825
- Let's go. - Wait up.

433
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:35,410
What are you talking about? When?

434
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,580
When you came home drunk.

435
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,110
You brushed my teeth?

436
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,665
Yes, I made you breakfast too.

437
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,735
Oh, that day.

438
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,405
Come to think of it,

439
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:48,575
there was too much sweetness.

440
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:50,675
You didn't really brush my teeth for me, did you?

441
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:52,045
I really did.

442
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:54,145
You must have a strong stomach.

443
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:55,815
It was disgusting.

444
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,355
I thought you left.

445
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:09,195
I'll stay by her side.

446
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:13,435
Okay.

447
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:17,335
You can call me whenever you need me.

448
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,305
Okay.

449
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:40,825
You fool.

450
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:46,065
You turned out to be a bigger fool than me.

451
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:49,835
Let's stop...

452
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,975
living the way we used to.

453
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:09,315
What kind of photo was uploaded on the internet?

454
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:10,630
I didn't get to see it.

455
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:12,785
It was a photo of someone from behind.

456
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:15,155
But we're not sure if it's Soo A or not.

457
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,955
I heard her face showed a little.

458
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:23,495
Her phone's turned off, and she won't answer.

459
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:27,335
I thought we were friends, but she hasn't even contacted me.

460
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:30,020
If you were her friend, why did you badmouth her so much?

461
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:32,675
Hey, I'm not the one who spread all those rumours.

462
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:34,690
Everyone already knew about her throwing up...

463
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:36,275
and meeting all the guys from our department.

464
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:40,845
Anyway, Soo A has such a bad image now. I feel sorry for her.

465
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,785
I heard she isn't even from a rich family.

466
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:44,585
Who told you that?

467
00:39:46,507 --> 00:39:49,325
When we were at the lab, Dong Won suddenly...

468
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:52,425
came up to me at the bathroom and told me that Soo A was a fake.

469
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:54,925
What does he know?

470
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:56,780
Isn't he a little weird?

471
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:59,665
Look at you. You have a habit of badmouthing people.

472
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:01,950
- Just eat this. - What?

473
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:05,050
He's really weird. He can't even look at anyone in the eyes.

474
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:06,405
Gosh.

475
00:40:06,727 --> 00:40:11,190
I hope he gets locked up in prison for the rest of his life.

476
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:14,645
I know it makes you feel uneasy, but don't worry too much.

477
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:17,415
He'll be prohibited from approaching you once he gets released.

478
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:20,200
And you'll feel a lot better if you continue...

479
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,455
to receive psychotherapy.

480
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:28,225
I really don't get why I need to go through...

481
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:30,195
something like this.

482
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:32,395
From now on,

483
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:35,735
I don't think I'll be able to stay alone.

484
00:40:35,956 --> 00:40:39,905
Do you have anyone you can lean on?

485
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:43,575
Is there anyone that can keep you company for a while?

486
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:46,945
I thought I did,

487
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:51,615
but not anymore.

488
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:54,585
(Counselling Office 2)

489
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:59,195
Yes, of course. Okay.

490
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:01,025
Okay, bye.

491
00:41:05,786 --> 00:41:07,135
Soo A.

492
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:13,905
What's wrong? Did you not expect me here?

493
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:20,445
I'll keep you company for a while...

494
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,715
if you're not too uncomfortable with that.

495
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:36,165
That place sells the best cakes.

496
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,295
Let's go eat there sometime.

497
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:44,235
No one knows about what happened.

498
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:47,005
I'm telling the truth.

499
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:51,175
We all know how to keep to ourselves.

500
00:41:51,398 --> 00:41:54,715
That goes for Woo Young, Kyung Seok, and Mi Rae.

501
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,485
You too.

502
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:06,525
I was going to keep to myself,

503
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:10,495
but I want to tell you this.

504
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:14,165
Apparently,

505
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:17,635
Mi Rae really liked you at first.

506
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,705
She told me that you called her a friend.

507
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:24,375
She said that made her feel really excited.

508
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:39,540
Thanks, Eun.

509
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:42,025
Don't mention it. It's no big deal.

510
00:42:47,955 --> 00:42:49,650
I think he recognizes you.

511
00:42:49,657 --> 00:42:52,535
Yes, I feed him from time to time.

512
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:54,075
He eats really well.

513
00:42:56,764 --> 00:42:58,475
You must like cats.

514
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,245
Yes, I do.

515
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:11,645
Did you hear? Kyung Seok and Mi Rae are a couple.

516
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:12,325
- Since when? - Since the summer vacation.
Did you hear? Kyung Seok and Mi Rae are a couple.

517
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:13,525
- Since when? - Since the summer vacation.

518
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:16,295
They started dating as they went to Kelun together.

519
00:43:18,018 --> 00:43:19,765
I should've registered for that.

520
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,065
Do you think that would've made you become Kyung Seok's girlfriend?

521
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:25,490
Mi Rae got really lucky.

522
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:27,820
I know, right? She must've saved her country in her past life.

523
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:29,290
I feel so jealous.

524
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:31,575
- Right? - I'm jealous too.

525
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,345
It's unbelievable.

526
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:35,515
Everyone, they're here!

527
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:41,300
- We finally have a couple. - My gosh, you guys.

528
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:42,870
Are you guys really dating?

529
00:43:42,877 --> 00:43:44,455
My gosh.

530
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:48,895
Yes, we're dating.

531
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:51,295
- My gosh. - Unbelievable.

532
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:53,665
Kyung Seok's so straightforward.

533
00:43:55,956 --> 00:43:57,935
- I guess it's true. - My goodness.

534
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:02,745
- Mi Rae. - Ta-da.

535
00:44:02,997 --> 00:44:04,575
I'm so jealous.

536
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:07,145
My gosh.

537
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:11,430
Don't kiss each other in class.

538
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:12,855
Gosh, stop it.

539
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:18,055
Okay, I won't kiss her in class.

540
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,725
Does that mean you'll kiss her after class?

541
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:29,320
You didn't have to respond to that.

542
00:44:29,323 --> 00:44:31,135
You told me to be nice to people.

543
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:42,145
I'm going to apply for an exchange student program next month.

544
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:43,900
Is your GPA above 3.50?

545
00:44:43,904 --> 00:44:46,770
Hey, do you also think pretty girls...

546
00:44:46,774 --> 00:44:49,055
will naturally have bad grades?

547
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:52,395
I didn't think you'd be so biased. I'm disappointed in you.

548
00:44:52,846 --> 00:44:55,210
I never really thought you were that pretty.

549
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:56,695
I was just asking.

550
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:58,680
What's for lunch today?

551
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:00,765
Is that what you're most curious about?

552
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:04,405
Aren't you all curious about it? You're just not asking.

553
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:06,790
Come to think of it, you may be right.

554
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:08,020
I always wonder,

555
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:10,190
but I never ask because I know you will.

556
00:45:10,197 --> 00:45:11,575
Right?

557
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:15,985
Am I the only one who can't seem to relate to what you're saying?

558
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:32,835
I'm sorry.

559
00:45:33,854 --> 00:45:36,235
- For what? - I'm sorry...

560
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:38,835
for hurting you.

561
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:41,675
Forget it. It's all in the past now.

562
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:44,845
You can't do anything about your feelings.

563
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:47,315
Yes, I know.

564
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:50,415
I can't control my heart as I want.

565
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:55,085
I keep thinking about you.

566
00:45:59,313 --> 00:46:00,625
Is that right?

567
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:03,565
How sad.

568
00:46:03,684 --> 00:46:05,635
I don't really think about you.

569
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,735
There are those people who look amazing at first,

570
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:14,275
but turn disappointing after going out with them.

571
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:17,545
That's the case for you.

572
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:22,285
So I've gotten over with you quickly.

573
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:26,355
Don't be so upset. Bye.

574
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:35,525
Woo Young.

575
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:40,665
Do you have some time to talk?

576
00:46:41,588 --> 00:46:44,205
There isn't anyone among seniors,

577
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:48,705
so they want me to be the student president for the time being.

578
00:46:50,064 --> 00:46:51,845
Tae Young, that punk.

579
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:54,430
It can't be helped if there isn't anyone.

580
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:57,215
Don't cause trouble and do a good job until the re-election.

581
00:46:57,237 --> 00:46:58,585
Okay.

582
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:00,385
By the way, Woo Young,

583
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:08,595
do you know her? She's the prettiest girl in the dance department.

584
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:10,580
I don't.

585
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:12,565
You don't? She's famous.

586
00:47:14,154 --> 00:47:16,635
I'm not sure. Why do you ask?

587
00:47:17,224 --> 00:47:20,220
She wants to have a blind date with you.

588
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:22,360
She came to our building for her liberal arts class and saw you.

589
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:23,745
You'll do it, right?

590
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:27,215
- No. - Why?

591
00:47:27,868 --> 00:47:29,330
Have you gotten a girlfriend?

592
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:30,985
That's not it.

593
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:33,955
I'm the type who should fall in love at first sight.

594
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,755
Tell her that I'm sorry.

595
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:42,795
She isn't like a model, but she's so cute.

596
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:50,635
He really is like a pine tree in this area. He never changes.

597
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:53,990
Who in the dance department?

598
00:47:53,994 --> 00:47:55,220
Goodness.

599
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:57,845
Who is it? Set me up with her instead of Woo Young.

600
00:47:58,465 --> 00:47:59,830
Don't talk to me.

601
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,145
Hey.

602
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:04,685
Hey, both of us are at fault, so let's make up already.

603
00:48:07,207 --> 00:48:08,885
Things never go well for me this year.

604
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,125
Hyun Jung.

605
00:48:15,582 --> 00:48:16,865
Hyun Jung.

606
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:19,965
Are you going home?

607
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:21,835
Hello.

608
00:48:22,923 --> 00:48:24,405
What's wrong? Did something happen?

609
00:48:24,758 --> 00:48:27,205
Will you buy me a drink?

610
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:30,445
Well, okay.

611
00:48:42,676 --> 00:48:44,540
My senior said it was his friend,

612
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:46,410
so I thought my blind date was in his 20s.

613
00:48:46,413 --> 00:48:49,495
But he turned out to be 33 years old. I can't believe this.

614
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:52,880
It's not like we've grown to like each other from friends,

615
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:57,235
how could a 33-year-old man asks for a blind date with a freshman?

616
00:48:57,457 --> 00:48:58,790
He has no conscience.

617
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,420
That was wrong of him.

618
00:49:01,428 --> 00:49:04,290
He should've revealed his age first.

619
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,445
I mean, I'm not asking for much.

620
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:10,015
I want to meet an ordinary man and have an ordinary relationship.

621
00:49:10,404 --> 00:49:11,915
Why is it so hard?

622
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:15,800
No relationship is ordinary in this world.

623
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:17,425
Every romance is special.

624
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:23,395
I wonder whom you'll go out with.

625
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:26,465
I'm not sure about that either.

626
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:39,945
How will you change this exponential function into a logarithm function?

627
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:42,585
Where did you get your surgeries done?

628
00:49:43,237 --> 00:49:45,215
This is time to study.

629
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:46,555
Let's see.

630
00:49:47,107 --> 00:49:50,125
If you change it into a logarithm function,

631
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:51,655
it'll be like this.

632
00:49:52,346 --> 00:49:54,325
Did you get all of them done at once...

633
00:49:54,648 --> 00:49:56,265
or one by one?

634
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:00,580
Can't you focus because of my face?

635
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:03,250
That's not true. You're the best tutor...

636
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:05,335
of all my past tutors.

637
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:07,405
Is that right?

638
00:50:07,928 --> 00:50:09,405
Let's go back to the question.

639
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:13,260
Switch X and Y here.

640
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,545
Then...

641
00:50:15,535 --> 00:50:17,015
it'll be like this.

642
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:18,400
How much did it cost?

643
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:20,900
Look here, seriously.

644
00:50:20,907 --> 00:50:23,970
I'm explaining the concept here. It's important.

645
00:50:23,977 --> 00:50:24,970
Okay.

646
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:27,040
You remember symmetric transformation?

647
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:29,265
- Mi Rae. - What is it again?

648
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,310
Can I go to the toilet?

649
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:32,635
What?

650
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:35,605
Okay, go ahead.

651
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:44,975
Calm down, Mi Rae.

652
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:48,545
You need to earn money to buy Kyung Seok's birthday gift.

653
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:55,085
Your brother is like the legend itself.

654
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:57,025
He's that handsome?

655
00:50:59,513 --> 00:51:00,910
What do you want to have?

656
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:03,695
It's on me, so tell me anything you want.

657
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:06,295
He's such an ideal brother.

658
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:08,065
By the way,

659
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:10,835
what is that?

660
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:14,305
My ID.

661
00:51:14,394 --> 00:51:16,775
(I'm Taken.)

662
00:51:22,235 --> 00:51:23,815
I just arrived.

663
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,385
Hold on.

664
00:51:26,073 --> 00:51:28,455
Take your time. I'll wait.

665
00:51:30,844 --> 00:51:31,870
(Do Kyung Seok, Chemistry)

666
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,340
Hey, this is upsetting.

667
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:34,725
My goodness.

668
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:37,810
What is?

669
00:51:37,818 --> 00:51:39,595
Am I just your college friend?

670
00:51:40,954 --> 00:51:44,720
You mean this? I was thinking of changing it,

671
00:51:44,725 --> 00:51:47,075
but I wasn't sure how I should change your name in my phone.

672
00:51:48,662 --> 00:51:50,575
What's my name in your phone?

673
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:53,445
Whatever.

674
00:51:54,368 --> 00:51:56,515
Come on. Tell me.

675
00:51:57,637 --> 00:51:59,415
"Kang Mi Rae, Chemistry".

676
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:04,855
Are you upset?

677
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:08,695
Okay, I'll change it.

678
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:11,995
What should we do on Saturday? You have any plan with someone?

679
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:17,235
If you don't, how about we go somewhere?

680
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:23,275
Okay.

681
00:52:24,264 --> 00:52:26,345
This Saturday is your birthday.

682
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:28,230
Are you 33 years old?

683
00:52:28,235 --> 00:52:30,215
- No. - No?

684
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:32,600
I'm sure you'll be with Mi Rae that day.

685
00:52:32,606 --> 00:52:34,085
Come visit me some time.

686
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,685
I'll buy you a drink.

687
00:52:39,246 --> 00:52:42,740
When do girls get bored of their boyfriends?

688
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:44,065
What?

689
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:48,265
What are you talking about? Are you already on bad terms with Mi Rae?

690
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:49,935
No.

691
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:53,605
I'll call you later.

692
00:52:55,295 --> 00:52:56,575
Bye.

693
00:52:58,465 --> 00:52:59,845
You're here.

694
00:53:05,939 --> 00:53:07,670
You're wearing the perfume I gave you.

695
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:10,525
I spray only a little at a time to save it.

696
00:53:10,577 --> 00:53:12,955
I'll buy you another one when you run out of it.

697
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:15,040
When is your birthday?

698
00:53:15,048 --> 00:53:18,865
Me? It's September 25.

699
00:53:19,186 --> 00:53:20,580
Mine is in September too.

700
00:53:20,587 --> 00:53:21,680
Really?

701
00:53:21,688 --> 00:53:23,005
It's September 15.

702
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:26,605
I'm 10 days older than you.

703
00:53:29,296 --> 00:53:31,075
All right, be my brother then.

704
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:36,885
Has she forgotten about it?

705
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:41,070
You can't work part-time forever.

706
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:43,840
Why don't you try your father's business...

707
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:45,570
and see how it is first? You can quit after then.

708
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:47,625
You haven't even started yet.

709
00:53:50,116 --> 00:53:52,765
Do you want to visit my dad's workplace with me?

710
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:58,335
Can anyone go there?

711
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:02,105
They welcome anyone there.

712
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,645
Why are we here at church all of a sudden?

713
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:11,315
Dad.

714
00:54:12,405 --> 00:54:13,885
Hi, Yoo Jin.

715
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:16,385
Your father?

716
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:20,940
Who is she?

717
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:23,095
She's my junior from college.

718
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:27,480
Hello, I'm Choi Jung Boon of the chemistry department.

719
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:28,835
Chemistry?

720
00:54:29,856 --> 00:54:31,905
Isn't Kyung Seok in that department too?

721
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,505
- That's right. - Right.

722
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:38,675
You said business, so I thought...

723
00:54:39,432 --> 00:54:43,300
You must be torn. I know how much you like drinking.

724
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:46,785
I know. That's a problem to begin with.

725
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:52,955
I'm sorry to you and our children.

726
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:55,495
I've realized that I was wrong.

727
00:54:57,918 --> 00:55:00,535
Tomorrow is Kyung Seok's birthday,

728
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:03,265
so how about we dine out all together?

729
00:55:06,693 --> 00:55:08,675
I guess it's too soon for us to do that.

730
00:55:09,563 --> 00:55:11,145
Is that what you wanted to say?

731
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,745
No.

732
00:55:14,968 --> 00:55:16,885
I hope you know about this one thing.

733
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:21,385
I've loved only two women in my life.

734
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,625
The 26-year-old Na Hye Sung,

735
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:26,925
and the 46-year-old Na Hye Sung.

736
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:35,165
I'm 47.

737
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:36,605
What?

738
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:44,945
Well...

739
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:58,870
- Sang Won. - Hey, why...

740
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:01,425
You fired me, so I'm no longer your staff.

741
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:04,995
Oh, yes. You're right.

742
00:56:08,388 --> 00:56:11,350
About the thing with Kyung Hee, I'm sorry I took it all out on you.

743
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:13,205
Gosh, don't you worry.

744
00:56:13,293 --> 00:56:15,405
Thanks to you, I found a better job.

745
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:19,090
I'll tell my new boss, Congressman Kim Young Bae,

746
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:22,615
to take good care of you.

747
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:30,455
Take care of yourself, okay?

748
00:56:57,037 --> 00:56:58,385
It's not her.

749
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:00,855
I thought it was her.

750
00:57:08,014 --> 00:57:11,495
What? Did I sleep through the class?

751
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:15,065
Mi Rae.

752
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:17,835
- Yes? - Were you sleeping?

753
00:57:17,924 --> 00:57:20,290
Yes, I must've dozed off.

754
00:57:20,293 --> 00:57:21,805
You didn't answer my call.

755
00:57:22,629 --> 00:57:24,875
I think I was fast asleep.

756
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:30,485
What's this?

757
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:33,900
What is this?

758
00:57:33,907 --> 00:57:35,755
Someone must've left it while you were asleep.

759
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:40,295
Come on. It must've been you.

760
00:57:40,413 --> 00:57:43,295
- No, it wasn't me. - Whatever. You can't fool me.

761
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:45,795
It really wasn't me.

762
00:57:51,558 --> 00:57:53,805
It really wasn't you?

763
00:57:56,262 --> 00:57:57,875
It's a perfume.

764
00:57:58,565 --> 00:58:00,645
Someone else must know you as well as I do.

765
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:06,055
I have to go. I have a class.

766
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:09,185
Call me after class.

767
00:58:09,275 --> 00:58:10,825
I have a shift right after class.

768
00:58:14,314 --> 00:58:15,795
What is going on?

769
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:17,895
Who left this here?

770
00:58:21,855 --> 00:58:24,305
Gosh, it's Kyung Seok's birthday tomorrow.

771
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:42,355
It's been a while.

772
00:58:45,478 --> 00:58:47,125
How did you know that I work here?

773
00:58:48,948 --> 00:58:51,495
It's all over social media.

774
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:53,665
You're famous.

775
00:58:56,723 --> 00:59:00,005
Now, I browse the Internet and even check those things.

776
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:01,905
Are you feeling better now?

777
00:59:04,197 --> 00:59:06,575
It feels weird to hear you worry about me.

778
00:59:09,435 --> 00:59:10,915
I'm taking a leave of absence.

779
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:13,785
At the moment, I don't know when I'll return to school.

780
00:59:14,774 --> 00:59:17,170
I figured I'd have no reason to see you anymore.

781
00:59:17,177 --> 00:59:18,725
Is there something you want to tell me?

782
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:21,095
Yes.

783
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:24,895
I thought I should get the facts straightened out.

784
00:59:25,985 --> 00:59:27,365
You see,

785
00:59:27,854 --> 00:59:30,905
I never liked you, even for a second.

786
00:59:38,398 --> 00:59:39,775
I'll be off, then.

787
00:59:43,136 --> 00:59:46,215
By the way, are you wearing perfume now?

788
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:47,855
Yes.

789
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:52,155
I tried something I had never done,

790
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:54,325
and everything else became easy.

791
01:00:43,963 --> 01:00:45,375
Hey.

792
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:48,615
I don't even know who gave it to me. What am I supposed to do?

793
01:00:48,735 --> 01:00:51,415
- Is it my fault? - I didn't say anything.

794
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:54,085
What can I do? I'm dating a popular girl.

795
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:56,855
I even changed your name on my phone.

796
01:00:57,243 --> 01:00:58,555
Look.

797
01:01:00,747 --> 01:01:02,725
(Kyung Seok)

798
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:08,565
We're good now, right?

799
01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:10,735
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

800
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:12,835
Well, yes.

801
01:01:14,827 --> 01:01:16,305
By the way, where are we going?

802
01:01:17,363 --> 01:01:20,415
It's a beautiful day. We should go on a picnic.

803
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:22,715
- A picnic? - Yes.

804
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:30,955
A table for two?

805
01:01:30,977 --> 01:01:34,140
Yes, we have a reservation under Do Kyung Seok.

806
01:01:34,147 --> 01:01:36,065
I see. This way, please.

807
01:01:44,324 --> 01:01:45,875
Please have a seat here.

808
01:01:47,827 --> 01:01:52,775
(Happy Birthday, Kyung Seok.)

809
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,585
Hey.

810
01:01:56,736 --> 01:01:58,215
You probably thought I forgot.

811
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:14,765
No, don't do that.

812
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:20,190
- Don't do it. - Whatever, I'm doing it.

813
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:25,730
Happy birthday to you

814
01:02:25,732 --> 01:02:30,045
Happy birthday, dear Kyung Seok

815
01:02:31,337 --> 01:02:34,885
Happy birthday to you

816
01:02:37,777 --> 01:02:39,125
Blow out the candles.

817
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:44,195
Happy birthday.

818
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:47,935
And...

819
01:02:52,425 --> 01:02:53,775
This is for you.

820
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:56,990
You acted like you totally forgot about it.

821
01:02:56,996 --> 01:03:00,090
I've always wanted to throw a surprise birthday party like this.

822
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:02,145
There are so many things you've wanted to do.

823
01:03:04,137 --> 01:03:05,415
Thanks.

824
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:09,225
Open it.

825
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:22,135
- Do you like it? - It doesn't matter...

826
01:03:27,226 --> 01:03:28,605
I like it.

827
01:03:29,896 --> 01:03:34,845
Oh, last but not least...

828
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:37,045
Ta-da!

829
01:03:45,478 --> 01:03:46,755
All right.

830
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:51,195
1,2,3!

831
01:04:00,426 --> 01:04:01,805
You see,

832
01:04:02,061 --> 01:04:05,060
I used to rate people on the streets...

833
01:04:05,064 --> 01:04:07,945
purely based on their looks.

834
01:04:11,237 --> 01:04:13,355
But I stopped doing that at some point.

835
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:16,225
I thought everyone looked at me and judged me...

836
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:20,325
because I was doing the same to others,

837
01:04:23,716 --> 01:04:27,265
but I realized not that many people are interested in me.

838
01:04:35,628 --> 01:04:37,875
This would be a nice spot to propose later on.

839
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:40,515
What?

840
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:45,755
Places like cafés either change or shut down eventually, you know.

841
01:04:47,273 --> 01:04:48,925
But it won't happen with this place.

842
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,665
Because of my parents,

843
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:58,865
I thought I'd never get married.

844
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:16,115
You see, the hoodie...

845
01:05:17,236 --> 01:05:18,715
I bought one for myself too.

846
01:05:20,306 --> 01:05:21,585
Good.

847
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:50,445
Hey, the Do-Rae couple!

848
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:52,430
Don't make it so obvious, okay?

849
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:54,285
- We'll be late. - Hey, wait.

850
01:05:57,076 --> 01:05:59,540
Let's leave, just the two of us

851
01:05:59,545 --> 01:06:01,925
Wearing matching hoodies

852
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:03,895
Are you two on your honeymoon or what?

853
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:10,065
Should I not have bought one for myself?

854
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:13,405
Who cares? Do everything you want to do.

855
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:37,095
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

856
01:06:48,427 --> 01:06:50,275
(We thank Jeon Jin Gi for his guest appearance.)

857
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:13,665
(Thank you for watching My ID is Gangnam Beauty.)
