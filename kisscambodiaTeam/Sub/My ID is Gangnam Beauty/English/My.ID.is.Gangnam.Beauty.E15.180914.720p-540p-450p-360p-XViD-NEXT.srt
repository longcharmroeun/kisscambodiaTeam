1
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,195
You're wearing that perfume.

2
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:34,305
I used to hate this scent so much.

3
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:39,045
But I like it now.

4
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:11,405
You smell nice too.

5
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:16,345
But I'm not wearing any cologne.

6
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:19,985
There's this scent I always smell when I'm around you.

7
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,665
By the way, what's this smell?

8
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,465
What smell?

9
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:40,975
Oh, no.

10
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,330
My gosh, we ruined it all.

11
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:54,055
All of the water has evaporated.

12
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,855
Don't touch it. It's still hot.

13
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:02,655
I'll clean it up.

14
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,695
Let's eat the cake after that.

15
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,605
Okay.

16
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,275
- Why is there only one candle? - It's the first time for us both.

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,985
Shall we blow the candle?

18
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:26,515
Sure.

19
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,115
In 1, 2, 3.

20
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:42,180
Bottoms up.

21
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:43,535
What?

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,535
It doesn't contain any alcohol.

23
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,485
Here.

24
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:01,500
What is it?

25
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,315
I got it for you.

26
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,965
I wanted to thank you.

27
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,965
You waited for me even when I rejected you twice.

28
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,005
Open it.

29
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,485
- Thanks. - Don't mention it.

30
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:50,850
Hey, Yoo Jin.

31
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,080
- Where are you? - What?

32
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:55,505
Are you okay? What happened with that girl?

33
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,605
Why are you talking so loudly?

34
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,690
Because it's loud in here.

35
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,530
How did things go with her?

36
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:02,915
Didn't it work out?

37
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,545
No. It...

38
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:08,885
worked out.

39
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:12,025
Then you should've told me.

40
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:13,925
Who is she?

41
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,695
I'll call you later. Bye.

42
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,435
Hey, wait.

43
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,535
Gosh, why won't he tell me who she is?

44
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:30,975
It was Yoo Jin.

45
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:33,075
He was with me when I drank that night.

46
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,815
What do you think he'll say...

47
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,000
if he finds out?

48
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,715
He probably won't say much.

49
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:41,885
I'm sure he'll congratulate us.

50
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:47,395
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

51
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:52,565
To be honest, I'm scared about people finding out.

52
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,035
But...

53
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:58,465
it's kind of sad that we have to keep...

54
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,075
hiding from people.

55
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:05,645
And I feel sorry for locking you up like this.

56
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,245
That's fine.

57
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,915
Should we just tell everyone?

58
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,825
I want to tell people.

59
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:22,240
Hyun Jung, Woo Young, and your mother.

60
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,395
We already have three people rooting for us.

61
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:29,350
I think that's already a good enough number.

62
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:32,665
Don't force yourself. I'm okay with this.

63
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,675
No.

64
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:38,145
I think I can do it.

65
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:54,025
(Episode 15: My boyfriend is Do Kyung Seok.)

66
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,725
You can do it, Mi Rae.

67
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:31,595
Good luck.

68
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,135
What are you doing?

69
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:43,835
What?

70
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,845
Nothing.

71
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:02,195
Hey, you guys are coming to school together.

72
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:04,895
- Yes. We're... - My stomach hurts. Bye.

73
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,710
He only mentioned that we came in together, so it's awkward...

74
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,135
to tell him that we're dating.

75
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,280
Don't try to force anything.

76
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:14,720
Just tell anyone who asks.

77
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,035
Okay.

78
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:22,475
But I feel like no one will ask.

79
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,255
I guess not a lot of people are interested in us that much.

80
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,225
- Let's go. - Okay.

81
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:43,595
- Hello. - Hi.

82
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:48,750
Eun, are you close with Soo A?

83
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:49,750
Pardon?

84
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,205
What kind of person is she?

85
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,090
Why do you ask?

86
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:56,475
I saw her meeting Tae Young in private a few days ago.

87
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:57,815
I saw them together.

88
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:58,930
What?

89
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:02,385
And apparently, Jung Yeob and Chan Woo fought over her yesterday.

90
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
She told everyone that she likes Kyung Seok,

91
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:07,825
but she's going around meeting so many other guys.

92
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,640
Isn't that a little weird?

93
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:10,925
Well...

94
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:14,595
I'm not really sure.

95
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,780
Let's just ask Soo A directly.

96
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:21,275
Do you think she'll tell us the truth?

97
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,375
It's weird that Tae Young isn't even answering my calls.

98
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,475
Soo A, where are you now?

99
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:40,400
Soo A.

100
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,310
You look pretty from every single angle.

101
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:46,595
Can you not take photos of me without permission like this?

102
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:49,735
Isn't it illegal to take photos without asking for permission?

103
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,665
Bye.

104
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:07,970
What is it that you need to say?

105
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,800
Do you still take photos of me without asking for permission?

106
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,200
- What? - You secretly took photos of me.

107
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,370
You're the one who uploaded all those photos on the web, right?

108
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:16,925
No, that's not it.

109
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,635
I only sent it to a couple of my close friends.

110
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:27,405
Should I report you to the cops and make you become a criminal?

111
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,590
A criminal?

112
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,075
You had hopes about me and took your revenge.

113
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,245
I knew you were a dork, but I didn't know you'd be this bad.

114
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,045
Hey.

115
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:42,215
Is there something going on over there?

116
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,185
It's nothing.

117
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:54,010
Delete all the photos you uploaded.

118
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:56,095
And you better not tell anyone.

119
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,665
What?

120
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:08,145
My gosh, I can't believe this.

121
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,555
(Delete)

122
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:19,725
(Delete)

123
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,165
(Delete)

124
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,505
Hey, Soo A.

125
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:41,915
You never really liked Kyung Seok,

126
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:44,285
did you?

127
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,445
What are you talking about?

128
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:49,085
What a joke.

129
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:03,280
You've been learning how to find your own personal scent.

130
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,380
And today, you'll finally be making your own perfumes...

131
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:07,690
by using what you've learned until now.

132
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,350
So go ahead and get started.

133
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:10,675
- Okay. - Okay.

134
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,460
Don't think too much.

135
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:15,315
Just try making one using your favorite scents.

136
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,515
I don't think...

137
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:22,585
I'm really fond of perfumes.

138
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:23,830
Why not?

139
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,955
I think the natural body scent is better than perfume.

140
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,155
Natural stuff are always better than artificial stuff.

141
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:33,465
Well, everyone has different tastes.

142
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:37,080
You'll be able to take the perfume you make today.

143
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,920
And if you wait for about three weeks before using it,

144
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:42,605
you'll be able to enjoy a deeper scent.

145
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,560
You guys can also try making one as a couple.

146
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:54,855
Pardon?

147
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:03,025
Are you two not dating?

148
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,295
I'm sorry. I must've been mistaken.

149
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,395
Actually,

150
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,035
we are dating.

151
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:15,835
She's my girlfriend.

152
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,105
Right? You made me think I was mistaken.

153
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,475
My gosh.

154
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:37,595
My goodness.

155
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:39,280
Since when?

156
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:41,095
It hasn't been that long.

157
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,065
Awesome.

158
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:45,250
That must be why you came in together this morning.

159
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:47,020
Since when?

160
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,935
It hasn't been that long.

161
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,520
You two stuck together all the time.

162
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,160
Were you on a date with her...

163
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:53,805
when you ran into me and Yoon Byul?

164
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:56,330
- Yes. - My goodness.

165
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:58,030
You should've just told us that you came with her.

166
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,300
You got surprised for nothing.

167
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:02,385
I knew you'd end up like this. You two look good together.

168
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:04,725
We look good together?

169
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,455
How jealous.

170
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:09,755
I know, I'm so jealous.

171
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,695
Seriously. I don't understand.

172
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,005
How could he date with her instead of you?

173
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,805
Do they really mean it by saying how they look good together?

174
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:28,175
How ridiculous.

175
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,725
I was afraid for nothing.

176
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,625
So why were you afraid?

177
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,435
You suggested that we eat outside to hold hands on the streets, no?

178
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,945
What?

179
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,575
Is there another reason?

180
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,785
Well, Soo A might feel uncomfortable if we eat together.

181
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,395
Why do we have to care about her?

182
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:18,025
- Still. - I've had this thought all along,

183
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,265
but I wish you were less nice.

184
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:24,350
I'm not that nice.

185
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,135
If you're nicer, it means you're a fool.

186
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,465
What?

187
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,375
- Hey. - See? It doesn't hurt at all.

188
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:33,905
Sorry. Does it hurt?

189
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:36,545
See? It doesn't hurt.

190
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,985
- Stop it. - What do you want to have?

191
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:49,095
Shall we go there?

192
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,265
Okay.

193
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:02,535
Are you okay?

194
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,305
What do you mean?

195
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:08,045
I just wondered if you were eating well.

196
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:11,530
It's not like I dated him.

197
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:12,885
I'm fine.

198
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,285
Right, it's fine.

199
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,925
His standard in women is lower than I expected.

200
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:25,325
- What? - Can you stop saying such stuff?

201
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,505
What a high pride of hers.

202
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:39,445
Don't you think she's more strange the more you see her?

203
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,835
This really was nothing.

204
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,620
I'm sorry for troubling you until now.

205
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:08,275
It wasn't that much of trouble.

206
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,730
- It's delicious. - Yes.

207
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:22,055
What are you doing?

208
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,585
What do you mean? He's stealing my food.

209
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:28,425
What?

210
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:31,225
Well...

211
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:33,910
Is it the exam period right now?

212
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,635
I see a lot of teenage students.

213
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:42,405
I used to be envious of those things.

214
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:47,420
I was envious of how other boys and girls...

215
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:51,045
went together for snacks after school.

216
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:57,255
It's not like I wanted to hang out with boys.

217
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:01,255
I've never done stuff like that before.

218
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,895
- Then do it. - What?

219
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,365
Do it. Do you still have your school uniform?

220
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:10,810
Did you throw it away?

221
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,035
No, I might still have it at home.

222
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,035
Are you telling me to wear my school uniform?

223
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,190
I might still have mine too.

224
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,605
- Are you going to wear it too? - Do you want to do it alone?

225
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,795
Something seems to have happened to your father.

226
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:39,465
I'll take good care of Kyung Hee.

227
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:41,695
And I believe you'll do fine on your own.

228
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:44,905
You may come to my house at any time.

229
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:58,430
("Mayor Do Sang Won's Daughter Does a Show-off Streaming")

230
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,985
("Mayor Do Bought His Teenage Daughter an Expensive Bag")

231
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:09,295
- Someone's coming down. - Someone's coming.

232
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:14,880
The mayor isn't here, so please go back.

233
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,010
Where is he?

234
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,450
Did he know about his daughter's streaming?

235
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:21,350
Did she buy the bag herself, or did he buy it for her?

236
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:22,690
- Please answer. - Tell us.

237
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,960
- Where is the mayor? - Tell us.

238
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,045
- Please say a word. - We want to know.

239
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:40,455
I can't hold this in anymore.

240
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:43,040
I've got to ask her why she met Tae Young.

241
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:46,295
She won't tell the truth even if you ask her.

242
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:47,825
She won't admit that she coaxed him.

243
00:18:48,884 --> 00:18:50,080
People will think you're venting your anger out on her...

244
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,405
for being dumped.

245
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,805
Still, I want to know at least what excuses she'll make.

246
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,005
Hey.

247
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,475
What is she doing right now?

248
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,140
Did she just throw up what she ate?

249
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,780
She said she didn't easily gain weight.

250
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:56,865
So she was throwing up every food she ate.

251
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,350
To be honest, it didn't make sense...

252
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,250
that she never gained weight when she ate so much.

253
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:05,805
Right. She always went to brush her teeth right after every meal.

254
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,605
That was actually for throwing up.

255
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,215
She's unbelievable.

256
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:14,885
I think you're mistaken.

257
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:18,300
I saw her throw up before,

258
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:21,055
and she said she easily got an upset stomach.

259
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:23,310
I do that sometimes too.

260
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:26,280
No, she checked every single stall to see if anyone was in...

261
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:27,980
and threw up after that.

262
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,395
I saw it.

263
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,245
Goodness.

264
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:41,975
- Did you see her face just now? - How scary.

265
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:51,115
Soo A, wait.

266
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:59,925
It's okay. Don't worry. No one...

267
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:04,365
You really burn me up.

268
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:08,290
- Are you feeling pity on me now? - That's not it.

269
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,175
Now that you're going out with Kyung Seok,

270
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,905
do you think your class has gone up?

271
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:15,445
Do you think you've won?

272
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,485
How funny.

273
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,640
You wouldn't have been able to date him...

274
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:28,825
without your plastic surgeries.

275
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:31,170
Even if he said he liked you,

276
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,225
you wouldn't have been able to be with him.

277
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,735
You had a surgery on every single part of your face,

278
00:21:37,753 --> 00:21:39,805
so why do you act like you're unselfish?

279
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:43,205
Why don't you be honest?

280
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,505
Don't overstep your place and worry about me.

281
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:50,875
I'm not worried about you.

282
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:58,525
And who are you to judge how much I like him?

283
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:03,325
How do you know whether I'd give up or not?

284
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,735
What if I do?

285
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:28,485
Hey, you're here.

286
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,555
Soo A.

287
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,240
She's being like that because we caught her forcing herself to vomit.

288
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,935
She must be so embarrassed.

289
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:45,620
You're always with Soo A. You didn't know?

290
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:49,035
She was throwing up every time she said she was brushing her teeth.

291
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,675
Soo A.

292
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,445
Hyun Soo A!

293
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:23,975
My gosh.

294
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,760
I've clearly warned you. Delete it.

295
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:29,960
- Delete what? - Just delete it!

296
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:31,415
What are you talking about?

297
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,525
We took selfies because it's our last day here. What's the matter?

298
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:45,380
Hey, Soo A.

299
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,295
Do you think I'm still chasing you because I like you?

300
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:52,305
I only had three photos of you, and I've deleted them all.

301
00:23:52,654 --> 00:23:54,635
I closed the group chat too.

302
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,775
Are we good now?

303
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:00,005
Kyung Seok is a good judge of character.

304
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:03,145
It was wise of him to choose Mi Rae over you.

305
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,085
Why do you have to treat Won Ho like that?

306
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,215
He really liked you.

307
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,085
I know things didn't work out with Kyung Seok.

308
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,155
But are you taking it out on him?

309
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:22,835
I was wrong?

310
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:25,965
He'll obviously say that.

311
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:20,085
How strange.

312
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:24,440
There's no way it'd be here.

313
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:26,095
Actually, here it is.

314
00:25:41,997 --> 00:25:44,175
I didn't even want to see this ever again.

315
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:49,155
Gosh, it's hot. I'm sweating.

316
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,005
She bought many bottles. How thoughtful.

317
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,875
Gosh, I ate way too much.

318
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:14,575
You're back.

319
00:26:16,097 --> 00:26:18,460
Why are you sweating so much? Did you exercise?

320
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,785
Yes.

321
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:22,130
Yes, I did some stretching exercises.

322
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,985
I feel like I've gained some weight lately.

323
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:28,555
Hey, gaining 1 or 2kg doesn't even show because you're tall.

324
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,925
With me, even 500g shows right away.

325
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:13,165
What brings you here?

326
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:15,975
To check up on what kind of mess I'm in?

327
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:18,690
("Daejin Daily")

328
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:21,845
Your mom has surely managed to get back at me.

329
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,285
Kyung Hee shouldn't have run away and taken off that darn mask.

330
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:29,115
Then this wouldn't have happened.

331
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:33,025
I told Kyung Hee to focus on her studies, but she didn't.

332
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:36,025
She's been stuck in her room wasting her time like that.

333
00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:37,755
I feel bad for Kyung Hee.

334
00:27:38,747 --> 00:27:40,065
What?

335
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,495
And I feel apologetic.

336
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:45,635
What do you mean?

337
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:48,305
She wants our affection and attention,

338
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:50,405
but I can't give her enough of either.

339
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:55,715
Mom didn't do anything.

340
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,545
It's all your fault, Dad.

341
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:04,185
Leave if you're here to talk nonsense.

342
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,825
Bye.

343
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:28,660
- You haven't eaten yet? - No.

344
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:31,290
My gosh, are you guys already having a fight?

345
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,330
No.

346
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:34,645
Then why didn't you eat with him?

347
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:38,155
Kyung Seok said he had to go somewhere today.

348
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:44,195
Hey.

349
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:47,410
I told everyone.

350
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:48,695
About what?

351
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:50,235
That we're dating.

352
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:53,935
Hey, seriously? What did they say?

353
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:57,775
Well, you know. They didn't say much in front of me.

354
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,545
They congratulated us.

355
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:03,345
Thank goodness. That's such a relief.

356
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,230
I feel like I worry you all the time.

357
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:12,085
What are you talking about?

358
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:14,725
I put you through an ordeal too back in the days.

359
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,655
You had to teach me math.

360
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:18,765
Oh, that's right.

361
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:21,640
I showed you how to solve the question three times.

362
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:24,580
Hey, get it right. You only had to show me twice.

363
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:26,450
Didn't I once go over something five times?

364
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:28,835
Hey, I'd appreciate it if you could get it straight.

365
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:44,715
Be quiet.

366
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,625
Quiet, please.

367
00:29:57,218 --> 00:30:01,105
I'm doing all this to make my old wish come true.

368
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:23,455
You look like a school uniform model.

369
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:25,525
You too.

370
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:28,365
You look pretty.

371
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,165
I didn't know you could make such a remark.

372
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:38,760
Why did you come out so early?

373
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,005
I wanted to leave when Hyun Jung was still asleep.

374
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,075
She might make fun of me.

375
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,755
By the way, where are we going?

376
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,755
I know that we've made our relationship public,

377
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,395
but what if we run into someone we know? That will be...

378
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:58,925
Shall we go to our middle school?

379
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
What?

380
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:01,665
I've always wanted to visit.

381
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:04,595
Really?

382
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:08,465
I have no good memories about that place.

383
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:14,005
Do you not like the idea?

384
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:18,445
Where do you want to go?

385
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,385
No, let's go there. I want to go there.

386
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:28,685
Let's go.

387
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:37,635
It's changed a lot, hasn't it?

388
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:39,335
Yes.

389
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:42,705
Some things changed, and some things are the same.

390
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,915
Have we ever seen each other on the streets back when we were students?

391
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:51,915
I never really walked around.

392
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,885
I was always stuck in my room after school.

393
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:58,615
Me too.

394
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,125
Let's walk around a lot today.

395
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,535
Are we allowed to hold hands while wearing school uniforms?

396
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:14,505
Middle school kids are always holding hands.

397
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,175
You're right.

398
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,315
He's so good-looking.

399
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:28,315
Which school's uniform is that?

400
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:30,085
It's not from our neighborhood.

401
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:33,125
She's wearing Jaryong High School's uniform.

402
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,995
Do you really think they're really high school students?

403
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,595
I guess so.

404
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,295
What's wrong?

405
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:41,165
Is there anyone you know?

406
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:45,135
No. And even if there was, they wouldn't be able to recognize me.

407
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,805
The exams must be over in this neighborhood as well...

408
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:53,675
since they're all outside at this hour.

409
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:14,365
- Do you not like burgers? - No, I like them.

410
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:15,935
Then why are you eating yours like that?

411
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:21,735
It's too thick.

412
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:29,375
I won't look, so you can eat freely.

413
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,745
I really won't look.

414
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:37,785
Okay.

415
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:46,195
Did you take a bite?

416
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,395
Yes.

417
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,345
Was that your one bite?

418
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:04,575
You're cute.

419
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:12,285
Apparently, Jung Yeob and Chan Woo fought over Soo A.

420
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:15,655
Soo A's gone completely insane.

421
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,255
Exactly. Okay, bye.

422
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:21,795
- Chan Woo. - Hey.

423
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:24,735
I heard you got beaten up even by Jung Yeob.

424
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:26,305
Who told you that?

425
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:27,850
Did Jung Yeob tell you that?

426
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:29,350
That's nonsense. I beat him up a lot more.

427
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:31,290
Everyone's talking...

428
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,960
about how you fought with Jung Yeob at Berlin over Soo A.

429
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:35,405
My gosh.

430
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,945
But what did Soo A do?

431
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,785
I heard she even made Tae Young and Tae Hee break up.

432
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:43,655
- What? Really? - Yes.

433
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,855
I heard it was a complete mess. They broke cups and everything.

434
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:52,255
I didn't know she was going around meeting all those guys.

435
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:54,140
And I really didn't know she threw up after eating.

436
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:55,780
- Really? - Yes.

437
00:34:55,783 --> 00:34:57,680
She wanted to pretend like she was naturally skinny,

438
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:58,980
so she threw up everything she ate.

439
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:01,180
You used to be her best friend.

440
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:02,650
Must you badmouth her about that?

441
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:04,850
Hey, I'm annoyed by all this as well.

442
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,875
People might think I'm weird because I'm friends with Soo A.

443
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:11,815
You're already weird on your own.

444
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,585
What?

445
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:29,195
Did she just throw up what she ate?

446
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:31,810
She said she didn't easily gain weight.

447
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,780
So she was throwing up every food she ate.

448
00:35:33,788 --> 00:35:36,435
Apparently, Jung Yeob and Chan Woo fought over Soo A.

449
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,205
Soo A's gone completely insane.

450
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,195
(Yoo Eun)

451
00:36:06,988 --> 00:36:09,635
(Yoo Eun)

452
00:36:23,638 --> 00:36:26,085
Hey, it's Eun. What are you doing?

453
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:27,985
Why do you ask?

454
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:30,855
I was wondering if you wanted to eat with me.

455
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:32,625
No.

456
00:36:33,514 --> 00:36:35,310
Please leave me alone.

457
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:37,695
We don't have to eat. Can we meet?

458
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,665
Where are you? Are you at home?

459
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,550
What do you want to hear from me?

460
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,575
Nothing.

461
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:49,515
But you can talk if you want to.

462
00:36:50,998 --> 00:36:55,515
I just feel like I'll regret it if I don't reach out to you.

463
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,815
I'm sorry if I annoyed you.

464
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:13,335
This is where you were cleaning.

465
00:37:13,721 --> 00:37:16,705
Yes. It's when I misunderstood you.

466
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:19,005
You had every reason to.

467
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:24,645
Have you seen me in other places other than here and the bus stop?

468
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,385
- Of course. - Really?

469
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:29,855
You were always alone...

470
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:31,955
just like me.

471
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:38,695
But why didn't you hang around with Hyun Jung?

472
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,965
I felt sorry.

473
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:46,835
She got into a lot of fights at school because of me.

474
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:52,035
So I just didn't hang around with her at school.

475
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:59,075
We mostly hung out at her place or mine.

476
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,915
We also studied together.

477
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:06,425
Those were the times when I could feel at ease.

478
00:38:08,676 --> 00:38:10,425
I guess I should be nice to Hyun Jung.

479
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,025
How exactly?

480
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:18,495
By buying her food?

481
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:24,475
She's on a diet right now. She wants to get a boyfriend.

482
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:31,075
The classrooms must be empty right now, right?

483
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:46,525
Nothing's changed.

484
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:51,535
Of course. It's only been two years.

485
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:03,145
(Kang Orc)

486
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:05,445
It really is the same.

487
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,545
Was there always a basketball court over there?

488
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,255
What?

489
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:14,985
Where?

490
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,865
I never got to do that either.

491
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:26,005
- You can do it. - What?

492
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,120
Whenever guys played basketball,

493
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:32,745
girls would always cheer for them beside the court.

494
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:35,845
I sometimes wanted to watch the game as well.

495
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:38,075
But I never could.

496
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:42,755
Then you can do that today too.

497
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:44,715
What?

498
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:47,355
Let's go. You can cheer for me.

499
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:51,855
You're going to play basketball?

500
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,865
Right now?

501
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,335
- You can do it. - You can do it.

502
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:01,005
Can I play with you guys?

503
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,005
Who's that?

504
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:09,175
- My gosh. - He's so good-looking.

505
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,415
Is it okay if I play with you guys?

506
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:13,160
- Sure. - Let's play with him.

507
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,260
How should we split teams?

508
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:15,815
- 2 against 3? - Sure.

509
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:17,815
I guess he's really going to play.

510
00:40:18,806 --> 00:40:20,085
Pass.

511
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:21,755
- My gosh. - Goodness.

512
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,025
Good job.

513
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:29,495
Don't dare stop me.

514
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:33,035
- My gosh. - He's so good.

515
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,235
Get the ball.

516
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:38,735
Come on. Block him.

517
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,660
Good job, Kyung Seok.

518
00:40:44,665 --> 00:40:46,545
- No! - Come on.

519
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,085
My gosh.

520
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,555
Hey.

521
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:53,425
- Gosh, seriously. - Go, Kyung Seok!

522
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,125
Go, Kyung Seok!

523
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:02,065
You were really good.

524
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:04,965
You cheered pretty well as well.

525
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,465
I know, right?

526
00:41:07,888 --> 00:41:10,635
I didn't know I'd be so good at cheering.

527
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,005
Excuse me.

528
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:15,205
Is he your boyfriend?

529
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:17,175
Yes.

530
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,875
- I'm so jealous. - Me too.

531
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:25,785
Shall we go now?

532
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,365
- Bye. - Bye.

533
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,605
But didn't she call him Do Kyung Seok just a while ago?

534
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,435
Wait, I think I heard it too.

535
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,005
So it's right.

536
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:51,675
He's the legendary handsome boy in our school.

537
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,615
Awesome.

538
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:56,785
What should we do now?

539
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:02,285
Shall we eat and watch a movie?

540
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:03,925
A movie?

541
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:07,295
You'll be teased all day long if you go back in that uniform.

542
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:10,435
You should go late when she's asleep.

543
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:13,035
You're right.

544
00:42:33,874 --> 00:42:35,255
Soo A.

545
00:42:43,884 --> 00:42:45,280
Have you eaten?

546
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:46,635
What for?

547
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:49,005
I'd throw up after eating anyway.

548
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:53,205
I guess everyone in the school thinks I'm a psycho now.

549
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:55,845
I even lied to you.

550
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,745
My grandma is alive.

551
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:01,945
I once told Kyung Seok that I had a grandma,

552
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:04,015
so you must've known.

553
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:06,085
He isn't the type who'd say such a thing.

554
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:08,725
Right.

555
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:11,095
He's not even interested in me.

556
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:13,365
He cares only about Mi Rae.

557
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:19,435
Do you hate her because of Kyung Seok?

558
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:24,905
I don't think it's because of him.

559
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,175
The way I see it,

560
00:43:27,228 --> 00:43:29,405
you've hated her from the start.

561
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:34,915
That's right. I did.

562
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,785
Why?

563
00:43:38,172 --> 00:43:42,455
Becoming pretty isn't the only purpose of doing plastic surgery.

564
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,625
They do it because they want to do something after then.

565
00:43:47,448 --> 00:43:50,395
I had a close friend when I was a third grader in middle school.

566
00:43:51,785 --> 00:43:53,805
She was good to me...

567
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:55,505
like a servant.

568
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,035
She had an ordinary face,

569
00:43:58,092 --> 00:44:00,720
but she got a double eyelid surgery as she entered high school.

570
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:02,475
She became really pretty.

571
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:07,945
And she purposely dated a guy whom I had a crush on...

572
00:44:10,037 --> 00:44:11,915
even when she knew that I liked him.

573
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:14,770
But you hated Mi Rae from the beginning.

574
00:44:14,775 --> 00:44:16,325
Because she's pretty.

575
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:20,465
I guess I hated her because her surgeries were done so well.

576
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:32,250
Hey, did you post...

577
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:35,190
a picture of the beauty in my department...

578
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:36,590
somewhere online?

579
00:44:36,597 --> 00:44:40,685
No, I showed the picture to others, but I never posted it online.

580
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:44,285
By the way, I saw some pictures that looked like her on the Internet.

581
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:45,785
She wore the same clothes too.

582
00:44:46,473 --> 00:44:48,055
What are you talking about?

583
00:45:01,922 --> 00:45:03,305
Hello?

584
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,860
Hi, Won Ho. What's up?

585
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,575
I have something to tell you.

586
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,915
What is it about?

587
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,445
Now?

588
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:36,975
- Hello. - Hi.

589
00:45:37,257 --> 00:45:38,635
Did something happen?

590
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,605
I think so.

591
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:43,330
What is it?

592
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,875
You know who Hyun Soo A is, right?

593
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:47,885
Yes, I do. What about her?

594
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:52,255
She told some strange stuff to me, so I wondered what it was about...

595
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,055
and found this.

596
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,910
Who is this?

597
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:06,480
Her face isn't in the picture, but it's Soo A.

598
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:07,765
I'm sure about it.

599
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:12,075
But she thinks I took this picture and posted it online.

600
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:14,905
I took another picture of her before,

601
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:17,515
but it really isn't me.

602
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:22,185
Please help her.

603
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:33,740
We have to go catch the last bus as soon as it ends.

604
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,340
Let's go right after then.

605
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:36,635
Okay.

606
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,765
I can't believe those little punks are dating.

607
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,815
Don't mind it.

608
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:06,665
They won't make it to college like that. Gosh.

609
00:47:29,169 --> 00:47:32,815
Gosh, I hope my daughter isn't like that.

610
00:47:33,707 --> 00:47:35,025
Goodness.

611
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:40,265
Whom did you mean just now?

612
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,235
I was talking to myself.

613
00:48:04,238 --> 00:48:06,015
You've changed a lot.

614
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:11,055
I told you before. I usually don't get intimidated.

615
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,085
Didn't you say you don't usually get intimidated?

616
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,055
I'm not intimidated.

617
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:54,465
Why are you eating that alone?

618
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:10,885
It's gross.

619
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:12,855
Are you a beggar, Soo A?

620
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,995
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors and make the loser kiss Soo A?

621
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:19,995
I might get sick.

622
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:23,125
I heard her parents abandoned her.

623
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:25,395
Poor thing.

624
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:27,365
But why?

625
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:28,920
- Because she's dirty? - Because she's dirty?

626
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:30,605
- Telepathy. - We thought the same.

627
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:33,175
How funny.

628
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,920
I would abandon her too if I were her parents.

629
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,615
Same here.

630
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:07,745
Don't you wash yourself?

631
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:40,105
I don't know about anything else, but make sure you wash yourself.

632
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:46,215
You can go home alone, right?

633
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:50,455
Finish that before you go.

634
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:53,725
Don't go.

635
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:57,095
Don't abandon me again.

636
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,865
I can't do that.

637
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:05,935
Why?

638
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:12,275
You have no friends, but I hope you do well.

639
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,545
Mom.

640
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:17,175
Mom.

641
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,425
Hey, is that Hyun Soo A?

642
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:31,125
That's Hyun Soo A?

643
00:51:31,845 --> 00:51:33,195
My goodness.

644
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:34,795
It is her.

645
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:37,335
I didn't know she was so pretty.

646
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:39,965
I know, right? Why did she look like that before?

647
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,605
I'm pretty?

648
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:44,450
Your skin is so fair. Are you wearing makeup or something?

649
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,720
No.

650
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:48,975
Don't you think Soo A is the prettiest girl in the entire school?

651
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:50,560
- No, I'm not. - You are.

652
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:52,560
Soo A, this guy has a crush on you.

653
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:54,915
- Hey, cut it out! - What was that about?

654
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:58,085
Hey, did you see that?

655
00:51:58,171 --> 00:52:00,955
- Her face looked so cute just now. - I know, right?

656
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:03,695
To be loved,

657
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:07,065
I must be pretty and cute.

658
00:52:07,614 --> 00:52:10,195
At the same time, I mustn't know that I'm pretty.

659
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:14,405
I must be obedient, and I should never be too smart.

660
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:18,135
I must always smile and agree to others.

661
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,905
I must always be kind and friendly.

662
00:52:46,153 --> 00:52:47,280
Let's go.

663
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:49,535
Right, the bus. We have to hurry.

664
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:01,115
We're two minutes late.

665
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,415
Gosh, what should we do now?

666
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:07,085
- Should we take a taxi? - All the way there?

667
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:10,595
Hang on a second. Let me see how much cash I have on me.

668
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,225
I have 26 dollars. How much do you have?

669
00:53:17,384 --> 00:53:19,135
If we're short, I can bring money from home.

670
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:24,675
Then I'll call a taxi.

671
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:35,045
(Searching for a taxi nearby)

672
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:41,085
(No taxis currently available)

673
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:43,795
- There are no taxis available now. - Then what should we do?

674
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,710
Then should we just go to a sauna?

675
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:52,065
A sauna?

676
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:55,665
Minors can't use our facilities from 10pm to 5am.

677
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:58,850
We're actually college students.

678
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:00,190
Can't we show you our school ID cards?

679
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:02,945
(Sauna, Open for 24 hours)

680
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:06,275
I've only been here with my mom, so I didn't even think about that.

681
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:09,445
Are there any cars going to Seoul?

682
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:14,285
Okay, thank you.

683
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:22,095
Shall we just go to my parents' place?

684
00:54:25,452 --> 00:54:28,205
Shall we just go to my parents' place?

685
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:32,650
It's probably not a good idea, right?

686
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:34,975
- You should go home. - Then what about you?

687
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:38,345
I'll wait a few hours and take the first bus.

688
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:40,930
- Then I'll wait with you. - Just go home.

689
00:54:40,934 --> 00:54:43,085
No, I don't want you to wait alone.

690
00:54:46,106 --> 00:54:47,685
Let's just go to my parents' place.

691
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:50,495
We have no choice.

692
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,125
- Just go by yourself... - Hi, Mom.

693
00:54:57,617 --> 00:54:59,235
You're still awake?

694
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:03,990
Where are you now?

695
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:06,975
We're at your grandmother's 70th birthday party.

696
00:55:07,093 --> 00:55:09,805
We can't go home right now because your dad has been drinking.

697
00:55:09,996 --> 00:55:12,215
- Who is it? - Mi Rae.

698
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:14,045
My pretty daughter?

699
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:16,600
Mi Rae!

700
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:19,185
Dad sounds really drunk.

701
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,985
- Is something wrong? - No, nothing's wrong.

702
00:55:23,243 --> 00:55:24,895
Then when will you come home...

703
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:27,325
I mean, when will you go home?

704
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:29,265
Mi Rae, Mi Rae!

705
00:55:29,316 --> 00:55:31,580
When can we go to a karaoke lounge together again?

706
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,335
Go in. Go inside, okay?

707
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,380
Gosh. By the way, why did you call me at this late hour?

708
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:38,020
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

709
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:40,805
Yes, don't worry. Everything is fine.

710
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:42,745
Yes.

711
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:46,115
Then tomorrow, come home... I mean, get home safely tomorrow.

712
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:49,785
Wait until Dad sobers up completely. All right.

713
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:56,555
My parents aren't home now.

714
00:56:09,255 --> 00:56:10,575
This is it.

715
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:18,475
Did you live here back then too?

716
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:21,845
Yes, we've been living here since I was in elementary school.

717
00:56:25,972 --> 00:56:27,685
Shall we go in?

718
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,615
This is where my family lives.

719
00:56:59,906 --> 00:57:01,185
I see.

720
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:05,455
Have a seat.

721
00:57:06,346 --> 00:57:07,665
Okay.

722
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:20,745
I'll go bring something to eat.

723
00:57:20,994 --> 00:57:22,275
All right.

724
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:30,915
(Squid)

725
00:57:32,706 --> 00:57:34,125
This is squid.

726
00:57:35,942 --> 00:57:37,595
This is also squid.

727
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:40,895
This is beef jerky.

728
00:57:42,982 --> 00:57:45,435
Gosh, what's going on? They're all bar snacks.

729
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:47,635
Are there any chips?

730
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:55,175
(Tomato Ketchup)

731
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:01,115
Soju.

732
00:58:06,773 --> 00:58:08,555
Do you want some soju?

733
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:10,855
Sure.

734
00:58:21,054 --> 00:58:23,035
I couldn't find many snacks to eat.

735
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:24,975
There's a lot here.

736
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:28,475
Isn't the uniform uncomfortable?

737
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:31,115
No, it's fine.

738
00:58:31,765 --> 00:58:33,215
Yours must be more uncomfortable.

739
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:35,715
Get changed into comfortable clothes.

740
00:58:38,238 --> 00:58:39,655
I'll be right back.

741
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:37,515
Hey!

742
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:41,945
Hey, you can't.

743
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:44,570
- Come on. You can't see that. - Why not?

744
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:46,270
- Give it back. - I'll just take a quick look.

745
00:59:46,272 --> 00:59:47,400
I know what you used to look like.

746
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:49,500
What's there to see? Give it back.

747
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:52,710
No, you can't see it. Gosh, give it back. Give it back.

748
00:59:52,712 --> 00:59:54,725
- Just for a second... - No, don't be like this.

749
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,195
Are you mad at me?

750
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:30,665
Yes, I am.

751
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:34,905
I'm sorry.

752
01:01:04,784 --> 01:01:07,235
But there's something I'm curious about.

753
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:16,305
How can you like me when you know how I used to look like?

754
01:01:16,996 --> 01:01:20,045
If I had kept that face,

755
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,955
would you still have liked me?

756
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,155
You're just you.

757
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:37,435
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

758
01:01:43,523 --> 01:01:44,805
But...

759
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:49,405
I do miss your old face from time to time.

760
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:11,065
Then just for a moment...

761
01:02:13,252 --> 01:02:16,605
You can see it for like a split second.

762
01:02:19,192 --> 01:02:22,505
No, it's okay. I don't have to see it if you don't want me to.

763
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:56,975
Just for three seconds.

764
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,015
No more than that, okay?

765
01:02:59,766 --> 01:03:01,045
Here we go.

766
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:07,855
1, 2...

767
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:10,695
Three.

768
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:20,495
If you still like me after seeing this,

769
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:24,775
that means you really like me.

770
01:05:05,558 --> 01:05:09,775
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

771
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:11,990
I had my first kiss.

772
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:13,530
- Who is he? - Mi Rae's boyfriend.

773
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,900
That guy is super handsome!

774
01:05:15,902 --> 01:05:18,170
Her phone is still off. I can't get a hold of her.

775
01:05:18,171 --> 01:05:19,770
It was obviously taken without her consent.

776
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:21,340
Why can't you delete it?

777
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,370
A victim?

778
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,540
No, I don't want people to think of me weird like that.

779
01:05:24,544 --> 01:05:27,740
I think Kyung Seok likes you more. Am I right?

780
01:05:27,747 --> 01:05:29,910
This would be a nice spot to propose later on.

781
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,250
You said hi to me first.

782
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,380
You smiled at me.

783
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:33,380
Do you know what this is?

784
01:05:33,386 --> 01:05:35,235
Have you seen Soo A today by any chance?

785
01:05:35,288 --> 01:05:36,835
What did you do?
