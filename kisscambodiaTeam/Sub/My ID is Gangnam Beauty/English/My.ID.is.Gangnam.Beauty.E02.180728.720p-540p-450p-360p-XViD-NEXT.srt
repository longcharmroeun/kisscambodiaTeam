1
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:19,235
Kang Mi Rae.

2
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:35,845
By any chance,

3
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,755
did you go to Jaryong Middle School?

4
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,985
What?

5
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:45,995
What should I do?

6
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,665
What should I do?

7
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:52,495
Forget it.

8
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:55,535
You have the same name as a girl I used to know.

9
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:08,045
I knew it.

10
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:11,115
He is that Do Kyung Seok.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,625
There are those blessed ones who turn any streets into their runway.

12
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,165
The most handsome guy at Jaryong Middle School,

13
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:24,795
Do Kyung Seok.

14
00:01:26,222 --> 00:01:28,335
Even when he was just walking...

15
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:32,075
or participating in an earthquake drill...

16
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:39,345
and even when he broke his arm.

17
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:43,145
The world practically revolved around him.

18
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,795
And the most legendary one of all was...

19
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:58,135
Do Kyung Seok walking in the rain.

20
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:09,045
Then one day, he suddenly transferred to a different school,

21
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,015
but everyone at my school knew him.

22
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:40,405
But I don't know you.

23
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,375
I'll pretend I don't know you.

24
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:56,185
(Episode 2: You Should've Been Pretty from the Get-go)

25
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:02,225
Oh, my goodness. He's grown up into a fine, good-looking guy.

26
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:06,480
Do you still see my old face from how I look now?

27
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:08,805
I can tell at a glance that this girl is Soo A.

28
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:12,035
She must be much prettier in person.

29
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,575
He won't ask me again, right?

30
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:17,615
Shall I say I went to a different school?

31
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:21,145
I'll end up making a fool of myself if someone else went to our school.

32
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,815
I must say, you're on par with her.

33
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,485
You're pretty too.

34
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:30,040
Hey, are you listening?

35
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,740
I'm asking you what I should do.

36
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:33,650
Hey, he won't recognize you.

37
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,580
Even your dad couldn't.

38
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,565
How on earth will Do Kyung Seok recognize you?

39
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,735
He probably just wanted to strike up a conversation.

40
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:43,105
Hey, wait.

41
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,820
What if he's interested in you?

42
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,575
- Hey, what are you talking about? - By the way,

43
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,945
did something happen between you and him back then?

44
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,815
How does he remember you?

45
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,485
Oh, well.

46
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:30,245
He was the same as everyone else.

47
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:34,155
Attention, please.

48
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,325
Patient Lee Hyun Joo,

49
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:37,880
please come to the ICU.

50
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,210
Can you tell me where Seo Yoo Jin is?

51
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:40,865
Okay, let me check.

52
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,065
My goodness.

53
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,180
What did he throw at you?

54
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,235
Why did he do this?

55
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:50,890
Does it hurt a lot? Should I help you heal faster?

56
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:52,135
Yes.

57
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,705
- Here? - No, it's here.

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,000
Yoo Jin, does it feel better now?

59
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,230
Of course.

60
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,615
Gosh, I'm so upset.

61
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,515
Hey, Kyung Seok, you're here.

62
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:09,725
Hey, can you take her home? It's too late.

63
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,125
Did you get kicked out?

64
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,095
He got kicked out?

65
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:15,795
Why?

66
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,665
What's he saying?

67
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,565
I told my dad that I'm going to start my own business.

68
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,335
Do you have money to start the business?

69
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,935
What? What business?

70
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:27,760
A pub.

71
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:29,305
You're going to start a pub?

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,445
My goodness.

73
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,670
Then what about your dad's inheritance?

74
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,085
I won't be getting anything.

75
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:41,155
I'll let you drink free beer every day.

76
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,510
Yoo Jin, I wasn't just fooling around with you.

77
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,555
I was planning on getting married to you.

78
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,010
I can't believe you're proposing to me right now.

79
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,895
Stop right there. The guy should be the one to propose.

80
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,220
But this was not what I was expecting.

81
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,935
We can't see each other anymore.

82
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,235
Ah Reum.

83
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:01,845
Ah Reum.

84
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:05,645
Ah Reum, wait. Please hear me out.

85
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,985
- Taxi. - Ah Reum.

86
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,885
Let me go.

87
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,285
Were you dating me because of my family's money?

88
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,985
You lost my trust.

89
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:17,240
I didn't know you were this reckless.

90
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:20,525
It's not because I'm materialistic. It's because you're irresponsible.

91
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:28,205
Hey, Ah Reum.

92
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,645
You're completely fine. Why were you lying in bed?

93
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:37,445
You lost...

94
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,415
my trust.

95
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:45,515
How can you make a joke when I just had my heart broken?

96
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:47,055
Then...

97
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,280
do you want me to help you heal faster?

98
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,995
My gosh.

99
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,595
Let's go.

100
00:06:57,253 --> 00:07:00,095
Hey, Kyung Seok. Kyung Seok!

101
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,865
Wait for me.

102
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,705
She'd always tell me that she doesn't want to go home.

103
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,105
And every morning, she'd say,

104
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:12,075
"Yoo Jin, I dreamt of you last night."

105
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:16,785
I can't believe I'm still so bad with women.

106
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:19,285
How many more women do I need to date?

107
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,225
I guess I should date a bit more.

108
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,995
Isn't it too early to be thinking about dating other women?

109
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,295
Where are we going?

110
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:29,765
To your school.

111
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,095
Let's go.

112
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:37,975
When did you buy this place?

113
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:40,845
The remodelling will begin starting from tomorrow.

114
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:43,505
Hey.

115
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,715
Drink up.

116
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,045
Congratulations on entering university.

117
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:52,615
Gosh, that's bitter.

118
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:57,755
Are things okay with your dad?

119
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,455
Isn't he upset that you chose to major in chemistry?

120
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:00,850
Of course, he's upset.

121
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,695
Then why did you become a chemistry major?

122
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:04,895
I don't know.

123
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:08,765
I chose this major because he kept telling me not to.

124
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,575
Are you curious about your mom?

125
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,475
Let's not talk about the dead.

126
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:23,385
She's dead to me.

127
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,305
My goodness gracious.

128
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,305
Are you Mi Rae?

129
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:46,275
Gosh, stop it.

130
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,830
Hello. Have you been doing well?

131
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,960
Yes, we've been doing well.

132
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:54,300
- Have you been well? - Yes.

133
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:57,370
I think Hyun Jung should get something done as well.

134
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:58,855
Stop talking nonsense.

135
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,140
I'll be off now. I'll see you guys later.

136
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:04,640
- Okay. - See you later.

137
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:06,380
- Bye. - See you.

138
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:08,425
- Bye. - Bye.

139
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,935
My gosh, she looks pretty from the back as well.

140
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,765
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

141
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,175
She has some guts.

142
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:23,305
How could she get plastic surgery done without telling her dad?

143
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,145
You better not do anything behind my back.

144
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,885
It's too loud.

145
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:42,295
Who attends entrance ceremonies these days?

146
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,950
If I take photos with Kyung Seok,

147
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,805
people will comment on how different we look.

148
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,475
My gosh, what was that? My goodness.

149
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,815
I'd like to report an accident.

150
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,330
No, I'm fine.

151
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:06,315
But I'm not sure about the people inside the car.

152
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,070
Please make it quick.

153
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:11,995
I can't afford to be late to my deliveries.

154
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:15,265
There's no need for that. You must've been surprised.

155
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,635
- Pardon? - You can just go.

156
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,665
But still...

157
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:23,435
- It's okay. - "Tell people how nice I am."

158
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,190
- You're working this hard. - "Take a good look at my face."

159
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,475
- I don't want to get paid for this. - "I'm Congressman Do Sang Won."

160
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,875
Thank you.

161
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:31,845
Keep working hard.

162
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,315
- Thank you. - No problem.

163
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,585
Nice shot.

164
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:42,285
Let's go.

165
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:02,145
I'm near your school. I'm almost there.

166
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:06,075
Mom, when did Dad receive his medical checkup?

167
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,970
How's his blood pressure? Is it normal?

168
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,055
Don't worry. Where are you?

169
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,655
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:21,025
What do you mean you can't find Dad?

171
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:28,935
Excuse me, are you a student here?

172
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,075
Pardon?

173
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,690
I'm here for my daughter's entrance ceremony.

174
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:37,600
Is there a nice restaurant nearby?

175
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,175
A place where girls like to go.

176
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:46,785
Wait a minute.

177
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,525
You're the girl I talked to last time.

178
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,355
Right?

179
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:56,310
I'm Mi Rae's dad. She majors in chemistry.

180
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:59,695
We talked on the phone because you answered Mi Rae's phone.

181
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,135
Yes.

182
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,320
That was me.

183
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:08,590
See? I knew it. Yes, I remember your voice now.

184
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:12,815
I was so surprised because you sound just like my daughter.

185
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:16,315
What a coincidence.

186
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:30,795
Dad.

187
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,335
Dad, I'm Mi Rae.

188
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:38,235
What?

189
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:43,005
Dad, I'm... I'm Mi Rae.

190
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,875
It's me, Mi Rae.

191
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:51,085
I'm your daughter, Mi Rae.

192
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:59,425
What... What...

193
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,125
Dad.

194
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:09,135
Mi... Mi Rae...

195
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,975
I'm sorry Dad.

196
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:15,605
I had to keep it a secret because you were so against it.

197
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:25,355
Honey. Sweetheart.

198
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:36,580
Dad.

199
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,835
Honey. Honey.

200
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,065
Honey.

201
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:49,705
Dad.

202
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,315
Dad.

203
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,985
Dad.

204
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,495
Dad.

205
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:07,495
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,105
I don't know you, miss.

207
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,750
Nice. That looks great, Mr. Congressman.

208
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,965
I'll take a picture now, then. 1, 2, 3.

209
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:47,535
Great. Kyung Hee, stand a little closer.

210
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:51,305
All right, 1 more shot. 1, 2, 3!

211
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,160
Oh, my. You look dashing, sir. I really mean it.

212
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:55,630
Yes. Kyung Hee, stand in the middle.

213
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,745
Here we go. 1, 2...

214
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,385
Hello?

215
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:07,785
Yes, hold on.

216
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:13,625
She's been appointed as the CEO of Kelun Korea.

217
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,795
Let's talk about it another time.

218
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:20,535
Can you at least gain some weight?

219
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,890
My dear son, we have to take a photo together.

220
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:27,705
- Look at the camera. - I love you.

221
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,160
All right, I'll take another photo.

222
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,830
My, I can't get over how dashing you look, sir. I really mean it.

223
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:35,485
All right. Oh, it was my face. There.

224
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:47,195
Don't worry.

225
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:49,965
I'll have a talk with your dad when I get home.

226
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:51,635
Okay?

227
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,645
Hurry up!

228
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,085
- Hurry. Come on! - My goodness.

229
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,685
Why? What is going on?

230
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:16,985
Mi Rae, you're here too.

231
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,580
Ta-da.

232
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,510
Whose camera is it? Did you buy it?

233
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,125
No, I borrowed it.

234
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,635
I thought we should take some photos together now that I own this taxi.

235
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,905
I no longer have to share it with other drivers,

236
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:31,505
so I want to hang a photo of Mi Rae inside my taxi.

237
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,075
Mi Rae, come stand here.

238
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,275
I'll take a pretty photo of you.

239
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,975
Dad.

240
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,585
Can you not take a photo of me?

241
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,955
I want to hang your photo inside my taxi.

242
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,955
Seeing your face will keep me energized throughout the day.

243
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:53,725
It's my wish.

244
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,435
All right, then.

245
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:01,520
- Come on. - Come stand here.

246
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,635
Not there. You should stand right here.

247
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,905
- We're ready! - Here we go.

248
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:11,075
Honey, get out of the frame. Come on.

249
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,745
I'll take a photo of Mi Rae first.

250
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:16,230
All right. Mi Rae, smile.

251
00:17:16,238 --> 00:17:17,770
- Give me a pretty smile. - Smile.

252
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,285
1, 2, 3.

253
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:23,285
All right. One more time.

254
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:27,795
Okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3.

255
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:52,440
I have a craving for it.

256
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:53,855
What about you?

257
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:56,555
Isn't that Mi Rae?

258
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,525
- Hello. - Hi.

259
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,810
Are you two in this class too?

260
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,050
- You too? - Yes.

261
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,935
That's great. Let's sit together.

262
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,090
We studied so hard to get into university,

263
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,435
and we now have to study more.

264
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:12,435
Are we writing up reports now?

265
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:14,460
I didn't know when I was registering for my courses,

266
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:17,005
but it really hit me on the day of my first class.

267
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,045
Mi Rae! Hi.

268
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:25,400
- Mi Rae is here. - Mi Rae.

269
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,385
- Hi, Mi Rae. - Hi.

270
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:32,180
- Hi. - New face, new, new, new face

271
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:33,895
- Soo A! - Soo A!

272
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:35,280
- Hyun Soo A is here. - Hi.

273
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:36,765
- Hi. - Hi.

274
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:38,020
Hello.

275
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,835
Hi. Hi, Mi Rae.

276
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,405
- Hi, Soo A. - How have you been?

277
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,775
- Good. - I'll see you later.

278
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:48,105
- Jung Hyun. - Hey, you.

279
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:50,630
She's already like a celebrity within our department.

280
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:51,660
I know, right?

281
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,630
Soo A is making my life difficult.

282
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,430
Why do guys keep asking me to set them up with her?

283
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:57,685
Mi Rae.

284
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,655
Hello.

285
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,810
Sit here. I saved this seat for you.

286
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,055
Pardon me?

287
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,600
Are you taking General Chemistry too?

288
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:31,015
No, I got an A in this class in my first year.

289
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,015
- Oh, I see. - Yes.

290
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,840
Then what are you doing here?

291
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:38,295
What do you think? I'm came to see you.

292
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:42,425
What on earth is he doing here?

293
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,095
Does he have to retake this class?

294
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,980
It looks like he's trying to hit on Mi Rae.

295
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:48,790
Right, when Mi Rae walked in earlier,

296
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,165
I could see how much she stands out.

297
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:52,935
Really?

298
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:56,245
But as soon as Soo A walked in...

299
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,875
What? Did you call me?

300
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,275
No, no. I didn't call you.

301
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,445
I'm such an idiot.

302
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
I wanted to call you after the orientation, but I realized...

303
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,425
that I never even asked your number.

304
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,255
I see.

305
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,255
Has everything been well with you? Did the entrance ceremony go well?

306
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:16,750
- Yes. - If there's anything...

307
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:19,065
you don't understand during class, feel free to ask me.

308
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:21,565
I got an A in General Chemistry in my first year.

309
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:26,135
Also, I have all the exam notes for this class.

310
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:28,505
The questions on this professor's exam are the same every year.

311
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,245
Do you know what I mean by "exam notes"?

312
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,500
It seems like you can only see Mi Rae.

313
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,060
We'll need the exam notes too.

314
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,845
Figure it our yourself.

315
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,385
Mi Rae and I have a special relationship.

316
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,600
- Me? - We drank with our arms crossed,

317
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,855
didn't we?

318
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,095
Oh, shall we have lunch together at the cafeteria?

319
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:50,750
- Sorry? - Today's menu looks amazing.

320
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,535
Girls, you'd better not follow us.

321
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:02,675
Mi Rae, let's sit over there.

322
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,725
This is on me, so eat everything you want.

323
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:20,425
Thank you.

324
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,595
How is it? The food at our cafeteria is quite good.

325
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,935
- Yes, it's good. - Good.

326
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,485
By the way, about that question...

327
00:21:42,871 --> 00:21:44,855
I asked you if I can like you.

328
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,125
I think you've had enough time to ponder.

329
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,925
Should we not talk about it at school?

330
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:55,825
Shall we go to a nice bar in the evening, then?

331
00:21:58,353 --> 00:21:59,620
Do you want some water?

332
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,390
No, it's okay. I'll use the restroom quickly.

333
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:03,605
All right.

334
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,205
Gosh, why is she acting all naive?

335
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:15,315
Hello, Chan Woo.

336
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:16,815
Soo A.

337
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:22,185
You're in the same General Chemistry class with us, right?

338
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:26,995
Oh, I'm not actually in the class. I just stopped by to see you guys.

339
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:31,795
I was wondering why you were retaking a first-year course.

340
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,465
Oh, were you curious?

341
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:37,305
- Have a seat. We can chat. - Sure.

342
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:45,200
Isn't somebody else sitting here?

343
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,860
It's Mi Rae, but she went to the restroom.

344
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,075
I see.

345
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:53,085
Chan Woo, you like Mi Rae, don't you?

346
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:56,255
Well, I think all of you guys are adorable.

347
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,210
That includes you.

348
00:22:58,213 --> 00:23:01,595
Just talk casually to me. You don't need to be so polite.

349
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:06,995
I think you and Mi Rae will make a cute couple.

350
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:11,005
Well, we're not there yet.

351
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:14,005
I'll be cheering for you.

352
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:16,875
Although I'm a little sad.

353
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,445
What do you mean?

354
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:23,970
Nothing. Never mind. I should get going now.

355
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,355
Hey, wait.

356
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,125
What did you mean by that? Why are you sad?

357
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:30,455
Well...

358
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,755
Oh, sorry.

359
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:37,365
I can sit here, right?

360
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:41,765
Hey, how could you ignore all of my messages for three days?

361
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,220
- I guess you've been busy. - I don't check my phone often.

362
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:48,205
Goodness, that's why you don't have a girlfriend.

363
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:50,975
What did you mean by that?

364
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,215
To tell you the truth,

365
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:58,255
I was quite smitten by you at the freshmen orientation.

366
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:00,455
What? Me?

367
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:02,870
Don't take it too seriously though.

368
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm over you now,

369
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:06,855
so you don't need to care too much. Okay?

370
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:08,395
No, wait.

371
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:17,035
Gosh.

372
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,075
I can't believe...

373
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:24,875
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:28,815
I just want to think of you as my senior.

375
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:30,815
Yes.

376
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,755
I just want to think of you as my senior.

377
00:24:36,244 --> 00:24:38,025
I just want to think of you...

378
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,055
I just want to think of you as my senior...

379
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Chan Woo.

380
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:49,390
Hey, Mi Rae. Let's just be friends.

381
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,005
- Okay? - Pardon?

382
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:55,175
What I said to you was a mistake.

383
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,360
I think I was confused. I actually like someone else.

384
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,215
I'm sorry for making things complicated.

385
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:04,270
I'm sorry. You understand what I'm saying, right?

386
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:07,985
I'm sorry if you took it seriously. Is everything okay?

387
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,425
You can finish your meal.

388
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,365
What's he doing?

389
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:27,875
Sorry, my mistake.

390
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:35,745
Sorry, my mistake.

391
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:38,245
Is it you again, you jerk?

392
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,585
What did you just say?

393
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:44,385
"Mistake"?

394
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:48,625
Do you want to die?

395
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:50,225
My gosh.

396
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,235
This is a mistake as well.

397
00:25:57,592 --> 00:25:59,405
You must want to die.

398
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:02,175
I'm done eating.

399
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:04,975
You must be crazy for a beating. Hey!

400
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:10,670
- What's wrong with him? - My gosh.

401
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:12,540
- My goodness. - What's going on?

402
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,285
You little jerk.

403
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:16,125
I'm going to kill you.

404
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,010
Chan Woo.

405
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:22,280
What are you doing? Move! Are you taking his side?

406
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:23,565
Move!

407
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,910
Chan Woo, what are you doing?

408
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:55,250
Let go of me!

409
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,780
Everyone's staring.

410
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:59,520
- What's his problem? - My gosh.

411
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:01,180
- Why is he causing a mess? - Let's go.

412
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:03,135
- Why is he always causing trouble? - Let me go.

413
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:05,360
You better consider yourself lucky.

414
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,935
I'm going to kill you the next time I see you. Okay?

415
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,730
Why is he always causing trouble?

416
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:11,030
- My gosh. - What's his problem?

417
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:12,515
What a joke.

418
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,545
Isn't he the jerk from the chemistry department?

419
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,970
- What was that? - Oh, gosh.

420
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:16,970
Why did they fight?

421
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:18,185
Are you okay?

422
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,185
What was that all about?

423
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:23,855
My gosh.

424
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:30,095
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

425
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,845
They were fighting like crazy.

426
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,315
Do you know what Chan Woo's nickname is?

427
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:59,325
It's SOJ. It stands for son of a jerk.

428
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,195
You need to be careful of guys like him.

429
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:07,395
Soo A, you better watch out as well.

430
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:09,405
Okay.

431
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,635
What? Oh, okay.

432
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:15,945
Oh, well...

433
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:19,715
What do you think about having chicken and beer after class?

434
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,075
Are you up for it?

435
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:26,255
Well, I'm up for it...

436
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:27,985
if Soo A is.

437
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:31,255
My gosh.

438
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:40,095
Sorry, my mistake.

439
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,135
How cute.

440
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:48,560
What?

441
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,805
She thinks you're cute.

442
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,770
Soo A, there you are.

443
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:59,185
- Hello. - Hi.

444
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:03,555
Can we talk outside in private?

445
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:05,680
Sure.

446
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,325
I'll wait for you outside.

447
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:21,830
What I'm about to tell you comes from the bottom of my heart.

448
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,275
So please hear me out.

449
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,015
- Okay. - Right.

450
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,900
Guys always have their own ideal type of girl in mind.

451
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:33,215
The same goes for me.

452
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,870
When I first saw you,

453
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:37,425
my heart almost dropped to the ground.

454
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,695
I'll be straightforward with you.

455
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,395
You're my ideal type of girl.

456
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,880
To be honest, you're the only person...

457
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:46,465
I was interested in ever since the freshmen welcoming party.

458
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,535
You might not believe me,

459
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:53,605
but I tend to get really shy around the person I like.

460
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:57,930
But now that I know you feel the same way about me,

461
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:01,145
I was wondering if you'd like to start going out with me.

462
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:04,185
Then what about Mi Rae?

463
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,440
I was only nice to her because she was in my team,

464
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:09,770
and she participated actively in the talent show.

465
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,455
You were the only girl I liked.

466
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:15,155
Soo A.

467
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:21,865
I'm really grateful that you think of me that way.

468
00:30:21,923 --> 00:30:23,135
Okay.

469
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:26,135
But can you give me some time to think about it?

470
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,330
Yes, of course. You should think about it.

471
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,500
Although it won't be a problem since we both like each other.

472
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,015
Anyway, well...

473
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:39,215
I'll wait for your call.

474
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:42,055
Bye.

475
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:48,225
Soo A.

476
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,050
Did anything happen?

477
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:55,565
What? What do you mean?

478
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,875
Is Chan Woo showing interest in you?

479
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,305
No.

480
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:04,475
He just said what all the other seniors said to me.

481
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:07,645
He told me to let him know if I need any help.

482
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,685
Who else said that to you?

483
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:12,355
Jung Hwan? Jin Wook?

484
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,625
I can't believe he made a fool out of me.

485
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:23,625
Do I still seem like a joke to everyone?

486
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,295
Remember when I asked you...

487
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,650
if it'd be okay for me to like you?

488
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:29,650
Chan Woo.

489
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:30,950
Hey, Mi Rae.

490
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:34,735
What I said to you was a mistake.

491
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:38,945
I think I was confused. I actually like someone else.

492
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:07,975
Are you okay?

493
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,885
Are you okay?

494
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,885
I was looking for you because I was worried.

495
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:26,595
I heard Chan Woo and Kyung Seok had a fight at the cafeteria.

496
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:30,195
I heard Chan Woo even pushed you.

497
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:33,195
Did you get hurt?

498
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:35,465
No.

499
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,605
What happened?

500
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:42,545
I thought things were going well between you and Chan Woo.

501
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,275
What's going on?

502
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,685
I don't know.

503
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:53,855
He asked me if he could like me, but then he said it was a mistake.

504
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:58,655
Is that why Kyung Seok got mad and fought with him?

505
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:02,825
No, they fought because Kyung Seok made Chan Woo trip.

506
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,895
I see.

507
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,465
Do you...

508
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,605
have a crush on Chan Woo?

509
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:13,875
No.

510
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:16,905
Not at all.

511
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:19,915
I'm so relieved that he doesn't actually have feelings for me.

512
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:23,245
Yes, don't let it bother you.

513
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:24,630
Have you heard?

514
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:27,185
Chan Woo's nickname is SOJ.

515
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:28,755
Son of Jerk.

516
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,870
He really should behave himself as our senior.

517
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,755
Why does he have to bother freshmen?

518
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:34,355
He's so annoying.

519
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:40,580
Just forget about it. Don't take it to heart.

520
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:42,135
You have me, you know.

521
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,435
I have you?

522
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:48,075
We'll be late for our class. Let's go.

523
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:50,905
Okay.

524
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,415
If he bothers my friend again, I'll teach him a serious lesson.

525
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,300
"My friend"?

526
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:59,585
Friends must help each other. Aren't I right?

527
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,755
Yes, thanks.

528
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,655
You just smiled. Do you feel better now?

529
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:12,265
She's an angel.

530
00:34:14,255 --> 00:34:17,135
Yes, I'm totally fine now.

531
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:22,375
Hello, I'm Yeon Woo Young. I'll be helping you with your experiments.

532
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:30,330
First, I'll explain how the experiments will work.

533
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,255
After that, you'll split up into teams.

534
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:36,525
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

535
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:40,380
You'll do all experiments in teams.

536
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:43,325
Each team will consist of 5 to 6 students.

537
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,395
You'll be graded as teams, so please help each other out.

538
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,380
Now, let's split you guys into teams.

539
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,990
Come on out. We'll do a random draw.

540
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:51,050
It's going to be hard.

541
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,290
I can't believe we have to do team experiments in this class.

542
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:55,435
Gosh, I really hope I can team up with someone I know.

543
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,260
Somebody I know. My goodness.

544
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:59,575
- I heard this class is hard. - Somebody I know.

545
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,415
Someone I know, please.

546
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,785
(Team 3)

547
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:10,185
Mi Rae, are you in Team One?

548
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,255
No, Team Three.

549
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,895
Won Ho, are you in Team Three?

550
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:17,350
I was so worried. Thank goodness one teammate is someone I know.

551
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:19,635
Gosh, you idiot.

552
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,305
I hope there's a pretty girl in our team.

553
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,605
Hey, Won Ho. Are both of you in this team?

554
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:29,975
- What are you doing here? - What?

555
00:35:30,098 --> 00:35:32,775
I was hoping a pretty girl would join us. Why you?

556
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,030
- Are you dumb? - Whatever, Ji Hyo.

557
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:37,745
You're the type to go off the grid when we have a group assignment.

558
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,470
Gosh, you little... Shall I teach you a lesson?

559
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,155
Please don't. I want to live.

560
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:47,295
I bet Won Ho will enlist in the army after getting dumped by a girl.

561
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,550
You'll be a total outcast when you join the military, you idiot.

562
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,235
- Totally. - Okay.

563
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,390
- Are you in Team Three too? - Yes.

564
00:35:57,392 --> 00:35:58,835
Me too.

565
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:00,660
We're in the same team, then.

566
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,345
- Really? - Yes.

567
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:07,130
Is Soo A the last one to join our team?

568
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:08,345
Is this Team Three?

569
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:14,300
This is amazing.

570
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:16,725
All the celebrities of the first year are in our team.

571
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,410
- "Celebrities"? - Yes.

572
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:20,825
You and Do Kyung Seok are very famous, you know.

573
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:23,995
So is Mi Rae.

574
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:30,520
It'll be each team leader's duty to guide the team members...

575
00:36:30,525 --> 00:36:32,675
and make sure to submit the reports on time.

576
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:35,905
What should we do? Are there any volunteers?

577
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,745
How about Mi Rae?

578
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,445
Me?

579
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:45,855
She seems very mature, so I think she'll be a great team leader.

580
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,425
I'm not sure.

581
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,185
I'll just do it.

582
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,125
Then I'll be our note taker.

583
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,535
Do we need a manager?

584
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:10,175
It's that girl, the celebrity of Hankook University.

585
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,975
She's really pretty.

586
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:14,715
She's already so famous.

587
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:17,045
Even guys at other schools are asking me about Hyun Soo A.

588
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:19,385
- Hyun Soo A? - Yes.

589
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,085
I see.

590
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,535
I like soda too.

591
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,875
What are you good-looking people doing here?

592
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:45,390
Are you two dating already?

593
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:47,930
Please stop. Kyung Seok hates hearing things like that.

594
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:51,315
Soo A, what guy wouldn't want to date you?

595
00:37:58,346 --> 00:37:59,895
Can you give me that?

596
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:02,865
Buy one with your money.

597
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,335
I was just kidding.

598
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:12,505
They're just standing, and yet it looks like a scene from a movie.

599
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,575
They're making our school look like a film set.

600
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:18,205
It'll be crazy if they actually date, right?

601
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,145
Yes, totally.

602
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:25,145
- Thanks for this. - Mi Rae.

603
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:33,155
Let's have a quick talk.

604
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:40,265
What's going on? A secret chat between just the two of you?

605
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:42,635
We don't have any secrets.

606
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,305
Go on.

607
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,875
Okay.

608
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:52,815
What's going on? What could it be about?

609
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,375
I'm not sure.

610
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,885
- This is yours, right? - Yes.

611
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,985
- It was on the cafeteria floor. - I see.

612
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:09,325
- What? - Are you really not Kang Mi Rae...

613
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:10,625
from Jaryong Middle School?

614
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,395
The bus stop.

615
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:17,365
Pomelo.

616
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:29,815
Don't tell anyone.

617
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,485
- About what? - What I used to look like.

618
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:36,525
Keep it to yourself.

619
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,865
Kyung Seok.

620
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,035
Do Kyung Seok.

621
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:48,995
See you.

622
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,225
Hey.

623
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,240
Are you wearing perfume?

624
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,495
(Kang Mi Rae)

625
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:20,735
Yes. Am I not even allowed to wear perfume?

626
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:53,135
Will my undergraduate years end up turning into another disaster?

627
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:57,505
Pomelo.

628
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:02,845
By the way, how does he remember my perfume?

629
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,255
There will be a frosh week party here.

630
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,185
For your department.

631
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:20,155
I have so much to do.

632
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:28,265
Help me put this up.

633
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,735
Come on. I haven't found a part-timer yet.

634
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:36,205
Kyung Seok, please?

635
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,345
Kyung Seok, help me with this.

636
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,985
I must say, you're such a nice guy.

637
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,425
Shut it.

638
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:52,795
Although you're very rude to me.

639
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:55,655
I mean, you're nice. So nice.

640
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,595
By the way, who's that girl?

641
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:05,335
No way. Are you interested in girls now?

642
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:09,475
Or was she hitting on you? Tell me.

643
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:13,815
Don't tell anyone.

644
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,215
What I used to look like.

645
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,255
Keep it to yourself.

646
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,785
- Are you an idiot or what? - Hey.

647
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,025
That totally startled me. How could you...

648
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,125
You're not nice at all.

649
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,165
I take back what I said earlier.

650
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:37,905
Shall I...

651
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,235
just not go to the fresh week party?

652
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:45,845
Don't you worry. He doesn't even care about you.

653
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,515
I mean, don't you know him?

654
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,385
But still, I'll be so uncomfortable.

655
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:55,515
Hey.

656
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,870
It's not like you spent...

657
00:42:57,878 --> 00:43:00,395
all that money and risked your life to get the plastic surgery...

658
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,625
just so that you can keep avoiding people.

659
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,135
Right.

660
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:09,765
Or...

661
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,565
should I go ask him for a favour in person?

662
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,990
How about you get close with him...

663
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:16,805
and make him on our side?

664
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,645
It'll be more of a hassle if things go worse.

665
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,070
Let's wait and see for now.

666
00:43:26,073 --> 00:43:28,755
It's because you're anxious.

667
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:32,085
Still,

668
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,210
I have a friend in my department...

669
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:38,365
who'll take my side if something happens to me.

670
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,265
Who is that?

671
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:43,265
Hyun Soo A.

672
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,305
Have you become close with her?

673
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:50,305
Yes.

674
00:44:07,214 --> 00:44:09,710
I'm telling you, he's interested in you.

675
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:10,780
No way.

676
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:12,835
This is really frustrating.

677
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:15,920
I know. He should've returned the perfume to you when we were there.

678
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,490
Why did he call you outside?

679
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,735
That's really not it.

680
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,485
I think this place is so nice, don't you agree?

681
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:39,355
Mi Rae.

682
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,955
- Hi. - Hi, Mi Rae.

683
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:43,550
- Hello. - Why are you late?

684
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,795
Hi.

685
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,580
What is Kyung Seok doing over there?

686
00:44:47,588 --> 00:44:50,335
The owner here is his close friend.

687
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,505
- Is that right? - Hello.

688
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:54,290
- Hello. - Hello.

689
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:56,075
This is on the house.

690
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,475
- Thank you. - Thank you.

691
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,900
Welcome to the start of the fresh week party!

692
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:05,745
- Hello. - Welcome.

693
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,015
- Hi. - Hello.

694
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:11,010
- What's up? - Hey.

695
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,140
New face, new face

696
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:15,110
- New, new, new face - New, new, new face

697
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:16,780
- New face, new face - New face, new face

698
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:18,895
- New, new, new face - New, new, new face

699
00:45:23,057 --> 00:45:25,320
I care more about face than body figure.

700
00:45:25,326 --> 00:45:28,560
It's a no for me if she's ugly no matter how nice her figure is.

701
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,905
Face can be fixed.

702
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,560
Whatever. Soo A.

703
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:35,515
What do you care the most when it comes to men?

704
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,045
Well...

705
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:41,715
I think personality matters the most.

706
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,925
- Great. - What are you doing? Sit down.

707
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,150
- What's that? - All right.

708
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,765
All the seniors are gathered around Soo A.

709
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,690
How about we play the image game?

710
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:58,690
Sure, that sounds fun.

711
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:00,690
Let's play the image game.

712
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:02,305
- I'll go first. Let's go this way. - Okay.

713
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:06,145
I'll start with a weak question.

714
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,685
Who do you think was most delinquent in high school?

715
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,715
1, 2, 3.

716
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,015
Mi Rae has got all the votes.

717
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:17,640
It's not true though.

718
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:21,440
- Shot in the orchard - Shot in the orchard

719
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:25,125
- Bottoms up to remember acacia - Bottoms up to remember acacia

720
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:28,550
- Good. - It's my turn.

721
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:31,590
Who do you think dated the most among us?

722
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:33,175
1, 2, 3.

723
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:36,590
It's me again?

724
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:39,160
- I've never dated anyone. - Alcohol is drinking me

725
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,000
- I am drinking alcohol - I am drinking alcohol

726
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:42,245
- Kang! - Kang!

727
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:43,645
- Mi! - Mi!

728
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:45,145
- Rae! - Rae!

729
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,815
- Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

730
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,955
She's so cool. Mi Rae's good at drinking.

731
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:53,740
It's your turn.

732
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:55,195
Oh, right.

733
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:57,980
- What should I do? - Gosh.

734
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:59,295
Hold on.

735
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:02,465
Are you okay?

736
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,065
Yes.

737
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:07,575
Well, I don't know.

738
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:09,690
Oh, okay.

739
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:13,100
Who do you think kissed the earliest among us?

740
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,660
You mean, kiss? Not a peck?

741
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,485
Kiss. 1, 2, 3.

742
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,870
Kyung Seok, it's you.

743
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:23,385
Wait, hold on. Raise your hands if you voted for him.

744
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:26,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

745
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,180
Raise your hands if you voted for Mi Rae.

746
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

747
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:30,450
It's half and half. Why don't we do a couple drinking?

748
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:32,080
- Will do. - Will do.

749
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:35,680
- Couple drinking. - Couple drinking.

750
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,965
- Couple drinking. - We'll just drink separately.

751
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:41,035
Right, Mi Rae is drinking three times in a row already.

752
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,275
I'll drink two shots then.

753
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:49,770
He's really good at drinking.

754
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, Do Kyung Seok.

755
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:52,200
Give me that.

756
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:53,455
What?

757
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:57,540
Thank you.

758
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:00,225
Shouldn't he make a wish for this favour?

759
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:04,810
I think they really have something.

760
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:06,065
I guess so.

761
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:10,665
He's cool.

762
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:14,075
It's my turn now, right?

763
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:15,675
All right.

764
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:19,405
Who do you think got the most professions from the opposite sex?

765
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,775
1, 2, 3.

766
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:26,370
Me?

767
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:28,900
No, that never happened for me.

768
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:31,240
Come on. It's the image game, not truth or dare.

769
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,455
Drink it.

770
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:37,010
- Drink! - Drink it.

771
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:39,095
I drank a lot already though.

772
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:44,305
- Drink. - Drink it.

773
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,260
Goodness.

774
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,575
Is he out of his mind?

775
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,205
Are you really going to do it?

776
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:58,145
Soo A, can you stand up for a second?

777
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:01,415
Why?

778
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:09,655
(Frosh Week Party for Chemistry Department)

779
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,195
Actually,

780
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:14,495
I wasn't thinking of expressing my feelings for you this soon.

781
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,735
But there were just too many guys going for you,

782
00:49:17,858 --> 00:49:20,305
so I thought I should make you mine quickly.

783
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,145
It's crazy.

784
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:25,745
- Goodness. - It's too corny.

785
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,215
I like you.

786
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,245
Let's go out, Soo A.

787
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,355
What a man.

788
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,555
Great.

789
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,865
I...

790
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:51,605
I never imagined you'd think of me this way.

791
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:55,575
But I don't think I'm ready...

792
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:58,145
to go out with someone yet.

793
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:00,975
I'm sorry.

794
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,485
Still,

795
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,240
we're good friends to each other.

796
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:10,485
We'll stay the same,

797
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:12,625
right?

798
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,295
Of course, we're all friends.

799
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:19,795
Right?

800
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,220
Let's go take some fresh air.

801
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:25,120
Gosh, that idiot doesn't know whom she likes.

802
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,605
- Hope you become closer. - Be friends.

803
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,275
Goodness.

804
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:38,415
Are you having fun?

805
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:40,985
- Hello. - Hello.

806
00:50:52,953 --> 00:50:55,135
Face the reality.

807
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,265
I told you not to do it.

808
00:50:57,658 --> 00:51:00,360
You think it makes sense to profess to a girl...

809
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,975
without giving her any gift in such a generation?

810
00:51:03,196 --> 00:51:06,300
Or prepare some balloons and flowers...

811
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,730
and try again.

812
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,775
I'll help you out.

813
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:15,240
Do you remember my name?

814
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,710
Of course, I remember it...

815
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,710
because your voice sounded nice when you introduced yourself.

816
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:21,640
How about we have fried chicken with beer after class?

817
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:22,895
What do you say?

818
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:26,535
If Soo A goes,

819
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,365
I'll go too.

820
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:31,835
He's cute.

821
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:35,305
What?

822
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,845
You cute boy.

823
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,075
Okay?

824
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:47,785
Okay.

825
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:50,085
"Okay."

826
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,680
It'll be awesome if they become a campus couple.

827
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:56,925
Right?

828
00:51:57,184 --> 00:51:58,425
I guess so.

829
00:52:00,253 --> 00:52:02,265
It was a joke.

830
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,635
Thanks for the drink.

831
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:12,175
Kyung Seok, that...

832
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:23,385
Soo A, you must be surprised a lot.

833
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:26,185
There are those strong-headed punks.

834
00:52:26,546 --> 00:52:28,895
If it's uncomfortable, you may go first. I'll take you home.

835
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,665
No, I'm all right.

836
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,195
Really?

837
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:37,765
How dare he try to hit on you, seriously?

838
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,105
I can't believe it.

839
00:52:40,627 --> 00:52:44,005
Then again, being pretty is a headache indeed.

840
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,275
I know.

841
00:52:45,565 --> 00:52:48,845
Soo A's face looks like it has been sculpted.

842
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:52,015
What? I didn't do any plastic surgery though.

843
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:57,585
Mi Rae is pretty like a doll.

844
00:52:57,744 --> 00:53:00,195
Her face and body figure.

845
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,550
Right.

846
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,735
- Mi Rae's pretty. - That's right.

847
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,005
Mi Rae didn't do any plastic surgery either.

848
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:24,645
Hey.

849
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:26,785
You think it's funny?

850
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,615
What do you mean?

851
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:32,525
Is it fun?

852
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,655
You mean, the fresh week party?

853
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,010
Of course, it's fun.

854
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:39,295
The fresh week party?

855
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:41,665
I'm talking about your ridiculous act.

856
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:50,145
I don't understand what you're saying.

857
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:51,805
Or you're just pretending like you don't know.

858
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:04,170
Soo A, are you crying?

859
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:06,525
- Why this punk... - Don't cry.

860
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:09,510
- Why are you crying? - What's wrong with you, Kyung Seok?

861
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:11,565
- Apologize right now. - Apologize.

862
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:13,535
Kyung Seok!

863
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:20,205
I'm sorry.

864
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,335
I guess I did something wrong.

865
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:25,190
You did nothing wrong.

866
00:54:25,198 --> 00:54:28,015
- Apologize to her, punk! - Don't cry, Soo A.

867
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:30,515
I guess he's mistaken.

868
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:36,455
Soo A.

869
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:44,095
What's wrong with you?

870
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:47,535
Are you a fool or an idiot?

871
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:55,105
Why does that jerk behave so rudely like that?

872
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:56,690
Let's not swear.

873
00:54:56,696 --> 00:54:58,630
Can't you see the situation?

874
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:00,130
Are you taking his side because he's handsome?

875
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:01,845
Stop adding to it!

876
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:04,870
The girls aren't saying anything about his terrible manner.

877
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:06,545
They're crazy about handsome looks.

878
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,100
You're crazy about pretty girls too.

879
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:11,540
You guys got so hyper when Soo A came here.

880
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:12,570
What is it?

881
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,455
Are you mad that you're not a match to Soo A?

882
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,950
- What? - Hey, don't bother them.

883
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,195
Did you talk about me just now?

884
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,220
Girls have got to serve military and fix their attitudes.

885
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:23,120
Why are you bringing up military here?

886
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:24,790
You haven't even served your duty yet!

887
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,720
- I'm going to! - Why don't you go right now?

888
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:28,920
Did I enter an elementary school or what?

889
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:30,060
Stop it.

890
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:32,005
What's wrong? What happened?

891
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:35,515
Some girl was putting up a show. See you.

892
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:37,485
Hey, Kyung Seok!

893
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,385
I need to talk to you for a second.

894
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:53,395
What's wrong with him?

895
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:01,805
Soo A.

896
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:11,615
I really didn't know. I'm sorry.

897
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,515
No, it's okay.

898
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:17,585
I should've told you first.

899
00:56:18,745 --> 00:56:21,195
I know it's hard to tell that kind of story first.

900
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:26,565
Why am I so slow-witted?

901
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,995
Soo A. Are you okay?

902
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:41,945
Don't think about running away like a coward.

903
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:48,155
The loser will give up on Soo A like a man.

904
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:49,955
Understand?

905
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:56,125
Do you feel better now?

906
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,235
Yes, thank you.

907
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,565
Don't mention it. I'm glad you feel better.

908
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:08,705
By the way, have you thought about it?

909
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,905
About our relationship.

910
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:18,615
Yes, I've given it some thought,

911
00:57:19,372 --> 00:57:21,255
but I don't think...

912
00:57:22,275 --> 00:57:23,955
you and I can be together.

913
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:25,340
Why?

914
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:29,280
I think it'll be better for us to stay as friends.

915
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:31,210
Why do we have to?

916
00:57:31,217 --> 00:57:33,595
Is it uncomfortable to go out with your direct senior?

917
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:35,395
Let's make it a secret then.

918
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:38,705
That's not the reason.

919
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:40,835
Then what is it?

920
00:57:41,194 --> 00:57:42,620
What's the reason?

921
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,475
You said you liked me too.

922
00:57:44,564 --> 00:57:46,345
Did I misunderstand?

923
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,075
That's not it.

924
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,945
I'm friends with Mi Rae.

925
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:54,440
What?

926
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:58,155
How can I go out with my friend's crush?

927
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:00,925
Soo A, that's...

928
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,740
I told you. That's not it.

929
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:05,125
I'm sorry. I'll go first.

930
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:06,965
Soo A, hold on.

931
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:09,695
Soo A. Soo A.

932
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:12,505
That's...

933
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:26,015
Hey, calm down.

934
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,625
It's your turn. Drink it.

935
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:37,495
Are you giving up because you might lose?

936
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:41,465
Then give up on Soo A.

937
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:43,195
Don't change words later.

938
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:44,865
Give up on what?

939
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:47,735
- Is she an object or what? - What did you say?

940
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:50,905
You got rejected simply because you were not good enough.

941
00:58:50,997 --> 00:58:53,775
- What, you punk? - Calm down.

942
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,875
What do you know about Soo A?

943
00:58:58,104 --> 00:59:01,585
If you play with Soo A, depending on that handsome face or yours,

944
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,855
I won't let it slide.

945
00:59:06,513 --> 00:59:07,795
Understand?

946
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:20,905
You're too drunk. Let's hurry and go.

947
00:59:22,328 --> 00:59:24,330
- Can I really go? - Yes.

948
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,905
It's really fine.

949
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,430
It seems like the party will end soon though.

950
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:31,730
No, it might last for a long time this way.

951
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:34,985
- You must be tired, so go. - Right, go home.

952
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,740
- Still... - Hurry and go.

953
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:38,285
It's okay, so go.

954
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:44,450
Then I'll go first.

955
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,695
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

956
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,235
Bye.

957
01:00:05,738 --> 01:00:08,215
Do you like me?

958
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:09,500
What?

959
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:12,325
Do you like me? Do you want to go out with me?

960
01:00:12,445 --> 01:00:13,685
No.

961
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:19,595
Then did you babble on to Soo A to hit me in the back?

962
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:21,450
- What? - She says...

963
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:23,535
she can't go out with me because you like me.

964
01:00:24,624 --> 01:00:27,805
Who said that? Because I've never said such a thing.

965
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:29,875
Then go tell her directly yourself...

966
01:00:30,129 --> 01:00:32,475
that you don't care even if she goes out with me.

967
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:35,145
Why should I do that?

968
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,045
Hey, stop right there.

969
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:41,115
What are you doing?

970
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:43,415
Are you crazy?

971
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,755
- What did I do? - What did you do?

972
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,540
Hey, you flirted with me first.

973
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:51,595
How dare you act like you don't know, wench?

974
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:54,035
Did you think things would work out for real because I was nice to you?

975
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,895
Don't make me laugh. People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

976
01:00:58,658 --> 01:01:00,875
Gosh, you plastic monster.

977
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:11,085
How dare you swear at me?

978
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:13,615
What did I do so wrong?

979
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:15,855
What did I do?

980
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,985
Why that crazy... Do you want to die?

981
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:20,525
That crazy witch. Hey!

982
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,765
Don't make me laugh. People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

983
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:30,295
Gosh, you plastic monster.

984
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:41,645
Hey, gosh.

985
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:57,895
(We thank Park Min Ji for special appearance.)

986
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:11,605
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

987
01:02:11,664 --> 01:02:14,460
Aren't you curious what Mi Rae looked like in the past?

988
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:16,600
Mi Rae and Kyung Seok went to the same middle school.

989
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:19,500
It's nothing to hide, so why didn't they tell us?

990
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:21,240
Maybe he liked her.

991
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,540
If I didn't know she did plastic surgery,

992
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:24,340
is there a reason why I should ask her about it when she didn't?

993
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:26,010
You don't look that thoughtless.

994
01:02:26,012 --> 01:02:27,880
He gathered all the freshmen in the department.

995
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,780
Tell Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee...

996
01:02:29,782 --> 01:02:31,210
that their mom wants to see them.

997
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:34,135
All the female freshmen may leave except for Kang Mi Rae.

998
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:37,135
Mi Rae. Let's go.

999
01:02:37,824 --> 01:02:39,165
What are you doing right now?
