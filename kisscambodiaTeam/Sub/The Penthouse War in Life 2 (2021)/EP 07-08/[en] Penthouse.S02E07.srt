00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,710
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,750
How did the necklace
investigation go?

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,450
We found a trace
of Bae Ro Na's blood.

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,620
It matches precisely
with Bae Ro Na's DNA.

5
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,699
Bae Ro Na's blood
on Ha Eun Byeol's necklace?

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,199
Things are getting fun.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,670
- When is her funeral?
- It's today.

8
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,539
Who's attending?

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,939
Ms. Oh Yoon Hee didn't break
the news to anyone.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,709
I believe it'll be
just her husband, Mr. Ha.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,348
I guess her parents weren't
too good to the people around them.

12
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:53,479
Looks like it'll be
a lonely funeral.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,229
(Cheon Seo Jin)

14
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:06,559
(Cheon Seo Jin)

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,769
(Cheon Seo Jin)

16
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,809
I told you that today is
Ro Na's funeral!

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,279
I told you to not call!

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,148
Our Eun Byeol!

19
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:26,319
You need to come home right now.

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,849
- Eun Byeol!
- What's going on?

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,349
Mom!

22
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,220
You need to come right now!

23
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,628
Eun Byeol!

24
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,959
No! Eun Byeol!

25
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,689
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee. There's
an emergency at work.

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,720
I can't get out of it.

27
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:11,830
(Bae Ro Na)

28
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,019
(Bae Ro Na)

29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,959
Are you in that big a rush to die?

30
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,459
Let go.

31
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,799
I'm going to Ro Na.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,160
I can't let my daughter go
all by herself.

33
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,769
Do you think I saved you to do this?

34
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,838
I'll punish myself.

35
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,338
You can die when you want to,

36
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:59,279
but you need to find out
who did this to Ro Na.

37
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,239
The real killer...

38
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,580
is someone else.

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,820
The real killer?

40
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,249
Who is it?

41
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,519
Ha Eun Byeol.

42
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,429
And behind that, is Cheon Seo Jin.

43
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,200
Eun Byeol!

44
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:24,998
Eun Byeol! What's wrong with you?

45
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,670
- Get away from me!
- Eun Byeol!

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,269
No! Eun Byeol!

47
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,839
Go away!

48
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,880
Eun Byeol!

49
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,179
Eun Byeol, Mom is right here.
Please come back to your senses!

50
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,249
Mom.

51
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,249
Over there. There's Ro Na.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,559
Over there!

53
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,830
No, she isn't!

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,928
Ro Na is dead.

55
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:57,099
How many times do I need to tell you
that she's not coming back?

56
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,499
No! She's over there.

57
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,040
There's Ro Na right there.

58
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,880
Don't come.

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,550
No!

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,290
Eun Byeol!

61
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,929
Eun Byeol.

62
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,800
Eun Byeol.

63
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,099
- Eun Byeol!
- It's okay, Eun Byeol.

64
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,808
It's okay, my child.

65
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,770
Please save me, Dad.

66
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,139
I'm too scared.
It's driving me crazy.

67
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,480
Ro Na keeps showing up.

68
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,579
She tells me to die.

69
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,420
That laugh...

70
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,489
Eun Byeol.

71
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,160
What should I do?

72
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,840
Please carve it out of my brain.

73
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,679
You're a doctor.

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,210
Please remove Ro Na
from my brain!

75
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,748
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol. No.

76
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:24,819
Eun Byeol!

77
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,290
Please help me, Dad.

78
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,100
I want to sleep.

79
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,400
I'll protect you.

80
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,030
Trust me.

81
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:39,739
I'll do whatever it takes...

82
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,170
to erase your memory.

83
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,980
Dad...

84
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,780
- Eun Byeol...
- Dad...

85
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,249
Get it together, Yoon Hee.

86
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,689
Will you crumble like this?

87
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,489
Are you sure...

88
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,929
it was Eun Byeol?

89
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,030
Stay alive and confirm for yourself.

90
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,400
No.

91
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,770
I don't want to.

92
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,040
What can I do now, anyway?

93
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,669
If I hadn't come back
to get revenge,

94
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,578
Ro Na wouldn't have died.

95
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,309
Why did I care so much
about taking revenge?

96
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,649
Why did you send my daughter here?

97
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,808
You should've stopped her.

98
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,948
You should've
stopped her at all costs!

99
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,050
Do you really not know
why Ro Na came back?

100
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,590
She asked me.

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,929
Please send me to Korea.

102
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,999
No. It's too dangerous.

103
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,470
I want to fulfill
Seol A's dream for her.

104
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,170
I promise to win
the grand prize trophy...

105
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,239
from Cheong A Art Festival.

106
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,040
Then Seol A...

107
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,780
may forgive my mom a little bit.

108
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,749
Why did you do it?

109
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,960
For me...

110
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,319
Why did you do that for me?

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,460
Why did you do that for me, Ro Na?

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,899
Will you still die?

113
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,169
Why did you do that?

114
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,328
- No!
- If you truly wish to die...

115
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:20,669
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just die.

116
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,409
If you're going to fall into despair
and implode like this,

117
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,239
just die as those scumbags want.

118
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,139
But remember one thing.

119
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,509
Ha Yoon Chul...

120
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,920
was involved in Ro Na's death.

121
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,059
Wait.

122
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,689
What did you just say?

123
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,600
Did you say "Yoon Chul"?

124
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,470
No way.

125
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:51,368
You're mistaken. He'd never do that.

126
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:54,770
Yoon Chul is with
Eun Byeol right now.

127
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,439
He knows that his daughter did it.

128
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,879
What?

129
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,179
If your daughter's murderer
living happily is fine with you,

130
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,650
do as you wish.

131
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,249
No.

132
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,220
Yoon Chul wouldn't...

133
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,359
Yoon Chul wouldn't do that. No.

134
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,400
No! It can't be!
Yoon Chul wouldn't do that!

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,650
That's the only way.

136
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,910
It's what Eun Byeol wants.

137
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,218
There may be side effects.

138
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,819
There may not be.

139
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,959
She's only 19 years old.

140
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,500
She has more days to live
than the stars in the sky.

141
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
We can't tell her...

142
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,540
to live each of them in torment.

143
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,370
How could we?

144
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,540
Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine.

145
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,609
It'll be fine.

146
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,319
Please join me...

147
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,390
so Ro Na isn't lonely
as she leaves. Please.

148
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,030
I'll wait for you.

149
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,010
Who are you?

150
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,260
Su Ryeon?

151
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,939
How have you been?

152
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,040
It's been a while,

153
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,740
Joo Dan Tae.

154
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:54,020
What are you doing?

155
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,959
You're always so rough
with your greetings.

156
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,630
Ae Gyo?

157
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:05,829
Zip it back up.

158
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
What?

159
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Did you think Su Ryeon
came back to life?

160
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,510
Were you shocked, Dan Tae?

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,349
You really were.

162
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,179
How adorable.

163
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,859
What's going on? When did you come?

164
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,489
I came straight here...

165
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,530
as soon as I landed.

166
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,000
So?

167
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,059
Did you like your surprise?

168
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:45,099
You're still a pro
at surprising people.

169
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,339
You should've told me
you were coming.

170
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,938
I would've picked you up.

171
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,010
That's so lame.

172
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
You know I hate things like that.

173
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,890
I was trapped
in that hick town for two years.

174
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,489
It was hot and humid.

175
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,990
That annoying weather
drove me crazy.

176
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,530
Then you should've come sooner.

177
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,969
Why did you refuse to come?

178
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,098
If you refused again this month,

179
00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:20,699
I was planning to go get you
personally.

180
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,079
Su Ryeon died.

181
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,410
It felt weird.

182
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,780
As if...

183
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,890
I had died.

184
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,559
Sure. I guess that's understandable.

185
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,530
You lived half of your life
as Su Ryeon.

186
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,229
No one saw you, right?

187
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,329
All the helpers went out.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,569
They're coming after 3 p.m.

189
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,910
The penthouse.

190
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,179
This place is insane.

191
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,380
How much is all of this worth?

192
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,689
Just these few items here...

193
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,319
would be about a million dollars.

194
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
Su Ryeon was so lucky.

195
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:21,729
She enjoyed this luxury
all her life.

196
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,900
But what's the use?

197
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,000
It's over once you drop dead.

198
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:35,308
You can't stay here.
The kids will be back soon.

199
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,178
We don't want the other residents
to see you either,

200
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:38,410
so let's talk somewhere else.

201
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,380
So what?

202
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,050
Aren't they going to
find out soon anyway?

203
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,890
That I'm Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung's real mom.

204
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,130
Then why did you tell me to come?

205
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,929
I didn't tell the kids yet.

206
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,670
They're sensitive right now.
They need time to accept it.

207
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,410
Gibberish!
Why do they still need time?

208
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,880
It's not like
I'm going to raise them.

209
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,478
What I want is this penthouse.

210
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,050
Not being their mom.

211
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,619
Wearing long dresses
that are so not my style,

212
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,420
chugging expensive wine
that I don't even like...

213
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,589
I lived as Su Ryeon for...

214
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,089
20 years!

215
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,030
Aren't I qualified
to enjoy this now?

216
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,900
Hello. I'm Shim Su Ryeon.

217
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:37,969
I heard so much about you
from my late father.

218
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:42,150
So you have a special relationship
with Simoon Construction?

219
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,478
Gosh, I'm sick of it.

220
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,920
Didn't you say that I can live
as Na Ae Gyo at this penthouse?

221
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,020
You will, I promise.

222
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,459
Just wait until I sort things out.

223
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,459
How can I trust you?

224
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,870
This drug is still being
clinically tested.

225
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,870
It can make a person forget
recent traumatic events.

226
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:12,410
What are the side effects?

227
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,140
The patient may have a seizure
while the drug is administered.

228
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,179
It can also distort
the patient's memories.

229
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,449
In the worst-case scenario,

230
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,660
she may lose all her memories.

231
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,870
Eun Byeol has...

232
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:44,069
always been a lucky girl.

233
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,780
Please get started.

234
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,329
(Yoon Hee)

235
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,640
(Yoon Hee)

236
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,880
The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave...

237
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,309
Ro Na, wait for me.

238
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,179
Ro Na, wait!

239
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,420
Let's go.

240
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,489
Get your hands off of my daughter!

241
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,760
Ro Na!

242
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,459
If you lay a finger on
our Ro Na one more time,

243
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,059
I'm going to sue you all.

244
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:50,510
No. It can't be.

245
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,479
I don't believe that Yoon Chul
can be so mean.

246
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,309
Logan must be mistaken.

247
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,380
Yoon Chul will come. I'm sure of it.

248
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,760
Eun Byeol!

249
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:18,469
Eun Byeol! What should we do?

250
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,598
What is going on?

251
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,108
- Eun Byeol!
- Move.

252
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,009
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

253
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,040
Eun Byeol, I'm right here.

254
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,409
Eun Byeol! What should we do?

255
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,490
The drug was administered too fast,

256
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,460
so she went into shock.

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,500
I gave her a sedative.
She'll be fine now.

258
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:56,970
(Yoon Hee)

259
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,950
(Yoon Hee)

260
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:11,049
Was our goal Hera Palace
that has only 100 floors?

261
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,658
A taller, fancier building
will be built soon.

262
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,159
In Cheonsoo District.

263
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,800
Did you win the development rights?

264
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,229
The land compensation
must be immense.

265
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,839
Not a problem.

266
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,269
I know Seo Jin's weakness.

267
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,569
Her weakness?

268
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,480
I didn't expect a woman like her
to have weaknesses.

269
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,619
Intriguing.

270
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,079
So what is it?

271
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,490
Her daughter killed a girl.

272
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:52,128
What's more, the girl's mother
detests Seo Jin more than anyone.

273
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:55,599
To be fair, Seo Jin loathes her
quite strongly as well.

274
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,930
She killed a girl?

275
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:00,668
No matter how cold-hearted
Seo Jin can be,

276
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,939
she couldn't sit back
and let her daughter...

277
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,309
end up in prison.

278
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,280
This is my chance to take over
the entire Cheong A Group.

279
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,619
Cheong A will be ours.

280
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,349
Are you serious?

281
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,148
Are you saying that Joo Dan Tae
Village will be completed soon?

282
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:20,789
Just be careful not to get caught.

283
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,490
If anyone finds you out,
all our plans will go up in smoke.

284
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,460
This is exciting.

285
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,769
A new penthouse
in Cheonsoo District?

286
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,899
Just the thought of it
makes me thrilled.

287
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,180
You know it's mine, right?

288
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,348
So don't act up and do as I say.

289
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,520
You've been waiting all your life...

290
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,249
to live with Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung...

291
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,290
in a penthouse.

292
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:58,589
This is nice.

293
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:01,899
I can finally hear you
breathe again.

294
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,638
It must be the kids. Do you
want to see them from a distance?

295
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,039
Forget it. That's unnecessary.

296
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,280
I've been fine without seeing them
all these years.

297
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,750
It's not like I feel
any affection for them.

298
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,950
Come this way.

299
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,859
Don't you have a lesson today?
Are you skipping it again?

300
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,689
- Why?
- Leave me alone.

301
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,790
Gosh, I can't believe you.

302
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,240
Ladies first.

303
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,579
Do you like it?

304
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,300
(May the flower that fell too early
become a bright star in the sky.)

305
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,009
Ms. Oh.

306
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,909
Who was it?
Who bought you off that day?

307
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:54,940
Please don't do this.

308
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,709
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

309
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,180
Who was it? Answer me!

310
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,349
Well...

311
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,859
(Ha Yoon Chul)

312
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,659
(Ha Yoon Chul)

313
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,440
Ha Yoon Chul?

314
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,809
(Logan Lee)

315
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,790
Ha Yoon Chul...
Where is that jerk right now?

316
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,790
Get some sleep.
You didn't sleep at all last night.

317
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,500
Eun Byeol will...

318
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:59,109
wake up safe, right?

319
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,339
And all the bad memories
will be gone, right?

320
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,909
Yes, definitely.

321
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,419
Without you,

322
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,550
I couldn't have done this.

323
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,790
Seeing you genuinely worry
about Eun Byeol...

324
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,930
and do all you can do for her,
I realized this.

325
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,329
Both Eun Byeol...

326
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,069
and I...

327
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,940
need you.

328
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,149
(Restricted Area)

329
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:50,889
(Cheong A Medical Center)

330
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,869
But remember one thing.

331
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,210
Ha Yoon Chul was
involved in Ro Na's death.

332
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,790
My daughter is dead.

333
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,760
And you're busy trying to save your
daughter from becoming a murderer?

334
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,459
My baby died
because of your daughter!

335
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,429
Do you feel more sorry for your
murderer daughter than my daughter?

336
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,899
Why should your daughter be happy?

337
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,270
She doesn't deserve happiness.

338
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,230
- No!
- Yoon Hee! No!

339
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,970
No!

340
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:04,129
Seok Hoon, are you really being
like this because of Ro Na?

341
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,499
You won't eat, you won't talk,

342
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,939
and won't do anything.

343
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,339
How many days has it been?

344
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,139
Don't you think you're overreacting?

345
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,139
Shut up...

346
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,710
if you're the slightest bit sorry.

347
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,180
Why should I be sorry?

348
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,119
I'm not the one
who committed the murder.

349
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,290
I know who killed Ro Na.

350
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,658
She must be so happy...

351
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,129
now that her eyesore is gone.

352
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,639
That's right.
It's who you think it is.

353
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:47,309
Ha Eun Byeol. It's her.

354
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,079
What proof do you have?

355
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,379
I played a little joke on Eun Byeol,

356
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,750
telling her that you're
absolutely in love with Ro Na.

357
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,749
She then went crazy.

358
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,689
But still, how can she kill someone?

359
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,690
I didn't expect this at all!

360
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,760
What have you done?

361
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,659
Why did you do that?

362
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
What has...

363
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,129
Ro Na ever done?

364
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,419
Don't go.

365
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,129
Don't go to Yoon Hee.

366
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:40,960
I have to go.

367
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,270
I missed Ro Na's funeral.

368
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:44,999
She must be struggling alone.

369
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,399
Don't you think this is
even harsher on Yoon Hee?

370
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,740
Your daughter killed Yoon Hee's,

371
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,839
and yet, you want to lie to her
and stay with her?

372
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,980
Don't you think that's truly insane?

373
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,849
What will she say
when she finds out?

374
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,449
She'll probably rip
all of us apart...

375
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,490
because she's mortified.

376
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,460
So what?

377
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,430
If Yoon Hee wants me to die,
so be it.

378
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,470
Both you...

379
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
and I.

380
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:42,419
Can we...

381
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,960
start over?

382
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:49,629
- Are you insane?
- I know...

383
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,399
how much of a heartbreak
I've caused you.

384
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:58,040
I'm sorry. I'll be sorry
until the day I die.

385
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:00,309
Forgive me.

386
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,908
Give me one more chance.

387
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:05,710
I'll be good to you forever.

388
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:08,450
Don't you dare to think...

389
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,919
that I'm here because I love you
and I feel bad for you.

390
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,919
I'm here...

391
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,490
because I have no choice.
I'm Eun Byeol's dad.

392
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,659
I'm not yours anymore.

393
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,999
My head is only filled
with Yoon Hee.

394
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,030
You and Yoon Hee are over!

395
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,569
Don't you understand?

396
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm not doing this only for myself.

397
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,639
It's for Eun Byeol.

398
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,970
If you would just change your mind,

399
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,408
our family can go back
to how things were before.

400
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:35,940
We can be happy.

401
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:37,649
Happy?

402
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,579
You think...

403
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,349
we deserve any happiness?

404
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,990
Don't leave.

405
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,129
Don't leave me!

406
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,500
Don't leave me for Yoon Hee!

407
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,809
Please.

408
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:22,889
Goodness.

409
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:26,559
Poor you.

410
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:32,230
You must be so disheartened
that Ro Na is dead.

411
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,569
When's the funeral?

412
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:37,709
Make sure to give me a call.

413
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,879
I, Kyu Jin,

414
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,909
will at least send the biggest
flower arrangement.

415
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,049
You need a floral arrangement
from an assemblyman at a funeral...

416
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,918
to make the funeral look good.

417
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,859
Poor Yoon Hee!
What is she going to do?

418
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,490
You're drunk. Let's head in.

419
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,260
But you know,

420
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:07,000
the more I think about it,
the person who killed Ro Na,

421
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,868
I don't think it's Mr. Park.

422
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:12,769
Min Hyuk told me...

423
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,050
that Mr. Park absolutely
adored Ro Na.

424
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,119
The case is already closed.

425
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:21,919
He turned himself in.

426
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,689
You're right.

427
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,990
The murderer turned himself in.

428
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,559
But you know,

429
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:35,358
even when Min Seol A died,

430
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,500
everyone said it was a suicide...

431
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,540
except for me.
I knew that she was murdered.

432
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,209
It could be...

433
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,579
that the murderer is
inside Hera Palace again.

434
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Hey!

435
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,490
Cheon Seo Jin.

436
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,760
It's not her, is it?

437
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:09,828
She didn't kill Ro Na
out of wrath...

438
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:12,699
after hearing that you and Yoon Hee
are getting married?

439
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,270
You punk!

440
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,739
If you're drunk, shut up
and go to sleep.

441
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,710
Don't blabber nonsense.

442
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,210
The phone is turned off.

443
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:57,379
Please leave a message
after the tone.

444
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,030
Are you awake now?

445
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,700
Are you okay?

446
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,599
You kept talking in sleep...

447
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,430
and were in pain all night.

448
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,408
How can you handle...

449
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,909
Cheon Seo Jin and Joo Dan Tae
when you're so fragile?

450
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,280
You'll have to battle
against Ha Yoon Chul too.

451
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,480
How much do you know
about Ro Na's death?

452
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,290
Tell me what I'm missing out on.

453
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,828
This is Eun Byeol and Seo Jin...

454
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:48,430
on the night of the incident.

455
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,069
I'm guessing...

456
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,300
that Eun Byeol's dress was in there.

457
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:58,710
I checked the dress myself.

458
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,180
There was nothing on it.

459
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:04,010
It took a lot of work to get this.

460
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,119
I went to every dress shop in Seoul.

461
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:17,359
They got the exact same dress made
at a different shop.

462
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,200
Then who set off the fire alarm?

463
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:30,240
Was that Cheon Seo Jin too?

464
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:32,569
Or...

465
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,339
Ha Yoon Chul?

466
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:39,710
Based on what we know so far,
those two didn't do that.

467
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,519
The time and their locations
don't match.

468
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,760
Are you saying it really went off
on its own? Right at that moment?

469
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,329
They must've told someone to do it.
Secretary Do or someone.

470
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,558
There's a good enough reason
for that to be possible.

471
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,328
We only have guessed so far.

472
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:56,609
We don't have definite evidence.

473
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,499
I'm going to kill Cheon Seo Jin.

474
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm going to kill them all,
Ha Yoon Chul and Ha Eun Byeol!

475
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:07,010
Oh Yoon Hee!

476
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,009
It's too early for you to move.

477
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,250
I don't care.

478
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,078
I can just kill them...

479
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,720
and kill myself.

480
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,019
I don't want to live
a second longer.

481
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,818
Just being awake right now feels
like a nightmare.

482
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:23,989
You also made
someone else's child die.

483
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,159
If you're going to die,
you need to pay back...

484
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,700
what you owe Seol A
and Su Ryeon first.

485
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,970
That way, you'll be a little less
ashamed when you meet Ro Na.

486
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,708
What makes you so shameless?

487
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:39,609
You're the one who just took
the marrow and left her!

488
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,979
If you feel so sorry for Seol A,

489
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,549
your parents should pay
for what they've done first!

490
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,310
Ms. Oh!

491
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,050
Could you step outside for a bit?

492
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,089
I'm flying to the US soon.

493
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,329
Once I'm gone,

494
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,700
you're the only one who can take
revenge for Su Ryeon and Seol A.

495
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,709
I killed Min Seol A.

496
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:19,010
What right do I have to take
revenge for Seol A?

497
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,720
What can I possibly do?

498
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,419
Look for Na Ae Gyo.
The twins' real mother.

499
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,830
She knows
all of Joo Dan Tae's secrets.

500
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,399
I'm Na Ae Gyo.

501
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:40,200
I have something to tell you
before I leave.

502
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,740
I know what Joo Dan Tae did
to Shim Su Ryeon...

503
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,939
and what kind of a person he is.

504
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,279
I might never get to tell you
if I don't tell you today.

505
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,749
And as she said,
she disappeared that day.

506
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:00,859
- That's...
- It's Na Ae Gyo.

507
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,160
She looks just like Shim Su Ryeon.

508
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,669
- No way.
- You have to find her.

509
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,268
I've been tracing
Joo Dan Tae's move every day...

510
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:19,108
for the past two years,
and I couldn't find her.

511
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,609
But recently,
I got some news on her.

512
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,209
She just entered Korea
from Thailand last week.

513
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:28,550
She'll surely get in touch
with Joo Dan Tae.

514
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,569
What a surprise.

515
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,568
You're never awake at this hour,
let alone eat breakfast.

516
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:55,170
I woke up early. Maybe it's
because it's a different bed.

517
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,339
I got hungry.

518
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,440
What brings you here so early?

519
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,309
There are some things that need
to be taken care of urgently.

520
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,579
I need to sell all the buildings
in Gangnam under your name.

521
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,819
I need cash.

522
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,850
There are some great deals
in Cheonsoo District.

523
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:10,519
Before the redevelopment plans
are announced,

524
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,519
I need to purchase the land
at a good price.

525
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,190
Is that why...

526
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:18,060
you insisted so much
that I come to Korea early?

527
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:22,569
So that you can sell my buildings?

528
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:26,239
Of course not.

529
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,179
More than anything, I missed you.

530
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:38,880
Now that I think about it,
you've been looking great.

531
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,789
Is dating Seo Jin that great?

532
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,690
You know that it's all just a play.

533
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,489
You're the only woman I'll love.

534
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,830
Your acting improved.

535
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,469
Want to play a game?
We haven't played in a while.

536
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,549
You've gotten much better.

537
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,548
Seems like you've only been
playing pool in Thailand.

538
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:19,560
You were never a match for me.

539
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,690
I know.

540
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,199
Mom?

541
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,330
Mom!

542
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,539
Eun Byeol! I'm here.
Are you awake now?

543
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,409
Why did I sleep for so long?

544
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:38,279
Aren't I late for school?

545
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:41,380
You're at the hospital.

546
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,619
The hospital? Why am I here?

547
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:50,190
You couldn't sleep
and that must've thrown you off.

548
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,988
You just suddenly passed out.

549
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:55,259
I passed out?

550
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,928
What date is it today?

551
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,199
I need to get ready
for Cheong A Arts Festival.

552
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,669
It's over already.

553
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,310
What do you mean?

554
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:10,909
I don't remember any of it.

555
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:15,350
What about the grand prize?

556
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:17,549
Who won the grand prize?

557
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:19,980
The grand prize?

558
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:23,949
Ro Na got it.

559
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,219
Ro Na?

560
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,730
She really got the grand prize?

561
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,199
I'm sorry, Mom.

562
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,969
You must be so mad.

563
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:45,509
You really don't remember any of it?

564
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:49,880
Not even the fact
that Ro Na is dead?

565
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:54,650
Why is Ro Na dead?
Why all of a sudden?

566
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:58,659
Well,

567
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
there has been an accident.

568
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:04,859
I'll fill you in on it all.

569
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,100
Don't force yourself
to remember anything.

570
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:12,000
Why don't I remember anything?

571
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,138
Is something wrong with me?

572
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:17,638
I have midterms coming up.

573
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:20,039
The mock tests are coming up too.

574
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,150
I can't just ruin them all.

575
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:25,379
I need to go home right now.
I need to study.

576
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,849
No, you're not ill. It's fine.

577
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,889
You just need some rest at home.

578
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,429
It's all in the past.

579
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:37,259
Nothing happened.

580
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,199
It's okay.

581
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,169
She really doesn't seem
to remember anything,

582
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,278
from singing at
Cheong A Arts Festival...

583
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:54,349
to Ro Na's death.
She doesn't remember any of it.

584
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,810
There seem to be no side effects.

585
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,380
It's too early to relax.
Keep a good eye on her.

586
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:02,419
I'm taking her out of the hospital
as soon as I can.

587
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,790
She'll feel more at ease at home.

588
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:08,230
You'll...

589
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,230
come to see Eun Byeol, right?

590
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,799
I'll pick you up.

591
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:42,489
Where are you, Yoon Hee?

592
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,099
Welcome to the Hera Palace's lobby!

593
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,170
Doesn't it look like a lobby
at a luxury hotel abroad?

594
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:55,008
And this fountain.
It's our Hera Palace's landmark.

595
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:57,480
You should take a picture here.

596
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,408
Assemblyman Lee is the only member
of the National Assembly...

597
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,580
who lives in Hera Palace, isn't he?

598
00:42:03,779 --> 00:42:05,649
We worry about
what people may think,

599
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,750
so we live in rentals.

600
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,019
That's ridiculous.

601
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,589
Is it a crime to be wealthy?

602
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,158
If you're going to be
an assemblyman,

603
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,729
you should know how to make money...

604
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,658
and scam people just enough.

605
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:21,868
If your family is poor,
how can you manage a nation?

606
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:23,599
I know, right?

607
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,969
It's not like you get paid
for being honorable.

608
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,869
Right? Let's take a picture.
Stand right there.

609
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,539
Okay. Kimchi. Cheeze.

610
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,650
Smile.

611
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:41,790
Sorry.

612
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,219
What's your problem?
I almost fell flat on my face.

613
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,589
Do those people know
that a person died here?

614
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,929
Are you insane?
What if they hear you?

615
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,900
How do you get more and more
shameless by the day?

616
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,039
How long has it been
since Ro Na died,

617
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,539
that you bring people here
with your "Kimchi. Cheese."

618
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,679
And laugh loudly like that?

619
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,609
You're an assemblyman's wife.

620
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,909
You need to work on
your personality.

621
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,650
Why that woman...

622
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,230
(Body scrub waitlist)

623
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:24,029
Number three!

624
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,429
Coming.

625
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,810
It's so nice seeing you here.

626
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:38,139
I hear you give
an amazing body scrub.

627
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,149
I wanted to see if your hands
are as fierce...

628
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,949
as your mouth, Ms. Jincheon.

629
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:46,850
Please lie down, ma'am.

630
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,329
That hurts.

631
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,900
Why are you scrubbing so hard?

632
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,928
Hey, lady. Are you trying
to skin me alive?

633
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:04,869
My apologies, ma'am.
I'll scrub lighter.

634
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,739
That's cold!

635
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:13,979
How can you make any money...

636
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,940
if you can't even get
the water temperature right?

637
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,449
It's hot.

638
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:20,989
My gosh. That feels nice.

639
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:24,790
Ms. Jincheon. Clip my toenails too.

640
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,730
For the ladies with me too.

641
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:31,560
That's not included
in the list of services.

642
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,369
I'll pay you five dollars more.

643
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,199
What? You won't do it?

644
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,639
Is five dollars not real money?

645
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:42,770
I guess you're too rich for that.

646
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,479
Where's the owner?

647
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,149
Is this the type of help you use?

648
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,850
Get the owner in here!

649
00:44:58,589 --> 00:44:59,589
Hi.

650
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,589
Which of you old hags is the owner?

651
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,959
Which one of you is it?

652
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,600
Is this how you train your help?

653
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,969
Madam Chairman.
What brings you here?

654
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:13,499
Chairman?

655
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,110
She's Chairman Song Hee Soo
of Hyeyeon Group.

656
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:19,339
She's Chairman Byun
and she's Chairman Choi.

657
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,110
Get up and introduce yourself.

658
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:24,110
Hyeyeon...

659
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,690
Madam... Madam Chairman.

660
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,989
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes, ma'am.

661
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,630
Why are you taking low-lives
as customers and ruining your ears?

662
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,860
This is my job.

663
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:40,859
It's fine, madam.

664
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,330
I'm not fine.

665
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:44,568
You are someone I cherish.

666
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:47,440
And we're the only ones
who can call you "Ms. Jincheon".

667
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:50,210
Who dares to insult Ms. Jincheon?

668
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:51,810
Who was it?

669
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,178
Also. I won't use the same water
as political sewer rats.

670
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,520
Replace the water in the tubs.

671
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:00,980
Yes, madam.

672
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:03,488
Drain the tubs!

673
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:04,589
Okay!

674
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:08,489
How's my dear niece Jenny?

675
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,428
She's doing well.

676
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:13,329
She's busy preparing for college.

677
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:16,770
I said to call me if
anyone ever harasses you.

678
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,100
We'll go
and snuff the life out of them.

679
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,909
You keep too much to yourself.

680
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,480
You never ask for any favors.

681
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,379
I'll make you all
some nice, cold iced coffee.

682
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,580
- Let's go.
- Sure. Of all the...

683
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,600
What is going on here?

684
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,299
Darn it.

685
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,480
Honey. It's me, Kyu Jin.

686
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,209
Oh dear.
You must've had many clients.

687
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,778
You're all puffy.

688
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:06,080
You're totally...

689
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,230
Ms. Kang. You know
he's an annoying dirtbag.

690
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:23,298
Please be understanding
with your magnanimous heart.

691
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:26,969
Seriously. I could take you down
with a single punch. You...

692
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,080
What... Has that woman
lost her mind? How dare...

693
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,309
How dare you talk to
our Lady Kang that way?

694
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,679
"Lady Kang"?

695
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,919
Have you lost your mind?

696
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,779
Let go. Let go.

697
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,118
Hold it in.

698
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,618
Whatever it takes,

699
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,219
hold it in, please!

700
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:49,759
She's way on top of us.

701
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:54,299
Jenny's mom has secret connections
to the highest people.

702
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,830
What?

703
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,150
How do you feel?

704
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,119
Eun Byeol, I haven't seen you
since the festival.

705
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,818
What brings you here?

706
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:19,759
I came to see you...

707
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,429
and Eun Byeol.

708
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,799
Go to your room.

709
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,420
You weren't answering your phone.

710
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:37,170
Is something wrong?

711
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:39,738
Eun Byeol wasn't feeling well,

712
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:42,009
so I took her to the hospital
to get an IV.

713
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,549
I see. You went to the hospital.

714
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,888
Don't forget we're having lunch
with Assemblyman Lee tomorrow.

715
00:48:56,889 --> 00:48:57,900
We are?

716
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,130
I forgot.

717
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:03,399
Can't we reschedule?

718
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,638
If we do,

719
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,868
who knows
what that big mouth may say.

720
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:09,439
He keeps going on and on
about how he helped us...

721
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,338
get the approval to construct
Cheong A Art Center.

722
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,279
It's driving me crazy.

723
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:16,310
It's just lunch,
so we can make it quick.

724
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,080
Okay?

725
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,219
(Cheong A Arts High School)

726
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:36,469
This is the song I'm going to sing
at the festival.

727
00:49:37,529 --> 00:49:38,540
What do you think?

728
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:41,310
It'll be a good match...

729
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:45,440
with your voice.

730
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:50,948
I want to do a solo...

731
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,980
at the graduation.

732
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,049
Will you be my accompanist?

733
00:49:58,089 --> 00:49:59,690
I never thought about it.

734
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,659
Please do it for me.

735
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,170
You will, right?

736
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:16,469
I'll think about it.

737
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,250
(Cheong A Arts High School)

738
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,270
So this is where you were.

739
00:50:53,139 --> 00:50:56,580
I still can't believe
that Ro Na's dead.

740
00:50:57,549 --> 00:51:00,719
I know who killed Ro Na.

741
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,759
Ha Eun Byeol. It's her.

742
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:11,029
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

743
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,670
You must've been very sick
if you had to miss school.

744
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,199
Yes. I was in the hospital.

745
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,900
Where were you...

746
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,238
when the festival ended?

747
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,239
That night?

748
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,350
They say I took too many sedatives,
so I had fainted in the school.

749
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:31,949
Mr. Do must have found me
and carried me home.

750
00:51:32,449 --> 00:51:34,420
I don't remember anything else.

751
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,889
You were carried out?

752
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:43,790
Yes.

753
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,659
You didn't see Ro Na before
the grand prize announcement?

754
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,900
I didn't see her.

755
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,239
At least,
I don't remember seeing her.

756
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,139
You must be devastated
by Ro Na's death.

757
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,278
It's true that I hated her,

758
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:07,020
but I don't want to be jealous
of a dead girl.

759
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:09,420
So grieve as much as you want.

760
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:20,460
Seok Hoon.

761
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:22,670
What's wrong?

762
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:47,489
Eun Byeol.

763
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:50,029
Will you go out with me?

764
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:52,330
What?

765
00:52:53,259 --> 00:52:55,029
Go out with me.

766
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,770
I think I really like you now.

767
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,980
Are you serious? Do you mean it?

768
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:22,690
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

769
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:26,199
Nothing beats drinking
during the day, right, Chairman Joo?

770
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,099
You seem to be slacking off
more and more blatantly.

771
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,229
Why did you insist on meeting
during your office hours?

772
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,999
I have three appointments tonight.

773
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,408
I have to eat three dinners.
Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.

774
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:38,639
Gosh, I'm way too popular.

775
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,209
Why are there so many weddings
and funerals in this country?

776
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,930
It takes so much time
to attend all of them.

777
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,718
It's so nice to see you two.

778
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:48,618
We haven't done this in a while.

779
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:52,060
Then again, so much has happened
at Hera Palace lately.

780
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:55,229
Why don't we start a separate group?

781
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,059
The other families
can't keep up with us.

782
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,759
The four of us are perfect,
don't you think?

783
00:54:01,299 --> 00:54:03,928
Ms. Cheon, is something wrong?

784
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:06,670
You haven't even touched any caviar.

785
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,068
Nothing's wrong.

786
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:14,009
Then I suggest that
we take a picture together.

787
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,350
I just started
a social media account.

788
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:21,178
More people will follow me...

789
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:23,350
if they see that
I'm friends with you.

790
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:26,088
- Smile, Ms. Cheon.
- Look at the camera.

791
00:54:26,089 --> 00:54:27,759
Make a V.

792
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,158
That looks great.

793
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:32,428
Does it look good?

794
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:35,069
I'll post it right away.

795
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,500
Let me see.

796
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,539
Seo Jin, you sure are a celebrity.

797
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,179
I'm already getting
a ton of comments.

798
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:47,810
What is this?

799
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,019
Chairman Joo,
is Ms. Cheon in trouble?

800
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,719

What is it? What happened?

803
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,369
What are they saying?

804
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:13,298
"Fake soprano Cheon Seo Jin".

805
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:15,210
"Liar Cheon Seo Jin".

806
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:17,069
A "shocking lie"?

807
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,940
What are these comments?

808
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,289
The nation's most renowned
prima donna, Cheon Seo Jin,

809
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,289
allegedly used a ghost singer...

810
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,528
at her 20th-anniversary concert,

811
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:37,888
leaving the whole country in shock.

812
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:40,059
The news couldn't be
farther from the truth.

813
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,169
An official statement
will be announced soon.

814
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,229
- Are you saying...
- Do you have anything more...

815
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,068
Evidence shows that Cheon Seo Jin
paid a large amount of money...

816
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:49,109
to an unknown amateur singer.

817
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,678
Cheon Seo Jin's agency has not made
any official statement yet.

818
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:55,149
The public is criticizing
the celebrated prima donna...

819
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,709
for hiding and
not taking responsibility.

820
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,420
That's all for today.
"Reporter Kim's Eye" seeks truth.

821

A police investigation?

822
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,959
The press is keeping a close eye.
She can't hide forever.

823
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,689
Many Cheong A Group stockholders
have called as well,

824
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,059
demanding that she step down.

825
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,059
That's not important right now!

826
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,659
Find a way to delay
the police investigation.

827
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,030
And tell Lawyer Park
to come up with a plan immediately.

828
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,440
- You two may leave now.
- Yes, sir.

829
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,850
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

830
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:34,350
I think you should spend some time
away from the company.

831

We need to calm down
the stockholders first.

832

Why didn't you discuss it
with me earlier?

833
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,968
You didn't have to keep it
to yourself.

834
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:51,529
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

835
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:55,000
- What?
- The ghost singer was...

836
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,380
Oh Yoon Hee.

837
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,250
Was it really Oh Yoon Hee?

838

so I can help you.

- I'll take it.
- It's okay.

842
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:29,139
We should meet, shouldn't we?

843
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,639
We have a lot to talk about.

844
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:10,509
Why was it such a big deal...

845
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:12,980
to stand on this stage?

846
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,920
To you, me,

847
00:58:16,219 --> 00:58:17,850
and our kids.

848
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,159
It was to be on this stage
that Ro Na went against me...

849
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:27,130
and came back.

850
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,969
To win the Cheong A Art Festival
grand prize.

851
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,540
For me.

852
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:37,639
Why are you telling me this?

853
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:41,110
Are you trying to blame me
for Ro Na's death?

854
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:45,080
Ro Na died
because of your stupid greed.

855
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,250
You're right.
It angers me even more...

856
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,258
that my girl died...

857
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:56,060
because of her foolish mom.

858
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,690
So...

859
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,029
I'm seeing red right now.

860
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,099
Don't even try to cover up
the ghost singer deal.

861
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:07,969
It'll only provoke me even more.

862
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,170
Why now, of all times?

863
00:59:10,869 --> 00:59:13,440
Eun Byeol isn't well.

864
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,449
Because...

865
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,080
my daughter died.

866
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:24,750
She kept taking things away from me.

867
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:28,319
She kept getting in my way
and badmouthed you.

868
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:32,199
That you slit her mom's throat.

869
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,529
That you lost to her mom.

870
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:41,139
What is it you want?

871
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,909
I'll do anything.

872
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:50,210
Just don't reveal that
you were my ghost singer.

873
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,979
If you do, you'll be punished too.

874
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,319
Keep your mouth shut
for your own good.

875
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,319
You want to keep your pride
even in this situation?

876
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,789
Why?

877
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:06,130
Are you afraid that people will
find out that you're below me?

878
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,158
That your daughter will?

879
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,270
Yes! I hate it!

880
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:13,040
I'd risk anything...

881
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:17,008
to hide the fact that
I borrowed your voice.

882
01:00:17,009 --> 01:00:18,369
So...

883
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,679
please...

884
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,850
I beg you.

885
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:42,369
Then get on your knees.

886
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:44,369
What?

887
01:00:44,569 --> 01:00:46,969
Get on your knees and apologize...

888
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,068
for slashing my throat. Beg and beg.

889
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:52,879
Admit that you lost to me
already 25 years ago.

890
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,179
Get on your knees!

891
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:25,739
I'm sorry.

892
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:28,339
I lost to you.

893
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,449
I stole your grand prize.

894
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:40,290
I apologize.

I'm here...

(Cheon Seo Jin)

900
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,100
to apologize to my fans...

901
01:02:58,429 --> 01:02:59,900
who supported me...

902
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,040
and to the public.

(Soprano Cheon Seo Jin

904
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,679
As of this day forth,

905
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,480
there is no Soprano Cheon Seo Jin.

906
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:18,290
I will never take the stage...

907
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:23,330
or sing ever again.

908
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,659
The name Cheon So Jin...

909
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:30,969
became Korea's representative
soprano...

910
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:33,739
- thanks to the support of my fans.
- It can't be.

911
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,169
- Thank you for your love and trust.
- It can't be.

912
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,770
That's what made it possible.

913
01:03:38,139 --> 01:03:39,509
I believed...

914
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:42,650
- I owed it to you to give you...
- Eun Byeol.

915
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,580
A good performance.

916
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,290
This is truly shocking.

917
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:52,219
How could she think of
scamming the entire nation?

918
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,190
You didn't know
she was like that, did you?

919
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,330
I'm worried they'll lump us together
and humiliate us too.

920
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,729
Don't worry about it.

921
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,569
Just focus on
your college applications.

922
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,639
Will you really marry her?

923
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,508
We're engaged already.

924
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:10,968
Am I supposed to break it off...

925
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:12,508
just because she can't sing?

926
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:13,979
This isn't a big deal.

927
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,809
I know I can't undo it.

928
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,049
You'll regret it.

929
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:22,650
What?

930
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,330
Because I will destroy her.

931
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,730
Joo Seok Hoon.

932
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,130
Joo Seok Hoon!

933
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:39,440
That little...

934
01:04:42,409 --> 01:04:44,739
Are you officially
announcing your retirement?

935
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:46,279
Yes, I am.

936
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,549
Will you step down as director
of Cheong A Foundation as well?

937
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:52,250
As an educator,
I will hold myself accountable...

938
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,520
and follow the decision
of the foundation's board.

939
01:04:56,350 --> 01:05:00,088
Moreover, I will do my best
to reimburse and compensate...

940
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:02,190
the attendants of the concert.

941
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:06,359
The people want to know who it was
that showcased the best voice ever.

942
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,900
Can you tell us who sang for you?

943
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,469
I'll take full responsibility.

944
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:18,170
I hope no one will be harmed
because of me.

945
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,650
I will cooperate with the police
and submit to an investigation.

947

Who was your ghost singer?

948
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:58,380
Don't tell me it was Ro Na's mom.

949
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,980
No.

950
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:03,219
It was.

951
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:04,819
What a disgrace.

952
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:06,819
What?

953
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,359
It's a disgrace that you're my mom.

954
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,028
Don't you have self-respect?

955
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:13,460
How could you make Ro Na's mom
your ghost singer?

956
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,369
You lost in high school too,
didn't you?

957
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:18,230
That's why you slit her throat.

958
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:19,940
Eun Byeol!

959
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:23,540
So how dare you hound me
to beat Ro Na?

960
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,339
Why were you acting out
your inferiority complex on me?

961

Don't order me around anymore.

962
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:31,710
Don't try to teach me.
Don't act like you're all that.

963
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,179
You disgust me.

964

Cheon Seo Jin! You fake!
You imposter!

965
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,479
You stole someone else's voice?

966
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,949
You're the absolute worst!

967
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,349
You were so arrogant.

968
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,179
You thug! You loser!

969
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:19,230
Maybe Eun Byeol is a fake too.

970
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,129
I thought it was strange...

971
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:23,869
that she got into
Cheong A with no skills.

972
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:26,469
Like mother like daughter.

973
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,238
You should leave the school
for the school's sake.

974
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:34,540
Our kids' image can't be tainted
because of one piece of garbage.

975
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,400
That's enough.

976
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,639
I'm fine.

979
01:08:09,779 --> 01:08:11,080
I can just ignore it.

980
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,779
As long as Eun Byeol
goes unscathed.

981
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,989
I can do anything...

982
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,290
for her.

983
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,259
Because I'm a mother.

984
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,230
It's okay.

985
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,460
I'm really okay.

986
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,900
I'm terrified.

987
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:35,370
Can I live...

988
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,870
without singing
for the rest of my life?

989
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:42,749
Can I live like that?

990
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:45,009

I don't think I can ever
go back to you.

993
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,536
Cheong A Foundation is preventing
the articles from publishing,

994
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,200
but the public is very critical.

995
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,600
Pressure the media companies...

996
01:09:37,629 --> 01:09:39,299
to keep publishing the articles.

997
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,769
More powerful and more nasty ones.

998
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:45,940
So that every
person in Korea can see.

999
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,410
Seo Jin must be dying right now.

1000
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,388
Also. Did you find out
why Eun Byeol was hospitalized?

1001
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:58,349
She received
sleep brainwave therapy...

1002
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,230
which is highly confidential
even among doctors.

1003
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:03,490
Sleep brainwave...

1004
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:06,859
Are they trying to manipulate...

1005
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,100
her memory of killing a person?

1006
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:13,770
She must be losing her mind
trying to save her kid.

1007
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,209
Something is strange though.

1008
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:18,870
- What is it?
- I checked today,

1009
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,039
and the land in Joo Hye In's name
was transferred to someone else.

1010
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:25,810
Who? Was it that rat Logan Lee?

Oh Yoon Hee?

1013
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,719
That's absurd. How did she...

1014
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,160
Okay.

1015
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:44,669
I'll go see you tomorrow night,

1016
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:46,469
Chairman Joo.

1017
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:00,248
You're here early.

1018
01:11:00,249 --> 01:11:02,150
He said to come at 6 p.m.

1019
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,350
He told me it's 7 p.m.

1020
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,520
I must have misheard.

1021
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,229
Please wait here.

1022
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,660
He isn't home yet.

1023
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:15,159
He said to wait in his study.

1024
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,169
Pardon?

1025
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,999
Okay. It's that way.

1026
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:24,439
I'll have tea with Chairman Joo
when he comes home.

1027
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,440
Yes, ma'am.

1028
01:11:49,999 --> 01:11:51,200
Su Ryeon?

1029
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,110
Inside the study, you'll see
an odd-looking bookcase.

1030
01:12:06,049 --> 01:12:09,718
Open it, and there's a door
to this secret room.

1031
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,759
There, you need Joo Dan Tae's
fingerprint to get in.

1032
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,969
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1033
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,909
Bring Ms. Oh to the study.

1034
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,009
She's already waiting inside.

1035
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,879
What?

1036
01:12:38,549 --> 01:12:41,979
When you open the door,
you'll see a sculpture.

1037
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,520
Tilt its head and you'll see
a secret button.

1038
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,740
Looking over here

1039
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,480
And over there

1040
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,219
But I still can't see

1043
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,248
Whoever dares to betray me will die.

1044
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,119
We're over.

1045
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,189
Get out!

1046
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:04,758
I just realized that I'm catching
feelings for Seo Jin again.

1047
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:06,088
You're Su Ryeon!

1048
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,798
I'm sorry for being late.

1049
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:08,799
The day Ro Na died...

1050
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,269
Do you remember something?

1051
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:12,699
You killed Ms. Bae Ro Na
by the stairs that night, right?

1052
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,538
Isn't it cold?
I'll be back tomorrow.

1053
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:18,538
Once I open my mouth,
your name will be gone.

1054
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:19,638
This is insane!

1055
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:22,509
You really think you can do
anything I tell you?
