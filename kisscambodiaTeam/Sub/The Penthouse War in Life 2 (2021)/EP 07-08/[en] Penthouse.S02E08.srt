1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,669
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,609
Bring Ms. Oh to the study.

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,709
She's already waiting inside.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,579
What?

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,710
Looking over here

6
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,080
And over there

7
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,820
But I still can't see

8
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,389
Yoon Hee

9
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,620
She looks too much like Su Ryeon.

10
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,899
It's you?

11
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,700
Did you come for me?

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,600
Of course.

13
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,110
What a surprise.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,240
I missed you.

15
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,619
Father, may I come in?

16
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,530
What is it?

17
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,270
Ro Na's mom came by and left.

18
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,339
She had to go because she had
an urgent matter to take care of.

19
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:23,039
Ms. Ahn said that she didn't see her
walking out of the house.

20
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,940
Oh, I saw her.

21
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,979
She told me to tell you.

22
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,809
All right, then. Go and study.

23
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,459
- Ms. Oh, where are you?
- What?

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,199
My father is home. I told him
that you left. Just so you know.

25
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,799
Thank you, Seok Hoon.

26
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,979
I didn't expect you to just come
out of the blue like this.

27
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,850
Aren't you the one in a rush?

28
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,620
I'm here to give you the contract
for the Gangnam properties.

29
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,319
You know that...

30
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,690
I own half of
these properties, right?

31
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,960
We're going to half it precisely.

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,630
Don't you dare
play any tricks on me.

33
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,799
Once I open my mouth,

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,109
your name will be gone.

35
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,039
Don't you forget.

36
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,710
Na Ae Gyo, do you think
I won't know you well enough?

37
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,150
I've seen you since you were 10.

38
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,489
I don't trust anything...

39
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,690
except for the money in my hands.

40
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,690
Not even you,

41
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,859
or me.

42
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,199
Isn't life too lonely for you
if you don't even trust me?

43
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,169
I only have you.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,109
My lifelong dream is to live
a happy life with you...

45
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,009
in this penthouse forever.

46
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,180
We're almost there.

47
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,519
I guess I'm getting suspicious
for no reason again.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,220
I was crazy lonely
when I was in Thailand.

49
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,859
- Is that right?
- Yes.

50
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:24,889
Here.

51
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,329
Thank you.

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,569
Great.

53
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,769
I'm leaving.
My taxi is waiting for me.

54
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,880
No, take mine.

55
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,750
It's fine.

56
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,419
I'm going to disappear
so that nobody will know.

57
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,840
Na Ae Gyo?

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,749
Look for Na Ae Gyo.

59
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,379
She knows
all of Joo Dan Tae's secrets.

60
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,530
(Premium taxi)

61
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,289
Who are you?
And how dare you follow me?

62
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,059
Su Ryeon!

63
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,660
You were alive?

64
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,799
Su Ryeon.

65
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,600
It's me. Don't you recognize me?

66
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,539
How would I know you?

67
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,109
You're Su Ryeon.

68
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:51,970
Don't you remember me?

69
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,239
Why are you lying?

70
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,939
Are you dense?

71
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,309
I don't know you or anyone like you.

72
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,080
You freak.

73
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,320
Wait. Let's talk.

74
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,530
(Na Ae Gyo)

75
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,059
Satisfied?

76
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,499
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,640
You look so much
like someone I know.

78
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,109
Don't touch my things.

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,820
(Installed)

80
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,359
(Premium Taxi)

81
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:49,270
Wait a second.

82
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,770
Your phone.

83
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,039
You're so annoying.

84
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,439
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,479
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,789
Logan. I found Na Ae Gyo.

87
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,629
Where? I'll come right away.

88
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,460
I installed the tracking app,

89
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,629
so I'll contact you
once I confirm where she's staying.

90
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,499
Okay then. Call me.

91
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,869
I'll be waiting.

92
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,609
I'm sorry Su Ryeon...

93
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,879
for coming so late.

94
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,350
What are those bags?

95
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,649
Let's stop.

96
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,119
I left the divorce papers there.

97
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,790
(Petition for Uncontested Divorce)

98
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,259
(Ha Yoon Chul)

99
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,399
Why must we do that?

100
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,670
I've lost interest in the revenge.

101
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:38,940
Look at us.

102
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,340
You've lost Ro Na,

103
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,279
and I've only hurt Eun Byeol.

104
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,080
I can't do it anymore.

105
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,649
So...

106
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,220
Must you do this right now?

107
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,889
I buried Ro Na...

108
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,499
only four days ago.

109
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,139
It was a contract marriage anyway.

110
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,940
What do you expect
from someone like me?

111
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,170
It's all for show.

112
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,940
Did you want me to be
a real husband or something?

113
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:21,979
Go in. Yes!

114
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,389
Nice. How did you get that in?

115
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,090
Get it together.

116
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,759
You're only giving them
what they want.

117
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,899
Why are you back?

118
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,600
I said to stop coming.

119
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,550
Look.

120
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
See that?

121
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,420
Thanks to that scumbag Joo Dan Tae,

122
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,790
I can't even be a doctor anymore.

123
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,019
So what can I do?

124
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,519
My life is a mess already.

125
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,790
I should be a mess to match.

126
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,100
Yoon Chul.

127
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,999
Let's go back to Korea.

128
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,999
Let's go and get revenge...

129
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,739
on Joo Dan Tae and Seo Jin.

130
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,670
Together.

131
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,310
Yoon Hee.

132
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,509
You and I've lost.

133
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,850
We were shut out.

134
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,080
What can we do?

135
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,220
No hospital...

136
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,560
will take me
even if I do go back to Korea.

137
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,259
No one will welcome you either.

138
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,830
Why can't you start over?

139
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,899
Start a business, get a job...

140
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,499
Do something. I'll help you.

141
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,369
We've been to
the world of torment and back.

142
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,909
We have nothing to fear.

143
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,810
Joo Dan Tae and Seo Jin...

144
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,810
are getting engaged soon.

145
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,499
I wanted revenge...

146
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,970
because I still loved Seo Jin.

147
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,529
Because I couldn't let go.

148
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,399
I just realized...

149
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,109
that I'm catching
feelings for Seo Jin again.

150
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:25,769
Do you feel better...

151
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,379
if you say that?

152
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,119
Are you stupid?

153
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,590
Are you dense or playing stupid?

154
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:39,759
I wanted to use you...

155
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,320
to build a successful business
and show off to Seo Jin.

156
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,590
I used you.

157
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,560
I can never let her go.

158
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,800
That's the piece of trash that I am!

159
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,840
You jerk.

160
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,279
I'll move out...

161
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:10,249
until the divorce is finalized.

162
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,999
Ro Na...

163
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:25,499
liked you so much.

164
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,970
1, 2...

165
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,369
You should get in too.

166
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,509
- What?
- Get in the picture with us.

167
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,180
But... Shall I?

168
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:39,720
Excuse me.
Would you take our picture for us?

169
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,019
Sure.

170
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,190
Here we go.

171
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,619
1, 2...

172
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,149
What's with the bag?

173
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,909
Are you going somewhere this late?

174
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,149
You're not... No, right?

175
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,220
You didn't fight in the midst of
all this, did you?

176
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,889
Even still, how could a man
pack his things and leave home?

177
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,330
Is that it?

178
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,659
Let go. Stay out of
other people's affairs.

179
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,029
"Other people"?

180
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,369
Yoon Hee is like a sister to me.

181
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,170
You're running away
because of your guilty conscience.

182
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,940
I said to stay out of it!

183
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,170
Oh my gosh.

184
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:15,080
You... You'd better not be
getting any ideas.

185
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,850
I'll kill you myself.

186
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,680
I keep hearing a strange melody.

187
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:27,920
Mi fa sol fa mi mi mi re ti re mi

188
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,930
Everything is a mess.

189
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,659
With Ro Na's death...

190
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,330
Mom retiring...

191
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,930
Everything in my head is jumbled.
It's driving me crazy.

192
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,899
You still can't remember
anything from that day?

193
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,070
I can't remember anything...

194
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,909
other than what Mom told me.

195
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,540
It'll come back to you slowly.

196
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,909
Don't be anxious.

197
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,950
Ro Na died...

198
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,749
without even knowing
that she won the grand prize.

199
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,850
She was punished for coveting
something that wasn't hers.

200
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,290
I'll sleep with you
until you fall asleep.

201
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,930
She's coming.

202
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,470
Cheon Seo Jin.

203
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,830
How do you feel about being expelled
permanently from the Vocal Society?

204
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,739
There's a rumor
that your ghost singer...

205
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,540
was your high school classmate.
Is that true?

206
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,869
Did you know that Cheong A scheduled
an emergency board meeting...

207
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,279
to discuss your removal?

208
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,310
Please say a few words.

209
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,909
Please get in.

210
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,609
Please save a few words
before you get in.

211
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,320
- Cheon Seo Jin.
- Cheon Seo Jin.

212
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Is it true?

213
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,850
- Please say something!
- Please say a few words.

214
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,220
- Is it true?
- How do you feel?

215
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,420
Cheon Seo Jin.

216
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,830
You're holding an emergency
board meeting without telling me?

217
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,399
You disgraced the family.

218
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,830
How dare you raise your voice?

219
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,840
You don't deserve
Cheong A Foundation.

220
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,940
You damaged
your father's reputation.

221
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,239
Hand over
Cheong A Foundation to me now.

222
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:55,379
I'll take good care of Cheong A
Art Center too, so don't worry.

223
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,279
My in-laws can pull some strings
so you can avoid being arrested.

224
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,389
Don't be absurd.
I don't need your help.

225
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,220
Also, forget about
Cheong A Art Center.

226
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,460
Not a single brick or stair was
laid without my supervision.

227
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,359
Stop being greedy.

228
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,029
This is the last time
you'll see me as your mom.

229
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:19,269
If you don't stop,
we'll have to meet in court.

230
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,739
Go as far as you want.

231
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,739
This is the last time
I'll treat you as my mother.

232
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,249
Unless Father comes back alive
and takes my place,

233
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,779
I won't step down.

234
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,619
Cheong A Foundation is...

235
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,090
the last present
that Father left me.

236
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,649
You're not allowed
to be in a crowded place.

237
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,959
So? Am I supposed to be stuck
in the woods all day?

238
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,929
I'll drive you
to your accommodation.

239
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,830
It's Chairman Joo's order.

240
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:33,480
Get lost.

241
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,280
Anyone who is stupid enough
to lay a finger on me...

242
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,949
should be prepared
to become crippled.

243
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,800
Eun Byeol.

244
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,570
Do you want breakfast?

245
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,109
Should I make you a sandwich?

246
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:09,439
Ms. Jin, could you make
some juice for me?

247
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,209
I'll do it.

248
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,649
How do I make it?

249
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,949
Did I ask you to act like a mom?

250
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,649
You're annoying.

251
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,459
Eun Byeol!

252
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,159
She's a bit on edge.

253
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,530
I'll pack some snacks for her,
so don't worry.

254
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,439
What do you mean?

255
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,340
Things don't seem right
at Cheong A Group?

256
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:14,879
Even the stockholders on your side
seem to have turned their backs.

257
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,409
The recent event must have
damaged their trust in me.

258
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,780
It'll take a while to recover.

259
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
You shouldn't sit back and watch.

260
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:25,219
A few days ago,
Chairman Joo met with...

261
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,189
Cheong A's
major stockholders alone.

262
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,189
What are you talking about?

263
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,060
You shouldn't trust him too much.

264
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,530
He was aware
of your ghost singer deal.

265
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,270
Even the fact that
the singer was Ms. Oh.

266
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,169
What did you say?

267
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,669
How could he possibly know that?

268
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,939
It's all my fault.

269
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,980
I fell into his trap.

270
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,219
Punish me.

271
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,219
I'll accept
whatever decision you make.

272
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,760
Joo Dan Tae knew?

273
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,590
(Noise control)

274
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,300
Sit down, everyone.

275
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:55,780
Let me announce a decision that was
made at today's teachers' meeting.

276
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,679
As Bae Ro Na, who won
the grand prize...

277
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,820
at Cheong A Art Festival,
is deceased,

278
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,350
the principal will recommend
the second prize winner,

279
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:07,189
Joo Seok Kyung, to Seoul
National University instead.

280
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:11,760
Seok Kyung will be recommended
to Seoul National University?

281
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,230
That's unbelievable.

282
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,899
(187 days to performance test,
221 days to CSAT)

283
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
The midterms have started.

284
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,139
Your grades in your senior year
are extremely important.

285
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,969
Leave all the
distracting events behind...

286
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:25,639
and focus on your studies, okay?

287
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,139
- Okay.
- Okay.

288
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:31,679
On that note, why don't we
put those flowers away already?

289
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,780
I think we've mourned enough.

290
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,750
Okay. I'll put them away.

291
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,790
Get your hands off.

292
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,060
Whoever even touches the flowers...

293
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,500
is dead meat.

294
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,570
Eun Woo, have you lost your mind?

295
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,439
I completely agree with Seok Hoon.

296
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,570
Guys, how can you be so cold?

297
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,340
Your classmate is dead. How come
no one seems to genuinely grieve?

298
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,510
Seok Hoon, where are you going?

299
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,320
Oh, you're leaving early today?

300
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,980
Be careful on your way. "I will."

301
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,149
That's my boy.

302
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:14,020
What are you guys looking at?
Open your books.

303
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,060
(Bae Ro Na)

304
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,830
(Chocolate Milk)

305
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,740
(Chocolate Milk)

306
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,240
Thanks for the milk, Ro Na.
I appreciate it.

307
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,780
Sure.

308
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,909
Why are you keeping this?

309
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,600
It's good.

310
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,310
Isn't it cold?

311
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,540
I'll be back tomorrow.

312
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,179
- I'm not...
- You'll change your mind.

313
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,889
What are you doing outside my door?

314
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,149
Oh, there you are.

315
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:24,560
I was so disappointed,
thinking you were away.

316
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,030
You know what a great cook
Ms. Wang is, right?

317
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,030
I asked her to make
your favorite dishes.

318
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,469
Do you want to try?

319
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,669
- I'm busy.
- With what?

320
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:35,369
It's none of your business.

321
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:38,369
Can I tag along?

322
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,980
Are you on your way to meet
the Three Queens?

323
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,080
Forget it.
I can see right through you.

324
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,649
It really takes
all my appetite away.

325
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:50,320
You're making my place
smell like food.

326
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,189
Take it and leave.

327
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:59,090
That vulgar woman.
How dare she talk to me that way?

328
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,330
I should be patient.

329
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,830
I should put up with this
for Kyu Jin's sake.

330
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:10,340
Okay. Watch and learn.

331
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,010
First, hold the brush firmly.

332
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,240
And brush thoroughly.

333
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,850
- Ms. Kang.
- To remove water stains,

334
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,080
use quick, short movements.

335
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,980
Otherwise, you'll sprain your wrist.

336
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,419
Why are you just standing there?

337
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,189
The cold bath is yours.

338
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,159
If you don't do a proper job,
you won't get paid.

339
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,859
Hurry up!

340
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,510
Don't forget the corners.
Brush thoroughly.

341
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:48,580
- Okay.
- Good.

342
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,649
Hold the brush firmly
using your wrist and arm.

343
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:52,780
Okay.

344
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:54,649
There you go. You can do this.

345
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,619
Let's do this. We can do this.

346
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,290
When things get tough,
look up at the sky

347
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:06,260
You're never alone

348
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,429
After heavy rain and strong winds

349
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,399
- The sun will shine again
- The sun will shine again

350
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,810
- Good!
- When it hurts too much

351
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:24,280
Give a loud shout

352
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,719
Make the weak sadness

353
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:32,649
Run away from you

354
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,159
Here. Dig in.

355
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:42,659
Jajangmyeon tastes best
at a bathhouse.

356
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,770
I'm...

357
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,070
hungry.

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,540
How dare I, right?

359
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:53,209
Whether you lost
your husband or your child,

360
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,780
it's not a sin to feed yourself.

361
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,879
Eat up.

362
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,909
You must feel shattered inside.

363
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:03,520
I saw Mr. Ha, no,

364
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:07,189
that punk, pack his things
and leave.

365
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,159
It doesn't just look
like it was a small argument.

366
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,959
Does he want to get a divorce?

367
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,030
Are you serious?

368
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,600
That despicable jerk!

369
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,010
Humans show their true selves
when they're at their worst.

370
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,179
How can he turn his back on you...

371
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,409
after seeing you faint?

372
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:34,250
The jjajangmyeon is getting cold.
Eat up.

373
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,250
I can't possibly say anything
to comfort...

374
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,290
a woman who's lost her child.

375
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,330
You have to stay strong.

376
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:50,030
You have to stand your ground.

377
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,230
That's what Ro Na wants.

378
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,669
You know what I mean, right?

379
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,649
I'm going to survive somehow.

380
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:10,520
I'll get through this somehow.

381
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,199
Yes.

382
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:31,709
Aren't these noodles amazing?

383
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,350
Look at her.

384
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,119
What?

385
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:49,619
That's hilarious.

386
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:54,859
(A fake junior soprano,
Ha Eun Byeol)

387
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,129
Who is it?

388
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,240
How dare you all act like kids?

389
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,709
I heard that Ms. Cheon is getting
fired from her Director position.

390
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,679
What a strong girl you are.

391
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:10,649
Your mom is about to go to jail,

392
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:11,909
but you're here to memorize
some English vocabulary?

393
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:14,919
Shouldn't you apologize to us
on behalf of your mom?

394
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,389
You're fake too.

395
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,760
It was always so annoying
to see you be a brat...

396
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,859
when you're not even talented.

397
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,389
To be honest, Bae Ro Na was
so much better than you.

398
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
You know that, right?

399
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,530
Go away. Get out of my way!

400
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,439
- What are you doing?
- Go away!

401
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:44,949
Why did you guys keep
a dead girl's desk? That's bad luck!

402
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,879
Watch what you say. Bad luck?

403
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Why?

404
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,790
Don't you dare talk like that
when she had such a sad death!

405
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,619
Did you just slap me?

406
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:55,859
How dare you?

407
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,929
Jenny is right.

408
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,129
I feel bad for Ro Na.

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,129
Joo Seok Kyung, you think you have
a right to say that?

410
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,030
Why not?

411
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,540
Was I the one who killed her?

412
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,439
I've been meaning to ask you.

413
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:16,179
You were with Ro Na
during the awards announcement...

414
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,879
at Cheong A Arts Festival,
weren't you?

415
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,419
No. I didn't see her.

416
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,520
You and Ro Na were the only two
who were missing.

417
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,419
Tell me. What were you doing
and where were you?

418
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,129
I was...

419
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,760
You overdosed on medicine,

420
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,030
so you were lying down
at the infirmary.

421
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:42,669
Then, you passed out
right before the announcement,

422
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:44,709
so Secretary Do took you home.

423
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:47,379
I was at the infirmary...

424
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,909
because all the pills I took
that day made me dizzy.

425
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,080
Are you sure? Really?

426
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:54,550
Any witnesses?

427
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:38,459
Are you okay?

428
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,929
Seok Hoon!

429
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:47,669
What happened?

430
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:50,070
You suddenly passed out in class.

431
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:56,010
My head feels like
it's going to burst.

432
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,490
I don't think you're feeling well.

433
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,959
I heard that you passed out
during Cheong A Arts Festival too.

434
00:32:11,689 --> 00:32:14,359
Yes, I did.

435
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,129
I'm a little disappointed...

436
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,139
that you don't seem to remember
what happened on that day.

437
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,649
Don't you remember what you told me
by the stairs?

438
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
What did I say to you?

439
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,449
You really don't remember?

440
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,189
Hearing you say that was
what made me ask you out.

441
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,290
Because I liked what you said.

442
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,230
I'll get going.

443
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,699
Seok Hoon!

444
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,820
What did I tell him here?

445
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,119
I can't remember anything!

446
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:20,060
Get your memories back,
Ha Eun Byeol.

447
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,859
Recall what you've done.

448
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,550
What a pleasant surprise, Ms. Oh.

449
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,580
I didn't expect you to come
and see me.

450
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,389
As you know,

451
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,189
there's nobody I can rely on.

452
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,790
I was thinking,

453
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,830
and I thought of you, who treated
me like your younger sibling.

454
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,260
I'm known to be the assemblyman
who listens to his people.

455
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,800
Not only that, we're like siblings.

456
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm even more all ears for you.

457
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:03,899
Look at me.

458
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,709
You trust me, right?

459
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:07,780
Tell me everything.

460
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,149
What do I do now?

461
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,719
Hey!

462
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,629
No!

463
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,429
Hey.

464
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,379
I totally saw that coming.

465
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,179
I just had a feeling.

466
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,810
Recently, I ran into
Ha Yoon Chul late at night.

467
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,419
I talked slightly bad
about Seo Jin,

468
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:50,889
then, he said,

469
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,389
"If you're drunk, shut up
and go to sleep."

470
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,259
"Don't blabber nonsense."

471
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,489
That's what he said.

472
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,589
They were already divorced,

473
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,630
so I couldn't understand why
he was being so defensive.

474
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,799
Everything makes sense now.

475
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,869
What a trashy man he is!

476
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,299
You know, even cheaters have rules.

477
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:09,270
If anyone's going to cheat, they
must cheat with a stranger.

478
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,339
If they don't know a stranger,
I can introduce one to them.

479
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,239
You know, something like a pen pal.

480
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,980
But he cheated on you
with his ex-wife?

481
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,610
He's insane!

482
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,679
I don't even know what to think.

483
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,980
This divorce came so suddenly.

484
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,060
It's me.

485
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,719
Don't worry.

486
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:33,560
I was so well-off
as a divorce lawyer.

487
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,060
All you need to do is
to do what I tell you.

488
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,440
What am I supposed to do?

489
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:47,009
The key to a divorce is...

490
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,839
the reason for divorce.

491
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,739
First, you need to start
by gathering proof...

492
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,610
that he's cheating on you
with Seo Jin.

493
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,549
I'll introduce you...

494
00:35:55,549 --> 00:35:57,480
to a very good ex-colleague
who's a divorce lawyer.

495
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,389
You've lost so much weight!

496
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,830
Does Joo Dan Tae know
this important news or what?

497
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,569
Don't stop yourself. Go, run.

498
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:14,969
I only want one thing from you.

499
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,339
You ladies are paying
for my paycheck.

500
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:20,940
You pay taxes, right?

501
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,279
Thank you all.

502
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,850
I don't have anything to give
but this. Here you go.

503
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,089
Assemblyman Lee, why are we
meeting up at a place like this?

504
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,690
Looks like you got yourself
some bonus.

505
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,299
I'm going to enjoy the night
since you're paying.

506
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,900
Don't stop me. Okay?

507
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,330
Order us something
expensive and amazing.

508
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't owe you anything, though.

509
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,699
You will soon enough.

510
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:51,009
Have a glass.

511
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,409
What is it that you're
stalling so much?

512
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:58,150
My mom told me that patience is
the key to making good rice.

513
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,710
Just wait.

514
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:03,150
I have a special relationship
with Seo Jin, as you know.

515
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,089
We attended the private
English kindergarten together,

516
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:09,520
and were neighbors
when we first moved...

517
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,690
into Simoon Mansion.

518
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,130
Stop playing around
and just tell me.

519
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:18,600
Ha Yoon Chul and Oh Yoon Hee
are getting a divorce.

520
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,839
- Why?
- Why would they?

521
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:24,339
Isn't this man so thick-headed?

522
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,810
Because of Seo Jin, of course.

523
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,650
Ha Yoon Chul and Seo Jin...

524
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,119
are back together.

525
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,060
Why don't you tell me more,
since you're not thick-headed?

526
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,449
I think you should spend some time
away from the company.

527
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,179
We need to calm down
the stockholders first.

528
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:17,319
Why didn't you discuss it
with me earlier?

529
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:20,020
You didn't have to keep it
to yourself.

530
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,690
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

531
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:26,000
- What?
- The ghost singer was...

532
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,330
Oh Yoon Hee.

533
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:31,940
Was it really Oh Yoon Hee?

534
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,710
What happened between you two?

535
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,310
Joo Dan Tae.

536
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:46,049
He did all of this to get
Cheong A Group in his hands?

537
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:50,489
You're right.

538
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:54,159
That's the kind of a man you were.

539
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,270
Is everything you told me
about the night Ro Na died true?

540
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,469
What do you mean?

541
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:10,509
Is it true that I passed out
and was brought home?

542
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,710
Of course. I have no reason
to lie to you.

543
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,920
Why do you ask?

544
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,190
Do you remember anything?

545
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:30,029
Why? Is there something
that I shouldn't remember?

546
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,909
It's me. Where are you right now?

547
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,100
What? Did you sleep here?

548
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:12,199
What's with the luggage?

549
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,170
I left my home.

550
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,040
And you're staying here?

551
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,009
I'm busy with work anyway,
so it's better here.

552
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:19,980
Booking a hotel is too much work.

553
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,279
What happened with Oh Yoon Hee?

554
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:25,119
I told her that I'd like a divorce.

555
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,489
That doesn't mean that
I'll get back together with you.

556
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,920
I just feel too ashamed
to be with Yoon Hee.

557
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,259
That's why I left her.

558
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,889
Good job.

559
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,159
You should start looking
for a place to stay first.

560
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,060
You can't stay here forever.

561
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:43,270
I'll take care of it.

562
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:46,040
How's Eun Byeol?

563
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,170
Are you sure her memory is gone?

564
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,980
I'm making sure she takes
her pills, but I'm so anxious.

565
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,580
She looks like she's starting
to remember something,

566
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,449
and she won't talk to me.

567
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:03,819
Are you eating well?

568
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,799
You have to get through this
for Eun Byeol.

569
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,670
If you get shaken,
it's the end for Eun Byeol.

570
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,679
What's with your hand?

571
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,449
I think it's cramping.

572
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,779
Did you...

573
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:36,850
hurt your hand?
Is that what happened?

574
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,860
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

575
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,699
It looks like you put your hands
on the wrong woman.

576
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:49,199
Who sent you?
Was it Joo Dan Tae? Jerk!

577
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,799
Break his hands.

578
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:01,750
Why are you telling me this now?

579
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,480
This all happened because of me!

580
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,420
It's not because of you.
No need to care. It's my business.

581
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,150
It's mine too!

582
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,159
I know what it took for you
to become a doctor...

583
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,060
and how much you loved your job.

584
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,060
It's all because of Joo Dan Tae.

585
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:23,170
I can't stand this anymore.
That jerk!

586
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,299
What are you going to do?

587
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,110
I'm going to call
the wedding off right now.

588
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,170
I never loved that man.

589
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:35,210
I hated that you were always
longing for Yoon Hee,

590
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:38,049
and I needed someone who'll
treat me like a lady.

591
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,750
It's my fault for thinking
that it was love.

592
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,049
If I marry him,

593
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,719
Eun Byeol won't be happy either.

594
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,429
I'm sorry...

595
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,699
for giving you a hard time
because of a jerk like him.

596
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,069
And I broke us.

597
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,839
It's all in the past.
We can't turn anything back now.

598
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,710
We can!

599
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:11,380
I'm letting go of my ego
and asking you to come back.

600
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:21,159
Please stay with me.

601
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,969
I told you to not do that!

602
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:56,360
You're late.

603
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,830
Where were you?

604
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,969
I almost fell asleep.

605
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:04,000
Like you care?

606
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,480
My fiancee couldn't be reached
late into the night.

607
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,480
Of course, I was worried.

608
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,219
What happened with
your dismissal matter?

609
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:21,690
Should I meet the board members
and talk to them?

610
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,389
What are you really after?

611
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,860
For me to leave Cheong A Group
completely to you...

612
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,460
and just be the high school director
until I grow old and die?

613
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,199
Why are you so angry?

614
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,369
I understand.

615
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:38,199
Things are tough, aren't they?

616
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,239
I heard you knew
Yoon Hee was my ghost singer.

617
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,540
You're the one who ratted me out
to the foundation, aren't you?

618
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:49,480
How dare you threaten my personal
assistant and do something so low?

619
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,650
Why? Were you anxious
to get the merger through?

620
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,989
You didn't want me,
you wanted Cheong A Group!

621
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:57,949
Deny it if you can!

622
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:01,460
Your family...

623
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:05,060
is equally as obsessed with money.

624
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:08,429
You scumbag.

625
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,670
Now that I know
what kind of a jerk you are,

626
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,739
I can't marry you.

627
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,610
We're over.

628
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,639
Get out!

629
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,929
Cheon Seo Jin.

630
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,900
You'll regret doing that.

631
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,480
Hello, Lawyer Park.

632
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,480
I want to break off our engagement
as soon as possible.

633
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:00,049
Please void the merger as well.

634
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,449
It says in the agreement...

635
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:05,290
that it will take effect
after the wedding.

636
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:09,659
Yes. Thank you.

637
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:12,330
You need to come out for a minute.

638
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,299
Detectives are here.

639
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,500
Detectives?

640
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,880
There are too many
eyes and ears in our home.

641
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,949
Let's speak comfortably here.

642
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,580
Why did you come...

643
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:37,389
to speak with Eun Byeol?

644
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,060
There are some things
we need to confirm with her...

645
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,989
regarding Bae Ro Na's death.

646
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:45,100
Isn't the case closed already?

647
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,659
It's a shame that Ro Na died,

648
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:51,170
but why must you speak
with Eun Byeol because of that?

649
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:55,040
Because Eun Byeol is
our prime suspect.

650
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,369
We've found solid evidence as well.

651
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,679
Evidence?

652
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,710
This necklace belongs
to your daughter, correct?

653
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,779
We found her DNA...

654
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:07,119
and the victim's blood on it.

655
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,360
We already got
the janitor's confession...

656
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,589
that he was paid
to give a false confession.

657
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,659
Ha Yoon Chul is at the station
being questioned as we speak.

658
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,630
Your daughter killed Bae Ro Na,
didn't she?

659
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,270
The person who struck the victim
on the head with the trophy...

660
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,600
was Ha Eun Byeol, wasn't it?

661
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,040
You and Ha Yoon Chul tried
to cover that up...

662
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,509
and send someone else
to take the fall!

663
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:41,380
Did you kill Bae Ro Na
in the hospital...

664
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,819
out of fear that the truth
would be revealed?

665
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:45,819
No.

666
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:47,989
No.

667
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:49,230
Arrest Ha Eun Byeol!

668
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,860
No! No.

669
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,429
Eun Byeol did nothing wrong.

670
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:55,830
I did it.

671
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,000
I bribed Mr. Park.

672
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,170
I killed Ro Na. I did it all.

673
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,670
My Eun Byeol knows nothing.

674
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,739
I'll kill you
if you touch my daughter!

675
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,110
What an amazing motherly love.

676
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,619
Your love for your daughter
and for your ex-husband.

677
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,520
I'm all choked up.

678
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,920
Dan Tae.

679
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,319
- Chairman Joo.
- Yes.

680
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,319
Take your men out for dinner.

681
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:22,330
Thank you.

682
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,299
Let's eat meat tonight.

683
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:27,299
Yes, sir.

684
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:30,630
- It was moving.
- Arrest Ha Eun Byeol!

685
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,000
No! No.

686
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,069
What a confession.

687
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:35,509
- Did you...
- Eun Byeol did nothing wrong.

688
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:38,139
- I did it.
- Plan this?

689
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,080
You want to break off
our engagement.

690
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Why?

691
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:43,880
To go back to Ha Yoon Chul?

692
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,219
How long has it been?

693
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:50,020
Ever since the jerk returned
to Hera Palace?

694
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:53,319
Or the night I shattered his hand?

695
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:54,889
You scumbag.

696
00:48:58,259 --> 00:48:59,460
"You scumbag"?

697
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,900
Did you think I wouldn't know...

698
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,239
that you and that jerk...

699
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:09,940
betrayed me in New York?

700
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,940
Get away.

701
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,339
Get away from me!

702
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:19,080
Should I take this evidence...

703
00:49:19,549 --> 00:49:21,219
to the police now?

704
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:23,489
No, no.

705
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,989
It would be much more fun
to send it to Oh Yoon Hee.

706
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,759
If I let the woman
who lost her only child know...

707
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,900
that her husband betrayed her
on top of that...

708
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,199
I wonder how she'll rip you
and Eun Byeol to shreds...

709
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:38,569
and kill you.

710
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,110
You've lost your mind.

711
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,480
It's the price for betraying me.

712
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,980
Did you not expect this much...

713
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,389
when you decided to call off
our wedding?

714
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:57,690
What should I do?

715
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:02,529
What must I do to break
Eun Byeol's heart excruciatingly?

716
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,230
You choose.

717
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:07,299
I think...

718
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,969
telling Oh Yoon Hee would be
the most fun.

719
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:11,969
No.

720
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,900
You can't do that! No.

721
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,009
No. You can't do that! No.

722
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,710
I'll do anything you say,

723
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,179
so don't do anything.

724
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,150
I'll do whatever you say,

725
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:24,449
So please leave Eun Byeol alone.

726
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,920
Please. I'm begging you. Please.

727
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:28,049
Please.

728
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,650
Can you...

729
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,119
really do everything I say?

730
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:06,619
What is this?

731
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,089
(Please join us
to celebrate our union.)

732
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,830
What...

733
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:26,409
What garbage...

734
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,480
The phone is turned off...

735
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:42,690
(Unit 8501, Paging)

736
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,929
Seo Jin, open up. We need to talk.

737
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:51,730
Seo Jin!

738
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,239
Open up! We need to talk!

739
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,239
Open up!

740
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:00,480
Open up!

741
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:04,679
We need to talk! We need to talk!

742
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,429
Seo Jin.

743
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:17,190
Seo Jin!

744
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,230
Did you get it?

745
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,670
The wedding invitation.

746
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,940
I did. It's in two weeks.

747
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,179
I didn't know
Chairman Joo would do this.

748
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,779
He's insisting on getting married...

749
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,779
after finding out
Seo Jin betrayed him.

750
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,949
Is that how much he loves her?

751
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,560
There must be an important reason...

752
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,319
why he can't dump her.

753
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,259
I have an appointment,
so I need to go.

754
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:53,199
What appointment?

755
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:54,929
You promised to tell me everything.

756
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:56,429
Hello?

757
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,299
- Hee? Hee.
- Hee?

758
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:04,469
What?

759
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,409
Hee?

760
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:08,239
Hee

761
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,980
Please look at me

762
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:21,319
You used to like me

763
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:24,029
Hee

764
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,860
I'm sorry
I couldn't keep our appointment.

765
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,000
But why did you want to meet...

766
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,699
I'm sure you know.

767
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,639
I want to know how you ended up
owning Hye In's land.

768
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:39,480
She's my daughter.

769
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:42,040
You mean, Su Ryeon's daughter.

770
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,449
I guess you didn't get the notice
because Su Ryeon...

771
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,719
gave the power of attorney
to someone else.

772
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:54,920
True. You were never qualified
to be her dad.

773
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,360
So it's only natural.

774
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,830
There are no plans to develop
Cheonsoo District.

775
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,230
Why did you want the land
in such a run-down area?

776
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,400
Aren't you the one
who built Cheong A Art Center...

777
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,900
in that district?

778
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,639
You're quite greedy for someone
who just lost her child.

779
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:17,949
Before, my biggest goal was
to raise my daughter well.

780
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:22,449
But now that she's gone,

781
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,449
my goal has changed.

782
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:30,529
I want to become extremely wealthy.

783
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,699
I'll do whatever it takes
to accumulate wealth...

784
00:54:35,699 --> 00:54:38,170
so that I can own this penthouse.

785
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,139
Ro Na always wanted to live here.

786
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:45,170
The penthouse?

787
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,380
Why don't we make a bet?

788
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,880
Who do you think
will be living here in a year?

789
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:57,819
Ms. Cheon is here.

790
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,529
Why are you so surprised?

791
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:11,170
I just stopped by to discuss
business. Don't get the wrong idea.

792
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,139
I didn't know you were having
a guest. I'll come back later.

793
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:18,810
You don't have to.
I was about to leave anyway.

794
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:22,139
Eun Byeol, it's been a while.

795
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,049
I heard that you were unwell.
Are you okay now?

796
00:55:25,049 --> 00:55:27,520
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

797
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:29,750
It's so nice to see you
healthy again.

798
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,389
Do you meet your dad often?

799
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:35,630
Why would you ask that?

800
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:38,190
It's just that I feel jealous.

801
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,100
Ro Na grew up without her dad.

802
00:55:42,569 --> 00:55:46,000
And she can't even see
her new dad anymore...

803
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,339
because she's dead.

804
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,610
By the way, congratulations
on your wedding.

805
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,049
Chairman Joo was kind enough...

806
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:02,420
to send me an invitation.

807
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,750
I'll see you at your wedding.

808
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:11,929
What? Aren't you two
high school friends?

809
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,139
We're having a wedding in two weeks.

810
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:22,739
We're becoming family for real.
I hope everyone gets along.

811
00:56:25,509 --> 00:56:28,940
Nonsense. That's a stupid idea.

812
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,819
I thought things were good again
between you and Dad.

813
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,190
How much are you
going to hurt me again?

814
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,889
At school, I have to put up
with kids pointing the finger at me.

815
00:56:39,889 --> 00:56:42,159
And now I have to put up with
you two getting married?

816
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,330
Tell him right now.
Tell him that you can't marry him!

817
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,759
This is...

818
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,500
my choice.

819
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,500
I guess you're not ready
to accept me as your dad yet.

820
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:58,170
It's okay. We can get used
to each other from now on.

821
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,810
I hate it.

822
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,679
I'll never accept this marriage.

823
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,520
I agree with Eun Byeol for once.

824
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:12,819
I'll never accept
this ridiculous marriage either.

825
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,489
Congratulations.
You two are perfect for each other.

826
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,040
- This is insane!
- Sit back down.

827
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,710
Please stop.

828
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,409
If you want money,

829
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:36,279
I'll compensate you as much
as you want, so please...

830
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:37,980
Cut it out!

831
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,119
In this game, you have no choice.

832
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,150
I get to decide whether
we get married or not.

833
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,589
All you have to do is
move into this penthouse...

834
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,389
as my wife on the day I choose.
Understood?

835
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,900
Ms. Ahn.

836
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,159
Yes, sir.

837
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:56,670
Call the dress shop
and tell them we're coming.

838
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:57,929
Sure, sir.

839
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,869
Try this on.
I think it'll look gorgeous on you.

(Cheong A Arts High School)

841
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:48,880
(The 28th Cheong A Art Festival)

842
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:51,850
What took you so long?

843
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,389
- Stop!
- Ro Na!

844
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:55,319
- Mom!
- Jenny!

845
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:56,460
(Fire alarm)

846
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,469
Fire!

847
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,569
Bae Ro Na.

848
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,339
Thanks to her,
things have become a lot simpler.

849
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:21,520
I would thank her,

850
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,819
but I can't.

851
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,489
It's me, Secretary Do.

852
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:31,089
Go to my place and get
me and Eun Byeol's passports.

853
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:33,799
And book us
the first flight tonight.

854
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:35,600
The destination doesn't matter.

855
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:40,400
(Passport)

856
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,670
Are you looking for these?

857
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,369
What? Are you disappointed?

858
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:48,509
Did you think
I wouldn't prepare this much?

859
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,020
Let's not waste each other's energy.

860
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,250
Wherever you go, I'll find you.

861
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:03,759
Are you okay?

862
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,710
No, not this.

863
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:27,549
I don't think it's for you.

864
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,949
This looks a bit funny too.

865
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,790
Why don't you just kill me now?

866
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,170
She must not be so happy
with the dresses.

867
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,569
She seems very upset.

868
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:52,369
She has pretty high standards.
Can you show her some other designs?

869
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:54,210
You're crazy.

870
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,850
You disgusting jerk.

871
01:01:11,259 --> 01:01:13,860
- What's this?
- A present.

872
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:23,469
This is totally my style.

873
01:01:24,339 --> 01:01:26,110
Did something good happen today?

874
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,380
The best thing that happened is
that you came back.

875
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,250
I missed you so much.

876
01:01:31,279 --> 01:01:34,219
You're being so sweet today.

877
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,920
- I'll go change.
- Okay.

878
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,600
I wonder how Joo Dan Tae
really feels.

879
01:01:46,759 --> 01:01:50,069
Is she special to him because
she gave birth to his children?

880
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:54,739
Even a monster like him
can love someone sincerely?

881
01:01:55,339 --> 01:01:56,869
It's hard to believe.

882
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,339
Something doesn't feel right.

883
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:01,440
Two years ago,
Na Ae Gyo was determined...

884
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:04,080
to escape from Joo Dan Tae.

885
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,119
They're completely on the same side.

886
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:11,190
I don't care.
We don't have much time.

887
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:13,589
I have to meet Ae Gyo and ask her...

888
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,989
what Joo Dan Tae did to Su Ryeon.

889
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:19,960
I won't make another mistake.

890
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:24,199
What was going on
between you and Su Ryeon?

891
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,239
Seol A's birth mother
and stepbrother.

892
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,610
Nothing more?

893
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:35,509
I wanted...

894
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,110
to make her happy.

895
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,020
I should have protected her
no matter what.

896
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:47,489
I was such a fool.

897
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:51,889
I can't forgive myself.

898
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:00,369
All my apartments sold out.

899
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,270
At the highest prices.

900
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,270
Is that why you look so happy?

901
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:08,009
It's a stellar location,
so it's no surprise.

902
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:11,179
The prices may go up even more.
Why did you sell them already?

903
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:14,049
The prices are at
their peak right now.

904
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:16,049
The district will be designated
as a speculative zone soon,

905
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:18,319
preventing people from taking loans.

906
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,589
How many people
do you think can pay...

907
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,860
tens of millions of dollars
without taking loans?

908
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:26,699
I guess Mr. Jung is still providing
you with useful information.

909
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:29,159
And I have you to thank for that.

910
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:32,369
You're the perfect partner for me.
You have been for the past 20 years.

911
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:34,139
You just now realized that?

912
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:40,980
Come to think of it,
I feel sorry for Su Ryeon.

913
01:03:42,509 --> 01:03:46,219
In her whole life, she knew
so little about her own husband.

914
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,389
I wouldn't want to talk about her
on a happy day like today.

915
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,690
We have only one bullet left each.
I'll go first.

916
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:01,400
Are you getting nervous?

917
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,900
Look who's talking.

918
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:11,069
Tell me the truth.

919
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:13,779
You tried to betray me
two years ago, didn't you?

920
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:14,779
What are you doing?

921
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:15,940
Tell me!

922
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,779
You can't fool me.

923
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:20,350
I knew from the get-go
that you had changed.

924
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,619
You wouldn't take my calls,
you wouldn't come back...

925
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:24,850
There must have been a reason why
you avoided me.

926
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:26,560
What are you up to?

927
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,690
Were you planning to leave me?

928
01:04:31,089 --> 01:04:33,060
Shoot me if you can.

929
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,369
If you think you can keep
your fortune without me,

930
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,230
shoot me.

931
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,139
You scumbag.

932
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,810
Whoever dares to betray me will die.

933
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:47,210
You are no exception.

934
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:13,739
Don't die, Mom.

935
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:16,310
No. No. No.

936
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,270
No. No!

937
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,080
No.

938
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,509
No.

939
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,549
No.

940
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,250
No.

941
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:31,949
No!

942
01:05:47,369 --> 01:05:48,369
Sir!

943
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,569
What happened?

944
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:53,279
Wake up.

945
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,710
Na Ae Gyo is gone.

946
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,520
- Find her!
- Yes, sir.

947
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:12,589
Wake up.

948
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:13,730
Open your eyes!

949
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,400
She's not breathing.

950
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:20,469
What?

951
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,239
We have to get out of here.

952
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:24,409
We have no time. Hurry!

953
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:18,330
(The Penthouse 2)

954
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,029
You're marrying Chairman Joo?

955
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:22,299
I told you.
You can never be free of me.

956
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,830
Leave before the wedding!

957
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,029
Our mom's killer...

958
01:07:26,029 --> 01:07:27,369
I found out.

959
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:30,310
I'll kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

960
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:31,310
Trophy?

961
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,080
What if I really end up going crazy?

962
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,440
Seok Hoon, Seok Kyung,
your biological mom is alive.

963
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,779
Oh Yoon Hee? You again?

964
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:39,449
Would you trust the person
who tried to kill you?

965
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:40,819
You meant it.

966
01:07:40,819 --> 01:07:42,520
I know it's you!
