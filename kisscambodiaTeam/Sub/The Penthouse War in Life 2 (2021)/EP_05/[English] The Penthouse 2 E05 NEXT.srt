00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:06,014
THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:07,585
AND BACKGROUND OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,338
EPISODE 5

4
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:16,386
Why are you here?

5
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:21,956
You said I was your daughter too.

6
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:26,456
Can't a daughter visit her mom to hang out?

7
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:28,026
I'm busy.

8
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,535
Say what it is and leave.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,636
I have many documents to review.

10
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,105
Cheong A Art Festival is in a few days.

11
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,175
I've waited really long for it.

12
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,545
What dress should I wear?

13
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,185
I'm so excited.

14
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:50,655
The notice should be up by now.

15
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:55,755
The teachers decided today to
disqualify you from entering.

16
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:59,795
What you did was too heinous.
It was out of my hands.

17
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,935
Don't make jokes.

18
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,836
My dad asked you, remember?

19
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,976
Just let me compete.

20
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,345
You're the director. You have the power.

21
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:22,416
Oh dear. Did I surprise you?

22
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:25,416
I was imitating Eun Byeol.

23
00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:27,726
I don't need to respond anymore, right?

24
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:32,155
Since you're being nice anyway,

25
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,965
how about you give me the grand prize?

26
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,965
- What?
- If you truly love my dad,

27
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:42,965
you can do that much for me.

28
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,636
Are you kidding me?

29
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,506
You have no skills. How could
you ask for the grand prize?

30
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,776
You know...

31
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:53,246
I can't beat Eun Byeol with my skills.

32
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,886
That's why I'm being shameless
and asking you for this favor.

33
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:59,886
Must I call your dad for
you to shut your mouth?

34
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,926
Get out. Now.

35
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:09,926
You'll regret it if you act like that.

36
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:15,935
I know a pretty big secret, lady.

37
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,076
What?

38
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:25,546
When Director Cheon Myung Soo passed away,

39
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,915
you were on the staircase with him.

40
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,516
Why did you just run away?

41
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,556
Instead of saving your dad?

42
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:43,366
What did you just say?

43
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:47,236
You must've been shocked.

44
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:51,405
Okay, then. Shall we restart our discussion?

45
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,146
Seok Kyung,

46
00:02:57,146 --> 00:03:00,116
what nonsense are you speaking?

47
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,586
Do you want to participate
in the festival that badly?

48
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:05,856
You can try whatever you want,

49
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,785
but you've already been disqualified.

50
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:10,396
You think the parents of the
victims will just let you be?

51
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,695
You think I'm only doing this for me?

52
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,565
I'm protecting your secret too.

53
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,866
It's a win-win situation.

54
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,095
Stop speaking like a lunatic.

55
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,706
You think I'd give in to a threat like that?

56
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:23,875
I see.

57
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,046
You need proof?

58
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:29,076
All right.

59
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,415
I'll give you proof if that's what you want.

60
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:34,945
But when you see it for yourself,

61
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,486
it'll only be more difficult for you.

62
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,366
You need some water.

63
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,465
Your face is so pale.

64
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:57,135
You have to be healthy, after all.

65
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:13,655
That brat!

66
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:16,685
What does she have that
she's being like that?

67
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:20,325
Was she the one who sent me
those threatening text messages?

68
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:23,366
No, that can't be.

69
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:26,966
If she had a video, she would've
shown it to me right already.

70
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:30,935
Calm down.

71
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:36,706
MS. KO

72
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,531
MS. KO

73
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,385
Hello?

74
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,955
Ms. Cheon! It's a mess here!

75
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,056
How could you do this to me?

76
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,596
What harm did my Jenny ever cause you?

77
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,426
Not only you bullied her,

78
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,835
you fed her until she threw up,

79
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,796
filmed that, and laughed at her!

80
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:01,565
How can you call yourselves humans?

81
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:04,736
How are you going to make
up for Jenny's broken heart?

82
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,236
Stop it!

83
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,775
What are you doing? This isn't your house.

84
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:11,815
You did me wrong too!

85
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,246
I don't know if you're just trying
to cover it up for Seok Kyung,

86
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,986
but don't underestimate me.

87
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,656
I won't forgive the kids...

88
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,185
involved in this.

89
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,726
I'll make sure they're all punished.

90
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,255
Eun Byeol! Min Hyuk!

91
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:25,496
I won't forgive them!

92
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:28,596
The only thing the other kids
did wrong was being there.

93
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,065
We've confirmed it already.

94
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,435
I see. You want to dump it all on Seok Kyung.

95
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:36,806
Why? Because your child
is among the assailants?

96
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:40,075
Calling her an "assailant" is offensive.

97
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,716
Those children are my precious students too.

98
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,346
Do you want all the top
students in the school...

99
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,015
to be punished?

100
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,216
You need to think about
the school's position too!

101
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,556
That's right.

102
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,856
Our innocent Min Hyuk had to do it
because Seok Kyung forced him to.

103
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,625
We're victims too.

104
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,455
Don't give me that garbage.

105
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:00,226
Jenny told me everything.

106
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,395
That no one helped her
when she was being bullied.

107
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,166
Being a bystander is assault too!

108
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,835
That's why we let Jenny
compete in the festival.

109
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,306
That's a given!

110
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,236
What I want is for every
assailant to be punished.

111
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:15,176
I will not settle or make exceptions!

112
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,145
Why are you being so cold?

113
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,585
We've been friends for so long.

114
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:24,515
Exactly.

115
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:27,085
There's just so much we can take.

116
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:31,255
We'll keep seeing each other
in the same apartment building.

117
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,996
You should give it a rest
and give in a little.

118
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,426
That's only right.

119
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:38,895
For the sake of our future relationship.

120
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:40,806
That's why I'm saying this.

121
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,265
Ma Ri.

122
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:44,775
Don't do this.

123
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:53,546
Our relationship.

124
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,955
Don't give me that garbage.

125
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,486
This means war.

126
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:05,856
I won't even talk to jerks
who hurt my daughter.

127
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:09,796
I'm seeing red right now.

128
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,335
You! If you don't go and
apologize to Jenny right now,

129
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,565
I'll break your legs.

130
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:18,205
You too!

131
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,806
You too. Get your act together.

132
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,515
Stop her. Stop her.

133
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,515
She left.

134
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:27,746
Where?

135
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:30,445
She's a total thug!

136
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,286
Fine. This is war.

137
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:39,825
My gosh. My gosh.

138
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,505
Min Hyuk is all grown up.

139
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:51,205
Son. Prepare hard for the festival.

140
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,476
Your dad will take care of...

141
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,005
Shut it.

142
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,515
Look at your face.

143
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:00,445
I'm so humiliated.

144
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:04,486
I thought an assemblyman was powerful, but...

145
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,205
Ma Ri.

146
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,635
How dare you take me...

147
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,205
for a chump?

148
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,515
It's me. Kyu Jin.

149
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,785
Hello, Kyu... I mean, sir.

150
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,616
A woman named Kang Ma Ri lives
in Unit 4503 in our building.

151
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,155
Find out everything you can.

152
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,785
Yes, sir. You can count on me.

153
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,665
All I need is Eun Byeol's phone.

154
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,395
Do you even have a brain?

155
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:55,905
You were put on probation?

156
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:57,936
School violence will go on your record.

157
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,305
Then you can kiss college
goodbye before you even apply!

158
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,875
I poured so much money into the school.

159
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,675
I could've built a building
in Cheongdam-dong with that!

160
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:07,076
Why is everyone only yelling at me?

161
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:09,885
Your fiancee's daughter bullied
Jenny when no one looked...

162
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,816
and did much worse things to her.

163
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,155
Then you shouldn't have gotten caught either!

164
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,226
Why are you inferior to Eun
Byeol in every single way?

165
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,196
You came from a good family
and had the best teachers.

166
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,196
I spent all that money to help you succeed,

167
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,425
but you can't beat that one girl?

168
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,966
It's not my fault I was born stupid!

169
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,966
My birth mom must've been dumb.

170
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:26,996
Why you...

171
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,866
I refuse to be punished alone.

172
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,476
That witch hid behind her mom.

173
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,645
I won't go down alone.

174
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,076
Just go study abroad.

175
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:39,415
I never expected you to
win the grand prize anyway.

176
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:40,645
Why should I leave?

177
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,086
I can go to Seoul National University.

178
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:43,746
Rather than apply to a college
way out of your league...

179
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:45,155
and be humiliated,

180
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,285
go to any random country and get a diploma.

181
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:50,086
It'll be much cheaper to get
you the SAT answer sheet.

182
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:53,425
I don't need your help anymore.

183
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,366
I'll win the grand prize at
Cheong A Art Festival somehow.

184
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,436
Just keep your promise to let me move out.

185
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:04,606
Joo Seok Kyung! Get back here!

186
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:08,545
Joo Seok Kyung!

187
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,885
I'll talk to her.

188
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,726
Why are you making things worse?

189
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,665
What do you gain by angering Father?

190
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:33,295
I said to be patient, that I would...

191
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,405
Don't act like you care about me.

192
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,535
Ro Na is back at school.

193
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,206
Doesn't it make you sick
just seeing her face?

194
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:39,375
Stop being unreasonable.

195
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,476
Ro Na's mom didn't kill Mom.

196
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:42,675
You believe that?

197
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:46,045
Do you think Ms. Yang killed Mom?

198
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,045
That's...

199
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,686
I didn't do it for money.

200
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:55,086
Take this. You are an
important person to me now.

201
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:02,072
100,000 DOLLARS

202
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,135
I know for sure that Ro
Na's mom didn't kill her.

203
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,436
So don't dump your guilty
conscience onto someone else.

204
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,005
How could you say that?

205
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,275
You're the same as Ro Na.

206
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:35,996
I don't owe you anything anymore.

207
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:38,665
Do you want me to reveal
what you did to my husband,

208
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,035
which you tried to cover up...

209
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,966
by giving me an apartment?

210
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:46,035
I don't think it's a good idea
to bring that up, Ms. Kang.

211
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:48,246
It was for Jenny's sake that
my husband took the fall...

212
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,645
and went to prison instead of you.

213
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,586
And your daughter ripped her heart to pieces.

214
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,586
Be prepared. I might even kill your daughter,

215
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:01,986
Seok Kyung.

216
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,196
Yoo Dong Pil is behaving and
living quietly in prison.

217
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:13,336
He doesn't seem to know
yet about his daughter.

218
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,305
When is he being released?

219
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:17,706
Two months.

220
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,375
Two months.

221
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,946
We can't let him out already.

222
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,175
Your wife...

223
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,246
dared to mess with me.

224
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:35,726
Why did you call us here?

225
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,356
Our kids have to go to school.

226
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,356
If you're here to kill our mood
first thing in the morning...

227
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:40,356
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,696
Jenny. Ro Na.

229
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,295
I sincerely apologize.

230
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,805
Drop the act. It won't work on us.

231
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,976
I know I was wrong.

232
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:56,905
It was too hard for me...

233
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,846
after my mom died.

234
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,316
I wasn't prepared to accept it yet,

235
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:05,915
and my dad got engaged.

236
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,986
I had to become a family with Eun Byeol.

237
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,326
I couldn't handle it.

238
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,466
Do you think that's an excuse?

239
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,696
Just because you were hurting,
you took it out on innocent kids?

240
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,206
I still hate Ro Na and Ms. Oh,

241
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:25,076
but I got angry that
Jenny was close to Ro Na.

242
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,436
That's why...

243
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:32,415
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,415
It'll never happen again.

245
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,415
Please...

246
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,155
Please forgive me.

247
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,486
I'll accept the probation.

248
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,025
It has been my dream to perform
at Cheong A Art Festival.

249
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:48,665
Please... Please let me do that at least.

250
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:49,826
Please.

251
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,716
That witch Seok Kyung
can't be sincere, can she?

252
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:10,346
It's obviously an act.

253
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,716
There's still fire in her eyes.

254
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:14,456
She was not sorry.

255
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,996
Still, she swallowed her
pride and got on her knees.

256
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,826
She's still a kid.

257
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,196
Shouldn't we give her another chance?

258
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,366
No. I won't forgive her.

259
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:30,305
"It has been my dream to perform
at Cheong A Art Festival."

260
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,706
Then even more so.

261
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,005
She has to lose that which
is the most precious...

262
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,915
for it to be true punishment.

263
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,425
Shouldn't you...

264
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,525
at least apologize?

265
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,265
The Office of Education is taking
what Seok Kyung did to Ro Na...

266
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:00,236
very seriously and is investigating.

267
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:01,805
Do as you wish.

268
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,905
Have her expelled or report her to the police

269
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,336
I will never bow down to you.

270
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:10,045
If Su Ryeon were to see Seok Kyung now,

271
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:12,816
what would she say?

272
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,645
How can you bring up
that name so shamelessly?

273
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:18,255
Aren't you the one who
begged me to get rid of her?

274
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,515
Is that why...

275
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,625
you killed her?

276
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,755
For my sake?

277
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:26,555
What?

278
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,795
Forget it.

279
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,836
It's all in the past now.

280
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,035
And it's true that...

281
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,936
I wanted Su Ryeon gone.

282
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:39,535
Why are you back anyway?

283
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,946
To get back at me or abandoning you?

284
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:46,616
Do you think that's possible?

285
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:50,316
You seem to underestimate me.

286
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,155
Stop wasting your time and
get lost with Ha Yoon Chul...

287
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,755
unless your child has two lives.

288
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,326
Thank you for your concern,

289
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,366
but shouldn't you be worried
about your company instead?

290
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,496
Rumor has it that it's
experiencing financial difficulty,

291
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:09,305
and its stocks have been plummeting for days.

292
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:12,505
I read an article in the financial paper...

293
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:16,645
advising against investing in your stocks.

294
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:20,645
The merger plan with Cheong A
Foundation seems to be called off,

295
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,586
and it's said that things are
not good between you and Seo Jin.

296
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:25,956
With all your financial sources drying up,

297
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,686
your company may face
severe financial strain.

298
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,155
Are you sure it'll be all right?

299
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:35,096
You're being nosy. I don't need your advice.

300
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,593
J KING HOLDINGS

301
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:48,145
It's already down by five percent today.

302
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,675
Where did the rumor about
financial difficulty leak?

303
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,116
It's definitely not the banks.

304
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,486
I think it's because of Ms. Cheon's scandal.

305
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:58,655
My company is going to falter
unless the merger is announced soon.

306
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,796
CEO JOO DAN TAE

307
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,066
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

308
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,635
I, PARK YOUNG RAN, AGREE NOT
TO DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION...

309
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,847
SIGNED BY CHEON SEO JIN AND PARK YOUNG RAN

310
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:23,906
Is it time to play this card in the end?

311
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:39,456
Are you preparing the Grand Prize for me?

312
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,295
Don't forget to engrave the
trophy with my name beforehand.

313
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,666
My patience has a limit.

314
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,436
Come on. Don't worry.

315
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,976
You'll see the evidence that
you're dying to see soon enough.

316
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:58,545
You won't be disappointed.

317
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,855
What is she hiding from me?

318
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,666
- You're here.
- Yes.

319
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,065
Seo Young, it's been a while.

320
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:24,605
I know. Sorry we showed up unannounced.

321
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,236
You seem very busy.

322
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:29,105
I was at the auditorium preparing
for Cheong A Art Festival.

323
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:30,775
What brings you here?

324
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,545
I was very moved by your
20th anniversary concert.

325
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,845
Sorry it took me so long to
congratulate you in person.

326
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,446
That's not necessary. We're family.

327
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:39,156
Especially the first song.

328
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:44,085
I've never heard you sing so perfectly.

329
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:49,626
Your father would've been so proud.

330
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,835
It's such a shame.

331
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:55,736
What are you trying to say?

332
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,535
This is just ridiculous.

333
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,005
Open it.

334
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,945
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

335
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,065
How reckless of you.

336
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:14,775
How dare you use a ghost singer
at such an important concert?

337
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,906
I was really shocked.

338
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,005
The country's most renowned singer...

339
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,775
fooled the whole country?

340
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:24,176
It creeps me out.

341
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:25,586
Where...

342
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,785
did you get this?

343
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:31,886
An anonymous report was made to
the foundation's ethics committee.

344
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:34,455
You've brought disgrace
upon the whole family.

345
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,025
Do you know how much trouble I went
through to keep the committee quiet?

346
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,596
But you didn't do that for me, did you?

347
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:44,606
As my mom, shouldn't you
ask how my voice is...

348
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,406
and how serious my condition is...

349
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:49,576
before anything else?

350
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,275
If you were my real mom, I mean.

351
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,676
Am I wrong?

352
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:58,086
What did you say?

353
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,416
Step down as the director...

354
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,156
before you humiliate yourself further.

355
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,856
Let Seo Young take over.

356
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:07,426
What?

357
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:08,725
Have you ever thought about...

358
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:11,295
the damage that the foundation
will suffer once this gets out?

359
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:13,696
The foundation that your
father devoted his life to...

360
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,396
might crumble overnight.

361
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,136
Is that what this is all about?

362
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,876
Taking your stepdaughter's position away...

363
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:24,436
and giving it to your real daughter?

364
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,676
Will that make you happy?

365
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,346
Now that Father is gone,

366
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:30,975
you don't have to pretend to
be my mom anymore, do you?

367
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,485
You rude brat. How dare
you speak to me that way?

368
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:39,626
I've looked after you for the past 35 years.

369
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,626
Have you ever acknowledged that once?

370
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:45,126
How can I possibly love you
when you never open up to me?

371
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,366
Aren't you responsible for that?

372
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:50,235
All these years,

373
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,565
you've tried so hard to make Father hate me.

374
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,775
Step down,

375
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:58,275
or I'll disclose it myself.

376
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:06,186
One more thing.

377
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,785
Sell off Cheong A Art Center...

378
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:12,156
as soon as it's completed.

379
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,156
Why would you waste the foundation's money...

380
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,025
on a stupid opera house?

381
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,326
It was Father's life-long dream.

382
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:20,696
I'm going to run it myself no matter what.

383
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,535
I can't let you do that.

384
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,366
I have a 30-percent share
of the foundation, remember?

385
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:31,376
Let go of the idea that you're
irreplaceable, will you?

386
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:48,896
Oh Yoon Hee.

387
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:53,826
You revealed it in the end?

388
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:09,876
Why did you have to rush me?
I'm stressed out as it is.

389
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:12,015
I don't even have any
reservations today, do I?

390
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:14,045
Apparently, someone
recommended you to this lady.

391
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,985
She even brought these flowers,
specifically asking for you.

392
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:21,725
- What?
- She's waiting. Hurry up.

393
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,866
What's more, she paid the
membership fee in cash.

394
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:27,295
Is she in the scrub room?

395
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,065
- Yes.
- Okay.

396
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,670
MA RI SAUNA

397
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:32,585
Hello.

398
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:35,186
I wonder who recommended me to you.

399
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:36,926
Usually,

400
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:39,426
you have to make a reservation
at least the day before.

401
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,666
I'm only making an exception here
because someone recommended me...

402
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,795
to you...

403
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:59,045
Now I understand why you smell like soap...

404
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,216
every time you've been out, Ms. Kang.

405
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:06,585
I thought you were having an affair,
but this is even more shocking.

406
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:10,686
I've never heard about anyone
like you at Hera Palace.

407
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:13,795
How did you find this place?

408
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,236
Put on some clothes already.

409
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:24,876
Assemblyman Lee hates waiting.

410
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,275
Yuck.

411
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:32,275
Sorry.

412
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,655
SAUNA

413
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:47,646
Honey.

414
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:51,616
What?

415
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:57,715
The outfit looks even better
on you than I expected.

416
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:59,856
When my aide told me that...

417
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,156
you work at a sauna, I didn't believe it.

418
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:04,525
But look at you.

419
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:08,196
This is why everyone should dress
in something that suits them.

420
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,866
You look fantastic. Right, honey?

421
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,166
Exactly.

422
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,576
I knew something didn't feel right...

423
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:19,205
when she bragged to everyone at Hera Palace.

424
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:22,315
So what?

425
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:24,916
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

426
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:28,755
I swear that I've lived
more honestly than you two.

427
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:31,455
I've earned money through hard work.

428
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,856
You have no right to mock me.

429
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:37,596
Then why did you hide it
from everyone so completely?

430
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:42,436
- Well...
- It's for your child, right?

431
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:44,836
But the thing is,

432
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:47,136
this sauna looks so run down.

433
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,936
Since her mom works her bottom
off at a place like this,

434
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:52,876
Jenny really should study hard.

435
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,676
So I had my aide...

436
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:58,315
send a few pictures to Jenny.

437
00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:00,245
She should grow up.

438
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:01,555
What?

439
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:03,416
Shouldn't you run?

440
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,225
Ms. Kang!

441
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,096
That was hilarious.

442
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:12,366
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

443
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,136
Ro Na,

444
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:19,866
are you just coming in?

445
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:22,406
Things are going fine at school, right?

446
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:26,076
Ms. Oh, is it okay if I prepare
for the festival with Ro Na?

447
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:28,076
I feel scared to do it on my own.

448
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:30,676
Of course, you can.

449
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,015
Let's go. I'll cook you tteokbokki.

450
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,025
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

451
00:25:42,196 --> 00:25:43,426
Sorry. Goodness!

452
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:44,926
Why is her head so thick?

453
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,495
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,406
I'm fine.

455
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:56,676
Excuse me,

456
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:59,275
who are you?

457
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,505
It's a secret.

458
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:08,856
A bathhouse?

459
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:11,455
Who's that?

460
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:14,285
These must've been delivered
to the wrong suite.

461
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,495
This is ours.

462
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:19,896
Jenny!

463
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:21,995
Jenny!

464
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:24,366
Are you okay?

465
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,735
Did anyone come by?

466
00:26:28,106 --> 00:26:30,475
Mom, why do you look like this?

467
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:31,646
Where are you coming from?

468
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:37,446
I was at the sauna.

469
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:41,215
I forgot I had dinner
arrangements with someone.

470
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,715
Why don't you and Jenny go
out and have dinner instead?

471
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:45,186
I'll cook you tteokbokki another time.

472
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,086
Mom, is that okay?

473
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,725
Yes.

474
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,295
All right. I'll be back.

475
00:26:50,295 --> 00:26:52,065
- Let's go, Ro Na.
- See you.

476
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:58,606
Are you looking for these?

477
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:19,326
Goodness.

478
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:30,965
Lee Kyu Jin that jerk! This is
what you became an assemblyman for?

479
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:35,576
Who's that?

480
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:43,077
DUBAI

481
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,466
Yes, officer.

482
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,248
Is something wrong with my husband?

483
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:50,819
What?

484
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:52,976
What do you mean?

485
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:56,105
My husband is hurt?

486
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,515
There was a fight between the prisoners,

487
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,916
and he got beaten up badly and
is at a hospital right now.

488
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,386
He got into a fight?

489
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:05,255
What happened?

490
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,785
He's been watching out for himself so much.

491
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:10,055
This has never happened before.

492
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:11,686
We're looking into it right now.

493
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,126
Just know that it happened.

494
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:16,896
One must be careful of the
smallest things before a release.

495
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:20,595
If anything goes wrong, his
release might get delayed.

496
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,865
Hello? Officer!

497
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,575
What's happening?

498
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:31,206
Who did he possibly fight with?

499
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,416
Could it be Joo Dan Tae?

500
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:41,716
That jerk!

501
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:48,666
This was your plan all along?

502
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,466
You sing for me once, and you
use that against me like this?

503
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,996
What are you saying? Talk
to me like a normal person!

504
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:57,005
Why my mother?

505
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,835
Why my sister?

506
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:02,246
You probably thought that that
was the best way to bring me down,

507
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,045
but whatever you do,

508
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:06,946
I won't let anyone take Cheong
A Arts High School from me.

509
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,416
Nobody can take my director position!

510
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,055
I don't know what's going on with you,

511
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:21,325
but are you going to rage at me
every time something goes wrong?

512
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:26,236
I'm sorry, but I haven't done anything yet.

513
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:27,896
I guess...

514
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,166
you have a lot more enemies than just me.

515
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,505
- Shut up.
- What are you doing?

516
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,275
Get out of my house.

517
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:40,815
I warned you.

518
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,186
I won't stay still if you hurt my wife.

519
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:45,986
You must know...

520
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,956
what that wench has been up to!

521
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,555
Since you live with her,

522
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,255
you must know too.

523
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,626
How fun has that been?

524
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,166
Are you having a blast?

525
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,065
How dare you just laugh with her, you jerk!

526
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,936
What do you mean?

527
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:03,865
Even if you hate me,

528
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:09,206
how could you team up with
Yoon Hee to get back at me?

529
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:12,946
You know...

530
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:17,845
what Cheong A Foundation means to me.

531
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,966
Are you okay? Did something
go on between you two?

532
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:33,865
No, it's nothing.

533
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,936
There must've been a misunderstanding.

534
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,206
I can't just let her be.

535
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:39,176
She's being like that because we let her.

536
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:42,845
Don't do anything.

537
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:45,646
It'll just get tiring
for us if we make a mess.

538
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:47,216
Stop letting people walk all over you!

539
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:49,115
If someone comes at you, you go at them too!

540
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,555
I'm here to protect you.

541
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,226
You're not on your own.

542
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:09,305
It's nothing. Don't overreact.

543
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,706
Dinner's ready.

544
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,436
I'm heading out for a moment.

545
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,775
I won't take long.

546
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:15,946
Be careful.

547
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:37,565
Why can't I reach you?

548
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:39,265
I've been worried sick.

549
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:41,535
Why?

550
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:43,136
Your mother called.

551
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:49,206
I heard that you're resigning
from being the director.

552
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:50,446
Is that true?

553
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,015
Is that what my mom told you?

554
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:05,396
What's going on?

555
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:07,726
Is there an issue that I don't know of?

556
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,765
Tell me so that I can help.

557
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:12,095
The Cheong A Arts Center project...

558
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,696
is going well, right?

559
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,365
Of course. As you've dreamed of,

560
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:20,805
it'll become the world's best opera house.

561
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:39,525
Rush...

562
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:41,525
the merge.

563
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:53,876
Is it because of what happened today?

564
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:55,805
Don't rush anything.

565
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:58,075
Think over it carefully. It's a big decision.

566
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,376
No. I've been thinking
about it for a long time.

567
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,115
There's no reason to stall time.

568
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,156
Announce the merge.

569
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:09,486
I can give the department store
and the hotel to Mom and my sister.

570
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:11,656
All I want is Cheong A Arts Center.

571
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:15,196
I'll give you the right to decide
on anything regarding the merge.

572
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,065
If that's what you want,

573
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:20,535
I'll get started on it.

574
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,736
It's going to be huge.

575
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:27,575
You might become richer than you can imagine.

576
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:29,876
I'm already satisfied...

577
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:32,646
with the wealth that I already have.

578
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:35,916
I don't know.

579
00:33:36,646 --> 00:33:40,055
Can one's desire for
wealth ever be fulfilled?

580
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:44,555
Even when you live on a
100th-floor penthouse,

581
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:49,226
humans are built to want more, to go higher.

582
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,065
Isn't that why you chose me, after all?

583
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:56,636
Let's not push our wedding back any further.

584
00:33:57,005 --> 00:34:00,005
Move in as soon as the Arts Festival is over.

585
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,406
Your daughter, Seok Kyung.

586
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,876
Will I be able to handle her?

587
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:10,285
Us two moving in together is...

588
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:11,445
What about Seok Kyung?

589
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,785
Did she do something wrong again?

590
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:18,856
No. Let's talk later.

591
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:22,595
I'm sorry. Can you please leave?

592
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:24,166
I need some rest.

593
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:25,226
All right.

594
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:59,066
Cheon Seo Jin will complete my dream.

595
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,695
CHEONG A ARTS CENTER

596
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:01,796
CHEONSOO DISTRICT 27

597
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:04,465
All I need now is to find Joo Hye In.

598
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:09,175
Then, her land can be mine too.

599
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:14,615
Had it not been for Shim
Su Ryeon, that wench,

600
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,497
everything would've already been mine by now.

601
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:32,941
Stop drinking.

602
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:35,642
Are you going to be drunk in front of Jenny?

603
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:37,412
Don't stop me.

604
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,712
I'm going to drink until I die tonight.

605
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,381
No, everyone is going to die.

606
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:44,951
Because you're embarrassed...

607
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:47,322
that you work at a bathhouse?

608
00:35:47,951 --> 00:35:50,721
You saw? You saw, didn't you?

609
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,062
Why did you do that?

610
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:55,121
What's wrong with working at a bathhouse?

611
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:56,892
It's not like you're
committing a crime or anything.

612
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:58,632
Are you teasing me now?

613
00:35:58,632 --> 00:36:01,632
Those who are threatening you
with that should be embarrassed.

614
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:03,831
Why are you the one who's embarrassed?

615
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:08,272
It's Min Hyuk's family that
sent you the photos, isn't it?

616
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:10,272
That brat.

617
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:12,681
He doesn't even care that
his son did so wrong.

618
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:16,411
Instead, he's busy threatening
me using my weakness.

619
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:20,481
Why hasn't lightning struck him yet?

620
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,991
There's no point in grumbling.

621
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:27,221
When you're weak, people
are bound to get you.

622
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:30,932
That's how I let people get me too.

623
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,101
The Hera Palace people, I mean.

624
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,331
I know it must look terrible
of me to apologize to you...

625
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,042
at a time like this,

626
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,211
but I was crazy.

627
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,482
You know, people are just like this.

628
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,241
I had no idea...

629
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:53,021
until I've been in your shoes too.

630
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,221
Sue me if you're pissed.

631
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:03,762
Even your apology sounds much like you.

632
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:06,902
You don't have clear evidence...

633
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:09,202
for the bullying incident,

634
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:13,241
so if you keep going forward,
you're the one who'll get hurt.

635
00:37:13,741 --> 00:37:17,071
Why don't you settle it now?

636
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:21,941
I know that I'm being stubborn too.

637
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,012
But...

638
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:27,182
I can't forgive myself...

639
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:31,321
for having had no idea of all of this...

640
00:37:32,992 --> 00:37:35,122
when my own child was going through so much.

641
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:38,291
I feel so bad.

642
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:45,832
Give one,

643
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,312
but we'll make sure that you get one too.

644
00:37:52,782 --> 00:37:54,041
Get what?

645
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:01,981
I want to go to school with Eun Byeol.

646
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:03,221
Where is she?

647
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:05,152
She's taking a shower right now.

648
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,761
I can wait.

649
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:09,532
It's going to take some
time. Have a seat and wait.

650
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:28,411
What? Why isn't it here?

651
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,182
Did she take it?

652
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:40,062
Eun Byeol, are you done getting ready?

653
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,161
What are you doing here?

654
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:52,731
That hurts!

655
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,471
I get it. Let go.

656
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,342
What do you think you're doing?

657
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,641
Why are you in her room
when she's not even here?

658
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:01,981
I came to go to school with Eun Byeol.

659
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:03,612
Why don't you trust me?

660
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:05,782
Since when were you so close to Eun Byeol?

661
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:07,851
Mom, what's wrong?

662
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,122
Get out!

663
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:18,462
You know that you're going overboard, right?

664
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:22,231
I thought you said that you're innocent.

665
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,131
Seems like you'll get caught soon.

666
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:26,242
Joo Seok Kyung!

667
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:30,112
I guess I'm too early. See you at school!

668
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:35,112
Mom, what's going on?

669
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:41,122
Distance yourself from Seok Kyung.

670
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:43,222
If she talks nonsense, just ignore her.

671
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:44,552
You understand?

672
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:46,862
Yes.

673
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:55,877
PRACTICE ROOM

674
00:39:57,502 --> 00:39:59,102
Stop.

675
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,372
Did you know...

676
00:40:02,372 --> 00:40:05,641
that Seok Hoon and Ro Na are dating again?

677
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:08,011
What? Who said that?

678
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:11,081
I saw the two together last night.

679
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:15,781
Things were looking quite serious.

680
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,691
It looked like Seok Hoon
is still not over Ro Na.

681
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:21,862
Do you know anything?

682
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:24,362
No, not at all.

683
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:38,242
Let go! What are you doing?

684
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:39,641
Let me go!

685
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,612
Stop playing with Seok Hoon!

686
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:44,612
Don't you and your mom have the
slightest bit of conscience?

687
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,211
Are both of you into
taking other women's men?

688
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,451
Watch your mouth. What are you talking about?

689
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:53,062
Seok Hoon is my boyfriend. We're dating.

690
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:55,461
Don't talk to him.

691
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:57,891
Don't even look at him. Don't be around him.

692
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:59,432
It's annoying.

693
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:03,271
Your mother and Seok Hoon's dad are engaged.

694
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:05,802
How can you two be together?

695
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:08,771
You're not worth explaining anything to.

696
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:13,011
I've warned you.

697
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:16,612
If I find you with Seok Hoon again,

698
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,752
you and I are both dead.

699
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:21,081
All right?

700
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,662
They're dating?

701
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:33,631
Lies. This can't be.

702
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,002
What did you just say?

703
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,841
I'll drop the bullying incident.

704
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:47,412
Let's just end it at Seok Kyung on probation.

705
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:50,381
That's what you should've
done from the start.

706
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:53,381
Did you finally get some sense in yourself?

707
00:41:53,381 --> 00:41:55,122
And let Seok Kyung...

708
00:41:55,122 --> 00:41:57,651
compete at the Cheong A Art Festival.

709
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:01,222
What made you change your mind so suddenly?

710
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:02,922
Right.

711
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,761
Isn't it better for Jenny if
Seok Kyung doesn't compete?

712
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,062
The more participants there are,

713
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:10,472
the lower your daughter's
rank is going to be.

714
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:14,372
I want to show everyone that
my Jenny can beat Seok Kyung...

715
00:42:14,502 --> 00:42:16,341
any day.

716
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:20,881
I got some kind of an apology too, after all.

717
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,441
Anyway,

718
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:25,852
thank you for making this decision.

719
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:29,222
Ms. Oh, you agree with this too, right?

720
00:42:29,222 --> 00:42:30,951
I do,

721
00:42:31,622 --> 00:42:34,591
but under one condition.

722
00:42:35,062 --> 00:42:36,432
What is it?

723
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,862
I'll join the PTA committee.

724
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:41,131
As a PTA committee member,

725
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:43,232
I'll have the right to observe school life...

726
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:45,771
and check the security videos as I please.

727
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:49,602
There's no guarantee that the
kids won't harass Ro Na anymore,

728
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:50,912
so it makes me nervous.

729
00:42:50,912 --> 00:42:52,742
As in, you'll observe them?

730
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:54,941
I have to protect my child, don't I?

731
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:59,482
While we're on the topic,
let the PTA choose...

732
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:02,722
the judges for the upcoming
Cheong A Art Festival.

733
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:03,722
That's...

734
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:07,222
the right of the school.

735
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:11,761
That's why there has been
corruption for all these years.

736
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:15,302
There were questionable
grand prize winners too.

737
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:18,901
That's a bit extreme.

738
00:43:19,232 --> 00:43:22,672
It's true that the fairness of
the judging has been questioned.

739
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:25,011
If you want to avoid such suspicions,

740
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:28,081
you can just proceed as Ms. Oh proposes.

741
00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:30,951
I'm for it.

742
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:32,852
Ms. Ko Sang A?

743
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:36,451
I have no reason to oppose.

744
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,461
Also, I'll notify the Office of Education...

745
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:42,591
that we will settle and drop the case...

746
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,531
only after my request is granted.

747
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:46,631
What do you say?

748
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:58,857
7 DAYS BEFORE CHEONG A
ART FESTIVAL PRELIMINARIES

749
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:27,972
Nothing salty.

750
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:31,511
You have to eat very balanced meals.

751
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:34,641
You have to eat well to
have the strength to sing.

752
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,881
That's a good boy.

753
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,192
- No, no.
- Mom, my throat.

754
00:44:47,192 --> 00:44:49,291
No. There. Wrap it.

755
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:50,761
Wrap it.

756
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:56,872
Again! Is that all you can do?

757
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:00,141
You need to breathe lower
the higher you sing.

758
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:02,901
Raise the pitch and make
your upper lip vibrate.

759
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,872
Okay. I'll try it again.

760
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:09,603
MI YUN YI

761
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,362
What's wrong?

762
00:45:23,092 --> 00:45:24,362
Is something wrong?

763
00:45:24,462 --> 00:45:25,462
It's nothing.

764
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:27,832
Focus on your singing.

765
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,181
Why can't you hold your breath longer?

766
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,411
How can you win the grand prize like that?

767
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:46,582
If you let Ro Na win the grand prize,

768
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:49,122
my life will be over.

769
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,822
You must beat Ro Na at all costs.

770
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:54,092
Even if you have to kill her.

771
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,161
I can do it.

772
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,362
I'll win the grand prize.

773
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:01,732
I won't lose to Ro Na.

774
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,771
You must make the perfect sound...

775
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:06,431
and squash the jerks whining about fairness.

776
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,002
You must practice and
practice until you get it.

777
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:11,411
Until you can hold your breath longer.

778
00:46:26,722 --> 00:46:27,722
Flex your abs.

779
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:29,222
More!

780
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:32,561
I was worried for nothing.

781
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,362
She has no evidence.

782
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,462
How could I let a kid scare me?

783
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:37,931
That wasn't like me.

784
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:39,572
More!

785
00:47:04,092 --> 00:47:06,561
It'll be hard not to win the grand prize.

786
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,531
- Was I really okay?
- Yes.

787
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:11,472
Take care of your throat
until the preliminaries.

788
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:13,372
Congrats in advance.

789
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:14,901
Thank you.

MERGER AGREEMENT SIGNING CEREMONY

798
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:03,082
I wanted to celebrate quietly just us.

799
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,921
We're engaged and we merged companies.

800
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:08,291
I feel like we're really one now.

801
00:48:08,962 --> 00:48:10,192
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

802
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:12,761
It took me a while to decide,

803
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,462
but now that we did it, I trust you.

804
00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:21,102
Cheong A Group will lead
construction and investment.

805
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:23,442
They're your specialties.

806
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:26,041
I already have the business model.

807
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:29,881
Here.

808
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,722
This is what I'm developing.

809
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,952
It's 20 minutes from Gangnam.

810
00:48:37,952 --> 00:48:40,791
Your Cheong A Art Center
will be at the center here.

811
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:44,592
Construction will be completed soon, right?

812
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:46,092
I'm excited.

813
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:47,702
Once the development is announced,

814
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,931
it'll be impossible for
anyone to buy the land.

815
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:52,002
It'll be worth much more than Hera Palace.

816
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:56,271
It'll become a wealthy
area surpassing Dogok-dong.

817
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:58,242
If it's worth that much,

818
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:00,811
large corporations must
have coveted it as well.

819
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:04,082
It was possible because I'm Joo Dan Tae.

820
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:08,852
I'm hungry. I have to eat light and go.

821
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:10,592
Cheong A Art Festival is tomorrow.

822
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:13,391
Okay. You must be fired from preparing it.

823
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:15,791
And thanks for letting Seok Kyung enter.

824
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,891
It's only natural.

825
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:23,061
Whether it's Eun Byeol or Seok
Kyung that wins the grand prize,

826
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:24,631
I can congratulate her sincerely.

827
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,171
Let's drink.

828
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:38,011
I can't wait for tomorrow.

829
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,702

I HOPE YOU WIN THE GRAND
PRIZE. GOOD LUCK. DAD.

833
00:50:29,962 --> 00:50:32,572
I hope you win the grand prize. Good luck.

834
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:34,872
Dad.

835
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,681
We will have a sunny day today.

836
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:49,122
The fine dust level is average.

837
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:52,521
If you're going to the East
Sea, be careful of strong waves.

838
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:54,722
There will be a wide range of temperatures.

839
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:56,122
In Seoul...

840
00:50:57,462 --> 00:50:59,332
Good luck, Ro Na. See you later.

841
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:02,732
See you later.

842
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:04,332
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

843
00:51:07,242 --> 00:51:08,342
Ro Na.

844
00:51:12,712 --> 00:51:14,881
Here. Drink it. It'll give you energy.

845
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:18,151
Just do as you have been in practice.

846
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:19,712
You were good.

847
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:24,222
Keep this in your mouth
until you have to go up.

848
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:26,722
It'll keep your mouth from getting dry.

849
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:30,021
Thanks. I'll do my best.

850
00:51:38,502 --> 00:51:40,232
At least have a banana.

851
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:43,171
Where's that drug?

852
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:45,842
You said you wouldn't take it this time.

853
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:48,612
I can't do it.

854
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:51,181
I just need to get my shaking under control.

855
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:55,651
Take just one.

856
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:59,092
It's for heart disease, so one's
enough to calm your nerves.

858
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:05,631

00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:08,161
We don't have time, so please hurry!

860
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:09,161
Yes, sir.

861
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:13,602

All right. The competition starts soon.

866
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:40,432
Everyone, go to the concert hall now.

867
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:42,002
Try to relax.

869
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:48,702
Please welcome contestant
number one, Bae Ro Na, on stage.

870
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:57,412
You can do this!

871
00:52:58,252 --> 00:53:00,851
- You look gorgeous!
- Let's do this!

872
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:21,242
Ma'am.

873
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:26,071
Ma'am.

874
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:29,182
What's wrong?

875
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:31,152
It's not the right key.

THE 28TH CHEONG A ART FESTIVAL

879
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:27,371
It's perfect. She pulled it off flawlessly.

880
00:54:45,422 --> 00:54:47,521
That was insane.

881
00:54:59,472 --> 00:55:01,341
- Well done.
- Next up is...

882
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:04,242
- Thanks.
- Ha Eun Byeol.

883
00:55:16,722 --> 00:55:18,621
- Oh, my.
- What happened?

884
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:22,121
I'm sorry. I didn't expect
Ro Na to pull it off.

885
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:27,202
Our deal is over now. Keep your mouth shut.

886
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:29,202
Don't worry about that.

887
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:37,511
I hope Eun Byeol doesn't get too nervous.

888
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:55,162
DON'T FORGET THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS
PEOPLE WHO ARE ON YOUR SIDE.

889
00:55:55,162 --> 00:55:58,261
Don't forget that there are always
people who are on your side.

890
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,561
I root for you. From Yoon Chul.

891
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:32,321
- Nice!
- Jenny!

892
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:36,321
- Good job!
- Well done!

893
00:57:39,492 --> 00:57:40,801
Great job, everyone.

894
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:43,061
Since everyone sang way better than usual,

895
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:46,932
this year's grand prize winner
will win by only one point.

896
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:50,271
Everyone, enjoy the festival while
the judges make their decision.

897
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:51,412
That's all.

898
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:57,811
After all my hard work...

899
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:00,851
It's all Ro Na's fault.

900
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:35,452
You did an amazing job today.

901
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,952
I was mind-blown.

902
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:43,192
- Here.
- Thanks.

903
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,851
What? Why doesn't it work?

904
00:59:10,482 --> 00:59:12,492
She changed the pattern?

905
00:59:14,222 --> 00:59:15,892
THE 28TH CHEONG A ART FESTIVAL

906
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:17,192
JUDGES

907
00:59:19,732 --> 00:59:20,861
SCORE SHEET

908
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:30,402
JUDGES' ROOM

909
00:59:33,972 --> 00:59:35,311
Have you decided...

910
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:37,581
on the grand prize winner?

911
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,752
Yes, we just did.

912
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:42,422
The decision was made
based on the potential...

913
00:59:42,422 --> 00:59:44,791
and the tone of the voice.

914
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,521
Here's the final result.

915
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:51,192
Thank you very much.

916
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:54,531
- Let's hand out the prizes now.
- Yes, ma'am.

917
01:00:08,482 --> 01:00:10,912
Eun Byeol, it's Mom. Are you okay?

918
01:00:10,912 --> 01:00:13,051
Why did you get so nervous?

919
01:00:13,351 --> 01:00:16,652
Your voice cracked a little,
but it wasn't a crucial mistake.

920
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,121
Don't worry too much.

921
01:00:18,121 --> 01:00:20,861
I'm not so sure about that, Ms. Cheon.

922
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:23,392
I'd say it was a crucial mistake.

923
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,992
Why do you...

924
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:30,002
Why do you have Eun Byeol's phone?

925
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:38,142
Seok Kyung!

926
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:40,212
That was fast.

927
01:00:40,412 --> 01:00:42,712
I'm winning the grand
prize as we agreed, right?

928
01:00:43,111 --> 01:00:45,152
Don't be ridiculous.

929
01:00:45,152 --> 01:00:47,311
I don't know who will win the grand prize.

930
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:50,521
The judges made a fair decision
based on who sang best.

931
01:00:52,722 --> 01:00:54,261
A fair decision?

932
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:56,662
Ask people on the street...

933
01:00:56,662 --> 01:00:59,732
if anything at Cheong A Arts
High School is ever fair.

934
01:00:59,732 --> 01:01:02,432
After promising that you'd bring
me evidence so confidently,

935
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:05,202
is this all you could cook up?

936
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,672
The result will be announced soon.

937
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:11,341
I didn't mean to be all dramatic,

938
01:01:12,142 --> 01:01:15,541
but I'll show you the evidence
that you so desperately want.

939
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:20,081
Here it is.

940
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:22,551
The evidence.

941
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:31,061
What are you talking about?

942
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:33,132
Eun Byeol had it all along.

943
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:34,831
The evidence that...

944
01:01:35,502 --> 01:01:38,402
you killed her grandfather.

945
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:43,271
Why did she hold on to this?
What was she going to do with it?

946
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:45,111
I'm not interested.

947
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:47,841
What I want is the grand prize trophy.

948
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:49,942
Whether she wins the grand prize or not,

949
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:52,081
Eun Byeol is good enough to get
into Seoul University of Music.

950
01:01:52,252 --> 01:01:56,351
So regardless of whose name
you find in the envelope,

951
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,621
just call my name.

952
01:02:04,162 --> 01:02:06,992
I feel like we've finally
become family for real.

953
01:02:09,432 --> 01:02:12,172
See you later, Mom.

954
01:03:07,821 --> 01:03:08,821
Seo Jin.

955
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:10,422
Hey...

956
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:36,482
Where are you?

957
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:40,091
We have to announce the winner.

958
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:02,281
What did you and Seok Hoon talk about?

959
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:04,311
He congratulated me for doing well.

960
01:04:04,952 --> 01:04:07,011
They'll announce the
winner soon. I have to go.

961
01:04:08,952 --> 01:04:10,081
Why?

962
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,121
Do you think you can win the grand prize?

963
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:13,922
That will never happen.

964
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,932
My mom will never give the
grand prize to the likes of you.

965
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:23,601
Just like with my mom?

966
01:04:24,202 --> 01:04:25,932
- What?
- Even then,

967
01:04:26,902 --> 01:04:29,041
she stole that trophy from her.

968
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:32,871
Your mom stole it from my mom.

969
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:34,811
Thanks to your grandfather.

970
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:39,311
My mom won it because she deserved to.

971
01:04:39,882 --> 01:04:41,551
Don't insult my mom.

972
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:43,722
And then she stabbed my mom in the neck.

973
01:04:44,492 --> 01:04:47,591
Because of your mom, my mom
had her chance at college,

974
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:50,021
her trophy, and her dream stolen from her.

975
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:52,932
That's not true. My mom would never do that!

976
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,761
You can deny it, but everyone knows...

977
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:59,601
that my mom was much better
than Ms. Cheon even back then.

978
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:02,502
And she still is.

979
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:05,412
You lost to me, Eun Byeol.

980
01:05:07,311 --> 01:05:11,412
Your dad bribed my pianist, didn't he?

981
01:05:12,482 --> 01:05:14,111
You probably asked him...

982
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:16,182
to ruin my performance.

983
01:05:21,162 --> 01:05:23,091
Did you want the grand prize that badly?

984
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:26,462
But I can't let you have it.

985
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,632
Because I have to win the
grand prize this year.

986
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,452
You know, right? No matter what anyone says,

987
01:05:44,752 --> 01:05:46,482
you're my only daughter.

988
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:50,452
You'll win the grand prize
today too no matter what.

989
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,422
Trust me.

990
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:56,021
Do you mean it?

991
01:05:56,021 --> 01:05:57,761
Of course, I do.

992
01:05:58,192 --> 01:05:59,962
Why? You don't believe me?

993
01:06:00,232 --> 01:06:01,601
Then prove it.

994
01:06:02,061 --> 01:06:03,831
Prove I'm your only daughter.

995
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:07,601
Fine. What is it?

996
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:09,041
I'll do anything you want.

997
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,142
What must I do?

998
01:06:10,442 --> 01:06:13,242
Ruin Ro Na's performance today.

999
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:16,142
Break the piano.

1000
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,351
Bribe the pianist.

1001
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:22,021
Make sure Ro Na doesn't win the grand prize.

1002
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,722
Eun Byeol. That's...

1003
01:06:23,722 --> 01:06:26,152
You promised to do anything I ask.

1004
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:32,162
You'll do it for me, right?

1005
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:34,962
If you don't,

1006
01:06:36,502 --> 01:06:38,331
I'll never talk to you again.

1007
01:06:46,371 --> 01:06:47,412
Eun Byeol.

1008
01:06:48,412 --> 01:06:49,811
What's wrong?

1009
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:52,011
If you let Ro Na win the grand prize,

1010
01:06:52,011 --> 01:06:53,652
my life will be over.

1011
01:06:53,912 --> 01:06:55,521
You must beat Ro Na at all costs.

1012
01:06:56,781 --> 01:06:58,121
Even if you have to kill her.

1013
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:00,621
Stop it.

1014
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:03,261
Stop it!

1015
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:12,402
You lost to me, Eun Byeol.

1016
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:15,271
Your dad, Seok Hoon,

1017
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:17,142
and the grand prize...

1018
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:19,172
are all mine.

1019
01:07:26,611 --> 01:07:27,611
No!

1020
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:29,482
Shut it!

1021
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:58,712
Eun Byeol. What are you doing?

1022
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:16,101
We'll bring our director, Ms. Cheon Seo Jin,

1023
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:19,801
to the stage to announce the winner.

1024
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:21,341
A round of applause, please.

1025
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:33,011
Classical singing. Bronze award.

1026
01:08:33,412 --> 01:08:34,851
Seniors from Cheong A Arts High School,

1027
01:08:35,222 --> 01:08:37,182
Noh Ji Ah and Cho Bo Mi.

1028
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:42,291
Congratulations.

1029
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:49,162
Classical singing. Silver award.

1030
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:51,061
Yoo Jenny.

1031
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:54,172
What? Jenny? Jenny! Jenny!

1032
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:56,942
Jenny! Jenny!

1033
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:58,672
Congratulations.

1034
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:04,982
Jenny!

1035
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:15,091
We will now announce the grand prize winner.

1036
01:09:15,462 --> 01:09:19,831
The grand prize winner will
be announced by the director.

1037
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:42,652
The highlight of the 28th
Cheong A Art Festival.

1038
01:09:43,081 --> 01:09:47,021
The recipient of the grand prize,
given to the singer who has...

1039
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:50,822
the most-divine voice, is...

1040
01:09:59,572 --> 01:10:03,502
Our director must be very nervous as well.

1041
01:10:06,271 --> 01:10:09,541
The winner receives a free pass
to Seoul University of Music.

1042
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:12,451
The winner of the grand prize
for classical singing is?

1043
01:10:12,851 --> 01:10:15,121
Ms. Cheon. Please read out the name.

1044
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:17,992
28TH CHEONG A ART FESTIVAL

1045
01:10:19,951 --> 01:10:21,391
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR

1046
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:22,822
BAE RO NA

1047
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:24,462
Ro Na!

1048
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:46,282
You're wrong, Ro Na.

1049
01:10:47,482 --> 01:10:51,382
I will not lose anything to you.

1050
01:10:52,991 --> 01:10:56,462
Not my dad, not Seok Hoon,

1051
01:10:57,822 --> 01:10:59,561
not the grand prize trophy.

1052
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:04,431
Cheong A Arts High School senior...

1053
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:05,732
BAE RO NA

1054
01:11:16,241 --> 01:11:18,581
What I want is the trophy.

1055
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:20,552
So,

1056
01:11:20,982 --> 01:11:23,252
regardless of whose name is in that envelope,

1057
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:25,822
you just have to say my name.

1058
01:11:35,132 --> 01:11:36,561
Bae Ro Na.

1059
01:12:22,782 --> 01:12:25,252
THE PENTHOUSE 2

1060
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:26,811
<i>Wasn't that murder?</i>

1061
01:12:26,811 --> 01:12:29,021
<i>The killer was in the school.</i>

1062
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:30,581
<i>Seok Kyung tried to kill Ro Na!</i>

1063
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:31,692
<i>What happened?</i>

1064
01:12:31,692 --> 01:12:33,121
<i>Tell the truth!</i>

1065
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:34,791
<i>Seok Kyung isn't the culprit.</i>

1066
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:37,291
<i>- Did you do this? - No!</i>

1067
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,462
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

1068
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:41,061
<i>I'm going to protect her with my life.</i>

1069
01:12:41,061 --> 01:12:42,302
<i>Even if that means you
have to kill Bae Ro Na?</i>

1070
01:12:42,302 --> 01:12:44,732
<i>Yoon Chul, you can't do that to Ro Na.</i>

1071
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:46,532
<i>The culprit for Ro Na's case!</i>

1072
01:12:48,471 --> 01:12:49,771
<i>Who are you?</i>
