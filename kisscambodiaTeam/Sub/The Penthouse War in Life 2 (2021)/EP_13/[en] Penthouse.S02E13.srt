00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,340
(Last Episode)

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,550
I've committed a sin against you
that cannot be cleansed.

3
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:27,220
No words or actions
can bring me forgiveness.

4
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,400
I've missed you so much.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,129
I loved you,

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,739
and that's why I resented you...

7
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,459
and felt bad for you all the more.

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,779
I'll take my punishment.

9
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,750
Here's my last act...

10
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,349
of atonement for you.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Gangnam Police Station.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,768
I'll walk on my own.

13
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,738
- Get in here!
- Let go!

14
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,068
Let go of me!

15
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,878
Move it already!

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,678
I didn't do it.

17
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:23,349
- Save it.
- Listen to me.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,019
Excuse me.

19
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,789
Yes? How may I help you?

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,190
I came to turn myself in.

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,069
I...

22
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,340
killed a person.

23
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,509
Power.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,840
Ares.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,009
Sunrise.

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,480
Zeus...

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,220
Zeus Palace.

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,420
What do you think?
For the new apartment.

29
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,919
I absolutely love it.

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,330
It sounds luxurious and rich.

31
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,300
Since I've become the president
of the residents association,

32
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,958
should we just buy the penthouse?

33
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,299
Forget it. Why would we move into
a place where people die...

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,640
and come back to life?

35
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,369
We'll move to Cheonsoo
in a few years anyway.

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,669
But you should dress nicer...

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,308
than the previous
association president.

38
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:29,509
Hey. Don't compare me
to that stupid jerk...

39
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,749
Joo Dan Tae.

40
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,148
They could bring me
a truck full of Joo Dan Taes.

41
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,790
I wouldn't trade you for them.

42
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,488
While we're here, let's get you
a suit in each color...

43
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,849
made of the best Italian fabric...

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,059
No, 2 or 3 in each color.

45
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,428
You have a cute face,

46
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,399
so you look good in bright colors.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,510
If you must define it,

48
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,510
I have a handsome face.

49
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,880
Let's buy them all.
We have way too much money.

50
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,209
I don't think
that's a good color for him.

51
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,380
He's a member of
the National Assembly after all.

52
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,959
Something respectful and refined.

53
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,688
And his face totally screams,
"petty weasel."

54
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,929
Hey.

55
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,498
Kyu Jin looks like a prince
no matter what he wears...

56
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,760
because of his face.

57
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,670
I ask because I'm really curious.

58
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,338
Are you my stalker fan?

59
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,838
Are you?

60
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,139
Why are you following me
when I'm shopping?

61
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,309
Come on. You're hurting my feelings.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,850
Didn't we strike it rich
with Cheonsoo District?

63
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,849
We're on a different level now.
We're all nobles.

64
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,089
We should have at least one bestie
on the same level.

65
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,630
I came to get a suit too.

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,789
A men's suit?

67
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,289
Didn't you know?

68
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,929
My husband is coming to Korea soon.

69
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,200
Mr. Yoo's coming?

70
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,570
Has it been five years already?

71
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,968
Did he close out the business
in Dubai?

72
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,938
I'm coming into a lot of money soon.

73
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,209
There's no reason to make him suffer
alone in that faraway land.

74
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,549
I'll tell you my husband's size.

75
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,688
I want the best...
The most expensive suit.

76
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,988
I'll take about 10 of them.

77
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,219
Did you say 10?

78
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,559
Come this way, ma'am.

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,128
Hey. Guys?

80
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,170
Hey. You.

81
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,569
Assemblyman Lee! Assemblyman Lee!

82
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,339
Assemblyman Lee!
Why aren't you answering your phone?

83
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,470
What?

84
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,308
Chairman Joo called.
Will he pay the 30 million dollars?

85
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,678
That's not it. Cheonsoo District...

86
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,079
- What? What?
- What about Cheonsoo District?

87
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,389
Cheonsoo District has been
flipped upside down!

88
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,889
Did it go up even more?

89
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,988
- Yes! We did it!
- Breaking news.

90
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:58,799
Cheonsoo District, which has been
the talk of the town...

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,599
for being named the location
of the new town development,

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,169
is now wrapped in a scandal related
to bribery of a government official.

93
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,238
Jung Doo Man, the party leader
of the Happy Future Party,

94
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,738
has resigned as party leader...

95
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,539
and submitted himself voluntarily
to the prosecutors.

96
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,678
Jung colluded with Joo Dan Tae,
the chairman of Cheong A Group,

97
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,909
who is being investigated
for the murder of his previous wife.

98
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,448
He changed the district
for the development...

99
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,748
and manipulated an over-inflation
of property value in Cheonsoo.

100
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:21,049
Focus is also turning to
the cause of death of Na,

101
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,188
to whom Joo Dan Tae had entrusted
to lead the development investments.

102
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,558
As per sources in the Ministry of
Land Infrastructure and Transport,

103
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,089
Cheonsoo was going to be announced
to be a landfill for garbage,

104
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,828
but it was suddenly named...

105
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,300
- the location of the new town.
- Let me in, Mr. Hwang!

106
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,969
Mr. Hwang!

107
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,868
A landfill? What?

108
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,169
Did you scam us?

109
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,039
Let us in, you scamming scumbag!

110
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,709
Mr. Hwang! Please return my money!

111
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,849
I can't even get married
without that!

112
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,019
Mr. Hwang! Let us in
before we get angry!

113
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,818
Are you trying to kill us?

114
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,118
Are you stupid?
How could you buy everything up...

115
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,988
without looking into it?

116
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,789
I even sold all of my buildings
in Gangnam and put it into this.

117
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,659
Why did you do that?

118
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,258
And why is this my fault?

119
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,128
You were happier than I was!

120
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,270
Kyu Jin. If your dad divorces me,

121
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,599
you have to let me
live with you, okay?

122
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,610
Okay.

123
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,138
Give me my money!

124
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,409
Mother.

125
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,578
Just tell me to kill myself.

126
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,149
That scares me more
than going bankrupt!

127
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,780
What are you talking about?

128
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,419
You can't do this to me!

129
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,789
Oh no.

130
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,290
- How do you feel?
- Why are you asking me?

131
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,428
Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin is here!

132
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,900
- Assemblyman Lee!
- What do you think about this?

133
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,769
- Let's go.
- Assemblyman Lee!

134
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,128
- Please give us a statement.
- Assemblyman Lee!

135
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,638
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Please say a few words.

136
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,269
I came to look at some land
for farming, that's all!

137
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,239
Out of my way!
No! This is defamation!

138
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,479
Get out of my way, jerks!

139
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,178
What? Can't assemblymen buy land?

140
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:57,179
Move!

141
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,618
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Wait!

142
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,019
- Honey!
- Assemblyman Lee!

143
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,049
Kyu Jin!

144
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,859
It's not true.
I'm not in the car! Honey!

145
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,029
Kyu Jin!

146
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,589
It has been confirmed...

147
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,529
that Assemblyman Lee was involved
in the war for Cheonsoo District.

148
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,599
He used the names of his parents,
son, and cousins...

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,899
to purchase
30 million dollars worth of land.

150
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,970
Yes. Hello? Madam?

151
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:25,110
Cheonsoo District... Hello?

152
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,340
What's wrong with my phone?

153
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,619
Lee Kyu Jin, Ko Sang A, Kang Ma Ri.

154
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,618
You need to come with us.

155
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:41,359
Oh no, I'm done for.

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,559
Already?

157
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
Hey, you.

158
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,999
Don't you know that Assemblymen
have immunity?

159
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,399
Plus, we're victims
of the Cheonsoo District scam.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,369
This is about the murder of
Min Seol A.

161
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,369
What did you just say?

162
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,970
Min Seol A...

163
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,679
That case was closed years ago.

164
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,349
We were victimized by Shim Su Ryeon
more than we care to mention...

165
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,818
The murderer confessed,

166
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,448
which reopened the case.

167
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,318
The murderer confessed?

168
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,850
Who was it?

169
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,888
Wait.

170
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,488
- Honey. Honey!
- No.

171
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:17,189
Wait!

172
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,569
I simply did what I had to.

173
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,840
I brought someone
who wanted to see you.

174
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,040
Will you meet with her?

175
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:12,849
Ro Na.

176
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Ro Na.

177
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,390
That's Ro Na, right?

178
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Ro Na.

179
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,559
I guess the police
didn't tell you...

180
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:26,800
in case it would influence
your statement.

181
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,640
Ro Na was alive.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
What happened?

183
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,040
Su Ryeon saved her.

184
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,619
She assumed the killer
would go after her again,

185
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,020
so she had been watching closely.

186
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,890
If she hadn't bribed a doctor
in advance,

187
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,959
something horrific
would've occurred.

188
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,999
Ro Na had to stay alive...

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,599
to prove Joo Dan Tae was
her assailant,

190
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,299
so she faked her death...

191
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,899
and transferred her
to another hospital.

194
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,449
Ro Na.

195
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,029
She's still not breathing.
Maybe it's too late.

196
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,599
No. Please don't give up.

197
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,400
We must save her. Let me take over.

198
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,429
Please don't die, Ro Na.
Open your eyes.

199
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,530
You must live for your mom.

200
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,870
She's breathing again.

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:15,839
Ro Na.

202
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,219
Ro Na.

203
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:02,920
Ro Na.

204
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,490
Do you recognize me?

205
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,260
Ms. Shim.

206
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,660
Good.

207
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:14,329
That's my girl.

208
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,439
Su Ryeon risked her life...

209
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,569
to save Ro Na.

210
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:43,390
Ro Na is waiting.

211
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,329
She's feeling a lot better now.

212
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,599
I'll bring her to you.

213
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,400
No.

214
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,599
She's alive. That's enough.

215
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,569
I'll meet her...

216
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,280
when I can face her...

217
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,109
without feeling ashamed.

218
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:07,479
Seeing her alive like this...

219
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:12,890
is more than I deserve for now.
I'm so grateful.

(Gangnam Police Station)

221
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,009
You could call it speculation...

222
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,938
if you're politically biased.

223
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,708
But in terms of
collective responsibility,

224
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:36,948
it's not speculation at all.

225
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,749
Also, I became an assemblyman
to bring about social justice.

226
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,889
Do you think I disposed of a corpse?
That's complete nonsense.

227
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,520
Assemblyman Lee, show some respect.

228
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,319
Who gives you
the right to yell at me?

229
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,490
Me? Did I yell at him?

230
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,428
No way.

231
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,799
Detective, just think about it.

232
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,899
We have such a high social position.

233
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,770
We have both fame and fortune.

234
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,739
How could we possibly
dispose of the dead body...

235
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,280
of a poor orphan
who had nowhere to go...

236
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,348
and destroy the evidence?

237
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,179
That's a crime, isn't it?

238
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,449
We're people of integrity.

239
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,519
Integrity, my foot.

240
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,188
Anyway, how long are you going
to talk about this kid, Min Seol A?

241
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,529
Who is it this time?

242
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,299
Who cooked up this story
and dragged us in it?

243
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,068
Who is it? Answer me!

244
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,099
I told you not to yell at me,
you punk!

245
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,140
Ms. Kang.

246
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,308
Who said that?

247
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,279
I cleaned the fountain that day?

248
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,179
I may scrub people's backs,

249
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:48,020
but I never do much cleaning.

250
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,920
There was emergency waterproofing
work at Hera Palace that day.

251
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,689
That's what the other residents
testified.

252
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,790
Is that when you transported
the dead body of Min Seol A?

253
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,568
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

254
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,169
There's a witness.

255
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,968
She saw all of you.

256
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,339
Who is she?

257
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,139
It's already been two years.

258
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,078
Who is this crazy woman
claiming that she saw us?

259
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,279
I'd love to see her face.

260
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,750
It's Ms. Oh Yoon Hee.

261
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:21,718
Ms. Oh already testified
that she saw you that day.

262
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,390
She really did?

263
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:26,219
That crazy witch.

264
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,030
How dare she turn her back on me?

265
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,800
- Ms. Kang.
- Why do you keep calling me?

266
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,949
Was it you? Did you frame us?

267
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,390
That day, I saw everything
with my own eyes.

268
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,890
The horrible things
that you did at the fountain.

269
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,328
As you know,

270
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,229
I was at Hera Palace that day.

271
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,370
But you were drunk
and couldn't remember anything.

272
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,969
That's not true.
I remember everything.

273
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,980
I remember everything
that happened that day...

274
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,709
very clearly.

275
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,749
Are you trying to frame me...

276
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,120
for something that
didn't even happen?

277
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,990
So what did you see?

278
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,058
Min Seol A killed herself.

279
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,228
She was devastated after being
abandoned by her own mom.

280
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,390
Seol A...

281
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,900
didn't kill herself.

282
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,240
I killed her.

283
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,209
Seol A was killed at Hera Palace...

284
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,280
by me.

285
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,390
What did you just say?

286
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,089
You killed Min Seol A?

287
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,760
Is that really true?

288
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,270
Does Su Ryeon know?

289
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,069
She does.

(Gangnam Police Station)

291
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,389
Sorry to interrupt your meal.

292
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,899
How does it feel to have killed
Na Ae Gyo with your own hands?

293
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,569
Shim Su Ryeon!

294
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,800
Are you really...

295
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,639
Shim Su Ryeon?

296
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,040
Are you?

297
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,408
You must have hoped...

298
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:02,809
that I'd never find out
about Na Ae Gyo.

299
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,050
Too bad.

300
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,649
I did, already two years ago.

301
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,020
That's when I realized
why you always forced me to wear...

302
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,030
only the clothes you bought me.

303
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,029
You had Na Ae Gyo
dress just like me...

304
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,058
and pretend to be your wife...

305
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,200
to use her for lobbying.

306
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,769
I was too busy
taking care of Hye In...

307
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,970
to meet any people, anyway.

308
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,579
You probably thought
no one would ever find out.

309
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,980
By using the daughter
of the Simoon Construction chairman,

310
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,919
it would've been no problem
manipulating big shots.

311
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:45,319
How come I didn't recognize you?

312
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,159
How could you possibly
fool me so completely?

313
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,128
Luckily for me,

314
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,930
I could find a ton of information
about Na Ae Gyo in Thailand.

315
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,369
For two years,

316
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,270
I lived more like Na Ae Gyo
than Na Ae Gyo herself.

317
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,369
I risked my life
to be able to get back...

318
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,780
and finally kill you.

319
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,149
How dare you fool me?

320
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,348
It creeps me out to think that you
were the beginning of all my misery.

321
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:20,618
You killed Seol A's dad,
pushed Seol A to the edge,

322
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,760
and even killed Ae Gyo.
On top of that,

323
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,990
you tried to kill Ro Na
when she was innocent.

324
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,899
I imagined ripping you to pieces
every single day.

325
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:34,638
How can a scumbag like you
still be alive?

326
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,839
I'm baffled
by the unfairness of it all.

327
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,909
Then shut your mouth
and keep complaining.

328
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:47,918
Let me tell you what.

329
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,990
Na Ae Gyo betrayed you long ago.

330
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,359
She was in love with Mr. Jung.

331
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,930
That's why she wanted to leave you.

332
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,829
That's complete nonsense.

333
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:06,940
What do you even know about her?

334
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,568
I'm the only man
she loved in her life.

335
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:13,409
She was ready to do anything for me.

336
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,480
Then why did you kill her?

337
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,250
Joo Dan Tae!

338
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,089
Mr. Jung!

339
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,530
What happened?

340
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,299
What have you told the police?

341
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,030
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through here?

342
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,270
Get me out of here right now.

343
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,379
Why should I?

344
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,680
If that's how you're going to be,

345
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,020
this isn't going to be fun.

346
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,196
Aren't you going to run
for the presidential election?

347
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,659
Does this mean that you're okay...

348
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,790
with me exposing...

349
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,159
your relationship with Na Ae Gyo?

350
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,559
Na Ae Gyo and I...

351
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:16,139
aren't in a disgusting relationship
like you think we are.

352
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,609
But how would a despicable man
like you know that?

353
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,750
You're garbage...

354
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,078
that's never been loved, after all.

355
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,619
Are you saying...

356
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,760
that you really loved my woman,
you dog?

357
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,609
Even after having everything
you've done,

358
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,308
I can't believe you have
the audacity...

359
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:55,780
to eat to live on.

360
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,389
Despite everything,

361
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,290
Na Ae Gyo was the only one...

362
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,790
who felt bad...

363
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,039
for someone as disgusting
as you are.

364
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,369
Killing that woman...

365
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,710
will be the biggest curse...

366
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,740
in your life.

367
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,550
There's nothing you can do now.

368
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,790
All of your money,

369
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,119
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung,

370
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,359
and the penthouse are all mines now.

371
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:49,700
Until you die, I hope...

372
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,440
that you'll rot
a pathetic death in jail,

373
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:54,300
Joo Dan Tae.

374
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,970
I'm going to do whatever I can...

375
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,180
until your misfortunes reach
their heights.

376
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,109
That's my loyalty...

377
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,980
to Na Ae Gyo.

378
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Get ready,

379
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Joo Dan Tae.

380
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,980
Jung Doo Man!

381
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,780
Shim Su Ryeon!

382
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,720
Mr. Baek!

383
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,389
What jerk is it this time?

384
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,760
Na Ae Gyo was right.

385
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,899
I heard you have a real name.

386
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,230
That's Mr. Baek?

387
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,339
Get out of there.
Bring it on, you jerk!

388
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,309
Talk to me face-to-face!

389
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,109
I don't have time for that.

390
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:07,740
I'm leaving for the US today.

391
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,510
The police are investigating
my parents there.

392
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,180
So, don't you get false hope.

393
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:17,690
I won't be cutting
any deals with you.

394
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,730
I'm going to make sure to expose
every last bit of you.

395
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:27,828
I'll show you that this isn't
the end, Joo Dan Tae,

396
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,500
no,

397
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Mr. Baek.

398
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,898
Doesn't it hurt?

399
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,269
(25 years ago)

400
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,700
It's bearable.

401
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,239
I need to leave a mark on myself...

402
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,120
so that you don't confuse me
with Shim Su Ryeon.

403
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,180
And why would that even happen?

404
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,849
I could find you
with my eyes closed. You're mine.

405
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,080
But why a butterfly, of all things?

406
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:22,565
You could've just gotten a mole.

407
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,119
To be reborn...

408
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,490
as a beautiful butterfly.

409
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:30,589
What do you think?

410
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,300
Beautiful, right?

411
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's stunning.

412
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,740
I'll make sure that you live
like Shim Su Ryeon.

413
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,210
As the happiest woman in the world.

414
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,179
You can hold on a little longer
until then, right?

415
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,480
For how much longer
do I have to wait?

416
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,520
It won't be long.

417
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:55,990
If I use Shim Su Ryeon's name right,

418
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,319
we'll become so rich that we could
suffocate under our piles of money.

419
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,490
I'll buy a house in Gangnam,
build a building,

420
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,559
and build a Joo Dan Tae Village...

421
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,729
on the land where my mother has
passed away on,

422
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,030
and make the whole world kneel
before me.

423
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:15,338
And we'll have children?

424
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:16,639
Of course.

425
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,079
We'll have a son and a daughter.

426
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,078
Our kids will live
in the most expensive home...

427
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,349
located on the highest level
in Korea.

428
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,480
The home that will be the closest
to the sky.

429
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,990
The penthouse.

430
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:33,990
Just thinking about it makes me
so happy.

431
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,270
So, Na Ae Gyo...

432
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,909
is really dead?

433
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:57,579
I...

434
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,550
killed...

435
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:02,950
Na Ae Gyo?

436
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,099
Mom would never do that.

437
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,459
How can she not want to see me?

438
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,669
She's my mom!

439
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,669
I must ask Mom myself.

440
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:14,619
Ha Eun Byeol!

441
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,770
Why? You look like you're looking
at a ghost.

442
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,109
What happened?

443
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,809
Why are you here?

444
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,079
You must've been hoping that I died.

445
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,149
I'm sorry I'm back alive like this.

446
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,779
Why did you do that to me,
Ha Eun Byeol?

447
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,149
Why did you try to kill me?

448
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,549
Did you hate me that much?

449
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,589
No, I didn't do anything.

450
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,520
I didn't do it!

451
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,559
I didn't think you'd admit it.

452
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,759
I feel bad for your dad...

453
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,800
for taking the blame
for someone like you.

454
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,599
But that won't make you innocent.

455
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,869
You'll be punished too.

456
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:01,940
Go away!

457
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:06,579
You're dead.

458
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:08,579
There's no place for you now.

459
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,950
Get out of my sight!

460
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,690
Are you okay?

461
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,388
You still have to be careful.

462
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:24,629
Let's get back to the hospital.

463
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,710
Ha Eun Byeol!

464
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:43,210
Where have you been
without telling me?

465
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,049
I told you to not go anywhere.
It's dangerous outside!

466
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,050
Ms. Jin!

467
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,950
I hate it here. I'm scared.

468
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,990
I'm scared to death.

469
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,259
Take me somewhere, anywhere.

470
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,259
I don't care where it is.
Just far away.

471
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,628
Take me somewhere
where nobody will find me.

472
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:05,700
Please, Ms. Jin!

473
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,139
You're really fine with anywhere?

474
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,079
Yes.

475
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,010
Wherever I don't see Bae Ro Na.

476
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,079
You poor thing.

477
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:25,119
Let's leave everything here and go.

478
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,030
Call me Mom from now on.

479
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,430
Call me Mom.

480
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,819
It's been a while, Shim Su Ryeon.

481
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:55,889
We meet, at last.

482
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,759
Could you give us a moment?

483
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,460
Are you sure?

484
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,829
That suits you so well.

485
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,200
Shut your mouth.

486
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,740
What have I ever done you so wrong?

487
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,479
The one who killed Min Seol A is...

488
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,908
Oh Yoon Hee, your favorite.

489
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,418
Compared to the disgusting thing
Oh Yoon Hee has done,

490
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,418
I've barely even shown my teeth yet.

491
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,089
You think...

492
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,259
Seol A is the only one
you've ever done wrong?

493
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,089
What, taking your husband from you?

494
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:37,828
You can have him back right now.

495
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:41,200
I will forever regret the fact
that I loved him for a moment!

496
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,269
How can you be so unapologetic
even at a time like this?

497
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,200
I've had my share of being punished.

498
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,769
Do you know what Joo Dan Tae did
to my family?

499
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,139
Do you want more?

500
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:56,050
What, you think I'll get on my knees
and beg you for forgiveness?

501
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,279
No, don't do anything.

502
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,089
I'm going to take over now.

503
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,020
I'll make sure that you regret
everything you've done so far.

504
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,089
You can just quietly sit around
and reap what you've sown.

505
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,769
Who do you think you are?

506
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,868
You think you rule the world?
You think you're the judge?

507
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:21,168
What right do you have to say that?

508
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:23,939
The only wrong I've done is
to live my life to the fullest.

509
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,579
All I've done is the best
for my daughter.

510
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,138
What's wrong with a mother
loving her daughter?

511
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,609
I'm innocent!

512
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,050
I won't let you be, Shim Su Ryeon.

513
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,750
I'll make sure to pay back for this.

522

What are you guys doing there?

524
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,559

into the Director's Office?

There he comes!

529
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,628
Do you admit to killing
Ms. Na Ae Gyo?

530
00:33:57,629 --> 00:33:59,499
No, I'm innocent.

531
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,769
Do you admit to kidnapping,
locking up, and beating...

532
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,999
Ms. Shim Su Ryeon and Bae Ro Na?

533
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,969
I've never done such a thing.

Do you admit to having lobbied
illegally...

535

536
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,539
You supposedly have a list
of politicians who received bribes.

537
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,979
Are you thinking of turning that in?

538
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,779
People may have taken money from me,
but I've never bribed anyone.

539
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,878
Why would I bribe people like them?

540
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,849
Do you plan on claiming innocence...

541
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,148
for today's trial
on Ms. Min Seol A's death as well?

542
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:23,088
I've done nothing wrong.

543
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:24,389
I'm innocent!

544
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,489
- Please answer us!
- Is it true...

545
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,059
- Over here!
- Will you admit...

546
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,858
I'm innocent. I'm clean.

547
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:32,560
I've done nothing wrong.

548
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,269
(Courtroom)

549
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:38,838
I'm not going to run away!

550
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,939
Seriously!

551
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,680
Let go! That hurts!

552
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,180
I can walk on my own.

553
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:00,559
Mom!

554
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,059
My goodness!

555
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,600
Mom is okay. Don't worry.

556
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,568
Min Hyuk! Have you eaten?

557
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:12,139
Don't worry about Mom.
I'll be just fine.

558
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,569
He's lost so much weight.

559
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,479
Attorney Kim, what class
is the judge from?

560
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,080
Eun Byeol...

561
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,350
(Defendants)

562
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,819
(Defendants)

563
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,899
Everyone, stand up!

564
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,748
(Judge)

565
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:55,910
You may take a seat.

566
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,059
Your Honor, I'd like to bring
Ms. Shim Su Ryeon as a witness.

567
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,589
(Seoul Central District Court)

568
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,529
- That witch!
- How dare you?

569
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,300
- How dare you?
- Su Ryeon!

570
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:17,768
What have we ever done wrong?

571
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:20,510
You're crazy!

572
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,280
Everyone, quiet.

573
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,339
(Defendants)

574
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,609
Please proceed.

575
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,350
(Witness)

576
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:33,589
On the day of the incident,
on your way down in the elevator,

577
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,890
you witnessed someone pushing
Min Seol A off, right?

578
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,830
And that person is...

579
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:43,160
Oh Yoon Hee. Is that correct?

580
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:49,530
(Gangnam Police Station)

581
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,300
Yoon Hee wanted me to pass this
onto you.

582
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,010
Su Ryeon, I have a favor to ask you.

583
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,850
Please come to the court
as the witness...

584
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:06,589
who saw Seol A die,

585
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,149
so that I may receive the punishment
that I deserve.

586
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,318
That's the only way for me...

587
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:13,229
to get justice on the rest.

588
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,660
Please.

589
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:18,200
Please testify.

590
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,499
Yes, that is correct.

591
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:26,538
- I knew it!
- Ridiculous!

592
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:28,969
How could that be?

593
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,108
How could she?

594
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:32,779
Oh Yoon Hee...

595
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,410
pushed my daughter Seol A
from the 47th floor.

596
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:39,220
I saw it clearly.

597
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:40,419
My gosh.

598
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,749
You really did it?

599
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:44,188
This is insane.

600
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:45,519
It is not insane.

601
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:47,059
It totally makes sense.

602
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,958
I knew it.

603
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:52,760
It's unfair to treat this murderer
the same as us.

604
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,299
You shouldn't compare us
to this evil villain...

605
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,370
who killed someone
so young as her daughter.

606
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,768
Your... Your Honor.
If you want to stone someone,

607
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:02,208
you should stone her.

608
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,280
What did we do wrong? Tell me!

609
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,910
I was about to sit down.

610
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,878
She killed a person...

611
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:11,120
and got her daughter into the school
in her place.

612
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,619
She even moved into
the apartment...

613
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,788
where the victim Min Seol A lived...

614
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,660
She even started a war
for her property...

615
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,789
several times its value.

616
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,759
She should get
an increased sentence.

617
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,830
If you have any shame,
say something, Oh Yoon Hee.

618
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,069
You acted like you were best friends
with Min Seol A's birth mom.

619
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,629
Do you have an honest bone
in your body?

620
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,939
Keep it down, will you?

621
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:35,469
If you cause a scene again,

622
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,109
I'll kick you out of the courtroom.

623
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Prosecution.

624
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,349
Joo Dan Tae.
Do you admit the charges?

625
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,788
I did not move the victim's body...

626
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:52,189
or set her home on fire.

627
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:54,288
You shouldn't take
a murderer's word for it...

628
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,389
and treat us like criminals...

629
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,600
Do you have proof?

630
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:01,469
Proof that we were involved
in Min Seol A's murder.

631
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,038
Korea's legal system is based on
evidence and trials.

632
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,870
This is in the Constitution.

633
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,469
I never did that either.

634
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,439
It was definitely the murderer
Oh Yoon Hee acting on her own.

635
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,310
I agree.

636
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,850
I swear on my daughter's name.

637
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,350
Me too. I'm innocent too.

638
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,959
Your Honor.

639
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:33,430
I'd like to submit into evidence
a video of the defendants...

640
00:39:33,629 --> 00:39:35,729
confessing to the crime.

641
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,898
It was not submitted in advance.

642
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:39,069
Please keep it out.

643
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,439
I'll accept it.

644
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:42,709
What?

645
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,509
Hey, you!
Do you know how much I pay you?

646
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,909
Do your job, punk!

647
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,410
I'm going to...

648
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,079
Silence in the court!

649
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,649
This is my final warning.

650
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,089
No! No.

651
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,559
Me. I'll go first.

652
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,530
That night...

653
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:10,640
All I did was wipe the blood off
the fountain.

654
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:13,309
That goes for me too.

655
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,139
Jenny's mom told me
to wipe the blood,

656
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,938
and that's all I did!

657
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:20,108
Stop it! This is a trap.

658
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:22,208
They're putting on a show
to get evidence!

659
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:25,349
Hey. Keep your mouth shut.

660
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,419
You can die for this alone!

661
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:28,789
I can't die.

662
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:31,859
That guy, Joo Dan Tae said...

663
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,060
we should dispose of the body.
I honestly...

664
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:37,329
only followed
what Joo Dan Tae said.

665
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,398
What a joke.

666
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:40,870
Lee Kyu Jin, you stupid scumbag!

667
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,168
The bag.

668
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:45,239
You brought the golf club bag
to put her body in!

669
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,239
That golf club bag.
We moved that in your car!

670
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,679
- And your ex-wife, this witch.
- What?

671
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,449
- She faked the girl's suicide note!
- What?

672
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,280
You two couples! You made it
look like it was suicide!

673
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:04,119
Those are false confessions
that we said under duress...

674
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,129
in order to survive,
thinking there was a bomb.

675
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,228
Shim Su Ryeon threatened us
at gunpoint.

676
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:13,568
That's correct.
If anyone moved the body,

677
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:16,599
it would've been Oh Yoon Hee,
who killed her!

678
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,800
We really didn't do anything.

679
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,169
This is unfair.

680
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,509
It's so unfair,
that it's killing me.

681
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,379
All we did that night was
enjoy the party.

682
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,089
They weren't fake confessions.

683
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,030
All of it is true.

684
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,289
What are you saying?

685
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,498
Hey. Don't do it. Hey.

686
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:48,068
Think about Eun Byeol.

687
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:50,100
Do you want both of us
to go to jail?

688
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,139
(Defendant)

689
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,248
That night, we took
Min Seol A's body to Bosuk Village,

690
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:02,850
and faked her cause of death.

691
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,990
We were afraid that she would
tell people that our children...

692
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:08,490
were assaulting other children.

693
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:13,189
We knew she was locked
in the mechanical room,

694
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:15,930
but we did nothing to help her.

695
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,330
We were all...

696
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,800
crazy.

697
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:28,309
You're the one who's crazy!
You're insane!

698
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,579
This is all gibberish.

699
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,009
Don't believe him!

700
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,478
- Sit down.
- The evidence is fake!

701
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,909
I didn't do it.

702
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,409
That jerk is lying!

703
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,249
- Let go! Stop it!
- Wait!

704
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,648
- Guards!
- It's a lie.

705
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:43,149
I did no such thing.

706
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,060
Stop lying, you jerk!

707
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:46,659
You jerk!

708
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,160
Let go of me!

709
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,729
Do you plan to push me off a cliff
and kill me?

710
00:42:57,169 --> 00:43:01,709
Yoon Chul. So your heart
belongs to Yoon Hee, doesn't it?

711
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,939
You wanted to take her side even if
you fell into the pit with her?

712
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:08,649
You don't care what happens to me,
is that it?

713
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,949
You're dead, you punk!

714
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,449
- You...
- I'll get you!

715
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,659
Ms. Cheon. Why are you so slow?

716
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,989

791
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,499

795
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:25,309
Tell them to kill him.

796
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,208

- Darn it.

808
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,538
Shut it.

809
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:54,208
My son! Min Hyuk!

810
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:56,539
My son! Min Hyuk!

811
00:46:57,879 --> 00:46:58,879
Mom.

812
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,049
Jenny. Madam. Please help me.

813
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,779
I can't go to jail
and leave Jenny by herself.

814
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,478
Please help me.

815
00:47:05,479 --> 00:47:06,479
Mom.

816
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:09,019
Why can't you go?

817
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,519
If you were afraid of prison,
you shouldn't have broken the law!

818
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,829
Even if you are one of my people,

819
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,858
I can't forgive you for doing that
to a child.

820
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:19,529
We'd readily spend
10 million dollars...

821
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,498
to get you out on bail,

822
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:24,398
but the Three Queens won't spend
a penny on something like this.

823
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,970
Don't use your child as an excuse.
It's sickening.

824
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,469
I'll look after Jenny.

825
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,580
No. Madam. Madam Chairman.

826
00:47:32,939 --> 00:47:35,978
- Please don't leave! Jenny!
- Mom!

827
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:38,248
How dare you sentence me to prison?

828
00:47:38,249 --> 00:47:40,719
Show some respect
for a former lawyer!

829
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,719
This is an attack...

830
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,688
on the rule of law in this country!

831
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:47,529
Let go of me!
Do you know who my father is?

832
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,489
Min Hyuk! My boy!

833
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,799
I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

834
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,530
This is humiliating.

835
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,700
Stop calling my name.

836
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,969
Where's Eun Byeol? How is she doing?

837
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,569
How should I know that?

838
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:02,538
Shame on you.

839
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:04,079
You've brought disgrace
upon your father.

840
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,938
How shameless of you
to ask about Eun Byeol.

841
00:48:05,939 --> 00:48:08,749
I'm sure she doesn't need
a mom like you.

842
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:13,719
Mom. Seo Young.
Please bring Eun Byeol to me.

843
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,619
Tell her I miss her.

844
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,359
Tell her I miss her so much.
Please...

845
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:22,160
Mom.

846
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,600
Mom.

847
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:30,600
Mom.

848
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:33,970
Mom.

849
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:38,410
Mom.

850
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,950
Mom.

851
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,450
Mom.

852
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,620
Mom.

853
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,060
Mom.

854
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:03,369
Joo Dan Tae, you were the worst man
I've met in my life.

855
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,568
What did you just say?

856
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:06,898
I wish I could gouge my eyes out
for not seeing how evil you are.

857
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:09,100
I wish I could curse my own heart
for falling for you.

858
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:11,669
You shouldn't be the one to talk.

859
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,179
Who was the one who jumped
into my arms, saying you're in love?

860
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,278
It was you!

861
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:18,979
I was never in love with you,
not even for a second.

862
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,218
From the start, you were nothing
but prey for me, Cheon Seo Jin.

863
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:24,318
Don't you dare to say my name
with that trashy mouth of yours.

864
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,789
- Cheon Seo Jin.
- Shut it!

865
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,519
- What are you going to do?
- Shut it!

866
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,330
You two are truly meant to be.

867
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:32,890
- What?
- What?

868
00:49:33,129 --> 00:49:36,258
I'm so sad that I won't get
to watch this anymore.

869
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:37,899
You brats!

870
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,599
What took you so long to visit
your father?

871
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,599
Is this how I raised you?

872
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,068
I gave you everything!

873
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:46,269
This is the best you can do?

874
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,480
You aren't our father anymore.

875
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,309
You're the man who killed...

876
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,591
both the woman who birthed us
and the woman who raised us.

877
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,649
We can't forgive you.

878
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,988
So, don't you speak to us
like we're your kids ever again.

879
00:49:56,989 --> 00:50:00,719
When did my son grow so big?

880
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,858
You think you can stay
on your high horse...

881
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:04,858
and deny the blood
that flows in you?

882
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:06,959
Even if the sky were to split
into two, you're my kids.

883
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,459
If I'm evil, you're a son
of an evil man.

884
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,330
If I'm a snake, you're a baby snake.

885
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,128
Give up on your paternal rights.

886
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:14,770
What? Give up on paternal rights?

887
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:18,169
From now on, our mother will be
our only guardian.

888
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,879
We're here to apply for a usurpation
of your paternal rights.

889
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,349
You can talk to our lawyer
about the rest of the process.

890
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,250
Who says you can do that?

891
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:29,349
You think anyone will take you
seriously without me?

892
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,718
I'm not giving a single penny
to either of you!

893
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:34,390
Do you even have money?

894
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:37,089
You have no money now.

895
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:40,029
I hear the penthouse is
already Mom's now.

896
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,929
Did you not know?

897
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,499
How dare you treat me like this?

898
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,000
You ungrateful brats!

899
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:50,210
Joo Seok Hoon! Joo Seok Kyung!

900
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,668
Is this how I raised you to be?

901
00:50:52,669 --> 00:50:54,409
Do you know how much I've done
for you two?

902
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,585
You don't deserve to be called
humans if you don't know!

903
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:59,309
I don't think you should be
so happy either.

904
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,648
You've been fired
from your Director position.

905
00:51:01,649 --> 00:51:02,649
That's fine.

906
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,619
You and I are nothing now.
Get out of my face.

907
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,520
I guess I won't have to keep
the secret now, right?

908
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,870
Eun Byeol is the only one
who knows, right?

909
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:22,540
That Eun Byeol's grandfather died
because of you?

910
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:29,540
It's too big of a secret
for someone young like me to handle.

911
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:33,149
I'll need to share it,

912
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,049
so I'm thinking of uploading it
on National Petition.

913
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,419
Seok Kyung,

914
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:45,989
Joo Seok Kyung,

915
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:49,830
no.

916
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,069
Do you see where you are now?

917
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,239
Seok Kyung, no.

918
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:01,108
We need to talk, Seok Kyung.

919
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:03,679
Seok Kyung! No!

920
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,548
- Please look here!
- Over here!

921
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:09,919
What do you have to say
about the murder?

922
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,549
Why did you admit everything?

923
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,290
I admit that I'm guilty
of having done all of it.

924
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,299
I may not ever be forgiven,

925
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,730
but I will live
the rest of my life...

926
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:25,169
asking Seol A for forgiveness.

927
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,590
Your Honor, before you announce
the verdict,

928
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,310
I'd like to say something.

929
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,080
Please speak.

930
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:41,980
Oh Yoon Hee has done
something unforgivable.

931
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:46,088
But she's the only one...

932
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:49,989
who has been there for my daughter,
who had nobody to rely on.

933
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:54,258
No, sir. I need money.

934
00:52:54,259 --> 00:52:55,959
You didn't even pay me last month.

935
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,430
Are you crazy?

936
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,699
Hey. Do you know how many plates
you broke?

937
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,969
Clean this up.
Clean everything now!

938
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:06,210
What do you think you're doing?

939
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,939
Don't you think it's wrong...

940
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,680
to have a young girl carry
those heavy grills?

941
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,918
This is child abuse.

942
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:15,679
I'm going to report you.

943
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,419
- Who are you?
- I'm her mom. Why?

944
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,189
Get up.

945
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:23,730
You can make money elsewhere.

946
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:26,999
Hey, lady. Are you crazy?

947
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,060
Hey! Get lost
before I call the police.

948
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,269
I'm sorry you lost your job
because of me.

949
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:36,839
I'll find another one.

950
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,278
Get something good with this.

951
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:44,278
It's okay, I have money.

952
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:46,410
It's because I feel so bad.

953
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:48,179
Take it, it's okay.

954
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,850
My daughter remembers her...

955
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,259
as a woman who was so kind
for nothing in return.

956
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,660
Not only so,

957
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:01,399
but she was also accused of murder
and served time in jail,

958
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,899
and has experienced what it's like
to lose her own daughter.

959
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:08,899
The law must judge her,

960
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:10,839
but I...

961
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,339
have already forgiven Oh Yoon Hee.

962
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:37,730
Seol A, you feel the same, right?

963
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,290
Everyone, please stand up.

964
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,560
I pronounce the verdict.

965
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:12,399
Since Defendant Oh Yoon Hee...

966
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:14,968
has admitted her wrong
and came clean on it,

967
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:16,798
was feeble-minded at the time...

968
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,439
but is now apologetic
of her wrong action,

969
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:23,679
and the family of the victim would
like favorable arrangements,

970
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,950
will serve three years in jail.

971
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:29,719
- Three years?
- Mom!

972
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:43,258
- Please tell us how you're feeling!
- Do you admit to everything?

973
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:45,568
Why did you admit to it all?

974
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:47,938
This is all a plot to bring me down!

975
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:49,369
It's a conspiracy!

976
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,508
My party won't stand this!

977
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:53,509
Hold on!

978
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,709
Jenny. Where's Chairman Song?
Where is she?

979
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,749
Please don't leave me.

980
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,778
Min Hyuk! My son!

981
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:02,249
My boy!

982
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,750
Let me talk to her.

983
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:06,319
My dear citizens!

984
00:56:06,649 --> 00:56:08,718
I will be back!

985
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:09,719
Mom!

986
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,789
I will overcome this tribulation...

987
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,729
and I shall be back!

988
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,269
The legal system of Korea
has fallen!

989
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,600
- Eun Byeol.
- Let go!

990
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,870
Eun Byeol!

991
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,639
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

992
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,399
Eun Byeol! I didn't do it!

993
00:56:24,939 --> 00:56:26,040
Eun Byeol!

994
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,449
I love you, son.

995
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,749
Make sure to eat regularly, okay?

996
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,219
Eun Byeol. I didn't do it.

997
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:38,219
Eun Byeol. My Eun Byeol...

998
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,830
Don't glare at me.

999
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:48,529
I can't stand this twerp.

1000
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,668
Mom!

1001
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:00,609
Mom!

1002
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,149
(Prisoner Transport)

1003
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:01,529
(Joo Dan Tae Village)

1004
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,569
I can do it alone.

1005
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,040
No, you can't.

1006
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,169
You haven't been here in a while.

1007
01:00:20,569 --> 01:00:22,439
I'm sure there's a lot
that needs fixing.

1008
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:29,980
Seok Kyung volunteered to help too.

1009
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,819
I did not.

1010
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:38,560
Did you hear about Eun Byeol?

1011
01:00:38,989 --> 01:00:40,830
She disappeared into thin air.

1012
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,700
She got scared and took off
since you came back.

1013
01:00:44,129 --> 01:00:45,930
I hope she never comes back.

1014
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,299
That shameless brat
gives me the chills.

1015
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:55,710
Hey! Ro Na! Get out here!

1016
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,720
What do you think you're doing?

1017
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,790
What are you two doing?
How childish are you?

1018
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,060
Are you two losers back together?

1019
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,559
You two need to snap out of it.

1020
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,629
This isn't the time to serve Ro Na.

1021
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:17,330
She's the reason our moms and dad
ended up in jail!

1022
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:19,870
- Jenny.
- Stay away from me.

1023
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:22,870
If your mom hadn't killed Seol A,

1024
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,839
my mom wouldn't have been locked up.

1025
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:28,239
I had no idea,
and liked your mom so much.

1026
01:01:28,879 --> 01:01:31,148
Do you know how heartbroken I was
when I thought you had died?

1027
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:33,109
How could you do this?

1028
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,750
You say you're my friend,
so why do you always hurt me?

1029
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,620
Why do you make it impossible for me
to be happy you're alive?

1030
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,059
I won't let this go, Ro Na.

1031
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,129
Do you know who our family is?

1032
01:01:45,629 --> 01:01:48,029
My grandpa said he'd get you back...

1033
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,200
for getting my dad fired.

1034
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:52,798
Fine. My mom did something terrible.

1035
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:53,899
I won't defend her.

1036
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:58,040
But you need to take responsibility
at least once for what you did.

1037
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,540
I'm ready to be punished...

1038
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,378
for hurting you.

1039
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:05,080
I won't forgive the jerks
who made my poor mom...

1040
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,310
miserable.

1041
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:10,219
You know how important she is to me.

1042
01:02:10,649 --> 01:02:11,649
Just you wait.

1043
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,649
My dad won't stand for it.

1044
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:14,989
She's right.

1045
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:17,730
Her dad is a very scary man.

1046
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:20,189
You're dead, Ro Na.

1047
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:25,469
You loser.
Worry about your own life.

1048
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:27,230
If Jenny's dad comes back,

1049
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:29,469
he'll kill you and me first.

1050
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,140
Don't mind them.
Let's finish unpacking.

1051
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,549
What are you looking at?

1052
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:48,859
I can't be a good person
because of you jerks.

1053
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:52,089
Let's go, Seok Hoon.
We're supposed to see Mom.

1054
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,160
Our Mom must be waiting.

1055
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:16,879
She gave birth to you.

1056
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:18,450
Have you...

1057
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:21,189
ever met her?

1058
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:23,489
Yes.

1059
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:25,759
What was she like?

1060
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:29,858
(Na Ae Gyo)

1061
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:31,799
She was really cool.

1062
01:03:33,169 --> 01:03:34,939
She never hesitated...

1063
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:36,569
and was loyal.

1064
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,939
She cherished and loved you guys
a great deal.

1065
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,210
Liar.

1066
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,580
But she never once came to see us?

1067
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:49,649
She had her reasons.

1068
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:53,390
I'll tell you later
after some time has passed.

1069
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:01,359
Where is Seol A?

1070
01:04:06,529 --> 01:04:08,000
I want to visit her.

1071
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,779
(Min Seol A)

1072
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,890
This trophy...

1073
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,560
is yours.

1074
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:39,969
Congratulations on winning
the grand prize, Seol A.

1075
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,439
(May you be a beautiful song in
paradise where there is no sadness.)

(Seoul Dongbu Detention Center)

1077
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:07,430
Mr. Chairman. Take it easy.

1078
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,799
Here, have this.

1079
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,910
There's a fun article in the paper.

1080
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,319
He who smiles...

1081
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:33,049
during hardship is
the most superior.

1082
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:34,689

Dad!

1088
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,108
My princess, how have you been?

1089
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:00,539
I'm back in Korea.

1090
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,779
Are you really back in Korea?

1091
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:04,338
Come home quickly!

1092
01:07:04,339 --> 01:07:05,679
My princess.

1093
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,250
I'll be home soon. See you.

1094
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,480
Bye.

1095
01:07:12,819 --> 01:07:14,290
Hello, sir.

1096
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:16,189
(Reformation, Order)

1097
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,560
Where's the punk now?

1098
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:30,039
Ladies and gentlemen, our flight,
which departed from JFK Airport,

1099
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,139
will land at Incheon International
Airport shortly.

1100
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,679
Please remain seated...

1101
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,479
- Are you going to propose?
- With seat belts fastened...

1102
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,148
- and raise the window shades.
- The rings.

1103
01:07:39,149 --> 01:07:41,008

You made a great choice.
They look gorgeous.

1106
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:47,419
You think so?

1107
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,060
Thank you.

1108
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:53,629
I guess Korea has changed a lot.

1109
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,830
It sure has.

1110
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:01,100
I'm excited
because it's been so long.

1111
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,509
I finally get to meet
my old friend again.

1112
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:09,279
I'm glad I lived...

1113
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:12,279
to meet him again.

1114
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,620
Mr. Baek.

1115
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,730
Su Ryeon, where are you?

1116
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:28,759
I just got back.

1117
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,399
Already?

1118
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,569
I was getting impatient,
so I couldn't wait any longer.

1119
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:38,138
I'm back in the penthouse too.

1120
01:08:38,139 --> 01:08:40,370
I'm busy organizing all the stuff.

1121
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,040
The kids must be excited.

1122
01:08:44,179 --> 01:08:46,479
Well... I'd love to see you.

1123
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:49,149
Can we meet soon?

1124
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,889
I have something to tell you too.

1125
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:56,459
I'm going to my store soon.
Should we meet there?

1126
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,790
Sure, let's do that.

1128
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,688
Hi. I'm here.

1129
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:28,689
Me too. I just arrived.

1130
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:30,559
I'm in the parking lot.

1131
01:09:31,489 --> 01:09:34,028
Can you come out for a second?

1132
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:35,700
I'll be right there.

1133
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,880
Can I go have a smoke first?

1134
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:00,120
- I'm a little nervous.
- Sure, go ahead.

1135
01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:51,870
Goodness. My bad.

1136
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,609
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1137
01:12:31,269 --> 01:12:33,709
I'll save her. I'll set her free.

1138
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,278
We'll take Seol A's revenge
together.

1139
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,178
Do you think I deserve a new life?

1140
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:40,308
I can't forgive myself
for leaving for the airport first.

1141
01:12:40,309 --> 01:12:41,778
I don't know you.

1142
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:42,978
I know it's you!

1143
01:12:42,979 --> 01:12:44,789
I'm sorry it took me
so long to recognize you.

1144
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,648
Why are you here?
You could get caught.

1145
01:12:46,649 --> 01:12:48,289
The last promise I made to Seol A...

1146
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:50,590
I want you to be happy.

1147
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,760
I'll make you happy.

The highlight of the 28th
Cheong A Art Festival.

1150
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,199
The recipient of the Grand Prize...

1151
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,369
Bae Ro Na? Can't you give in
a little for Seok Kyung?

1152
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:06,009
I really love my daughter a lot.

1153
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,209
You don't love Mr. Joo!

1154
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:09,909
I'll do whatever you say,
So please leave Eun Byeol alone.

1155
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:12,308
Don't you remember what happened
to Su Ryeon?

1156
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:14,449
Is this how you train your help?

1157
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:16,619
Who dares to insult Ms. Jincheon?

1158
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,148
I'm sorry. Ro Na, please don't die.

1159
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:21,589
I need you in order to find
Ro Na's real murderer.

1160
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:25,058
I have a great plan
to finish off Dan Tae.

1161
01:13:25,059 --> 01:13:27,129
Na Ae Gyo died last night.

1162
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:28,928
No way! That's impossible!

1163
01:13:28,929 --> 01:13:30,829
She wasn't Na Ae Gyo.
She was Shim Su Ryeon.

1164
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:32,398
Su Ryeon saved Ro Na.

1165
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:34,068
I'm here to turn myself in.

1166
01:13:34,069 --> 01:13:37,039
Looking over here and over there

1167
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,470
Whoever dares to betray me will die.

1168
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,809
So that I could kill you.
