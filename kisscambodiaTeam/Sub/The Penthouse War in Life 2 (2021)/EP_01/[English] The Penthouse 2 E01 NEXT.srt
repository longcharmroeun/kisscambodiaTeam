AND BACKGROUND OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

THE 28TH CHEONG A ART FESTIVAL

00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,572
THE 28TH CHEONG A ART FESTIVAL

6
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:47,512
The highlight of the 28th
Cheong A Art Festival,

7
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:50,783
the recipient of the Grand
Prize, given to the singer...

8
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,713
who has the most-divine voice, is...

00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:02,292
THE 28TH CHEONG A ART FESTIVAL
GRAND PRIZE IN SINGING CATEGORY

00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:05,832
Grade 12 of Cheong A Arts High School...

11
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:13,632
Over there!

12
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:15,942
- Oh, my!
- No!

13
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,283
Who's that?

14
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:43,533
FOUR MONTHS AGO IN NEW YORK

15
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,972
EPISODE 1

16
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,712
Bravo!

17
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:18,793
Thank you for the invite.

18
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,663
Thank you for coming.

19
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,003
The Korean-Americans here chose you...

20
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,432
as the person they'd like to
meet the most, Director Cheon.

21
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,742
- Indeed.
- Of course.

22
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,112
You know that my wife is a
huge fan of yours too, right?

23
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,513
I'm honored.

24
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,643
You're stunning, ma'am.

25
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:38,513
You have no idea how hard our
organization worked to have you.

26
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,253
We pulled every string we could.

27
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:44,353
Why didn't Chairman Joo come with you?

28
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,253
He had something important.

29
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:50,022
He was very sad he couldn't come with me.

30
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:54,402
We reserved the best suite in this hotel...

31
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,103
because we thought you were coming with him.

32
00:03:57,973 --> 00:04:00,332
I heard that you two are
getting engaged soon.

33
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,212
Congratulations!

34
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,013
It's him.

35
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:13,082
I guess he's dying to know what's going on.

36
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:15,483
Please excuse me for a moment.

37
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:24,933
I should've been there to watch
your beautiful performance.

38
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,193
It's too bad.

39
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:29,563
I know. You should've
taken the day off for me.

40
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,602
I was amazing today.

41
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:35,573
It's for Cheong A Art Center,
which is just as important.

42
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,172
I can't just overlook it.

43
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:40,573
But you know that I'm always
thinking of you, right?

44
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:43,183
How's the construction going?

45
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,282
You better be excited.

46
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:47,722
I'm going to build a perfect
opera house, just for you.

47
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:49,352
What are you doing next?

48
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,753
I'm so tired that I might just pass out.

49
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,953
I'm flying back on the
first flight back to Korea.

50
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:55,592
All right. See you at home.

51
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:57,323
You must've been nervous
about your performance.

52
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:59,532
Having a little drink isn't a
bad idea for a night like this.

53
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:03,602
- I love you.
- I love you too.

54
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:30,592
Who are you?

55
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,402
It's been a while.

56
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,433
You...

57
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,143
What brings you here?

58
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,943
I had business to take care of in New York.

59
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:49,313
Did you perform? I guess you're staying here.

60
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,782
Yes.

61
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:56,652
You look good.

62
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,993
It's so strange to see you here.

63
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,563
- How long has it been?
- About two years.

64
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,263
Go to your suite. You're drunk.

65
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,513
Are you still alone?

66
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,162
Do you want me to walk you to your suite?

67
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:33,243
Goodness.

68
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,643
Did you forget something?

69
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:06,733
Who are you?

70
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,772
Why are you doing this?

71
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,643
Looks like you put your
hands on the wrong woman.

72
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:13,772
Who sent you?

73
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,113
Was it Joo Dan Tae? Jerk.

74
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,613
Break his hands.

75
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,393
No more surgery for you, doc.

76
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:32,932
Throw him in the water.

77
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,263
No. No.

78
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:37,772
No!

79
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:44,572
Good work.

80
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,113
Make sure there are no problems later.

81
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:53,483
Ha Yoon Chul.

82
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,723
Why did you do that?

83
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:25,952
Eun Byeol.

84
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:27,922
Are you going to school already?

85
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,952
It isn't even 7am yet.

86
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,322
Did you forget? The
practical exam is tomorrow.

87
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:34,253
I have to stop by the studio before school.

88
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,562
I rushed home to have breakfast with you.

89
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,863
My performance in New York...

90
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,202
Was amazing, I'm sure.

91
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,532
Tell me about it later.

92
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,593
Are you back yet?

93
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,123
Come for breakfast.

94
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,123
I'll be waiting.

95
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,822
TO: CHEON SEO JIN

96
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,253
DIE! JUST DIE!

97
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:51,932
This came again.

98
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,802
She has taken it too far.

99
00:12:57,873 --> 00:12:59,672
It's too sick to even talk about.

100
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:02,743
I'm sure it's Oh Yoon Hee.

101
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,113
She's the only one...

102
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:06,152
who would do this.

103
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:10,552
Calm down. It may not be her.

104
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,353
A lot of people envy you.

105
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:13,922
Do you know how many times
this happened already?

106
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,093
They couldn't take this risk
unless it was for revenge.

107
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,993
I feel like I'm being watched too.

108
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,463
You know too.

109
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,333
As long as Yoon Hee is alive,

110
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,003
we can't be completely free.

111
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,103
She went missing over a year ago.

112
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,713
She still hasn't been caught.

113
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,843
She either died...

114
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:34,213
while running or hiding.

115
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,013
- It's one or the other.
- I won't believe it...

116
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,682
until they find her body.

117
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:41,652
Are you keeping a close eye on her daughter?

118
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:43,623
She's a murderer and fugitive's daughter.

119
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:46,493
The police are watching her 24 hours a day,

120
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,393
and I put someone on her too.

121
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:49,522
Don't worry.

122
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:53,093
If she can't come to see
her one and only daughter,

123
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:54,833
she must be dead.

124
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,932
- But...
- Stress is bad for you.

125
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,343
You've been way too on edge lately.

126
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,113
What is this?

127
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,643
Did you cook yourself?

128
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,312
I missed you a lot.

129
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:13,753
You look especially beautiful today.

130
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,422
Thanks.

131
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,322
How was the party?

132
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,253
Did you get drunk?

133
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:23,593
Did anything happen?

134
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,393
No, nothing.

135
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:30,162
I drank enough to get a happy buzz.

136
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,942
The real estate policy...

137
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:46,412
that throws non-homeowners into despair...

138
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:49,422
must be eliminated!

139
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,952
- It must be eliminated!
- It must be eliminated!

140
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:55,192
Ministers who own multiple
houses must repent...

141
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:59,333
step down as ministers immediately!

142
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,133
- Step down!
- Step down!

143
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,072
On the fifth day of my hunger strike,

144
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,103
one citizen...

145
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:12,743
wrapped this scarf that she
knitted around me and said...

146
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:16,743
her lifelong dream was to own her own house.

147
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,182
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE KYU JIN

148
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:21,152
I, Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin...

149
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,223
REAL ESTATE POLICY

150
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:27,093
I'll make your dream come true!

151
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,662
ASSEMBLYMAN LEE KYU JIN

152
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:35,902
Like the morning dew

153
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,062
All together!

154
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:43,843
That endured the long night

155
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:51,812
On the leaves

156
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:58,123
More beautiful than pearls

157
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:00,623
I...

158
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,593
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Honey!

159
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:07,893
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Assemblyman Lee!

160
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,833
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Assemblyman Lee!

161
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:12,133
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Assemblyman Lee!

162
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,373
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Assemblyman Lee!

163
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,513
- Assemblyman Lee!
- Assemblyman Lee!

164
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,542
Like the morning dew

165
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,743
- Assemblyman Lee!
- You can't die like this!

166
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,383
- Assemblyman Lee! Please breathe!
- Wake up!

167
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,623
Assemblyman Lee! You can't pass away!

168
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:31,282
I'm starving.

169
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,192
I start shaking if I skip even one meal.

170
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,562
I've set it all up already.

171
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,633
Mother sent seafood chicken
soup, japchae, grilled shrimp...

172
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,503
All of your favorites. Eat.

173
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:44,402
How long must I keep up
this stupid hunger strike?

174
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,833
It's freezing out.

175
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,902
I'm going to get sick.

176
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:50,072
This is pathetic.

177
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:52,473
Your acting was incredible today.

178
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:55,983
Since you fainted, we can end it naturally.

179
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,952
If we loosen restrictions
and let apartments go up...

180
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,853
and make banks give loans easily,

181
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,353
it'll solve everything.

182
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:04,322
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,722
You made me do this garbage
on purpose, didn't you?

184
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:08,523
To make me suffer.

185
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,422
That's not it. It was to
make up for your mistake...

186
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,063
during the inspection...

187
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,563
I guess you never make mistakes.

188
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:16,303
I guess not.

189
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,633
Then you should be the assemblyman.

190
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,672
- Hey, you.
- Stop it.

191
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:24,343
He's trying hard. Look at him.

192
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,182
He has no respect for me
because it's my first term.

193
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,452
I have the fifth-largest
assets among assemblymen.

194
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,853
Do you know...

195
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,152
how hard it is to save that much
while living with integrity?

196
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:38,293
Honey. That's enough. Look at this.

197
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:39,652
There's an article.

198
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,662
Chairman Joo and Cheon Seo
Jin are getting engaged.

199
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,533
They're getting remarried after
cheating on each other's spouses.

200
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,533
Why are they announcing
their engagement now...

201
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:51,972
like it's the love of the century?

202
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:55,902
Cheong A Foundation and J
King Holdings are merging.

203
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:59,242
So their stock prices shot up today.

204
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:07,452
Hey. Did I or did I not
say let's buy that stock?

205
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,452
How could an assemblyman not know that?

206
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,252
You. Get over here.

207
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,422
I told you to tell me.

208
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,452
Did you buy it?

209
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:16,293
I went all in.

210
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,563
You little freak. Hey.

211
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:22,363
You were a nobody, and I gave you a career.

212
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:24,502
Get out. Get lost.

213
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,172
Go home. Go!

214
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,103
- Get lost!
- I'm sorry.

215
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,402
Why you...

216
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,942
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL

217
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,422
Hi, Eun Byeol.

218
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,662
Give me your bag. It must be heavy.

219
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,523
My dad brought me this chocolate.

220
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:51,732
Eat it while you study.

221
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,303
Eun Byeol. This is the latest.

222
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,972
My mom got it for you
from the department store.

223
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,133
You look extra pretty today.

224
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,202
Your face is brighter than my future.

225
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:06,073
Eun Byeol. Let's hang out at
my dad's hotel after school.

226
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,712
No. I have a lesson today.

227
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,212
Then want to go to a
restaurant with me tomorrow?

228
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:12,682
No, I'm busy.

229
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:15,152
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL

230
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:18,353
STAFF RESTROOM

231
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,002
Unbelievable.

232
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,902
"Chairman Joo Dan Tae of J King Holdings..."

233
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:37,472
"and Director Cheon Seo Jin of
Cheong A Foundation are engaged?"

234
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:40,113
I didn't see this coming.

235
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,313
Here they come.

236
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,442
Unbelievable. Your father
announced his engagement today.

237
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,952
It's become a top story.

238
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,353
Seok Kyung, how does it feel to
become sisters with Eun Byeol?

239
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:51,722
Who will be the big sister?

240
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:54,492
Who says we're sisters? That's disgusting.

241
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,323
What's disgusting about it?

242
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,762
Do you hate my family that much?

243
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:07,002
I couldn't be happier to be sisters with you.

244
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,172
I really look forward to it.

245
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,583
Is she out of her mind?

246
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:18,482
Calm down.

247
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:28,793
- What?
- You stepped over the line.

248
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,123
I stepped over the line.

249
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:40,402
LOSER'S SEAT

250
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:44,143
BAE RO NA

251
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:47,043
Look, that's her.

252
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,583
It's her, right? The murderer's daughter.

253
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,252
- How disgusting.
- I'm creeped out.

254
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,682
That's you, right?

255
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:01,823
This is crazy. How can you be so shameless?

256
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,922
You're a murderer's daughter.

257
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,932
So creepy.

258
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:09,333
Her mom stabbed a person to death.

259
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,603
She must have the psychopath gene too.

260
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,873
She's a potential criminal.

261
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,843
We'd better stay away.

262
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:23,283
Are you serious?

263
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:27,712
Get lost. Go away.

264
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,323
Go away!

265
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,722
- Oh, my.
- Look at that.

266
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,363
Is everyone here?

267
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,033
It seems like it.

268
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,273
You guys will be seniors next year.

269
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:52,573
The Seoul National University
prep course starts today.

270
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:55,783
Come back here after school. Also...

271
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,323
Here are competitions that
you can write about...

272
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:03,922
in your student record
and cover letter later.

273
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,353
I've prepared a plan so
that the prizes can be...

274
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:10,393
fairly distributed among you.

275
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:11,422
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL'S
COMPETITION SCHEDULE

276
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:16,232
They're organized by the school
under the director's protection.

277
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:18,902
You guys just have to do as I say.

278
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,303
Now, go to your seats and
start filling out applications.

279
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,942
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL
COMPETITION APPLICATION

280
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:35,252
Moving on.

281
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,623
Chairman Joo Dan Tae of J King Holdings...

282
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,652
has announced his engagement...

283
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,962
to Director Cheon Seo Jin
of Cheong A Foundation.

284
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:44,192
It's been said that they
were seeing each other...

285
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,563
casually for a while...

286
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,662
but recently decided to get married.

287
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:50,202
According to a J King Holdings employee,

288
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,472
after Chairman Joo's ex-wife, Ms. Shim,

289
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,702
was murdered at Hera Palace last year,

290
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:58,002
- Director Cheon comforted him...
- Good afternoon.

291
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,442
"Good afternoon"?

292
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,573
- The company hopes the public...
- Hey.

293
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,883
- will support their new start.
- Who are those people?

294
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,053
Are you really a murderer's daughter?

295
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,152
I mean, are you this woman's daughter?

296
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:17,492
Hey, get out of here. Right now.

297
00:23:17,692 --> 00:23:19,333
Get out of here.

298
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:20,992
Go away.

299
00:23:21,563 --> 00:23:23,303
Leave! Get lost.

300
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:25,232
Ro Na, can we talk for a minute?

301
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,202
Have you heard anything from your
mom? When did you last see her?

302
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:29,402
- Please say something!
- Ro Na!

303
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,912
- She didn't pick up her phone.
- Say something!

304
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,912
- Ro Na!
- Wait!

305
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:40,553
You've all heard about our engagement, right?

306
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,123
Congratulations, Mr. Joo.
Congratulations, Mom.

307
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,192
Thanks.

308
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,692
Thanks, Eun Byeol.

309
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,393
Most of all, I hope you guys will get along.

310
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,893
Why wouldn't we?

311
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:55,563
Will we be living in the penthouse too?

312
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,232
I love this place.

313
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,472
Don't you two have anything to say?

314
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:02,803
No, I don't.

315
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,373
Excuse me.

316
00:24:06,373 --> 00:24:08,583
Sit back down. We're not finished yet.

317
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,883
Don't you know?

318
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,313
I get an upset stomach if
I eat with someone I hate.

319
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:15,922
Joo Seok Kyung!

320
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:20,823
Eat up. The steak turned out amazing.

321
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:37,843
Get up.

322
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:41,073
Don't be so childish.

323
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:44,212
This is not only a marriage
but also a business deal.

324
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,712
You getting on my nerves
will do no good to your dad.

325
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:52,492
You're so creepy.

326
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:55,262
Does my dad know you're like this?

327
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:57,593
Don't interrupt me. It's rude.

328
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,293
Now that you've become my family,

329
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:02,563
I won't put up with your
disrespectful behavior anymore.

330
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:05,732
Too bad.

331
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:09,242
If you were a little smarter, you
wouldn't have behaved this way.

332
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:13,143
I wish your mom had taught you better.

333
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,883
Don't talk that way about my mom.

334
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,613
You're the one who should watch your mouth.

335
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:22,783
It might have been different before,

336
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:26,922
but I will never let you ruin my reputation.

337
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,432
Behave yourself, Seok Kyung.

338
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:52,853
How do you like the lemon charlotte?

339
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:55,212
I heard that it's your
favorite, so I tried making it.

340
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:57,583
Did you make it yourself?

341
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:01,893
It tastes lovely.

342
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:04,863
Is there anything you're bad at?

343
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:07,533
You come from a prestigious
family, make a ton of money,

344
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:11,133
and are good-looking. And
you're a good cook too?

345
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,902
I'm glad that you like it.

346
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:18,402
By the way...

347
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:33,793
When my mom isn't around, you
don't have to try so hard.

348
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,093
What?

349
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,962
I'll tell her that you're nice to me.

350
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:39,863
So loosen up a bit.

351
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,863
Seeing you try so hard to win my heart,

352
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:44,662
I feel so sorry for you.

353
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,313
Something doesn't feel right.

354
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,482
Maybe I'm just being oversensitive.

355
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,732
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.
YOU WILL BECOME MISERABLE.

356
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,262
YOU CAN NEVER BE HAPPY. DIE.

357
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,363
YOU HAVE THE VOICE OF A DEMON!

358
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,432
DIE, CHEON SEO JIN!

359
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:23,373
DIE!

360
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:33,083
DIE!

361
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,083
Secretary Do is checking
the security camera footage.

362
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:41,023
He hasn't found any suspicious visitors yet,

363
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,462
but I have a bad feeling.

364
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:45,023
How could this happen right after
our engagement was announced?

365
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:49,333
This person is right under my nose.

366
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,773
What if it's Oh Yoon Hee? What if she's back?

367
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:55,603
She's on the run. She couldn't
approach us so easily.

368
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:57,402
Then who did this?

369
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,313
We'll find out.

370
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:01,712
I'll tighten up security.
Don't worry too much.

371
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:04,043
Why did you have to take
away Oh Yoon Hee's house?

372
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,982
Couldn't you stop at having
her bank accounts seized?

373
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,053
When she finds out her daughter is
moving from one place to another,

374
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,523
wouldn't she become
determined to get back at you?

375
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,252
If I hadn't accused her of embezzlement,

376
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,393
I would have gotten in huge trouble.

377
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:14,823
You know that I had no choice.

378
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,262
Still,

379
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:19,692
you should have left Bae Ro Na alone.

380
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:23,662
A mom who has lost everything
would fear nothing.

381
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,373
You...

382
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:33,472
made a mistake.

383
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,182
Do you think...

384
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,692
I asked you to take care of
her to be treated this way?

385
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,692
You keep disappointing me.

386
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,363
How am I going to trust you again?

387
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,762
I'm sorry, sir. I'm really sorry.

388
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,333
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

389
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,333
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

390
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,972
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:09,412
NO LITTERING

392
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:25,893
Why are you here?

393
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:27,732
You went to see your mom, didn't you?

394
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:29,363
Where did you meet her?

395
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:31,103
Who gave you this?

396
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,702
Is it your mom?

397
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,472
You went to see your mom, didn't you?

398
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,742
No!

399
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:37,543
Where is she?

400
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,143
You better tell me now!

401
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:40,873
I really have no idea.

402
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:42,883
If you find out where she is,

403
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,212
let me know too.

404
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,012
Stop coming to me!

405
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:47,752
When are you going to stop?

406
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:51,383
Until your mom, that murderer appears,

407
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,952
you'll never be able to escape
the hands of the Chairman.

408
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:58,523
If you're caught contacting your mom...

409
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:01,133
or meeting her,

410
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,803
I'm going to kill you.

411
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,932
Do you understand?

412
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:16,212
What am I supposed to do?

413
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,742
I have nowhere else to go.

414
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:21,712
Even if I get beaten to death,

415
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:25,023
I'd like to see my mom before I go too!

416
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,833
That idiot!

417
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,162
Why did she let her take her sandwiches?

418
00:30:36,462 --> 00:30:37,833
So stupid!

419
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,373
Yoo Jenny.

420
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,512
What are you doing here?

421
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:50,682
Are you guys following me?

422
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,512
I told you that something was odd.

423
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,652
I knew something was up when
she came in late every day.

424
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,652
You completely fooled us.

425
00:30:58,652 --> 00:30:59,652
Tell us.

426
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,152
Have you been hanging out
with Bae Ro Na all this time?

427
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:03,692
Well...

428
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,333
That's not it.

429
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:10,262
Did you buy her sandwiches and food too?

430
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:12,162
Tell us!

431
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,133
Yes, I'm friends with Ro Na!

432
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,002
Don't you guys feel bad for her?

433
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,942
Both of her parents are gone!

434
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:22,212
She's the daughter of the
murderer who killed my mom.

435
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,242
I lost my mom because of her.

436
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:27,283
But that's not Ro Na's fault.

437
00:31:27,283 --> 00:31:30,452
So you're saying, you're on Ro Na's side.

438
00:31:31,482 --> 00:31:33,652
I'll be telling Mr. Ma...

439
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:36,662
that you won't be in the
SNU prep course anymore.

440
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,492
Eun Byeol!

441
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,452
DIE!

442
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:37,823
DIE!

443
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,662
That witch!

444
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:50,863
Get away from Chairman.

445
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,773
Joo Dan Tae is my man.

446
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,672
I won't let anyone take him.

447
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:00,972
Die! Die, Cheon Seo Jin!

448
00:33:01,843 --> 00:33:02,942
Die!

449
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,452
Die, Cheon Seo Jin!

450
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:08,912
Ms. Yang, you're here!

451
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,593
Director Cheon,

452
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:18,462
what brings you here?

453
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,393
My goodness.

454
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:26,672
I thought the white sneakers looked familiar.

455
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:29,303
It was you, indeed.

456
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,242
Do you think you can curse me with some toys?

457
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:37,613
Do you think Chairman can
become yours with that?

458
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:41,212
Please forgive me, Director!

459
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:43,982
Please don't tell Chairman that I did this.

460
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:46,722
I can't live without Chairman.

461
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:49,262
We don't have time to be
bothered by someone like you.

462
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,563
Just get out of this house right now.

463
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:53,992
If I see you again,

464
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,462
you won't make it out of the house alive.

465
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,773
No, I can't leave.

466
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:02,472
Please forgive me, Director.

467
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:07,373
If I have to die, I must die in this house.

468
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:10,742
Nobody except for Chairman can get rid of me.

469
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:15,882
Once I marry Chairman, I'll own the house.

470
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:18,983
It'll be in my right to
fire you and get rid of you!

471
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,802
I shouldn't be the one leaving.

472
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,072
It's you,

473
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:40,813
Cheon Seo Jin.

474
00:34:41,673 --> 00:34:42,742
What?

475
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,242
I...

476
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:47,353
have lived with Chairman...

477
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:51,123
for 20 years.

478
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:52,653
Goodness.

479
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:54,893
The way Chairman looks at me,

480
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:57,222
his breath,

481
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:00,963
and every hair on his body.

482
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:04,333
I remember them all.

483
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:09,132
I can die...

484
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:11,273
for this man.

485
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:13,572
Joo Dan Tae is mine.

486
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,083
I won't let anyone take him!

487
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:21,583
My goodness.

488
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:23,583
Chairman!

489
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:26,893
You haven't fixed that habit of yours yet?

490
00:35:27,353 --> 00:35:30,322
I've just let you be
since you've done so much,

491
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:34,063
but I'll make sure to fix that
crazy habit of yours today.

492
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,702
I have no reason to live if it isn't for you.

493
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,972
"You"?

494
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,103
I...

495
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:48,242
love...

496
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:52,782
you to death, Chairman.

497
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,012
Get her away.

498
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,793
No, Chairman! I can't leave.

499
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:02,762
Chairman! Don't desert me!

500
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,293
Chairman!

501
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:06,793
- My goodness.
- You can't get rid of me.

502
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:10,802
I feel a little sad that I can't have...

503
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,162
Ms. Yang's spicy braised monkfish.

504
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:16,342
DIE!

505
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,842
Who did this, then?

506
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,412
We'll find out.

507
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:20,412
There's one person...

508
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:22,842
that comes to mind.

509
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:24,742
Joo Dan Tae.

510
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:28,882
What a smart man you are.

511
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:34,092
Right. Did the PR Team
publish the engagement news?

512
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:36,463
Why? Is something wrong?

513
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:37,992
I want them to reword the statement...

514
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:40,963
that I'll become the CEO
once the two companies merge.

515
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:43,733
- What do you mean?
- When Cheong A Group is made,

516
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:47,403
you will be the CEO, of course.

517
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,003
I think I'll be busy...

518
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:52,543
making Cheong A Art Center
a world-class opera theater.

519
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:55,412
I'll ask them to fix that.

520
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,143
What are you doing tonight?

521
00:37:00,313 --> 00:37:01,313
Why?

522
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:04,123
Just curious.

523
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,080
Hello, Chairman.

524
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,790
I thought he passed out
because of his hunger strike.

525
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:29,400
Why is he sleeping at my office?

526
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:33,101
You make me come all this way and appear now?

527
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,071
You can't call a civil servant
up as you please like this.

528
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,040
Come on.

529
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:41,711
Have you forgotten already?

530
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:44,741
Remember who got you that badge?

531
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:47,211
Half of your votes were from me.

532
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:48,510
You know well.

533
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,851
The price of Hera Palace
properties went to dust...

534
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,851
thanks to your wife's death,

535
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,860
and I was the one who
pulled the prices back up.

536
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,190
Remember that?

537
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,260
If I didn't become an assemblyman,

538
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:04,561
Hera Palace wouldn't have
gotten the prices back up...

539
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,601
to 150,000 dollars per 3.3m².

540
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:10,170
Isn't that thanks to Seo
Jin's announcement...

541
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,870
of building the second Cheong A
Medical Center in Samseong-dong?

542
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:15,241
That's true.

543
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,750
But don't you think your
business is doing too well?

544
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:21,950
You've made it so big out of nothing.

545
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:25,691
Let's be honest here.

546
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,221
Thanks to Shim Su Ryeon,

547
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,661
your wealth multiplied.

548
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:36,101
I guess luck follows when
you're a righteous man.

549
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,000
Whatever. Just cut to the chase.

550
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,441
What is it? A complaint?

551
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,911
No, not that. This is very important.

552
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:15,301
FIGHTING CRIMES TOGETHER,
MAKING A SAFE SOCIETY

553
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:20,671
RIGHTEOUS POLICE

554
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:47,271
Surprise!

555
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,840
Congratulations on your marriage!

556
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,940
What's all this?

557
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:03,850
Dan Tae.

558
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:06,850
- Here you go.
- What do you think?

559
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:18,600
I feel like I've finally found my soulmate.

560
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,301
I'd like...

561
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,470
to dedicate the rest of my life to you.

562
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,310
I love you.

563
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,280
He's like a prince!

564
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,491
Did you get Assemblyman Lee
just to propose? He's busy.

565
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,320
Exactly.

566
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,590
I put serving the people
behind and came right here.

567
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,090
What are you doing? Accept it already.

568
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:51,900
His knees are going to wear out!

569
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,900
Get up.

570
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,141
Put it on me yourself.

571
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,271
This isn't your first proposal.

572
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,840
You're an experienced
one. How can you not know?

573
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:09,581
Here.

574
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,720
It's beautiful.

575
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,060
I love it.

576
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:20,791
Thank you.

577
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,031
Joo Dan Tae!

578
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,140
You're being arrested for
Shim Su Ryeon's murder.

579
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,570
What did you just say?

580
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:37,481
What do you mean?

581
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,681
He's suspected of murder?

582
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:43,120
What do you think you're doing?
Why would I kill my own wife?

583
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,820
Please come with us to the office.

584
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,921
Let go! Why would I do that?

585
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:50,161
Dan Tae!

586
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:51,620
Why would I do such a thing?

587
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,861
I would never!

588
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:56,361
What's going on?

589
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,270
This will surely be an unforgettable day.

590
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:02,401
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

591
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:06,971
We're Chairman Joo's defense counsel.

592
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:09,440
Why did you arrest him?

593
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,440
There has been a report.

594
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,781
What report?

595
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:16,651
That Chairman Joo was the one
behind Shim Su Ryeon's murder.

596
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,890
So, who made that nonsense report?

597
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:22,991
The first witness and Chairman Joo's maid,

598
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:26,460
Yang Mi Ok.

599
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:29,700
Yang Mi Ok!

600
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:33,770
You brought me all the way
here just with her report?

601
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,500
You're ready to face the consequences, right?

602
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,640
I can't stand this inhumane investigation.

603
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:42,981
You'll be sure to suffer the consequences.

604
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,940
Where's Yang Mi Ok right now?

605
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:47,310
I'd like to request a cross-investigation.

606
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,750
Ms. Yang...

607
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:52,421
has died.

608
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,820
What did you say?

609
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,291
Ms. Yang...

610
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,390
was found dead at her home an hour ago.

611
00:43:01,531 --> 00:43:03,161
We believe she poisoned herself to death.

612
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:07,471
I have loved Chairman
Joo Dan Tae all my life.

613
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,440
If I can't have him, I will destroy him.

614
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,171
That way, nobody can have him.

615
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:17,810
It is Joo Dan Tae who killed Shim Su Ryeon.

616
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,981
I'm sorry to Oh Yoon Hee.

617
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,830
Ms. Yang pointed to you...

618
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,531
as the murderer.

619
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:36,560
What?

620
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:40,671
She also made an apology to Ms. Oh Yoon Hee.

621
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:45,140
It sounds like she had a grudge against you.

622
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,570
I don't believe this.

623
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:51,181
Ms. Yang doesn't have the guts to break me.

624
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,880
- It's her.
- Sorry?

625
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,991
All of this was plotted by Oh Yoon Hee.

626
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,921
I bet Oh Yoon Hee killed Ms. Yang.

627
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,991
Make sure to apply for an
autopsy as soon as possible.

628
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,731
We need to confirm that it's a suicide.

629
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,630
If there are traces of people
having gone into her home...

630
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,531
and if her suicide note was forged...

631
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:15,770
Hold on!

632
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,810
Oh Yoon Hee?

633
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,120
Why is...

634
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,120
Oh Yoon Hee here?

635
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,830
INVESTIGATION DIVISION

636
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:45,161
Oh Yoon Hee!

637
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,950
Tell me. Why are you here?

638
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,020
What happened?

639
00:45:09,161 --> 00:45:11,060
Where have you been hiding?

640
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,190
Why are you pulling all of this nonsense for?

641
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:15,830
Ma'am, please stop.

642
00:45:16,401 --> 00:45:19,601
You did this, didn't
you? You killed Ms. Yang!

643
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:21,830
You plotted all of this nonsense!

644
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,370
- Tell me right now!
- Please stop.

645
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:27,341
Ms. Oh has already turned herself in.

646
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,380
Turned herself in?

647
00:45:29,681 --> 00:45:30,911
Let's go.

648
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,871
I didn't kill Shim Su Ryeon.

649
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,871
You can ask me over and over again,

650
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,511
but my answer won't change.

651
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,781
I can bet my daughter's life on it.

652
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,891
My goodness!

653
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,490
Ms. Yang left a suicide
note and killed herself?

654
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:20,090
How can Chairman Joo be the murderer?

655
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,060
Does that mean Oh Yoon
Hee isn't the murderer?

656
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,970
Just one suicide note can't
make someone a murderer.

657
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:30,200
That's horrifying.

658
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,440
There's no way Chairman
Joo would've done that.

659
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,171
She was his wife!

660
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,110
That means Oh Yoon Hee was
wrongfully imprisoned...

661
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,251
and became a fugitive.

662
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:43,621
So you are saying, Ms.
Yang from the penthouse...

663
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:46,421
named Chairman Joo as the
murderer and killed herself.

664
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:47,791
Right?

665
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,820
I never said this before,

666
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,860
but it never made sense
that Oh Yoon Hee killed...

667
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,830
Shim Su Ryeon.

668
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,230
Chairman Joo makes sense.

669
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,100
He took her entire fortune...

670
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:02,301
when she died.

671
00:47:07,871 --> 00:47:09,141
Oh Yoon Hee had requested...

672
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:11,541
a meeting with Ms. Yang, the
first witness at the scene.

673
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,350
And when the police went to her home,

674
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,810
Ms. Yang was dead already.

675
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,281
That witch Oh Yoon Hee killed her.

676
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:20,320
Or she paid someone.

677
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,621
I suspect the same, but
things look bad right now.

678
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,891
Since Ms. Yang named you
as the murderer and died,

679
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:28,761
they'll reopen the case.

680
00:47:29,401 --> 00:47:32,060
You will be the new
suspect. It's unavoidable.

681
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,541
If word gets out that your
people assaulted Ms. Yang,

682
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,810
you may be accused of murdering her as well.

683
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,210
Then what?

684
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,041
Should I just take it?

685
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,551
One good thing is,

686
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:50,921
they found photos that prove
Ms. Yang stalked you...

687
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,521
and defamed Madam were found in her home.

688
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,090
That psycho.

689
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,490
She never understood her place.

690
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,891
This is...

691
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,060
an opportunity.

692
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,801
Let's do this.

693
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:10,871
I'll say that...

694
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,641
Breaking news. The real murderer...

695
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:20,480
of the Hera Palace murder was revealed.

696
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,950
The murderer, Yang, was the
maid who worked for the victim.

697
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,820
She had been stalking Chairman
Joo, the victim's husband,

698
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,720
and had a deep grudge against
her regarding her pay.

699
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,230
This was revealed after Oh Yoon
Hee, who had been on the run...

700
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,631
for a year after being accused of the murder,

701
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,131
- turned herself in.
- No way.

702
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:42,570
- Ms. Yang killed her?
- Yang left a suicide note...

703
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,301
apologizing to Oh Yoon Hee...

704
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,271
and died in her home.

705
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:47,840
What happened?

706
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,740
The police state Yang...

707
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,110
Is it true?

708
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,281
Did Ms. Yang really kill our mom?

709
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:54,710
- The police...
- Did she?

710
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,251
will reopen the case and
investigate thoroughly.

711
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:59,751
Since the murderer Yang...

712
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,590
POLICE TO REINVESTIGATE HERA PALACE MURDER

713
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:13,330
What happened?

714
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,001
Ms. Yang is the killer?

715
00:49:15,001 --> 00:49:17,470
How could you frame her for it?

716
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,470
Stop talking. I haven't slept a wink.

717
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,110
Explain yourself!

718
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,240
I'm going crazy too.

719
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,580
I was about to become the target.

720
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,651
We were able to resolve it this easily...

721
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:30,381
thanks to her mental illness.

722
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:32,251
Do you know how much money I spent...

723
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:34,921
on five lawyers making sure
Ms. Yang was the murderer?

724
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:36,121
Yoon Hee is alive.

725
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:37,121
So?

726
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,490
This was the only way to get rid of Yoon Hee.

727
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,301
Yoon Hee is innocent again now.

728
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,261
What do you want from me?

729
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,771
If I didn't frame Ms. Yang for being crazy,

730
00:49:46,771 --> 00:49:48,271
I would've been found guilty of murder.

731
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:50,401
Must I go to jail? Will that make you happy?

732
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,970
That's not what I mean.

733
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:54,641
If...

734
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,610
Ms. Yang didn't kill herself...

735
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,450
Even if Oh Yoon Hee killed her,

736
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,820
it'll only hurt me if we dig into it.

737
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,121
I'm grateful beyond words...

738
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:08,751
that Oh Yoon Hee isn't obsessed
with finding Su Ryeon's real killer.

739
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:14,560
Even the public sentiment is
moving in Yoon Hee's favor.

740
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,830
Someone must be helping her.

741
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,100
Who?

742
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,141
The suspicions about the
Hera Palace murder...

743
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:26,810
do not end here.

744
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,681
The police did not find Oh
Yoon Hee's fingerprint...

745
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:33,610
on the forged family
picture found in her home.

746
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,480
Is this for real?

747
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:37,651
She was framed?

748
00:50:37,651 --> 00:50:38,950
She's innocent?

749
00:50:39,181 --> 00:50:40,921
What's wrong with you?

750
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:42,251
Why are you watching TV here?

751
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:44,291
- What's your problem?
- When did you come?

752
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,291
Yang was jealous of Shim.

753
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:50,360
Storeowners in the area
stated that she went around...

754
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,200
acting like she was...

755
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,001
the owner of the penthouse.

756
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:55,700
What's more shocking is,

757
00:50:55,901 --> 00:50:59,301
the last person she spoke
to on the phone was Yang.

758
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:04,240
Why did the police ignore
this big piece of evidence?

759
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,240
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

760
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,381
Oh Yoon Hee, who was branded
a murderer for a year,

761
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:10,950
has requested a retrial.

762
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:14,350
Since the real murderer has been revealed,

763
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:17,990
it is presumed that she
will be found not-guilty.

764
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,990
The police and justice
department will be unable...

765
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,931
to avoid being criticized...

766
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:26,901
for being incompetent both in
their investigation and decision.

767
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:05,141
I saw you every day in my dreams.

768
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,110
My baby looks the same.

769
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:15,411
You too.

770
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:30,031
I...

771
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,330
knew you didn't do it.

772
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,600
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

773
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:39,911
I'm so sorry.

774
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:42,911
I'm so sorry.

775
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:45,881
Mom...

776
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,350
Mom...

777
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,381
Mom...

778
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:56,261
Mom...

779
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:45,401
Are you home?

780
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,110
We spoke earlier.

781
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:50,480
You said you were looking for a gig worker.

782
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,230
Just a minute.

783
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:14,131
Hello.

784
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:20,311
This is all your mom's fault.

785
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,811
The chairman is angry because your mom fled!

786
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:25,311
If you die, your mom will show her face.

787
00:54:25,311 --> 00:54:28,450
If her daughter dies because of her,

788
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,121
she'll show up for sure.

789
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:32,480
Die! Die!

790
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,490
Die!

791
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:50,800
You were alive, Oh Yoon Hee.

792
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,071
Wasn't it enough that you framed me?

793
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:56,510
Why are you trying to kill my
innocent daughter too? Why?

794
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,811
That way, you'll show up.

795
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,681
If your daughter dies because of you,

796
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,891
you'd show your face even if
it were from the underworld.

797
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,790
Did Joo Dan Tae tell you to kill me?

798
00:55:16,931 --> 00:55:18,030
Goodbye,

799
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh Yoon Hee.

800
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:36,720
- Logan.
- I said not to go anywhere alone.

801
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,381
Why did you show up without my permission?

802
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:41,351
I had no choice. Ro Na was in danger.

803
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:42,921
I'll protect Ro Na.

804
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:46,661
I'll kill everyone who hurt children.

805
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:55,431
Ms. Yang!

806
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:57,000
What are you doing?

807
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:58,571
Ms. Yang.

808
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,710
Ms. Yang!

809
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:05,540
I should've...

810
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,720
taken her with me.

811
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,831
I'll go ahead and wait for you, Chairman.

812
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,270
I'll...

813
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,280
Is she dead?

814
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:43,421
Go to the police station and
turn yourself in right now.

815
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:46,790
Ask for a cross-investigation with Ms. Yang.

816
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:48,891
I'll take care of the rest.

817
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,460
I HAVE LOVED CHAIRMAN JOO DAN TAE...

818
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,561
ALL MY LIFE. BUT...

819
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,540
IT IS PAINFUL TO LOVE SOMEONE
WHO DOES NOT LOVE ME BACK.

820
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:11,311
IF I CAN'T HAVE HIM, I WILL DESTROY HIM.

821
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:20,220
DIE!

822
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,690
I HAVE LOVED CHAIRMAN
JOO DAN TAE ALL MY LIFE.

823
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,091
IT IS JOO DAN TAE WHO KILLED SHIM SU RYEON.

824
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:24,391
I HOPE HE WILL BE EXECUTED
AND SENT TO ME SOON.

825
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,861
Mom...

826
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,371
Mom...

827
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:10,700
Is that right?

828
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:14,341
Make sure that she leaves the country. Okay.

829
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,581
She's fleeing abroad?

830
00:58:19,881 --> 00:58:21,181
Oh Yoon Hee?

831
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:25,351
What if she comes back?

832
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:27,690
You can forget about her now.

833
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,821
She's been through so much.

834
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:32,260
She must want to leave everything behind.

835
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,161
We can finally get on with our lives.

836
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,530
We'll have an engagement
ceremony as planned...

837
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:44,371
and establish Cheong A Group.

838
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,710
You'll take over the musical
world as the greatest prima donna.

839
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:53,141
We'll build a happy family
that everyone envies...

840
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,010
and love each other for the
rest of our lives, okay?

841
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:09,230
What's wrong?

842
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,371
Nothing. Eun Byeol's
lesson will be over soon.

843
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,671
I should get going.

844
00:59:16,671 --> 00:59:18,500
She's not a kid anymore.

845
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:20,510
Don't you think you're
a little overprotective?

846
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,480
If you're being jealous, please don't.

847
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,911
How we raise our own
children is off-limits, okay?

848
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,470
I must be out of my mind.

849
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:58,581
You're out of your mind, Cheon Seo Jin.

850
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,111
Get it together.

851
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,450
Get it together.

852
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,161
3 MONTHS LATER

853
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:19,121
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

854
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:23,861
Ms. Cheon, you look stunning.

855
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,230
Who'd think you're getting
married for the second time?

856
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:29,071
Everyone would think you're 20.

857
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,571
How can Chairman Joo be so lucky?

858
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:33,540
At your age, you could have
gotten married right away.

859
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,710
Why bother to get engaged?

860
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,740
It's an important time for our children.

861
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,510
Also, with all my upcoming
concerts, I couldn't find the time.

862
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,280
Don't you get it?

863
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,081
Marriage is a business deal too.
It has to be handled carefully.

864
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,020
When their companies are merged,
there will be stock problems.

865
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,020
And it'll be complicated
to calculate alimony.

866
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,020
Do you know how much money...

867
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,831
Dr. Ha ripped off her when they got divorced?

868
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:57,200
Why would you bring that up today?

869
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,861
There's no one else here anyway.

870
01:01:59,861 --> 01:02:04,200
Let's face it, Chairman Joo
doesn't deserve Ms. Cheon.

871
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:06,841
Is there anyone in this country who
doesn't know Cheong A Foundation?

872
01:02:06,841 --> 01:02:10,480
Chairman Joo totally lucked out this time.

873
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:15,780
So when are you getting married?

874
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,220
Nothing's been decided yet.

875
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,050
I want to take my time
and get to know him well.

876
01:02:23,421 --> 01:02:25,220
Maybe I'll end up not marrying him after all.

877
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,411
You look beautiful.

878
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,421
- Congratulations.
- Why do you look so tired?

879
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,621
- Congratulations, Mr. Joo.
- Thanks.

880
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,760
It's a beautiful thing to watch.

881
01:04:16,431 --> 01:04:17,940
What's that?

882
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,490
Well, how have you all been?

883
01:05:43,921 --> 01:05:45,460
Are you in the middle of something?

884
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:55,000
Why do you look so surprised?
Am I not allowed here?

885
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:02,540
Oh, I'd like to introduce my wife,

886
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:04,740
Oh Yoon Hee.

887
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,260
It's been a while.

888
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,161
Congratulations on your engagement, Seo Jin.

889
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:57,931
THE PENTHOUSE 2

890
01:06:58,131 --> 01:07:00,401
<i>Are you saying you really got married?</i>

891
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:02,030
<i>Watch how you speak about my woman.</i>

892
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:03,631
<i>You're not the same Ha Yoon Chul of old.</i>

893
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:05,901
<i>It's an honor to be invited to Hera Club.</i>

894
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,371
<i>Are you here to see Ro Na?</i>

895
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:09,411
<i>Did you forget who died in the penthouse?</i>

896
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:12,210
<i>Let's both be happy with
our respective families.</i>

897
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:14,411
<i>You may never sing again.</i>

898
01:07:14,411 --> 01:07:16,611
<i>This concert must be perfect...</i>

899
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:18,121
