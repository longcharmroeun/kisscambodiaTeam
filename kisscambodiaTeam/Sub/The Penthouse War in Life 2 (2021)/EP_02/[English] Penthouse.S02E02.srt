00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,985
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,956
Are your legs made of jelly?
Why are you all over the place?

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,410
Who says so?

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,279
It's your engagement party
tomorrow. Are you ready?

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:22,250
Do you need any help?

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,125
No, but thanks for the offer.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,605
Right. Unit 4502 has been sold.

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,359
Really?

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,035
Does that mean
I'll finally have a neighbor?

10
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,776
That's great!

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,170
What kind of a person are they?

12
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:41,015
It's a bit of an unlucky suite
with Oh Yoon Hee and all.

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,485
Did the person buy the suite
without knowing that?

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,616
Chairman Joo recommended it
to him.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,455
He's the CEO of an American
biopharmaceutical company.

16
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,756
Is he Korean?

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,655
Or Korean-American?

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,595
He's Korean.

19
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,990
The company's name is JohnBIO.

20
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,689
Oh my. JohnBIO?

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,606
Looks like Hera Palace's prices
will rise again!

22
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,676
How do you know about JohnBIO?

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,445
Their sexual enhancer is a huge hit.

24
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:13,146
My husband uses it all the time.

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,069
It works so well.

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,510
You know I'm alone.

27
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:22,750
Are you teasing me or what?

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,346
Let's finish it up here.

29
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,045
Should we?

30
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:48,245
My mind is all over the place
with the engagement tomorrow.

31
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,010
Great work, reporters.

32
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,849
You must be extra nervous since it's
your 20th-anniversary concert.

33
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,979
I didn't expect to
hear you go off-pitch.

34
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,120
I guess my throat is dry.

35
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,335
You won't publish it, will you?

36
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,489
Of course not.

37
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,230
Did you prepare anything special
for this performance?

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,299
The industry is expecting you
to do something new.

39
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,840
I won't disappoint.

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,599
Bye now.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,969
- Secretary Do!
- Yes, ma'am.

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,449
He better not write
a ridiculous article again.

43
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,795
Let's go from there again.

44
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,189
Hitting a high F won't be possible
in this condition.

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,789
You should head home.
It's your engagement tomorrow.

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,806
Performing is more important
than my engagement.

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,629
You know that this is the most
important performance of my life!

48
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,469
I can do it.
Play from the last part.

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,509
Well, how have you all been?

50
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,449
Are you in the middle of something?

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,889
Why do you look so surprised?

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,860
Am I not allowed here?

53
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,730
Oh, I'd like to introduce my wife,

54
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,769
Oh Yoon Hee.

55
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,209
What?

56
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,339
It's been a while.

57
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,369
Congratulations
on your engagement, Seo Jin.

58
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,720
Your wife?

59
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,220
Did I hear it wrong?

60
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,759
Are you saying you two got married?

61
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,360
So, Dr. Ha, you're saying
that your wife is Oh Yoon Hee?

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,459
You two?

63
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,446
What's this surprise?

64
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,675
How could you get involved
with her, of all people?

65
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,545
Exactly. Of all women,

66
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,545
why a possible murderer?

67
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,415
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes?

68
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,939
I see you talk as much as always.

69
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,009
But that's enough.

70
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,350
It's impolite to question something
that the law has already...

71
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,019
concluded.

72
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,259
But... What about Ro Na?
Did she come too?

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,759
Nice dress.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,259
It looks good on you.

75
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,670
I don't remember inviting you
to my engagement party.

76
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,170
Don't get the wrong idea.

77
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,939
We had some business at the hotel,
that's all.

78
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,209
Still.

79
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,079
It's nice to see you again.

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,050
Dr. Ha.
I almost didn't recognize you.

81
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,766
Didn't you say you were conducting
some research in the US?

82
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,060
Well... Being a doctor
wasn't the right fit for me.

83
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,266
So I started a small business.

84
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,290
A business?

85
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,699
That's even a worse fit.

86
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,329
You two didn't start...

87
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,745
seeing each other when you lived
in Hera Palace, did you?

88
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,910
Definitely not.

89
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,680
I don't do things like that.

90
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,226
We met in the US. By chance.

91
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,250
Dr. Ha.

92
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,319
This is quite rude.

93
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,065
This is a happy day.

94
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,396
You came on purpose
to ruin it for us.

95
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,819
We really stopped by
on our way somewhere.

96
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Well... I apologize
if we caused an interference.

97
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,259
See you around.

98
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,029
Congrats, Eun Byeol.

99
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,769
You have a stepmom too.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
A super famous one
from the news, at that.

101
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,339
Don't look at me like that.

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,410
I like you all of a sudden.

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,850
Don't we feel closer now?

104
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,220
The feeling is mutual.

105
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,560
Eun Byeol!

106
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,189
Eun Byeol! Where are you going?

107
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,100
Murderer.

108
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,476
How dare you show your face here?

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,477
Seok Kyung!

110
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,776
I don't believe
that you're innocent.

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,545
Ms. Yang would've never
killed my mom.

112
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,470
You killed her.

113
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,855
My mom was so good to you.

114
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,009
Why did you kill her? Why?

115
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,579
I was sad because everyone seemed
to have forgotten...

116
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,120
all about Su Ryeon.

117
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,589
I feel good knowing
you remember your mom.

118
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,329
Let's go.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,829
I won't fall for it.

120
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,540
Murderer. Demon!

121
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,170
That brat.

122
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,839
How did she change so much?

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,860
I already thought...

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,629
seven million dollars was too much
in alimony for you.

125
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,415
What more are you trying to get,
that you show up in a chopper...

126
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,240
and designer clothes,
trying to look like you matter?

127
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,286
If Oh Yoon Hee was...

128
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,610
all you could think of
to get under Seo Jin's skin,

129
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,950
I'm very disappointed.

130
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,125
It's quite a novel approach,

131
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,549
but this is where it ends.

132
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,820
If you show your face again...

133
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,730
Let go!

134
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,440
Stop.

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,740
Hey. Shall we go?

136
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,379
Sure.

137
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,025
Are you okay?

138
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,149
Of course.

139
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,299
What happened?

140
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,505
He should've been fish food.

141
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,005
Why is he still alive?

142
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,500
They said they took care of him.

143
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,139
You loser.

144
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,879
Find out if Ha Yoon Chul
and Oh Yoon Hee really are married.

145
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,679
Find out everything she did
over the past three months.

146
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,830
Do you like it?

147
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,206
We couldn't go far this time
because of your concert,

148
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,269
but once it's over,

149
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,840
let's go to Italy for a few days.

150
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,139
Sound good?

151
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:32,259
Our engagement is
public information now.

152
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,870
There's no reason to delay
the merger.

153
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,476
I'll hire an M and A expert
next week...

154
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,240
- and form a special...
- What's the rush?

155
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,385
I'm busy this year with concerts.

156
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,489
That's why we got engaged
instead of getting married.

157
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,596
- Does it bother you?
- What?

158
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,389
You've been thinking only about
that jerk Ha Yoon Chul.

159
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,620
I did not.

160
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,820
I know you.

161
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,336
I'm trying my best
to make you happy,

162
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,635
but your mind is elsewhere.

163
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,535
He ruined our engagement party.

164
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,600
In front of everyone from
Hera Palace and our VIP guests.

165
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,700
I don't know what they're up to.

166
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,470
Do you think...

167
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,080
Yoon Hee reconnected with Logan
in the US?

168
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,686
They could've brought Yoon Chul in
to get revenge on us.

169
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,820
It's not him.

170
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,620
Logan is pretty much
on house arrest right now.

171
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,895
I'm in touch with his father
constantly.

172
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,759
If they are not involved...

173
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:37,429
Are you saying
they really got married?

174
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,476
That's ridiculous.

175
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,860
They were each other's first love.

176
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,446
The losers must have formed a pact.

177
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,940
He wouldn't get married easily
at least because of Eun Byeol.

178
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,645
And what? Business?

179
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:50,189
I wired him 10 million dollars
when the land in Myeongdong sold.

180
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,615
10 million dollars? When was that?

181
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,639
A year ago.

182
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,525
He'd never stop being a doctor.

183
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,379
He doesn't have the guts
to do business...

184
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,690
nor the greed.

185
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,596
We got engaged today!

186
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,789
How long will you talk
about Ha Yoon Chul?

187
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,905
Can't you leave it to me?

188
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,799
Do you have that little faith in me?

189
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
Sorry...

190
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,070
for yelling.

191
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,039
I must've been upset
because of Eun Byeol.

192
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,720
Ha Yoon Chul. Oh Yoon Hee.

193
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,120
They have nothing to do
with my life anymore.

194
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,789
I'll never see them again.

195
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Are you okay?

196
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,519
Ms. Kang. What is it?

197
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,289
Ms. Cheon. This is huge.

198
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,029
The new resident of Unit 4502...

199
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,730
is Oh Yoon Hee.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,629
It's Dr. Ha and Oh Yoon Hee.

201
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,700
What do you mean?

202
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:00,299
That's...

203
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,039
Let's talk later.

204
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,480
Yoon Hee is back.

205
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,919
What?

206
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,549
In Hera Palace.

207
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,250
What do you mean?

208
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,889
Yoon Chul is the one
who bought unit 4502!

209
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,129
Ha Yoon Chul?

210
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,389
How could he...

211
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,730
Wait. JohnBIO?

212
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,456
That's ridiculous.

213
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,409
Why didn't you check and confirm?

214
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,586
How could you approve the sale?

215
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,456
How could I have known? It was
bought in the corporation's name.

216
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,395
You should've been thorough.

217
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,525
Weren't you having Yoon Hee watched?

218
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:53,235
Didn't you consider the fact
that the two of them could meet?

219
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,436
Must I keep tabs on
your ex-husband too, now?

220
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,865
This is my fault too?

221
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:59,806
You're incompetent!

222
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,559
You need to admit it.

223
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,005
Then you should've kicked him out...

224
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,446
to some hinterland where
he could never return.

225
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,370
Don't you know what I did to kick
Yoon Hee out of Hera Palace?

226
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:13,309
Don't you know what I did
to get her out of my sight?

227
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:16,549
And she's back.

228
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,580
Because of you.

229
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,655
If you had taken care
of Ms. Yang properly,

230
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,995
Oh Yoon Hee wouldn't have
been acquitted.

231
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,159
That's all in the past now.

232
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,096
Even if she's back, what can she do?

233
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,360
All her properties have been seized.

234
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,635
She may have been acquitted,

235
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,135
but her label as a murderer
will never go away.

236
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,230
Ha Yoon Chul is the CEO of JohnBIO!

237
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:41,139
And Oh Yoon Hee is his wife!

238
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,179
I must have underestimated
Oh Yoon Hee.

239
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,379
I have to go back.

240
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,796
What can you do?

241
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,096
We freed up our time to be here.

242
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,995
We can't let those scum
ruin our precious time.

243
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,659
It's already ruined.

244
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,830
I can't trust you anymore.

245
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,629
I'll handle everything myself.

246
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,460
Darn it!

247
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,046
What is it?

248
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,580
I found out why Dr. Ha
came back to Korea.

249
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,926
He's the actual owner
of the American startup, JohnBIO.

250
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,409
Why are you
telling me that now, you jerk?

251
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,120
Gosh!

252
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,505
No way. It can't be.

253
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,460
Power Up was developed
by Ha Yoon Chul?

254
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,946
The CEO of JohnBIO, one of
the three people I respect the most,

255
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,240
turns out to be the loser,
Ha Yoon Chul?

256
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,916
This is humiliating.

257
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,816
His time in the US seems to have
done him a lot of good.

258
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,355
He has this successful
businessman's vibe to him now.

259
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,355
When his company goes public,
the stock prices will soar.

260
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:01,320
Will he make it to the penthouse
on the 100th floor before us?

261
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,066
You're right.

262
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,895
Even the Gangnam assemblyman is
still around the 50th floor.

263
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,730
How did Oh Yoon Hee get so lucky?

264
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,405
Do you think I'm not going up there
because I can't afford it?

265
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,176
It's because the voters are
not happy about it.

266
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,606
- Didn't Dr. Ha look so stylish?
- I know.

267
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,805
That Italian suit
looked perfect on him.

268
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,545
Was he always that good-looking?

269
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,785
That's why a man needs to
meet the right woman.

270
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,985
- He's become so sweet and gentle.
- Exactly.

271
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,785
I heard that they're
each other's first love.

272
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,785
If Ms. Cheon hadn't stolen him,

273
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:32,420
they would have gotten married
and lived happily.

274
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,789
This is such a huge blow
to Ms. Cheon, isn't it?

275
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,825
Serves her right.

276
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,495
Imagine how jealous she must be.

277
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,936
Why would she be?

278
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,005
She's getting married to
Chairman Joo soon anyway.

279
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,035
Women are not like that.

280
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:47,936
How can you still be
so clueless about women?

281
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,769
I can see why he's
so unpopular with them.

282
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,416
You have no idea.

283
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,216
- I won 52 percent of the votes.
- Oh Yoon Hee probably...

284
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,116
- saved a country in her past life.
- People on the internet adore me.

285
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,585
- I even won a beauty pageant...
- I thought Dr. Ha had a photoshoot.

286
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,640
- As a kid.
- Exactly.

287
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,130
What are you doing, Ms. Jin?

288
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,299
Ms. Cheon.

289
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,805
I thought you were on a trip.

290
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,916
I said, what are you doing?
Why are you cooking at this hour?

291
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,686
It's Eun Byeol's turn
to bring snacks tomorrow,

292
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,485
so I thought I should start
preparing them.

293
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,480
Pizza, tteokbokki, fritters...

294
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,196
What time did Eun Byeol go to bed?

295
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,990
Well, I don't know exactly.

296
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,866
How is that possible?

297
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,166
Didn't I tell you...

298
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,859
to keep a close eye on her
throughout her senior year?

299
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,676
You go to bed with her
and wake up with her.

300
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,376
You make sure she's feeling well,
going to the bathroom regularly,

301
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,140
and having regular periods.

302
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,269
Didn't I tell you to watch
her every move?

303
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,285
From her diet to her class schedule,

304
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,186
health, weight, and sleep cycle,

305
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,055
you're in charge
of everything about her.

306
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,750
I am well aware of that.

307
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,779
I also know that I should
handle her with utmost care.

308
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,049
I do want you to pay more attention.

309
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,765
- Mom.
- You're still up?

310
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,035
It's past 3 a.m.

311
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,829
Well, I had some studying to do.

312
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,000
When did you get back?
What about your trip?

313
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,616
I came back early
because I was worried about you.

314
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,410
Why would you be worried about me?
I'm doing fine.

315
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,579
I was hoping that you and Mr. Joo
would enjoy some time together.

316
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,656
Well, my throat is a little sore.

317
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,380
I wrapped up
so I wouldn't catch a cold.

318
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,670
Don't forget to take
your propolis and vitamins.

319
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,470
Okay.

320
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,470
Have you been...

321
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,809
talking to your dad lately?

322
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,109
You're the one who blocked
his calls and e-mails.

323
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,119
Did you know that...

324
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,450
he got married to Ro Na's mom?

325
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,319
No, I had no idea.

326
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,720
It's humiliating.
It's driving me crazy.

327
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,565
Why Bae Ro Na, of all people?

328
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:33,559
He knows how much I loathe her.

329
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,005
Do you see it now?

330
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:40,616
Your dad is never any help.

331
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,569
I've already erased him
from my life.

332
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:47,456
I'm not going to see him
even if he contacts me.

333
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,049
That's a good idea.

334
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,720
Until you reach the top,

335
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,890
I'll support you fully.

336
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,019
You're all I have.

337
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,430
I'll study some more.
Go to bed, Mom.

338
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:06,400
- Don't strain yourself.
- Okay.

339
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,410
Hurry up and leave
through the back door.

340
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,829
What are you doing over there?

341
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,140
Are you here to see Ro Na?

342
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:00,019
No.

343
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,859
(Fragile, picture frame)

344
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,240
What are you doing
to someone else's photo?

345
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,539
Eun Byeol!

346
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,980
Eun Byeol.

347
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,880
Eun Byeol.

348
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,926
My girl, you must have
been surprised.

349
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,490
Are you going to live here?

350
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,859
At Hera Palace? With Bae Ro Na?

351
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,467
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

352
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:46,476
I was about to tell you beforehand,

353
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,035
but I couldn't reach you.

354
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,976
You wouldn't answer
my calls, texts, or e-mails...

355
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,670
You don't have to explain.
Or apologize.

356
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,585
We're strangers now anyway.

357
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,386
Strangers?
What are you talking about?

358
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,910
You left me when I was
at the lowest point in my life.

359
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,480
I don't want you to say hi
even if you see me again.

360
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,349
Eun Byeol!

361
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:24,406
Oh, my. Ms. Cheon,
you didn't go on a trip?

362
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,440
Or did you get back early?

363
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,285
Sang A, my heart is racing.

364
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,140
Why am I suddenly so excited?

365
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,985
Hera Palace has been quiet lately,

366
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,480
but I predict a storm coming.

367
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,349
Oh Yoon Hee!

368
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,059
Where are you?
Come out, Oh Yoon Hee!

369
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,089
What's the matter?

370
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,470
Explain what happened.

371
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,116
Why are you here?

372
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,416
Why did you have to move back here?

373
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,009
Do you have nowhere else to go?
Are you a stalker?

374
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,380
You talk like I'm not allowed here.

375
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:10,309
I used to live here.

376
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:13,549
And I was so happy
when I first moved in here.

377
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:15,890
That's why I came back.

378
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,220
Did you forget
who died in the penthouse?

379
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,396
You should be having nightmares
every night.

380
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,890
And you want to live here?

381
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,835
Many neighbors still remember how
you were cuffed and arrested here.

382
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,200
- To them, you're still...
- You too...

383
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,230
still live here.

384
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,099
That gave me the courage.

385
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,470
What?

386
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,916
You're making a scene at my place.

387
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,456
Go somewhere else
if you need to talk.

388
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,579
No.

389
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,109
Here is good.

390
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,150
I don't care whether you two
got married for real or not.

391
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:49,295
But you can't live here.

392
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,519
Why is that?

393
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,565
Your daughter, Eun Byeol,
lives here.

394
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:57,805
Don't you care if she gets hurt?

395
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,000
Do you call yourself her dad?

396
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,430
I moved here
because I care about her.

397
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,015
You cut off all communication
between me and her.

398
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,376
So what else could I do?

399
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,910
I'm going to live close to her
so I can at least run into her.

400
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,779
We may be divorced,

401
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,250
but I want to stay close
to Eun Byeol.

402
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,450
Oh, my. He is so manly.

403
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:21,150
He's so charismatic.

404
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,966
What right do you have
to meet Eun Byeol?

405
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,329
Eun Byeol doesn't want a dad either!

406
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,730
Why are you so scared?

407
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,430
You have everything you want.

408
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,406
The Director position
that you've wanted,

409
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,140
the man you want,
and Eun Byeol too.

410
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,039
You can live your life
as you've been doing.

411
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:44,140
A happy life with Joo Dan Tae.

412
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,239
I'm going to live a happy life too,

413
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:48,809
with Yoon Hee.

414
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,819
I'm thankful for you, actually.

415
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,690
My life has changed so much
since our divorce.

416
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:01,160
Don't you try to act cool.

417
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,866
The home that you just happen
to move into...

418
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,035
just in time for my engagement...

419
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,799
is right in my building?

420
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,829
If you're doing this because you
still have feelings, don't.

421
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,369
There's no way I'll go back to you.

422
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
Don't insult my husband.

423
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,545
He's not your man anymore.

424
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,809
You're the one
who's insulting yourself!

425
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,579
Everyone in Hera Palace...

426
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:26,956
knows that your husband and I
were married.

427
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,690
And everyone knows that Chairman Joo
and you had an affair.

428
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,350
But you don't care about that.
You still live here just fine.

429
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,329
Why do you look so anxious?
I feel bad for you.

430
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,329
Let's both be happy
with our respective families.

431
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,700
You care for yours, I care for mine.

432
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,845
Can you leave now?

433
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:50,339
We have to rush if we want
all of our things here by lunch.

434
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,910
Is this yours?

435
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,309
Be careful. You might lose it.

436
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:17,299
Oh Yoon Hee totally won this round.

437
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:36,819
Oh Yoon Hee!

438
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:39,420
Why is she back?

439
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,259
What has she been doing?

440
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,460
Why is she back?

441
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,765
(Cheong A Medical Center)

442
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,420
Please sing a long note.

443
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,599
Good. Please sing
five short notes this time.

444
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,109
Good.

445
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,250
I feel out of breath
when I sing high notes these days.

446
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,150
I feel something in my throat too.

447
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:41,880
It's nothing, right?

448
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,490
You need to cancel
your concerts immediately.

449
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,137
Sorry?

450
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:49,019
You have serious vocal cord nodules.

451
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:52,359
I see a lump
that doesn't look good either.

452
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,460
If it gets worse from here,

453
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,569
you might need to get surgery.

454
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,440
A surgery? Why me?

455
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:06,410
No way.

456
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,555
If you leave it be,

457
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,309
you might not have your voice back.

458
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,456
You must cancel this performance...

459
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,279
and get some rest.

460
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,950
There's no way I can cancel it.

461
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:17,765
I've already paid
the rental fees to the venue,

462
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,765
and signed with the orchestra
for the concert.

463
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,059
I can't cancel it.

464
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,666
I have to get on stage.

465
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,130
You may never sing again.

466
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,329
Are you okay with that?

467
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,949
We got double the snacks today.

468
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,185
Can you eat this all?

469
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:52,280
Absolutely. I was starving.

470
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,989
Yoo Jenny!

471
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:58,659
Make it feel like I'm eating.

472
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,729
You have to be more real.

473
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:04,800
Is it a talent of yours to make food
look so unappetizing?

474
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,030
Don't you hear me? Open wide!

475
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,110
Look at all those greasy food.

476
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,969
Think of how much trans fat
she's consuming.

477
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,635
That's disgusting!

478
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,596
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

479
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,360
Don't be so ruthless.
Seems like she's not feeling well.

480
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,530
As promised, I'll take it that you
won't come to my mom's concert.

481
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:43,475
Why? I did everything
you told me to!

482
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,070
I ate everything I was told to!

483
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:50,909
I promised that I'll go with my mom.
Please let me go, Eun Byeol.

484
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,780
When were you ever our friends?
You have another friend.

485
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,580
Do you still keep in touch with her?

486
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,489
No, I haven't been
in touch with her since then.

487
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,659
Trust me on this.

488
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:08,489
Come up with a good excuse
to tell your mom why you can't go.

489
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:12,060
Let's go.

490
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,769
Sir, there's a guest.

491
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,140
What did you just say?

492
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:27,810
I'd like to be back in Hera Club.

493
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:30,620
You've become quite shameless
since the last time I saw you.

494
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,796
Your move-in hasn't even been
confirmed yet,

495
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,519
and you're asking to join Hera Club?

496
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,806
Don't you think it's setting
a bad example for the kids...

497
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,306
for a divorced couple to live...

498
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,830
in the same building?

499
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:47,705
That's what Seo Jin said too.

500
00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:50,816
Did you two meet?

501
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,086
I worked to my bones
to succeed in the US,

502
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,840
and as long as I'm in Korea,

503
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:58,485
doesn't it make sense for me
to want to move...

504
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:00,009
into Korea's best condo?

505
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,749
The board is planning on
rejecting your move.

506
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,195
Moving out may be easy,
but moving in isn't.

507
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:11,290
That's how Hera Palace works.

508
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,830
You don't like me being
around Seo Jin?

509
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,959
Why?

510
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:23,640
You feel scared because you're
only engaged?

511
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,140
Or is there another reason?

512
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,810
You're not the same
Ha Yoon Chul of old.

513
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,070
You can't think straight now that
you've experienced being rich.

514
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,550
People change after all.

515
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:53,169
(JohnBio's promise to you)

516
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,100
That's right. I forgot to give you
my business card.

517
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:03,709
You can just call me "Mr. Ha"
next time we meet.

518
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,209
Don't speak casually to me...

519
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,449
as if we're close or something.

520
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:08,709
Mr. Ha.

521
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,150
Mr. Ha.

If that's what you want,

523
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:19,060
I'll call you "Mr. Ha."

524
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,860
If you want to move into Hera Palace
that badly,

525
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,729
make a donation.

526
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,499
How much?

527
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Two million dollars?

528
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
10 million?

529
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,870
If you are willing to donate
that much,

530
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,439
I'll consider it.

00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,060
("It's Time Soprano Cheon Seo Jin
Forfeits the Crown")

533
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,070
(Vocal cord nodules form
straining or overusing the voice.)

534
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,540
Those rats.

535
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,870
They wrote about it already?

536
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,176
No. It's too risky.

537
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,630
Do as I say.

538
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:10,176
It isn't impossible.

539
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,639
It's just that
the public never found out.

540
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,039
Still.

541
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,046
No one who made a debut.

542
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,915
Find an amateur.

543
00:35:17,939 --> 00:35:19,785
She can't be too young or too old.

544
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:21,489
She must be as close to my age
as possible.

545
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,079
We don't have time.
We have one week.

546
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:27,150
This concert must be perfect...

547
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,959
no matter what.

548
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,369
(Dan Tae)

549
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,510
What? I'm about to leave.

550
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:52,479
Now?

551
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,050
I know.

552
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,196
Sorry, I'm late.

553
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,926
We just got here ourselves.

554
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,696
The traffic is terrible, isn't it?

555
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,660
Sometimes, there's traffic
even with the elevator.

556
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,176
Can we decide among ourselves
as the board...

557
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,546
to refuse to permit
Unit 4502 from moving in?

558
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,015
Oh dear. You must not have heard.

559
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,645
It has been decided already.

560
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:20,646
What do you mean?

561
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,970
JohnBIO...

562
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:24,415
Your previous husband. Your ex.

563
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:28,086
He donated five million dollars
to Hera Palace.

564
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,579
So there's no need for us to vote.

565
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,150
Chairman Joo, why did you create
that silly provision?

566
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,889
According to the rules of donations,
they've automatically been approved.

567
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:41,090
What happened?

568
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,300
You didn't tell me anything.

569
00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:45,430
Hello!

570
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,400
Welcome.

571
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,106
You're all here.

572
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,740
It's an honor to be invited
to join Hera Club.

573
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:54,216
- Come and sit.
- Please sit.

574
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,110
Sit. Sit.

575
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:58,915
There's no need
for formal introductions, right?

576
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:01,479
I'm happy to move into Hera Palace.

577
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,519
Hey.

578
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,320
Thanks for welcoming us.

579
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:07,720
Yoon Hee.

580
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
You look so good.

581
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,229
And guess what?
Kyu Jin's an assemblyman now.

582
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,935
I heard. You've gone so high
since I saw you last.

583
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,369
And you look great.

584
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,816
Sang A. I hope I'll be seeing
a lot of you as well.

585
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,139
Welcome back.

586
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:29,716
Come over for dinner
this weekend, okay?

587
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,816
I'll bring fruits and dessert.

588
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,256
What did Yoon Hee like again?

589
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,550
You know, let's not do this.

590
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:39,749
Mr. Ha, you and your wife
should rejoin Hera Club.

591
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,035
Residents of the same district
should be close to each other.

592
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:48,435
I agree. We've been too distant
ever since we lost Su Ryeon.

593
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:51,676
Why don't we vote on it
while we're all here?

594
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,776
I'm for it.

595
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,446
Definitely.

596
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,915
What are you trying to do?
Hera Club?

597
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:58,376
Have you lost your mind?

598
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,570
Since when were we friendly
with Oh Yoon Hee?

599
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:05,139
Don't you know who she is?

600
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:15,919
What?

601
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,395
You'll give us JohnBIO's
unlisted stock?

602
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:20,765
- Yes.
- To us?

603
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:21,836
Do you mean it?

604
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,006
I was dividing them up
with my hardworking employees,

605
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,800
and I remembered your two families.

606
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,900
We used to be like family,
weren't we?

607
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,575
Sexual enhancers will always
be steady sellers...

608
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,645
as long as human beings exist.

609
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:35,809
Of course, we're interested.

610
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,185
Then may I ask for a favor?

611
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:41,225
Of course. I'm in.

612
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:42,880
Anything you want. Anything.

613
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,849
I don't know
what they're giving you,

614
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,689
but I'm against it.

615
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,566
Hera Club has a reputation.
How could a woman like Yoon Hee...

616
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,660
Watch how you talk about my woman.

617
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,776
The whole world knows
that Yoon Hee is a murderer.

618
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,329
Did you see her kill her?

619
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,376
Actually,
don't you all owe her an apology?

620
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,340
You accused an innocent woman
of murder and didn't help her.

621
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,185
But she didn't resent you.

622
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,840
She was understanding
and patient.

623
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:17,519
Do you know how much
my heart broke seeing that?

624
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,889
I'm almost moved to tears.

625
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,696
We're all making a new start.

626
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,329
Let's not bring up the past
to hurt each other.

627
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,860
You can say whatever you want to me,

628
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,700
but I won't let you hurt my woman.

629
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,130
That's enough. I'm fine.

630
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:37,316
You're making me uncomfortable.

631
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,245
Why are you uncomfortable, honey?

632
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:40,639
You can be confident.

633
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,380
I thought Chairman Joo
also acknowledged...

634
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,740
that Ms. Yang killed Su Ryeon.

635
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:52,579
Fine.

636
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,389
Then I'll leave Hera Club.

637
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:56,990
Problem solved.

638
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,136
You're not leaving. Why should you?

639
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Let go of me!

640
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,570
Ms. Cheon. Ms. Cheon?

641
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:16,139
Chairman Joo.

642
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,510
Anyway, Mr. Ha.

643
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,849
You're a really good speaker.

644
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,126
You sound like a lawyer.

645
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,126
I was so moved.

646
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,895
Dr. Ha. Were you always
this manly?

647
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:31,090
You seem completely different.

648
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,229
Why are you so upset?

649
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:38,229
You know this won't solve anything.

650
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,070
How could I not be upset?

651
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,276
Didn't you hear Yoon Chul?

652
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,615
Since when was he
so thoughtful of his wife?

653
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,800
"My wife"?

654
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,110
What's this?

655
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,156
Are you angry...

656
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,940
that your loser ex-husband
became successful?

657
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,115
Or are you uncomfortable...

658
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:55,420
that Oh Yoon Hee, whom you despise,
made a grand comeback?

659
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,825
Or both?

660
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:00,450
You just disgraced me
with your actions.

661
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:04,495
"Cheon Seo Jin still has feelings
for Ha Yoon Chul."

662
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:06,196
"She regrets getting engaged
to Joo Dan Tae."

663
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,035
"She's still jealous of Oh Yoon Hee"

664
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:11,130
Those big mouths will talk about it
every single day.

665
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,606
Are you happy
now that you humiliated me?

666
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,099
What do you mean?
Why would I regret it?

667
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,800
I've lost all interest in
Yoon Chul long ago.

668
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,240
You realize we keep fighting
ever since we got engaged.

669
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,280
Who would this please the most?

670
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,555
Oh Yoon Hee is more dangerous
than Ha Yoon Chul.

671
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:30,050
We need to know why she's back here.

672
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,780
It's probably because of us.

673
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,349
There's one principle I always
stick to in business.

674
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:39,519
The more dangerous they are,
the closer I keep them.

675
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,559
That way, I know what they're after.

676
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:44,406
All that Ha Yoon Chul has is wealth.

677
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,935
I don't know how he became
such a success,

678
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:47,700
but he can't stay up there for long.

679
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,340
He offered a donation,
so I accepted it.

680
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,669
I'll just use him as I see fit.

681
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,439
If you get upset and attack,

682
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:57,479
you'll only show them
that you're anxious.

683
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:01,780
Sorry.

684
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:05,720
I've been irritable
because of the concert.

685
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,419
Look at yourself.

686
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:16,459
You are an amazing woman.
Oh Yoon Hee can't even compare.

687
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,406
She has already hit bottom.

688
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:22,700
So you should remain dignified
as you deal with her. Okay?

689
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,809
I don't know what I'm so afraid of.

690
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,439
Since Oh Yoon Hee came back,

691
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:35,309
everything's been a mess.

692
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,495
- Oh, my goodness.
- Why did you drink so much?

693
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:47,329
Don't do that again next time.

694
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:51,630
I'll break my back while carrying
another woman's husband.

695
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,305
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

696
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,376
Why is he so heavy?

697
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,869
Is he made of stone? Gosh, my back.

698
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,110
Wait a second. I'll get you
something cold to drink.

699
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:07,356
What do you want to drink?

700
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,979
Anything is fine. Gosh, my back.

701
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,919
Honey.

702
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,495
Dr. Ha gave me something great.

703
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:18,789
It's his latest product.

704
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,959
It's supposed to be amazing.
Be prepared.

705
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:24,930
Thank you so much.

706
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,630
What are you talking about?

707
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:31,300
Your honey is over there...

708
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:35,515
Is orange juice fine?

709
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:37,886
What? Orange juice sounds perfect.

710
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,426
If possible, with naked...
I mean, with crushed ice.

711
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,356
Give me just a second here.

712
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,919
Orange slushie coming up.

713
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,369
It's done.

714
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,245
Oh, my. He's taking off his clothes.

715
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:11,340
- My goodness.
- He'll catch a cold.

716
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,955
I can't believe him.

717
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:16,426
What are you doing?
This is embarrassing.

718
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,026
Jenny must be waiting. I have to go.

719
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,665
Why don't you drink this first?

720
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:23,189
Keep it for later.

721
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,160
What's with her?

722
00:44:28,189 --> 00:44:31,360
You must be tired.
Moving is exhausting.

723
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:33,459
Do you like the place?

724
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:36,829
Yes, I love it. Thank you so much.

725
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:43,709
We managed to get into Hera Club
as we had planned.

726
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:48,055
With our wedding photos
on the wall and everything,

727
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,680
it feels like
we're married for real.

728
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,955
I wouldn't have made it here alone.

729
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:55,050
I could come back here
thanks to you.

730
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,796
Cheon Seo Jin and Joo Dan Tae...

731
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,030
will do everything it takes
to kick us out of here.

732
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:03,236
If I was afraid of that,

733
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,329
I wouldn't have come back here
in the first place.

734
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,099
Don't worry.
They won't mess with you again.

735
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,840
I'll protect you.

736
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:14,269
Remember?

737
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:18,439
I'm your business partner
and husband.

738
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,309
You're cheeky.

739
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:25,249
Don't ever betray me again.

740
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,849
If you do, you're dead meat.

741
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:31,959
Never.

742
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,999
Oh, what about Ro Na? Not yet?

743
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,400
No.

744
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:46,970
I'm sure I can see her
again someday.

745
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:53,380
When I deserve to see her.

746
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:02,090
(Cheong A Arts High School)

747
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,689
Next.

748
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,660
Not this either. Next.

749
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:15,269
Next.

750
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,099
No. Not this. Next.

751
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,539
Next.

752
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:23,269
Next.

753
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,479
She's singing flat. Next.

754
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:30,749
No, not this! Turn it off right now.

755
00:46:31,979 --> 00:46:34,665
The audience has listened
to me singing all their lives.

756
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:37,066
They would notice the slightest
change in the way I breathe.

757
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,090
None of these singers are
good enough to fool them.

758
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,865
The broker introduced
about 10 singers,

759
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:44,289
and you've listened to all of them.

760
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,900
How about we cancel the concert
before it's too late?

761
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,530
No way.

762
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,915
There are people
waiting for me to crumble.

763
00:46:52,939 --> 00:46:55,110
Are you telling me
to make myself their prey?

764
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,886
They'll be excited and thrilled,

765
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,079
gossiping and laughing.

766
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,550
"Cheon Seo Jin steps down
as a prima donna after 20 years,"

767
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:06,519
"finally giving up her crown."

768
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,119
Actually, there was one singer
who sounded just like you,

769
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:15,490
but she suddenly announced that
she couldn't take the job anymore.

770
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,059
She refused a teaching position
at Cheong A Arts High School?

771
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:22,829
Let me hear it.

772
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:30,840
(Resume, Park Young Ran)

773
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,590
This is it.

774
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,130
She sings every note in tune.

775
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,099
And she never runs out of breath.

776
00:47:54,729 --> 00:47:57,400
- Who is she?
- She's in her late 30s.

777
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:01,639
She teaches kids in Ulsan
at the moment.

778
00:48:01,939 --> 00:48:03,740
She hasn't debuted...

779
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,939
and went to a college
in a smaller city?

780
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,280
Hire her.

781
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,519
Bring her in front of me
whatever it takes.

782
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,289
Get in touch with her right now.

783
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:32,369
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

784
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:34,709
Don't look back.

785
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,809
What's your name?

786
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:41,209
It's Park Young Ran.

787
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:43,486
I've always been your huge fan.

788
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,650
It's such an honor
to meet you in person.

789
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:50,220
I really enjoyed
listening to your demo.

790
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,559
You do have an amazing voice.

791
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,829
I have a long way to go.

792
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,336
Hearing that compliment
from my idol,

793
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,376
I don't know what to say.

794
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,729
Why did you turn down
a teaching position...

795
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,975
at Cheong A Arts High School?

796
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:07,615
Well...

797
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:10,439
My father recently
had surgery...

798
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,915
and is not feeling so well.

799
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:16,510
So I thought it'd be impossible
for me to work in Seoul.

800
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:19,796
He needs me by his side now.

801
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,650
If that's what it's about,
I could help you.

802
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,389
I can see to it that...

803
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,106
your father is treated...

804
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,900
at Cheong A Medical Center
by our best staff.

805
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,829
Of course,

806
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:36,530
he will have caregivers
around the clock.

807
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:39,400
You won't have much to do.

808
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,709
Pardon?

809
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:44,340
On the condition that...

810
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,880
you do me a little favor.

811
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,019
I'm going to talk
about something very important.

812
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,490
No one can know about it, ever.

813
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,789
Can you promise?

814
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:02,789
This will be...

815
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,329
the most important
opportunity in your life.

816
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,369
I promise.

817
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,070
I won't tell anyone.

818
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,780
First, sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

819
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:27,389
The opening song will be
"Una Voce Poco Fa".

820
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,360
Master the song completely...

821
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,760
and send me over a demo.

822
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,729
The most important thing is that...

823
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,006
we're in perfect sync.

824
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,070
("Una Voce Poco Fa" demo,
Park Young Ran)

825
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:56,785
No mistakes are allowed.

826
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:00,990
You must sing
exactly like you practiced.

827
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,189
Keep that in mind.

828
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:22,470
Seo Jin.

829
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:28,050
It's your 20th-anniversary concert
tomorrow, right?

830
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,450
Congratulations.

831
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,979
Yes. Thank you.

832
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:33,780
Whether you mean it or not.

833
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:38,389
- Honey, you must be hungry.
- I am.

834
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:40,660
I'll make you something nice.

835
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,990
- Put that down. It's heavy.
- Okay.

836
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,876
Oh, I made your favorite,
cheonggukjang.

837
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,276
- Really?
- Yes.

838
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,475
You're the best.

839
00:51:50,499 --> 00:51:52,869
I'm happy that you like my cooking.

840
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,139
Goodness, what did I do
to deserve you?

841
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,550
Well? Wasn't that quite natural?

842
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:11,990
Are you serious?

843
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:15,729
Who said you could do
things like that?

844
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:19,499
I couldn't help it. That's all.

845
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:00,515
I must've rehearsed too much
because it's an important concert.

846
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:02,615
Should we call it a day?

847
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,180
What happened? Your rehearsals
were always like the real thing.

848
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:06,955
Can you perform at the concert?

849
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,725
It's not my first time.

850
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:10,555
I'll rest a little
in the dressing room.

851
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:12,796
I'll check the stage and go.

852
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,550
Please do your best today.

853
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,110
While you're singing on stage,

854
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:40,415
Park Young Ran will be singing
in this secret area.

855
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:41,426
(Concert stage)

856
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,450
(Park Young Ran)

857
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,220
I just need this concert to go well.

858
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:47,765
Once my vocal cord nodules go away,

859
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,889
I can sing again
as I used to. Then...

860
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,919
nothing will go wrong.

861
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:52,349
(Soprano Cheon Seo Jin's
20th Anniversary Concert)

862
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,606
We should've
gotten her a bigger one.

863
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,030
- This is enough.
- Really?

864
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,450
Suction.

865
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:46,059
Again.

866
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:47,729
Make some noise.

867
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
Again.

868
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,300
Again. Try a loud noise.

869
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:10,856
Is there some kind of problem?

870
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,280
I think it's too hard.

871
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:15,590
At this point,
the vocal cords aren't moving.

872
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,300
She wants to try one more time.

873
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,369
We're going to try again.

874
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,439
Make some noise.

875
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:41,150
Again.

876
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:40,999
Brava!

877
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,720
Brava!

878
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,360
How could it be?

879
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,860
It was a perfect high F.

880
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:25,356
You were the best ever.
I got chills.

881
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:27,865
Why didn't you tell me
you were raising the finale?

882
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:30,519
You've exceeded your prime.

883
01:00:43,729 --> 01:00:45,039
What happened?

884
01:00:45,269 --> 01:00:47,316
You didn't say
you'd raise it to a high F.

885
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,785
It's hard enough to hit it
after a break.

886
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:51,169
It's nearly impossible to hit it
in one breath.

887
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,579
Did you intentionally hold back
what you could do?

888
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:58,720
There must be a reason why
you tried to deceive my ears.

889
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,820
Hey, you.

890
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,860
Who are you?

891
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:15,329
Who are you?

892
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,010
How...

893
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:28,150
How are you...

894
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:32,680
Finally, I get to say hi.

895
01:01:33,919 --> 01:01:35,990
I hope we get along
from now on, Seo Jin.

896
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,665
(The Penthouse 2)

897
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:09,666
Yoon Hee!

898
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,736
This is just the beginning.
Just you wait.

899
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,935
Track them down if
they try to get in my way!

900
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:16,205
The best voice and Yoon Chul
were both mine...

901
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:17,636
initially.

902
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,736
Now it feels real
that I'm back in Hera Club.

903
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,745
How dare you come to our school?

904
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:24,776
Your daughter
is included in my plan.

905
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,546
Put someone on Seo Jin too.

906
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,876
I'm getting nervous.

907
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,046
Yoon Hee...

908
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,769
I'm going to kill you.
