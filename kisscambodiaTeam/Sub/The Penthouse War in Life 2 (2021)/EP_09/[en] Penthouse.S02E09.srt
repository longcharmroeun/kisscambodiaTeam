00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,650
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,259
Are you finally awake, Na Ae Gyo?

3
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,239
Who are you?

4
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,109
Where is this?

5
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,010
I saved your life.

6
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:45,440
Don't you think you should be
a little more grateful?

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,050
I guess you only look like Su Ryeon.

8
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:52,079
Who are you?

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,849
I'm Logan Lee.

10
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,189
We've met two years ago.

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,589
Logan Lee? I don't know you.

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,929
Stop this nonsense and piss off!

13
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,160
Hold on!

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,200
I'm not trying to hurt you.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,700
I just want to hear...

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,438
what you're about to say back then.

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,740
If you don't want to die,
get your hands off me.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,439
I can finish you in seconds.

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,349
Until Su Ryeon died,

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,889
you pretended to be Joo Dan Tae's
wife because you look like her.

21
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,089
I know that you got
insider information by lobbying...

22
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,259
Party Leader Jung Doo Man
and others at Happy Future Party,

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,130
and you made a whole lot
of money from that.

24
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,099
But two years ago,
you certainly decided...

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,169
that you'll separate ways
from Joo Dan Tae.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,669
That's why you wanted to meet me.

27
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,010
Stop speaking nonsense.

28
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,239
I've never made such a decision.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,850
Joo Dan Tae is
the only person that I trust.

30
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,320
This voice!

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,090
I know it's you!

32
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,189
I'm Na Ae Gyo.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,859
I have something to tell you
before I leave.

34
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,730
I know what Joo Dan Tae did
to Shim Su Ryeon...

35
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,070
and what kind of a person he is.

36
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,100
I might never get to tell you
if I don't tell you today.

37
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,399
I know...

38
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,709
that you meant what you said.

39
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,310
You were desperate!

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,810
I must've...

41
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,690
had a fight with him or something.

42
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,220
Don't you think that I could've
done that on a whim?

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,759
I'm not very good
with anger management.

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,529
Does that mean that it's fine
if I play this for Joo Dan Tae?

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,759
Yes. Go ahead.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,739
Are you trying to threaten me
with a mere voice recording?

47
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,609
I'm sorry,

48
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,979
but the relationship
between Dan Tae and I...

49
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,679
is much stronger than whatever
you think it is.

50
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,118
We had children together.

51
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:09,350
You think a voice recording can
change anything?

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,089
Stop snooping and don't you
ever try to find me again.

53
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,869
We meet again.

54
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,799
What are you doing?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,869
Did you approach me
because you two are a team?

56
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,510
I don't know what you're thinking,

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,049
but I'm Dan Tae's woman.

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,749
I'm the birth mother of the twins.

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,488
Joo Dan Tae tried to kill you.

60
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,588
You almost died today!

61
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,190
You...

62
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:51,599
don't know when you'll be abandoned
like Su Ryeon.

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,160
And yet, you want to stand by him...

64
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,629
just to be loyal?

65
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,638
What do you know about Dan Tae?

66
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,070
Because I've been betrayed.

67
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,709
I've had to flee and almost died
because of him.

68
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,410
You're not any different from me.

69
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,648
You know better...

70
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:15,548
about how he deals with people
who are of no use to him.

71
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:17,149
I'm giving you a chance
to abandon him...

72
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,959
before he abandons you.

73
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,690
Work with us, Na Ae Gyo.

74
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:26,500
What do you two think you are?

75
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,328
(Seok Hoon)

76
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:31,539
Hello?

77
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,940
Hello, Seok Hoon. It's me, Ms. Oh.

78
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,439
Everything is good, right?
I called because I was worried.

79
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,610
I'm fine. How are you?

80
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,709
My dad didn't try to do anything
to you again, did he?

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,550
No, I'm fine.

82
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,550
Good to hear that you're fine.
Bye now.

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,029
Don't you want to meet
your children?

84
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,260
I'll let you meet Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung.

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,680
You two are adorable!

86
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,050
You think you can
win me over with just that?

87
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,820
If I had any
maternal attachment to my kids,

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,289
do you think I would've run away
when they were infants?

89
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,029
Being a mother?

90
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,528
That's certainly not my thing.

91
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,570
Do you know what Joo Dan Tae
did to the kids?

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,239
Your kids are being abused.

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,370
They're living in a nightmare!

94
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:44,610
And you're okay with
that lunatic raising them?

95
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,349
Watch what you say
about other people's families.

96
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,889
Let her go.

97
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,459
We can't let her go like this.

98
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,729
What if she tells Joo Dan Tae?

99
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,329
We can't stop her.

100
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,630
So? You'll give up?

101
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,370
I can't.

102
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,899
She may say that,

103
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,300
but I saw the look in her eyes.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,510
We'll have to hope she has at least
an ounce of motherly love left.

105
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,348
Where were you?

106
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:28,588
Why didn't you answer your phone?

107
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,019
Did you get a new man?

108
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,288
Who are you to complain?

109
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,120
You're the one who tried to kill me.

110
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,028
Why did you try to kill me,
you jerk?

111
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,458
Now that we sold the building,

112
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,759
you had no use for me
so you wanted to kill me?

113
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,569
I couldn't understand
why you did that two years ago,

114
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,629
so I was just verifying it.

115
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,869
What couldn't you understand?

116
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,898
I went to Thailand quietly
as you told me to!

117
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,909
I meant...

118
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,638
leave for a short while
because Su Ryeon was dead.

119
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,208
Since people can't see you.

120
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,908
So why did you avoid me?

121
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,619
You wouldn't take my calls,
you wouldn't come back...

122
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,620
and you ignored me.

123
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:01,550
How was I supposed to take that?

124
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,789
Babe. We're ideal partners.

125
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,659
We've been one forever.

126
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,529
As long as you don't betray me,

127
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,070
I will never betray you.

128
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,380
But once is enough.

129
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,409
Try that garbage with me again,

130
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,779
and there will be a bullet
in your skull.

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,320
Got that?

132
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,690
Finally,

133
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,789
I feel like Ae Gyo is back.

134
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,200
To be honest,

135
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,269
you were kind of sexy earlier.

136
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,800
You made my heart race a little.

137
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,110
How about a drink
to celebrate our making up?

138
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,019
I was nervous because I thought
you were straying.

139
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,820
You know what you mean to me.

140
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,560
We need to score big with
Cheonsoo District's redevelopment.

141
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,729
I won't stray at least until then.

142
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,110
Their relationship seems to be...

143
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,939
more solid than we anticipated.

144
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,539
No. I just saw a crack.

145
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,849
She didn't tell him that she met us.

146
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,959
Let me know
if you ever change your mind.

147
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,629
I'll let you meet Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung.

148
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,969
What brings you by?

149
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,410
The chairman isn't home yet.

150
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,549
I stopped by because of the tux
for the wedding.

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,379
I need to check his size.

152
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,588
Go back to work.

153
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,690
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,379
This necklace belongs
to your daughter, correct?

155
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,608
We found her DNA...

156
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:45,050
and the victim's blood on it.

157
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,469
Where is it?

158
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,089
What are you doing?

159
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:38,070
Why are you snooping around
in an empty office?

160
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,420
Looking for this?

161
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Give it to me.

162
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,969
You don't need it anymore.

163
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,838
I did everything you asked.

164
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,238
I sent out the invitations
and ordered my dress.

165
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,349
I'll show up at the wedding
as promised,

166
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,950
so give me the necklace.

167
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,719
That won't be hard,

168
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,119
but you don't think this is...

169
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,719
my only ace in the hole, do you?

170
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,758
What do you mean by that?

171
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,759
I heard Eun Byeol got an IV.

172
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,900
So? Did it cleanly erase her memory?

173
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,868
How could Dr. Ha test a drug
still in clinical studies...

174
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,540
on his own daughter?

175
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,910
He's still a licensed doctor.
He shouldn't do that.

176
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,979
What if there's a bad side effect?

177
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,478
His daughter's life
would be ruined for sure,

178
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,379
and he'd end up in jail.

179
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,560
Ms. Cheon Seo Jin.
Why are you so dense?

180
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,930
I told you. You can't be free of me.

181
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,929
It's time to accept your fate...

182
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,700
unless you want your daughter
to get back the memory she lost.

183
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,700
Do you understand now,
my dear Seo Jin?

184
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,660
(Yoon Chul)

185
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,150
(Fate)

186
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,748
What are you thinking?

187
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,520
You're marrying Chairman Joo?

188
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,019
You said you wouldn't marry him
for Eun Byeol's sake.

189
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,859
You know what kind of a jerk he is.

190
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,759
I do. But what about it?

191
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,899
What man wouldn't lose his temper...

192
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,099
if his fiancee fools around
with her ex-husband?

193
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,399
What's gotten into you?

194
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,338
Something happened
with him, didn't it?

195
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,669
Why did you suddenly
change your mind?

196
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,939
You don't love him!

197
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,708
I'm not a 20-year-old child...

198
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,410
crying for love.

199
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,550
Marriage is the biggest business
in a person's life.

200
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,089
That's why I chose Dan Tae.

201
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,050
What about our daughter?

202
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,890
Do you think Eun Byeol
can accept this marriage?

203
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,770
It's for me.

204
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,099
You dumped Yoon Hee.

205
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:02,770
That's enough for me.

206
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,579
I refuse to see you and Yoon Hee
live happily.

207
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,209
What?

208
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,209
Why?

209
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,920
Didn't you know? This is who I am.

210
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,979
I've been using you.

211
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,218
I had to bury Eun Byeol's crime,

212
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,790
so I needed your blind
fatherly love.

213
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,560
I wanted to get revenge on Yoon Hee,

214
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,060
so I acted like I wanted
to go back to you.

215
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,170
You're lying.

216
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,430
No matter how low you may be,

217
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
you wouldn't do this to me.

218
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,170
Stop being so clingy,
and get away from me.

219
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,609
I never wanted to go back to you...

220
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,310
from the start.

221
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,879
The type of man
who's right for me...

222
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:47,379
is someone who is insanely rich
and gentle...

223
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,219
like Dan Tae.

224
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,450
Seo Jin.

225
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,190
So take Eun Byeol and leave.

226
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,489
Go to the US or anywhere.
I don't care.

227
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,358
Now, you'll even dump our daughter?

228
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,030
My life is more important...

229
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,070
than my daughter's.

230
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,670
It's better for her too.

231
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,410
So...

232
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,040
make sure...

233
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,410
to leave before the wedding!

234
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,479
I...

235
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,050
I'm done talking.

236
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,190
You really are...

237
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,660
the absolute worst.

238
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,379
Please...

239
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,109
I need you to protect Eun Byeol.

240
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,280
That's the only way left now.

241
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,979
What's all this?

242
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,449
They're gifts from Chairman Joo.

243
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,950
Some of them are for you.
Do you want to have a look?

244
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,189
He sent a dress and shoes that you
will be wearing to their wedding.

245
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,459
Are they really going ahead
with this ridiculous wedding?

246
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,459
Seok Hoon, where are you?

247
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,869
That's hilarious.

248
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,238
Oh, wait. Ms. Kang!

249
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,640
Ms. Kang!

250
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,008
What are all these?

251
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:56,748
Why did you buy
so many designer handbags?

252
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,449
They're gifts from the Three Queens.

253
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,679
My birthday is coming up.
Isn't it so sweet of them?

254
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,320
Oh, my. They bought you all these?

255
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,889
Were all the new bags
you've been carrying...

256
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,029
also gifts from the Three Queens?

257
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,589
I knew it.

258
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,199
They must think of you
as their family.

259
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,899
They look heavy. Let me help.

260
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,399
Forget it.

261
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,370
I don't want people to think
that I boss you around.

262
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,538
Who would think that?

263
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,779
My obedience to you is
completely voluntary.

264
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:29,779
Come on.

265
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:34,248
I'm great at carrying bags.

266
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,589
I'm the greatest gentleman
of the 21st National Assembly.

267
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,719
Let's go.

268
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,119
A gentleman, my foot.

269
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,159
- You don't have to do that!
- Let's go, Ms. Kang.

270
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,728
- My goodness.
- Be careful.

271
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,759
- You're an important person.
- Stop it.

272
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,610
What's going on here?

273
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,539
It's okay. They were
going to find out sooner or later.

274
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,450
Let's go.

275
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,449
Their friendship is beautiful.

276
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,249
They're siblings!

277
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,719
Which floor did they start from?

278
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:17,729
What did you say?

279
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,758
Their mom and dad are
getting married soon.

280
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,569
How can Seok Hoon
and Eun Byeol be dating?

281
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,080
But they're quite cute together.
It made my heart flutter.

282
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,068
Chairman Joo, what if
your wedding gets called off?

283
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,139
Word will spread
among the neighbors in no time.

284
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,839
That's not going to happen
as long as you keep quiet.

285
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,449
You know I'm good
at keeping secrets.

286
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,449
Oh, I almost forgot about Ma Ri.

287
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,190
If she spreads the word
at the bathhouse, you're doomed.

288
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:49,028
Seok Hoon knows better than that.

289
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,788
I'm sure Eun Byeol came up
with the idea to stop our wedding.

290
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:53,399
If I react,

291
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,069
it'll only encourage the immature
kids to act up even more.

292
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,670
I ask you to stay
out of our family matters.

293
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,968
The door is that way.

294
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:06,379
Chairman Joo,
you can be honest with me.

295
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,110
Why are you so determined
to go ahead with this wedding?

296
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,949
I mean, your fiancee
cheated on you with Yoon Chul.

297
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,788
I doubt that you're
still in love with her.

298
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,450
I guess what you're in love with
is your share in Cheong A Group.

299
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,329
My wedding is coming up.

300
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,200
I really don't want to use violence
so early in the morning.

301
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,670
Also, you're
an assemblyman, after all.

302
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:35,038
I root for you.
That's true love right there.

303
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,669
You're pursuing love
despite your children's opposition.

304
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,479
I'm very touched indeed.

305
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,548
Hey, I have an aide too.

306
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:47,979
He was the best fighter
in all of Beolgyo.

307
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,999
You got up to something
very cute, Son.

308
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,039
You've been rebellious lately,
so I thought you were all grown up,

309
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,309
but you're apparently
still a little kid.

310
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,249
You're my baby...

311
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,950
who I need to shelter and care for.

312
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,660
I heard that Ms. Cheon is
stepping down as the director.

313
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,159
We'll finally get to see
how good Eun Byeol really is.

314
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,999
It'll be her first test
without her mom's influence!

315
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:35,630
She's way too timid
to do well on the test.

316
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,639
I heard that Mr. Ma even got rid of
her private bathroom.

317
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,869
She'll also be eating
the same food as we do.

318
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,068
She went from being the princess
to a commoner overnight.

319
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,680
Mr. Ma sure acts faster than anyone.

320
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,880
- Let's run.
- Hurry.

321
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,318
Is this really necessary?

322
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,519
Why did you have to show up
at school in this situation?

323
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,058
You don't care about me at all.

324
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,359
Whether it's your wedding or school,
you want everything your way.

325
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,269
Don't waste your energy
taking a taxi in the morning.

326
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,699
If you want to avoid me,
I'll get you a separate car.

327
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,339
I hate you.

328
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,039
You unloving egoist.

329
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,189
What is it?

330
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,219
Why are you doing this? Let go!

331
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,788
What are you up to these days?

332
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,689
Are you advertising
that you're dating my brother?

333
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,288
Is that your silly way...

334
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:39,958
of protesting against the wedding?

335
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,829
I'm not just protesting.
It's for real.

336
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,629
Seok Hoon and I are in love.

337
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,640
Do you think
that can stop the wedding?

338
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,409
What's going to happen is, Seok Hoon
is going to get beaten to death.

339
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,508
He may literally die.

340
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,738
He may die?

341
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:56,650
Do you want to know
how scary my dad is?

342
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,450
- Do you see that?
- What happened to your arm?

343
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,690
No way.

344
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,719
This is who your future stepdad is.

345
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,929
So forget about convincing my dad.

346
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,999
It'd be faster
to try and stop your mom.

347
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,569
If anything happens
to my poor brother,

348
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,670
I won't forgive you.

349
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,709
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

350
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,119
All right.
It seems like everyone's here.

351
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,359
We're here to take a vote
on the dismissal...

352
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,659
of the director
of Cheong A Foundation.

353
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,228
Before that,
I have something to say.

354
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:47,659
Cheong A Foundation is...

355
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,498
the country's most prestigious
private school foundation.

356
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,439
The previous directors
donated their immense wealth...

357
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,910
and dedicated themselves
to this cradle of education.

358
00:22:57,069 --> 00:22:59,839
But Director Cheon
damaged the school's reputation...

359
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,150
with her incompetence and arrogance.

360
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,180
I strongly demand that
Director Cheon be dismissed.

361
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:11,988
Director Cheon,
do you have something to say?

362
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,318
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

363
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,090
I admit that I made
a crucial mistake.

364
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,900
I am deeply ashamed.

365
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:22,359
However, this is
no time for division,

366
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,399
but we need to work
closely together.

367
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,870
I will put things right
by all means.

368
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:30,409
I can easily give up
my reputation as a singer,

369
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,910
but Cheong A Foundation...

370
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,610
is my life.

371
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,110
I can put everything back
the way it is.

372
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,580
Please give me a chance.

373
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:49,019
Let's take a vote.

374
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,930
(Against)

375
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,170
(Vote on Dismissal
of Director Cheon Seo Jin)

376
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,569
All right.

377
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,279
Let me announce the result.

378
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,110
(For: 5, Against: 6)

379
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,279
Five are in favor of her dismissal.

380
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,549
Six are against it.

381
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,160
What happened? I can't believe this.

382
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:24,590
It's been tampered with.

383
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,659
- What's going on?
- Unbelievable.

384
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,298
I announce that the motion
to dismiss Director Cheon...

385
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:32,799
has been rejected.

386
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,979
Thank you.

387
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,950
Thank you so much
for trusting me.

388
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,519
To repay your support,
I will do my best...

389
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,789
to make you proud
of Cheong A Foundation again.

390
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,590
(Notice of Board Meeting)

391
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,929
I don't know what you did
to manipulate the board members,

392
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,669
but I can never accept this result.

393
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,940
Of course not. We'll appeal
and take a vote again.

394
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,039
Let's go, Mom.

395
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,620
Your father asked us a favor
before he passed away.

396
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,719
What favor?

397
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,860
My first daughter
still has a long way to go.

398
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,370
She is ambitious
but lacks in many ways.

399
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,498
Once she becomes the director,

400
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,508
her mom will make up excuses
to bring her down.

401
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,380
Seo Young will
cause trouble as well.

402
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:49,580
Just believe in Seo Jin...

403
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,650
and support her...

404
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:55,150
so that she can keep her place
as Director.

405
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Father...

406
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,870
So, no need to thank us.

407
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,840
Think of your father
and work harder.

408
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:21,209
We'll have your back.

409
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:33,819
(Vote on Dismissal
of Director Cheon Seo Jin)

410
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,830
Father!

411
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:41,959
Father!

412
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,068
Father...

(Vote on Dismissal

Father!

415
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,549
I'm sorry.

416
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,229
You were here?

417
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,769
Were you looking for me?

418
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,440
Director Cheon isn't dismissed.

419
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:26,539
Did you hear?

420
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,509
No, I don't care.

421
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,979
I don't understand why she's
so attached to the foundation.

422
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,049
She doesn't even look ashamed
to see the students.

423
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,089
I'm so ashamed of her.

424
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,288
Don't mind what others are saying.

425
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,360
People will forget over time.

426
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,690
Keep your chin up.

427
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Seok Hoon,

428
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,268
you can count on me
if you need a shoulder.

429
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:57,870
I can lend an ear to you anytime.

430
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:03,910
You know how much I like you, right?

431
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,890
Are your memories back?

432
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,549
Do you remember what I told you?

433
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:16,259
No, I can't remember anything.

434
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,988
Can't you just tell me?

435
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,330
Just keep thinking.

436
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,769
Don't you remember
who you met with by the stairs?

437
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,239
Me? Who else other than you?

438
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,400
You have to get your memory back.

439
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,209
You might've seen the murderer
who killed Ro Na.

440
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,479
What do you mean?

441
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,579
Are you saying that Mr. Park
wasn't the murderer?

442
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,380
You know how kind Mr. Park is.

443
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,989
I'm confident that he's being
falsely accused.

444
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,420
I couldn't believe it either.

445
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,988
He's not a man who'd kill anyone.

446
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:51,029
If you get your memory back,
we could find the murderer...

447
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,259
and prove Mr. Park's innocence.

448
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,799
If you remember anything, tell me...

449
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,269
and tell me only.

450
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,969
You can promise that, right?

451
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:03,539
Wait.

452
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,680
Are you still thinking of Ro Na?

453
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,779
It's not about Ro Na.

454
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,519
I just feel so bad for Mr. Park.

455
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,019
You'll help me, right?

456
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,090
Yes, I will.

457
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,859
I'll do anything for you.

458
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,359
- I'll get my memory back.
- This peaceful afternoon,

459
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,288
I'll end off with a song...

460
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:27,900
that'll wake everyone up.

461
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:45,509
What's wrong?

462
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,450
How did you say Ro Na died?

463
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:54,259
Someone stabbed her in the head
with the Arts Festival trophy.

464
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,729
Trophy?

466
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,870
Hello, I'm Hwang Geum Bong.

467
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:17,080
I'd like to look into properties
in the Cheonsoo District.

468
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,149
The Cheonsoo District, you say?

469
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,120
That area doesn't have
any development plans yet.

470
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:26,389
If you'd like to invest,
I'd recommend the Opyeong District.

471
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,890
Please hold on.
I'll ask my investor.

472
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,389
Are you sure
about the information...

473
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,498
that Cheong A Group is going
to invest in Cheonsoo District?

474
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,870
Of course. I heard it directly
from Mr. Joo himself.

475
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,639
But, do be careful about it,

476
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,670
because the official announcement
hasn't been made yet.

477
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,539
Okay. So, how much property
are you looking for?

478
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,239
Everything you can
get your hands on.

479
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,179
There's going to be a massive
increase in value soon.

480
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,180
Okay.

481
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,219
Do you know Joo Dan Tae?

482
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,019
Sounds like Chairman Joo directly
made this recommendation.

483
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:02,259
My client wants Cheonsoo District
and nowhere else.

484
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,529
Okay.

485
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,699

00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,508
Chairman Song, it's me,
Hwang Geum Bong.

488
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,840
How have you been?

489
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,978
I just heard
of a new redevelopment plan,

490
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,109
so I had to call you.

491
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,209
Is that right?

492
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,179
All right, then.

493
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,549
Do some research and send it
to my assistant's office.

494
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,718
All right.

495
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,860
Ms. Jincheon,

496
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,759
- Yes?
- Did you like my present?

497
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,890
I put a lot of thought into it.

498
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,958
Of course!

499
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:45,729
You ladies have the best eye
for everything.

500
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,939
Does that nasty lady
not bother you anymore?

501
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,738
You said that she lives with you
at Hera Palace, right?

502
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,179
After you ladies taught her
not to mess with me,

503
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,950
she can't even say a word to me.

504
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:58,709
Don't worry about it.

505
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,920
If she ever tries to mess
with you again, tell us.

look down on my Ms. Jincheon?

Why don't you just move?

508
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,430
- Move?
- I just got a call,

509
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:16,298
and I hear that they're going
to build a multiplex condo...

510
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,028
that's 130 floors high
in Cheonsoo District.

511
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:21,340
You heard about that rumor too?

512
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,308
Hearing that Chairman Joo is
getting involved too,

513
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,809
it sounds like they'll announce
a redevelopment plan soon.

514
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,209
Chairman Joo?

515
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,079
He's so quick when it comes
to things like that.

516
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,580
Ms. Jincheon, you should
get a place there too.

517
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:38,349
That area will become
an even richer area than Hera.

518
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,690
Really?

519
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,759
That's some amazing
insider information!

520
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:46,599
Since it hasn't been announced yet,

521
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,199
the prices will go soaring
once it does!

522
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,968
That's why you need to hurry.

523
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:55,069
I hear that Chairman Joo bought
all the good areas already.

524
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,039
Honey!

525
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,779
Honey! Kyu Jin!

526
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,748
You need to dress me
so that I can go to work,

527
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:08,518
and take care of... Nevermind!

528
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,119
Why are you going around like that?

529
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,450
You look like you're crazy.

530
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,559
Did you visit
Kang Ma Ri's bathhouse again?

531
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,959
Why don't you just get a job there?

532
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,728
Did you save the country
in your previous life?

533
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,159
How did you find a woman like me?

534
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,799
I probably met a woman like you
because I didn't save the country.

535
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,969
How will you get your funds
for the election without me?

536
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,169
What? Did you hear something?

537
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,079
Cheonsoo District is going to be
redeveloped soon!

538
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,080
That rumor is already
about 200 years old!

539
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:41,449
I've been looking at properties
with my mother since a pre-teen.

540
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,978
I'm serious.

541
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,189
I've heard the Three Queens
say so themselves.

542
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,419
You know who they are?

543
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,130
They're the ultimate insiders
to real estate!

544
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,528
Not only that, Chairman Joo...

545
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:54,458
has been buying up properties there!

546
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:57,068
He didn't even tell me anything!

547
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,569
He's trying to take
all the gold alone!

548
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,839
How much money do you have
on hand right now?

549
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,538
No, I must call my mom.

550
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,569
That's right.

551
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,069
I am...

552
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,880
going to hold
a little talent show...

553
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,350
to get some cash on me.

554
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:14,919
Good morning, ma'am.

555
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,390
Here I go.

556
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:20,089
This is really expensive.

557
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:23,659
In just 2 years,
it'll be 100 years old.

558
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,089
You didn't have to.

559
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,029
Here you go.

560
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,370
This must be so expensive.

561
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,100
Here.

562
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,870
Please take a look over this.

563
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,149
Here.

(Real Estate Sales Contract)

565
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,579
Here.

566
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,850
Here as well.

567
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,290
All good.

568
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,419
What's this?

569
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,100
It's just a meal.

570
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:08,100
This is going to be worth
50 million dollars.

571
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,739
- Sorry?
- I said 50 million dollars.

572
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,770
Okay.

573
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,139
Let's stamp the last one together.

574
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,779
All right. Hold it.

(Real Estate Sales Contract)

576
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,290
Congratulations.
All there's left to do is get rich.

577
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,659
You're good at your job!

578
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,060
Sure I am.

579
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,390
I don't know
how the information leaked,

580
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,460
but sales in the Cheonsoo District
has gone up sharply today.

581
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,469
Who smelled the money?

582
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,369
I couldn't find who it was.

583
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,339
You idiot!

584
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,669
You used so much money for this.
How can you not know?

585
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:46,979
Find out as soon as possible!

586
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,008
Look into who bought the properties
and who's behind these deals.

587
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:52,349
No. First, purchase
all the properties...

588
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,980
that I've been eyeing on.

589
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,290
- Get out!
- Yes, Chairman.

590
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,960
That incompetent jerk!

591
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,128
It can't be...

592
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:08,930
Oh Yoon Hee? You again?

593
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:11,469
My goal has changed.

594
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:15,040
I want to become extremely wealthy.

595
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,410
I'll do whatever it takes
to accumulate wealth...

596
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,939
so that I can own this penthouse.

597
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:23,450
That witch!

598
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,779
How dare she even dream
of taking my penthouse?

599
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:38,589
Honey, it's me.
Could I ask you a favor?

600
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:42,299
I need you to take care
of this witch.

601
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,569
That's my expertise.

602
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,239
We'll talk later when we meet.

603
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,979
Thanks for calling me, Ms. Na.

604
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,449
I didn't expect you to call so fast.

605
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,410
No need to thank me.

606
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:04,390
I'm just here to check
how great you are...

607
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,319
at keeping your promise.

608
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:10,359
Are you sure you just need
to see them from here?

609
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,830
What else?

610
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:16,430
Should I hug them
and cry tears of joy or something?

611
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,239
They're here.

612
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,549
- You're early.
- Hello.

613
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:38,349
What is it? I thought you wanted
to talk. Why is she here?

614
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,418
Don't be rude.
She has something to tell us.

615
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:44,229
What do you want to drink?
It's on me.

616
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,430
The strawberry milkshake is
good here.

617
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,969
It's really sweet.

618
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,568
All done, right?

619
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,838
I'm not all that generous...

620
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,910
that I can sit across from the woman
who killed my mom for long.

621
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,919
Sit, Seok Kyung.

622
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,489
It's about your mom.

623
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,950
Mom?

624
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:14,560
Your birth mother.

625
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,659
- She's alive.
- What do you mean, birth mother?

626
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,528
I'm sorry,

627
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:23,729
but our birth mother died
as soon as she gave birth.

628
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,275
If you're going to try to fool us,
you need to get the facts right.

629
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,238
Do I need to stay any longer
for this nonsense?

630
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,410
Your father lied to you.

631
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,609
Your birth mother is alive.

632
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,549
She's your birth mother.

633
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,430
Have you gone insane?

634
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,029
Is this a joke? This is our mom
that just died.

635
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:56,969
No, she's your birth mother.

636
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,669
The resemblance between her
and Su Ryeon is uncanny.

637
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,339
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's true.

638
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,669
I've met her and checked myself.

639
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,639
Is this real? Where is she now?

640
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,548
You trust this woman?

641
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,879
She's trying to mess with us
because I bullied Ro Na.

642
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,989
Photoshopping photos like this is
a piece of cake.

643
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,020
We can ask Dad ourselves.

644
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,988
You still trust him?

645
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:27,560
After all of that, you still don't
know what kind of a man he is?

646
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,528
He's the man who abuses...

647
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:31,199
and controls us.

648
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,669
How do you expect him
to tell us anything truthful?

649
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,199
Just stay quiet.

650
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,569
Ms. Oh is trying to help us.

651
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,339
She's very close to you.

652
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,750
If you want to see her,
I'll let you.

653
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:48,319
Did I ever ask for my birth mother?

654
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,549
How dare she try to act
as if she's our mom now?

655
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,959
I only have one mom.

656
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,960
A fake mom? I don't need one.

657
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:35,389
Be honest with me.
You know something, don't you?

658
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:39,059
What is it? Tell me!

659
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,599
The person who killed our mom...

660
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,599
might be Dad.

661
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,010
Have you gone insane?

662
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,720
Why would Dad do that?
What would he do that for?

663
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,450
Why?

664
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,789
Because he no longer
needed our mom.

665
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,719
That's the kind of a man he is.
He abandons everyone useless to him.

666
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,930
We don't know...

667
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,829
when we'll be abandoned.

668
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,700
So, we can't trust Dad anymore.
Do you understand?

669
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,439
It's just you and me.

670
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,340
I'll never abandon you.
Even if I have to die,

671
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:26,079
I'm going to protect you from Dad.

672
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:27,749
If...

673
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,220
Dad really killed Mom,

674
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,389
I won't just let him be.

675
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:37,860
I'll never forgive him.

676
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,700
What is it?

677
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:51,668
What threats are you
making to Seo Jin?

678
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:53,438
Call the wedding off right now.

679
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:56,309
Seo Jin doesn't deserve
a trashy husband like you.

680
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,039
Stop fooling around.

681
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,808
You think you'll have a chance
to patch things back up...

682
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:03,978
if I don't marry her?

683
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,518
Let's be honest here.

684
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,189
Aren't you back because
you want her money too?

685
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,629
I guess this is the only use
your hand has now.

686
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,399
I should've completely crushed it
when I had the chance,

687
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,598
but I got too soft.

688
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,630
You lunatic!

689
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,799
I'm going to stop this wedding,
whatever it takes.

690
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,208
Even if it means that I'll have
to risk my life.

691
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:31,069
I love this
ambitious attitude of yours.

692
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,979
But I guess you haven't heard
anything from her.

693
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,449
That's disappointing.
She's your daughter too, after all.

694
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,449
The birth father should know.

695
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,719
What are you saying?

696
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,590
I found out...

697
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,090
that your daughter killed Bae Ro Na.

698
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,599
What can you do?

699
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:59,239
Parents need to be responsible
for their kids' mistakes.

700
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,139
Seo Jin is going to bear it all.

701
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:04,680
She loves her daughter quite a lot,
as you know.

702
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,479
Wow.

703
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,780
I wish someone else was here
to see that look on your face.

704
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:15,919
Go on. Hit me.

705
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:18,959
If you can handle
what I'll say, hit me.

706
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,930
I said to hit me.

707
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,728
Take your daughter
and get out of my sight...

708
00:43:27,729 --> 00:43:29,499
before I turn her into the police.

709
00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:33,169
I'll... I'll kill you.

710
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,639
I'll kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

711
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:38,610
Good luck with that.

712
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,979
I'll kill you, Joo Dan Tae!

713
00:43:43,979 --> 00:43:45,479
I'll kill you.

714
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,349
I will kill you!

715
00:44:16,209 --> 00:44:17,849
(Restricted Area)

716
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,269
I can't figure out
what Na Ae Gyo is thinking.

717
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,840
Even seeing her kids
didn't have much effect.

718
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,749
She won't readily show her emotions.

719
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,349
We'll have to wait and see.

720
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:55,119
What about Cheonsoo District?

721
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:56,749
Has there been progress?

722
00:44:57,189 --> 00:45:00,559
As expected, it reached Kang Ma Ri
and Lee Kyu Jin too.

723
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:04,630
The tip we leaked
to the Three Queens worked.

724
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,530
Then it's time to make our move.

725
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:20,410
Hello, Mr. Hwang. It's Oh Yoon Hee.

726
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,349
I'll sell lot 27 in Cheonsoo.

727
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,720
Yes. Please find out
if there are any buyers.

728
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,519
As soon as possible please.

729
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:29,849
Thank you.

730
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,740
Joo Dan Tae should be arriving
at his vacation house.

731
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,868
Did you want to meet
to give me this stupid invitation?

732
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,740
This is so annoying!

733
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:53,138
If Cheon Seo Jin won't divorce you,

734
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:55,180
will you live with her
for the rest of your life?

735
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:56,650
Am I stupid?

736
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,149
And she's marrying me
only because I am blackmailing her.

737
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,819
It means nothing to me.

738
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,249
- He's blackmailing her?
- This is just for the stock.

739
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:07,458
Then put all the land
you bought in Cheonsoo District...

740
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:09,189
in my name.

741
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:14,728
Let's go with half.

742
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:17,499
70 percent. I won't go any lower.

743
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,409
In exchange, I'll get the land
in Oh Yoon Hee's name.

744
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,209
Even still, 70 percent
is excessive.

745
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,380
70 percent is excessive?

746
00:46:29,749 --> 00:46:30,849
Really?

747
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,780
Fine. But...

748
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,650
it's only until I divorce Seo Jin.

749
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:46,429
When will you end that marriage?

750
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,199
Once we register our marriage,

751
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,069
I'll be Cheong A Group's
largest shareholder.

752
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,839
As soon as I get the shares,

753
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,498
I'll chop up the company
and sell them off.

754
00:46:54,499 --> 00:46:56,009
I'll bring up the stock price...

755
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,740
to the max and bow out.

756
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,809
- Don't you trust me?
- The man who tried to kill me?

757
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:02,709
How could I trust you?

758
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:06,518
Would you, if you were me?

759
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,119
I already explained that.

760
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,919
How would I know?

761
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,919
I may disappear quietly one day...

762
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,430
as Shim Su Ryeon did.

763
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:23,930
Get lost.

764
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,499
I'm not in the mood
to drink with you.

765
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,380
We're not done talking!

766
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,479
Seriously.
She has such a nasty temper.

767
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:51,700
What happened to your face?

768
00:47:52,229 --> 00:47:53,329
Who did this?

769
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,078
Call off the wedding.

770
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:06,309
It's lunacy.

771
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,450
Is Joo Dan Tae blackmailing you?

772
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,079
Don't be afraid.

773
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:13,119
He has no way to prove
Eun Byeol killed her.

774
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,550
How did you know?

775
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,050
Did he tell you?

776
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,320
No matter what
he threatens you with, stand firm.

777
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,630
I'll deal with
Eun Byeol's treatment.

778
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,400
Say you know nothing.

779
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:28,430
He has evidence.

780
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,200
Eun Byeol's necklace.

781
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,209
It has her DNA and Ro Na's blood.

782
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,239
And a recording of my confession.

783
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

784
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,650
You can't handle this on your own.

785
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:52,160
Don't underestimate me.

786
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,860
I can control Dan Tae easily.

787
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,459
If you'd take care of Eun Byeol,

788
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,099
I'll handle the rest.

789
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,829
Please leave quietly.

790
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:06,639
This is my final request.

791
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,150
I didn't do it, did I?

792
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:25,160
No, I couldn't have.

793
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,720
There's no way.

794
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,059
Then why do I keep
remembering the trophy?

795
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:44,139
It's time to take your medicine.

796
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,079
Your mom said
to make sure to take it.

797
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:49,249
Will this make my headache go away?

798
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:51,180
Does it hurt a lot?

799
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,018
Oh no. You reviewed this...

800
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:55,889
only three times.

801
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:01,959
I feel like my head is
about to explode.

802
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,459
I'm solving the math problems,

803
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,030
and numbers keep
crawling around in my head.

804
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,839
What if I really end up going crazy?

805
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,998
You've been doing well until now.

806
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:15,740
Ro Na's gone now.

807
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:21,379
Forget this.
Stop studying and go to sleep.

808
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,249
I'll wake you up early tomorrow.

809
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:36,990
How's Eun Byeol doing?

810
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:39,329
She's having a really tough time.

811
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,769
Her mom's wedding is coming up,

812
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:43,999
and something's wrong
with her memory.

813
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,939
What about the drug she's taking?

814
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,668
That's hindering her from getting
her memory back, isn't it?

815
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:50,839
I've swapped them out with vitamins,

816
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,539
so it won't have any effect.

817
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:55,450
She'll remember soon...

818
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,510
what she did.

819
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,519
No matter how much she struggles,
she's back where she started.

820
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,189
Poor girl.

821
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,459
(Seok Hoon)

822
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:12,499
Why did you want to see me?

823
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,570
I know that someone else...

824
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:19,769
killed Ro Na.

825
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,709
What?

826
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:24,369
Was it...

827
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,539
Eun Byeol?

828
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,550
I do suspect her, but...

829
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,720
I'm not positive.

830
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,559
I don't have evidence.

831
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:42,759
I think my father was involved
in Ro Na's death.

832
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,499
He has the necklace
that Eun Byeol wore...

833
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,729
during her performance.

834
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:55,740
Joo Dan Tae knew
that Eun Byeol was the killer.

835
00:51:56,439 --> 00:51:58,379
He's blackmailing Seo Jin with it...

836
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,979
into marrying him.

837
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,610
(Golden Real Estate)

838
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:04,249
A good lot just became available
in Cheonsoo District.

839
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:07,949
Then naturally, I should buy it.

840
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,618
I'll pay 50,000 dollars more
than the highest bidder...

841
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,359
No. 100,000 dollars more.

842
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,729
I'm relying on you, Mr. Hwang.

843
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,829
Awesome. A good lot
became available already?

844
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,400
Mr. Hwang was worth every dollar
we bribed him with.

845
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:26,039
If that land becomes mine,

846
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,740
my life will be set for life.

847
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:31,109
A 130-floor apartment complex...

848
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,339
is being built on that land.

849
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,949
This lame Hera Palace
is nothing in comparison.

850
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:41,419
My gosh. The Three Queens
have incredible sources.

851
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:44,049
Hurray. Hurray.

852
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,319
What did I tell you?
I told you...

853
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,260
that Kang Ma Ri's bathhouse
was like a secret conference room.

854
00:52:49,689 --> 00:52:53,700
Who would've thought I'd benefit
from a bathhouse scrubber?

855
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:57,669
Send Jenny's mom a few boxes
of the fanciest Italian towels.

856
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:02,240
I know, right? Honey.
We totally struck gold.

857
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,009
Kang Ma Ri's bathhouse?
Bathhouse scrubber?

858
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,740
Let's hurry.

859
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,950
I love you!

860
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,459
Hey, Jenny.

861
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:29,429
Are you aware that candy costs
100 dollars a piece?

862
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,939
If you have a sore throat,

863
00:53:32,439 --> 00:53:35,970
just get normal candy
at the supermarket.

864
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:40,209
Mind your own business.

865
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,150
Don't pick a fight and go away.

866
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:46,650
Isn't that humidifier
from Switzerland?

867
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,649
I'm impressed.

868
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,550
And all your clothes are
from designer brands.

869
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:55,229
Jenny, this is not okay.

870
00:53:57,389 --> 00:54:00,760
Did you buy them for me?
Did I steal them from you?

871
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,099
I use them because I can
afford them. What do you care?

872
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,800
Get lost so I can study.

873
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,009
Still, it's unacceptable.

874
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,668
Think about how many people's
backs your mom has to scrub...

875
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:14,138
to earn all that money.

876
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:16,349
Shouldn't you be more thrifty?

877
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:20,180
What? My mom does what?

878
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,418
Hey, you really didn't know?

879
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:24,848
After hearing...

880
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:27,660
how your mom works her bottom off,

881
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:30,228
I was really touched.

882
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:32,659
That's why I prepared
a little something for you.

883
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,130
Guys, what are you waiting for?

884
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:37,200
It's time to give her our gifts.

885
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,400
Ta-da!

886
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:48,110
- Here you go.
- It's pretty.

887
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,519
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

888
00:54:53,979 --> 00:54:56,589
Why is my wrist aching so much?

889
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,760
I still have to work
many more years.

890
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:06,299
Ma'am! This is insane!

891
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,498
What if Jenny sees this?

892
00:55:08,499 --> 00:55:11,328
Why would you dry these
in the living room?

893
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:12,999
Ma'am!

894
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,900
I did it.

895
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:20,638
Jenny. Well...

896
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,049
The thing is... I can explain.

897
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,208
When were you going to tell me?

898
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:28,119
If you're so ashamed of your job,
why do you even do it?

899
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,119
Just quit already.

900
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:33,359
How did you find out?

901
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,689
I wasn't trying to keep it
from you...

902
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,300
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- For what?

903
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:44,268
Did you steal?

904
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:45,839
Did you hit people
and take their money?

905
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,469
No, it's not like that.

906
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,168
Then why were you
hiding it from me?

907
00:55:49,169 --> 00:55:52,079
I've never done anything
I should be ashamed of.

908
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,708
Even if you were ashamed of me,
I can't quit.

909
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:57,749
What did I do wrong?

910
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,748
I've pampered you
more than any other parent,

911
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:03,549
and I've done everything
I can for you.

912
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,119
Isn't that enough?

913
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,638
If you don't dry them completely,
they'll smell.

914
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,510
If you don't satisfy your customers,
they'll leave.

915
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,880
Then we'll starve.

916
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,309
What?

917
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,208
After what happened to Ro Na,

918
00:56:31,209 --> 00:56:33,780
I'm not ashamed
or scared of anything.

919
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:36,788
I don't care if the kids tease me.

920
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:39,269
And I don't care if I don't
get into Seoul National University.

921
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,829
The only thing
that scares me is that...

922
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:48,669
someone close to me may leave me
and never come back.

923
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,069
With Dad gone,
we only have each other to rely on.

924
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,168
Why would you keep secrets from me?

925
00:56:57,169 --> 00:56:58,880
I'm your daughter.

926
00:56:59,709 --> 00:57:02,880
How could you let me find out
about your job through Min Hyuk?

927
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,720
Jenny.

928
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:12,860
I've run us a bath.
Come in when you're ready.

929
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,789
I want to see how good you are.

930
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,660
Don't forget banana-flavored milk.

931
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:27,139
My princess is all grown up.

932
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:30,839
Now that she's found out,

933
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,309
should I tell her
about her dad too? Or no?

934
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,379
Mom, hurry up!
The bath is getting cold!

935
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,619
Okay, I'm coming!

936
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:42,249
Here we go!

937
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,859
Come on. Let me scrub your back.

938
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,289
Stay still.

939
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:54,029
Your mom is a professional
with 25 years of experience.

940
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,868
There's a long line of chairmen...

941
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:59,069
waiting to be scrubbed by me.

942
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,800
You don't trust me?

943
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:03,969
Gosh, look how dirty your back is.

944
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:06,409
Were you too busy scrubbing
other people's backs?

945
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:09,308
Gosh, this is seriously gross.

946
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:12,550
What are you talking about?
I wash myself every day.

947
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,389
Have some milk. I want to pick up
some scrubbing skills.

948
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,789
Why should you?

949
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,388
You'll go to Seoul
National University...

950
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:25,089
and live a comfortable life.

951
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,729
That's why I'm working so hard.

952
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:30,729
Are you listening to me?

953
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,269
Gosh, you talk too much.

954
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:37,439
You don't have to pay me.
Just stay still.

955
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:39,910
Just for today.

956
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,349
Mom.

957
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,990
Mom.

958
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,989
Have some snacks and study.

959
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,889
Did you tell Dad to take me
to the US? Is that right?

960
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,300
Dad has to visit the headquarters.

961
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,368
Follow him and get some fresh air.
It's your vacation soon.

962
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:39,900
You're lying.

963
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,709
You're only sending me away
to have a wedding.

964
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:47,010
How can you do this
if you're my mom?

965
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,119
Mom. Can't you cancel the wedding?

966
00:59:53,249 --> 00:59:55,689
I can't live without you.

967
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:58,550
Please don't abandon me.

968
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,459
I'm scared.

969
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:01,760
Eun Byeol.

970
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:06,360
You're my everything.

971
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,869
So please don't get married.

972
01:00:09,669 --> 01:00:13,939
If I have to go to the US,
I want you to come with me.

973
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,070
As long as I have you,
I can give up on everything,

974
01:00:18,269 --> 01:00:21,010
even college. I mean it.

975
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:25,379
Why would you give up on college?
After all this hard work?

976
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,180
Don't be so weak. Just do as I say.

977
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:40,300
I'm only staying behind
to protect you.

978
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,869
To protect you from that monster.

979
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,579
Why?

980
01:00:56,479 --> 01:00:58,650
I said, I'm not angry.

981
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,880
Forget it.

982
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,050
Just focus on planning
your wedding with Seo Jin.

983
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:03,550
Are you sure you're coming
in a few days?

984
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:05,010
Of course.

985
01:02:05,479 --> 01:02:09,019
I'll come as soon as I sort things
out at the company and foundation.

986
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:11,889
Don't worry.

987
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:14,519
Stay with your dad until I come.

988
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,038
I'm not sure
if this is the best idea.

989
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,410
Eun Byeol can't know.

990
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,240
Don't say anything about me.

991
01:02:32,479 --> 01:02:35,950
This is not right.
I can't leave you alone here.

992
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,519
Let's just kill Joo Dan Tae
and run away.

993
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:43,720
Stop this nonsense and leave.
Right now.

994
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,160
Seo Jin.

995
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
Goodbye.

996
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,650
Don't get weak, Seo Jin.

997
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,789
You're getting married today,

998
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,090
but you sent your daughter away
without letting her see the wedding?

999
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,629
I guess Joo Dan Tae doesn't make
a very good stepdad.

1000
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,268
Stay out of my family's affairs...

1001
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:06,269
and leave this place.

1002
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,969
Your child and husband are gone.

1003
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,910
Why are you still here by yourself?

1004
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:13,380
I like...

1005
01:04:14,539 --> 01:04:15,950
this place.

1006
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,150
I also like the fact
that you're dying to get rid of me.

1007
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:22,849
And I'm curious to see...

1008
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:27,660
how happily in love
you and Joo Dan Tae will be.

1009
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,360
- What?
- That's why...

1010
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:34,260
I plan to sincerely wish you
a happy marriage.

1011
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,700
See you later.

1012
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:38,030
Can't wait to see
the happy bride, Cheon Seo Jin.

1013
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:49,010
Why is a bride's skin so dry?

1014
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,010
Were you up all night
from the excitement?

1015
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:53,118
If you couldn't wait,

1016
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,650
you should've said
let's have it sooner.

1017
01:04:58,389 --> 01:04:59,389
(Cheon Seo Jin)

1018
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:01,590
This is what you need, right?

1019
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:03,860
You can register
the marriage yourself.

1020
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,929
I wanted to rent out
an entire hotel...

1021
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,999
and make you
the greatest bride in the world.

1022
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,039
But your reputation is a bit...

1023
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,939
You know.

1024
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:31,019
Please understand why we're having
a small one at Hera Palace.

1025
01:05:31,419 --> 01:05:34,819
Even so, you're becoming
the owner of the penthouse.

1026
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,329
Enjoy it.

1027
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:39,860
So, did Eun Byeol leave?

1028
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,070
The weather in California
must be incredible right now.

1029
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,070
Don't say her name.

1030
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:47,569
Even if I marry you,
Eun Byeol is not your child.

1031
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,308
She'll have
nothing to do with you. Ever.

1032
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:52,680
Gosh. What a shame.

1033
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:56,309
I was so happy
to get another daughter.

1034
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:03,249
I think
they're really getting married.

1035
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,959
Eun Byeol left for California.

1036
01:06:06,189 --> 01:06:08,189
She left? She did?

1037
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
Where are you going?

1038
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,939
(Seok Hoon)

1039
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,979
Don't answer...

1040
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:29,479
anyone's calls.

1041
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,849
(Seok Hoon)

1042
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:47,900
Pull over. Pull over now!

1043
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:01,709
(Police)

1044
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:06,680
Don't come out.

1045
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,260
Ha Yoon Chul, correct?

1046
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:16,489
Yes, I am. What is this about?

1047
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,300
You are under arrest for
the murder of Bae Ro Na.

1048
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
What?

1049
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,399
What are you talking about?

1050
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,340
Dad. What's going on?

1051
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:30,069
What are you doing to my dad?

1052
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:33,239
Park Jung Shik, who is locked up
for murder confessed everything.

1053
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,680
That you bribed him to lie
and confess.

1054
01:07:35,939 --> 01:07:37,110
Come to the station with us.

1055
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,519
Wait. Wait a second.
Something's not right. Wait!

1056
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:41,619
Wait!

1057
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,418
It's not true! Wait.

1058
01:07:43,419 --> 01:07:45,319
- Dad.
- I need to talk to my daughter.

1059
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,719
Eun Byeol. Get in a cab
and go to the airport now.

1060
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,089
- Got that?
- Dad!

1061
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:52,228
I'll be fine, so don't worry.
You have to go.

1062
01:07:52,229 --> 01:07:53,859
- Dad!
- Did you hear me?

1063
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,660
Let go of me!

1064
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,229
Dad!

1065
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,400
Dad!

1066
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,599
Dad.

1067
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:04,240
Dad.

1068
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,708
Dad!

1069
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:12,680
Dad... Dad...

1070
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:15,579
Dad!

1071
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:20,689
Dad...

1072
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,209
He was just arrested
and is being taken in.

1073
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:46,119
(He was just arrested
and is being taken in.)

1074
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,120
Good work.

1075
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:49,389
(Good work.)

1076
01:08:56,129 --> 01:08:58,059
(Eun Byeol)

1077
01:09:09,469 --> 01:09:10,969
(Power off)

1078
01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:53,420
What happened? What's going on?

1079
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:57,189
Seok Hoon... What do I do?

1080
01:10:18,809 --> 01:10:20,979
Thank you, everyone.

1081
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,879
We're finally getting married.

1082
01:10:24,379 --> 01:10:25,750
You've succeeded.

1083
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,048
You two make a good couple.

1084
01:10:28,049 --> 01:10:30,589
Look. Here's the bride.

1085
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,210
Hi.

1086
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,509
You're wrong, Ro Na.

1087
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,540
I will not lose...

1088
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,910
anything to you.

1089
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:08,019
Not my dad,

1090
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,049
not Seok Hoon,

1091
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,089
not the grand prize trophy.

1092
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:17,389
What's wrong?

1093
01:12:18,629 --> 01:12:21,429
Ro Na... It was Ro Na.

1094
01:12:22,099 --> 01:12:23,330
I killed her.

1095
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:38,849
Smile.

1096
01:12:39,509 --> 01:12:42,620
Smile as if you're so happy,
you can't keep it in.

1097
01:13:24,589 --> 01:13:26,830
I'm sorry for realizing it so late.

1098
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:30,330
I loved you, Ha Yoon Chul.

1099
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,960
(The Penthouse 2)

1100
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:00,999
Welcome to your nightmare.

1101
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,758
I need to learn from you.

1102
01:14:02,759 --> 01:14:03,899
I killed her.

1103
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,228
I'll make you regret so much
that your heart will tear apart.

1104
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:08,268
I keep getting a feeling
that you're not a bad person.

1105
01:14:08,269 --> 01:14:10,109
Whatever the reason is, use me.

1106
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,709
I remember everything now.

1107
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,178
- There was someone else?
- Why did Ro Na die?

1108
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:15,279
There's a trap here.

1109
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,348
I need you in order to find
Ro Na's real murderer.

1110
01:14:17,349 --> 01:14:20,580
I'm going to find out everything,
even if I have to kill you.
