00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,340
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,809
I feel so sorry for Su Ryeon.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,320
She was too sweet
to be used by someone like you...

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,590
until she died.

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,659
Thank you...

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,060
for remembering me.

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,230
- What are you doing?
- You're Su Ryeon.

8
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:02,929
I know you're Su Ryeon.

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,660
Don't try to run away.

10
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,770
I'm sorry it took me
so long to recognize you.

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,630
Where are you?
Where are you, Cheon Seo Jin?

12
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,740
She's in the practice room.

13
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,039
How dare she go out
without my permission?

14
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,440
I asked her for a private lesson...

15
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,009
so that I can prepare for my finals.

16
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,580
You didn't just bring her here
to cook for us, right?

17
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,380
Let me take advantage
of my new stepmom.

18
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,850
- Tell her to come here after.
- Okay.

19
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,390
I told him that you're giving me
a private lesson.

20
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,030
He won't look for you
for a couple of hours.

21
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,860
(Ms. Cheon)

22
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,729
Chairman, please
have a look at this.

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,600
What is it?

24
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,710
Logan Lee?

25
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,979
You mean, Ae Gyo met with Logan Lee?

26
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,949
Yes. They secretly met
after the bid.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,949
When did this prick come back
to Korea?

28
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,389
What is James doing? All he had
to do is watch his son.

29
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,019
- Where's Na Ae Gyo?
- She's headed to the cottage.

30
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,460
The cottage?

31
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,870
- It's me.
- Do you know this man named Logan?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,940
Come to the cottage right now.
I need you.

33
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,870
All right. I'll be there.

34
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,810
Get my car.

35
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,650
Help me.

36
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,750
- Yoon Hee!
- How can I trust you?

37
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,590
I know it's hard to trust me.
Of course.

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,560
But why would I lie to you
at this point?

39
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,460
I came here, even knowing
I might go to jail.

40
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,199
So, what is it that you want to say?

41
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,069
On the day of the Cheong A
Arts Festival,

42
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,940
Eun Byeol struck Ro Na down
with the trophy.

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,579
Ro Na rolled down the stairs,

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,650
and it was Yoon Chul who put
the trophy in Seok Kyung's locker.

45
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,720
We were crazy. We were only thinking
of how we could save Eun Byeol.

46
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,819
And after finding that out,
Joo Dan Tae started blackmailing me.

47
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,560
He had Eun Byeol's necklace,
which she dropped on the site.

48
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,660
Are you looking for this?

49
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,030
He used your daughter's death...

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,470
to take Cheong A Group away
from me.

51
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,100
How does that change anything?

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,669
That still means Eun Byeol is
the one who killed my daughter!

53
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:04,410
No, it could be Eun Byeol,

54
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,079
or not.

55
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,810
Joo Dan Tae was there, after all.

56
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,780
Eun Byeol heard Joo Dan Tae's
phone ring.

57
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,280
Are you kidding me?

58
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,690
You want me to trust your daughter,
who can barely remember anything?

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,690
I can prove it to you.

60
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,460
Joo Dan Tae changed his outfit
at the festival.

61
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,129
Isn't it weird that he got changed
right before the awards ceremony?

62
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,570
There must be something.

63
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,700
Regardless,

64
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:36,340
Ro Na was very useful.

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,239
Just as much as Seol A.

66
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,879
Thanks to those tragic girls dying
right at the most opportune times,

67
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,820
I was able to swallow up...

68
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,049
Su Ryeon's and Seo Jin's fortunes
very easily.

69
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:54,789
So, you want to put all the blame
on Joo Dan Tae now?

70
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,760
You think you can expose him
with just a few photos?

71
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,160
There are plenty of reasons
to change his outfit.

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,140
I'm not doing this
to save Eun Byeol.

73
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,869
What I want right now...

74
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,970
is the truth behind what happened
that night.

75
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,539
Just help me...

76
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,479
kill Joo Dan Tae with my own hands.

77
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,619
Please.

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,650
Yoon Hee!

79
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,390
Then turn yourselves in.

80
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:28,859
Come clean on everything Eun Byeol
and you've done to my Ro Na.

81
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:34,999
(Recording)

82
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,570
Sure.

83
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,739
I will.

84
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,820
What do you think you're doing?
Who do you think you are?

85
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,350
Logan!

86
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,220
It's been so long.

87
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,090
I thought your father locked you up,

88
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,629
but I guess you were out loose.

89
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,999
- Joo Dan Tae!
- What brings you here?

90
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,299
No, how did you get here?

91
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,700
I think he followed me from the bid.

92
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,210
Are you still
not over Shim Su Ryeon?

93
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,340
Hey!

94
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,850
I was too nice on you
the last time, wasn't I?

95
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,280
Take him to the warehouse.
I'll teach him a lesson.

96
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,489
Let go! Let go of me!

97
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,619
Let go!

98
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,340
What did he say to you?

99
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,080
He keeps telling me
that I look just like Su Ryeon,

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,309
and keeps asking me
how we're related.

101
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,850
That lunatic.

102
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,679
The problem is,

103
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,280
he knew about Jung Doo Man.

104
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,789
What?

105
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,619
He seems to know
that we got insider information...

106
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,160
from Jung Doo Man and
used that to invest.

107
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,499
He kept threatening me
to come clean.

108
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,499
Maybe...

109
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,100
Shim Su Ryeon knew
before she died.

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,939
No, there's no way
she would've known.

111
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,179
Jung Doo Man wouldn't have
told him either.

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,809
Talk to that prick first.

113
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,010
You should be able to find
something out if you keep asking.

114
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,820
I'll call you later.

115
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,929
Mr. Hong, it's me, Shim Su Ryeon.

116
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,140
Let go, you jerks!

117
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,809
You brats.

118
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,520
Hey!

119
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,859
Logan!

120
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,030
You must've been quite happy...

121
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,970
when you thought Su Ryeon
came back alive.

122
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,770
But it's too bad...

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,910
that we've disappointed you.

124
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,850
How dare you mess
with another man's woman?

125
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,249
Su Ryeon died earlier
than she should've because of you.

126
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:41,119
You sided with her
and gave false hope,

127
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,619
you prick.

128
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,320
I guess you're wasting your time
obsessing over little things...

129
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,889
because you're so rich
and you've got lots of time,

130
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,560
but unfortunately,

131
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,369
your revenge ends here.

132
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,139
You prick.

133
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,810
Take the sack off.

134
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,519
What? What happened?

135
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,359
Wake him up.

136
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,369
Sir...

137
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,869
We've been fooled.
Logan's people followed us...

138
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,139
and already changed our driver
to one of his.

139
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,550
He knew that
we would take him in our car.

140
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,070
Who are those jerks?

141
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Just go.

142
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,580
Just run them over!

143
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Who are you?

144
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,450
You little...

145
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,759
Who are you?

146
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,269
Are you all right, sir?

147
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,909
You idiot.

148
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,320
You didn't even check
the driver's face?

149
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,550
Seriously.

150
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,019
Ae Gyo.

151
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,830
Darn it. Ae Gyo.

152
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,300
(Na Ae Gyo)

153
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,440
(Na Ae Gyo)

154
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,570
So?

155
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,340
What did he say?

156
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,779
What took you so long to pick up?

157
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,379
I went in to take a shower
and ran out!

158
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,310
What's your problem?

159
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,609
Do you think I'll put up with it?

160
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,720
Forget it. Let's talk later.

161
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:34,960
Why you...

162
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,670
This was your plan all along,
wasn't it?

163
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,509
If you were going to save me,
why did you call him here?

164
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,639
I had no choice.
I had to make him trust me.

165
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,680
He knew we had met...

166
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,509
and had started to suspect me.

167
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,279
We lived together for 20 years.

168
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,220
It's a matter of time
before he figures it out.

169
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,889
Why are you doing something
so dangerous?

170
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,859
Where were you all this time?

171
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,989
Why didn't you contact me?

172
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:13,100
If you were alive,
why didn't you contact me?

173
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,430
Shim Su Ryeon died...

174
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,340
two years ago.

175
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,239
She's alive and sitting before me.

176
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,769
You and I...

177
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,440
have nothing to do
with each other now.

178
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,580
I have something to do as Na Ae Gyo.

179
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,119
Until I finish it completely,

180
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,720
no one can know that I'm alive.

181
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,790
Not even Yoon Hee.

182
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,320
How can I ignore you?

183
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,659
You may fall into danger again.

184
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,259
Su Ryeon.

185
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,670
I regretted it...

186
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,769
every day during the past two years.

187
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,800
For not protecting you.

188
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,070
I couldn't forgive myself
for going to the airport first.

189
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,609
It drove me crazy every single day.

190
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:09,649
Dan Tae is on his way here.

191
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,190
You have to go.

192
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,790
I can't help you again.

193
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,790
I can't go.

194
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,430
Go with me.

195
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:17,330
I won't go alone.

196
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,560
You uncovered
what happened to Seol A.

197
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,930
You did enough.

198
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,369
This is my problem now.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,170
Stay out of it.

200
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Everything will be over
in two weeks.

201
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:32,239
If my plan falls through
because of you,

202
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,080
I'll be miserable
and resent you...

203
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,609
for the rest of my life.

204
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,609
So get out.

205
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,220
Promise me one thing.

206
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,050
That if it gets dangerous,

207
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,489
you'll ask me for help.

208
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
That you won't...

209
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,460
leave by yourself again.

210
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,869
You need to go.

211
00:13:58,229 --> 00:13:59,300
Su Ryeon.

212
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,670
Thank you for staying alive.

213
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,600
We have to pay the balance tomorrow?

214
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,430
That's totally unreasonable.

215
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,540
It was hard to get that lot.
We even had to win an auction.

216
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,710
We can handle that much.

217
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,509
Our lots went up in value
20 percent today alone.

218
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,609
Even still.

219
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:45,109
How can I get 50 million dollars
in cash overnight?

220
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,720
Well... You can gather everything
that is valuable...

221
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:53,989
and put the penthouse up
as collateral and get a loan.

222
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:56,529
Definitely not.
I refuse to touch the penthouse.

223
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,759
Babe.

224
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,830
How about that new safe
that you brought in?

225
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,129
How much do you think is in there?

226
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,139
Safe?

227
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,639
Seo Jin.

228
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,540
We have to squeeze out what we can.

229
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,609
We can't blow the five million
we put down as a deposit.

230
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,119
Oh Yoon Hee complicated everything.

231
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,749
I'm sure Logan Lee is backing her.

232
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,350
They bought Hye In's land...

233
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,090
and is playing with us.

234
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:27,820
Then the more reason not to give up.

235
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,629
Are you going to lose the center
in Cheonsoo District to Logan?

236
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,690
That's enough!

237
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,639
Logan didn't come back?

238
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,700
And if he did?

239
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,970
You would've been notified.

240
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,710
Think of how many guards
you have on me.

241
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,580
Did he really like Su Ryeon
or something?

242
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:53,580
That leech is sticking to me
and getting in my way.

243
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,790
It's not like you can kill him.

244
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,790
He comes from
a rich American family.

245
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,019
That Shim Su Ryeon...

246
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:03,389
Dead or alive,

247
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,600
she is incessant.

248
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Don't you agree?

249
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,129
I'll call you tomorrow.

250
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:19,330
(Hyeum Medical Center)

251
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,800
And if you take A...

252
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,570
(Accelerated High School Math)

253
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:35,709
Seok Hoon.

254
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,149
It's me.

255
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,159
Is it really you?

256
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:49,990
Where are you?

257
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,109
Seok Hoon.

258
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:12,780
Ro Na.

259
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,240
I've been awake
for about a week now.

260
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,399
They say I was really out of it.

261
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:38,639
I had multiple brain surgeries.

262
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:41,240
They say it's a miracle
that I'm alive...

263
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,649
and able to speak.

264
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,850
I see.

265
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,919
This is really great.

266
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,219
I thought you were dead.

267
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,090
Who brought you here?
Have you talked to your mom?

268
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,060
- No.
- Why not?

269
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,740
Imagine how happy she'll be.
Call her right now.

270
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,169
I can't yet.

271
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,379
But it won't take too long.

272
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:18,310
Before that, I have something
to tell you.

273
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,250
That's why I called you.

274
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,550
What is it?

275
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,320
The person who did this to me...

276
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,560
Is it...

277
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,060
my dad?

278
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,879
I hoped it wouldn't be him.

279
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,080
I desperately hoped
it wouldn't be him. Why...

280
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,719
Why does he keep taking away
people that are precious to me?

281
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,520
Why in the world?

282
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,600
I'll never forgive him.

283
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,699
- Seok Hoon.
- I'm going to kill him.

284
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,879
Seok Hoon.

285
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,379
Mom?

286
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:26,250
She's the one who saved me.

287
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,189
Mom.

288
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,040
Mom.

289
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,840
I missed you, Seok Hoon.

290
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,580
I missed you too.

291
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm sorry.

292
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,530
Seo Jin suggested that we team up.

293
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,330
She even confessed
everything she'd done.

294
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,600
I think we can trust her.

295
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:21,270
It'll be fine
as long as we use her well.

296
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,969
She's already cornered.

297
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,139
She has nowhere to run.

298
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:29,609
I'm supposed to sign a contract...

299
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,580
with Na Ae Gyo tomorrow.

300
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:34,480
Is it really okay
to hand over the land so easily?

301
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:38,389
Do it. Do as Na Ae Gyo says.

302
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,189
But everything's over if the land
ends up in Dan Tae's hands.

303
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,389
Don't tell me
you still trust Na Ae Gyo.

304
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,129
She's deleted the spy app.

305
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:50,129
We don't even know where she is
or what she's up to.

306
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,939
Do you think I put the land
up for sale...

307
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,740
without a plan?

308
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,740
I do have a plan.

309
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:02,850
How much?

310
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,149
50 million dollars.

311
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,149
I want it in cash tomorrow.

312
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,320
Are you kidding?

313
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,689
Who has that much money in cash?

314
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,389
If you don't, get it from somewhere.

315
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,500
Put your buildings up
for collateral, sell your diamonds,

316
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,669
steal your mom's money, or whatever.

317
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,300
Getting that much money
should be no problem for you.

318
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:29,000
If you don't do as I say,
I can't guarantee...

319
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:31,209
Eun Byeol's safety.

320
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,850
You have until tomorrow noon.

321
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,550
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

322
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,189
Thanks in advance.

323
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,540
(Seller Oh Yoon Hee
and Buyer Na Ae Gyo...)

324
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,879
Okay, I'll check.

325
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,780
Thanks for preparing
the money in time.

326
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,919
We just paid the rest
to her account.

327
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:18,590
I see.

328
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:21,760
You prepared that much money
in one day? Impressive.

329
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,330
Ma'am, you're lucky.

330
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,429
This is the highest price
you could possibly expect.

331
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:30,669
You made a good deal.

332
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,540
Could you excuse us for a second?

333
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,109
Sure. Now that the rest has been
paid, please take your time.

334
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll put these together
and give them back to you.

335
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:46,320
You just bagged a fortune,
but you don't look so happy.

336
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:49,389
Do you hate to
part with the land so much?

337
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:51,550
The land meant so much to Su Ryeon.

338
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,990
To think that it ended up
in the hands of scum like you.

339
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,830
You got paid for the land.

340
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,399
You don't have to pretend
to be loyal to a dead person.

341
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,800
You almost fooled me.

342
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Don't you feel sorry
for Su Ryeon at all?

343
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,000
She looked after your children...

344
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,169
like her own for 17 years.

345
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:14,379
What did you do
while impersonating her?

346
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:17,810
What is your relationship
with Jung Doo Man?

347
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,520
What do you have on him...

348
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,480
that made him hand over all
the development information to you?

349
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,850
Do you want to know?

350
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,590
Too bad.

351
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:29,659
I couldn't tell you...

352
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,629
after you installed a spy app
on my phone and invaded my privacy.

353
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:37,399
You look like a backstabber.

354
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,169
A betrayer.

355
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,869
What? Are you feeling guilty?

356
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,850
You're not taking revenge
because you feel sorry for Su Ryeon.

357
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,080
You're just upset
that Dan Tae betrayed you.

358
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,820
The moment Dan Tae reaches out,

359
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,389
you'll take his hand.

360
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,560
You know
what a despicable jerk he is,

361
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,429
but you still felt drawn to him
because he's rich and well-mannered.

362
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,929
Did you want a penthouse so badly?

363
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,699
You were jealous of Su Ryeon.

364
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,840
You have no right to lecture me!

365
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:17,469
I'm being cruelly punished for that.

366
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:21,010
Even my child died.
What more can I do?

367
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:23,280
Tell me how I can atone
for what I've done.

368
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm ready to kill myself or him!

369
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,520
I have a question.

370
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,389
You said you were with Su Ryeon
when she died.

371
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:36,990
Then you must have heard.

372
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,060
What were her last words?

373
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,129
Did she leave any message?

374
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:46,469
There's no message
she left for you, so forget it.

375
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,340
What about for her children?

376
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,469
I just think I should know...

377
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,280
in case they ask me later.

378
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,879
She raised them after all.

379
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,419
She told me to run away.

380
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,330
"Run away"?

381
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,730
"Go."

382
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,070
"Run. Right now."

383
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:21,169
After what I did to her,
she told me to run away.

384
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,169
I betrayed her and wanted her dead.

385
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:26,540
And she told me to run away.

386
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,419
Yes. You're right.

387
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,189
I leeched off Su Ryeon
just like you did.

388
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,990
We have no right
to criticize each other.

389
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,290
All we can do is
wait for our punishment.

390
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,300
Yoon Hee.

391
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,530
It sounds crazy,
but can you trust me for once?

392
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,270
I have a great plan...

393
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,409
to finish off Dan Tae.

394
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,449
What did you just say?

395
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:06,980
You want to get back at him.

396
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Then do it.

397
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:11,290
I'll take his money.

398
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,189
But you can't tell anyone...

399
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:17,530
about me.

400
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,399
What do you say? Deal?

401
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,899
Forget it. I don't trust you.

402
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,310
What if I leave this to you?

403
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,179
Protect your daughter yourself.

404
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:44,889
You must protect your child
at all costs.

405
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:46,889
Since you're her mom.

406
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,330
At times, isn't it okay for a mom
to become evil for her child's sake?

407
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,260
A mother should be ready...

408
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,169
to do anything for her child,
remember?

409
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600

do anything for their children.

to his study again!

What do I do?

Na Ae Gyo?

437

Why did you come here?

438
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:19,840
What if Joo Dan Tae sees you?

I have to get going right now.
Our kids are in danger.

440
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:24,250
That's why I'm here.

441
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:27,050
I'll head into the penthouse.

442
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,919
Are you kidding me?

443
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,020
I told you over the phone.

will do to them.

That's why I'm saying
that I'll go instead.

Get out of my way.

452
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,050
I just want to see the kids.

453
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,149
I'm leaving Korea soon.

454
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:09,119
I won't ever come back.

455

waiting at the airport.

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,889
Leave with him.

471
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,820
I'll scream, "Run!"

472
00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:52,129
Then, don't look back...

473
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,000

What are you saying?

489
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:38,600
Run.

490
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,069
That...

No way!

500
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,170
So, Oh Yoon Hee killed Su Ryeon?

501
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,009
That witch! You don't even deserve
to be called a human!

502
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,409
- My goodness.
- How could she?

503
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,580
- I don't believe it.
- No way.

504
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,949
- Oh Yoon Hee killed her?
- I can't believe it.

505

Na Ae Gyo?

506
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:33,420
This can't be true.

507
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,409
Get her!

514

The coffee smells
especially good today.

515
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,909
That's enough, Dad.

516
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,920
You think she should be here
in an apron like that?

517
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,049
Bring our maids back.

518
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,449
It's fine. I'm fine on my own.

519
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,989
I won't be eating at home anymore,

520
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:20,989
so you don't need to cook my food.

521
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,960
Sit down.

522
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,330
Did I teach you to be so rude
at the table?

523
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,839
I didn't learn anything from you.

524

00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:35,040

526
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,110
No need to cook my food either.

527
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,980
Might as well go on a diet.

528

What have you been doing to the kids
that they've become so rude?

529
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:53,529
Is it so hard to cook your food
to their taste?

530
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,699
You have to care for them like you
would for Eun Byeol!

531
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:58,699
I'll try harder.

532
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:00,730
I've never done
anything like this before,

533
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:03,239
but once I get used to it,
I'm sure I'll do well.

534

Why have you become...

535
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,380
so obedient?

536
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,210
What made you change your mind?

537
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,420
As long as you promise me
that you won't mess with Eun Byeol,

538
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,889
I'll try to listen to you
as much as I can.

all that difficult.

00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:27,730
I won't see Eun Byeol
without your permission either.

541
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,969
Do you mean it?

542
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:37,799
Just let Ro Na's case close...

543
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,239
with Ha Yoon Chul taking the blame.

544
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:42,170
Then, as you have asked for,

545
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,480
I'll give you everything,
including Cheong A Medical Center.

546
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:48,409
I'll think about it.

547
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:51,049
Thank you.

548
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,360
See? There you go.

549
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,659
How beautiful is it to admit defeat?

550
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,299
I'm having a great morning,
all thanks to you.

551
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:23,009
Sure. Laugh all you want.

552
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,080
If I have to die to get out of here,

553
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,449
I'll kill you too.

554
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:33,690
Goodness.

555
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,630
Have you looked into it?

556
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,270
What are you doing? Tell me already!

557
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,239
This is confidential information...

558
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,940
from the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport.

559
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,080
I think it's true...

560
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,380
that Cheonsoo District is
being redeveloped in secret.

561
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,549
When?

562
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,350
The plans may be announced
this week at the earliest.

563
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,690
This week? That quickly?

564
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,759
Hey, then...

565
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:11,199
who has Joo Dan Tae's back?

566
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:14,500
He's known Jung Doo Man
for a very long time.

567
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,869
Jung Doo Man?

568
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,339
That's some powerful string
he's got.

569
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:23,380
Mr. Jung politely declined.

570
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:28,350
Is he trying to say that this is
not good enough or what?

571
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:32,179
Or is he trying to cut ties with me?

572
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,150
Kyu Jin is here!

573
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,089
Where are your manners?

574
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,730
You can't just come in
without calling in advance.

575
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,699
I'm a busy man.

576
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,060
Why?

577
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,500
Because you need to go and buy
more land in Cheonsoo District?

578
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,469
My gosh.

579
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,940
What do you mean, buy more land?

580
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,810
I sold all my properties.
This house is all I have.

581
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,409
Don't make rumors.

582
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:04,920
No, you sold all your properties
to buy more in Cheonsoo District.

583
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,989
You hired a representative...

584
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:10,060
to buy lot 27
for 50 million dollars recently too.

585
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,589
You should've offered
a higher price if you wanted it.

586
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:15,230
The rich getting richer.
Isn't that how the world works?

587
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:18,230
Kyu Jin is a little disappointed.

588
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:21,529
Where is our Hera Club bond?

589
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,739
I hear that the redevelopment will
be announced this week.

590
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,409
Where did you hear that?

591
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:30,210
I'm Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin,
in the district of Gangnam!

592
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,110
You think I don't have my sources?

593
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:36,250
Brother!

594
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,449
Just hand me over a few good ones.

595
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:42,850
I'll give you the best prices.

596
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,290
I'd love to do that,

597
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,089
but one must always be careful,

598
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,100
and not be so tied down by money.

599
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,100
And a politician must live
an honest life,

600
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:54,830
don't you think so?

601
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,969
You starved in protest...

602
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,940
of real estate speculation,

603
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,440
so imagine how betrayed
your people would feel...

604
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,509
to find out that you're drooling
over some properties...

605
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,210
and trying to participate
in real estate speculation yourself.

606
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,310
I guess you don't need
that golden badge anymore.

607
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:11,319
Hey! This is personal.

608
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:14,150
How can you use the public
against me? That's a betrayal.

609
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,520
You don't think I can buy any land
without you?

610
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,290
"Any" land?

611
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,190
If you're so confident,
go out and buy some yourself.

612
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:25,330
Why are you coming to me
and begging me for it?

613
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,230
All right. It's on.

614
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,600
If this is how it's going to go,
I'm going to buy as much as I can.

615
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,969
Don't regret it later,
you greedy pig,

616
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:35,409
no, you swindler!

617
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,619
Idiot. That won't happen.

618
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,480
The announcement is happening
in just two days.

619
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,449
The game's over.

620
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:56,429
Here. I've even brought my son's
gold ring from his first birthday!

621
00:43:56,429 --> 00:43:59,100
Give me whatever is left
in the Cheonsoo District!

622
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,000
I'll take any land that's left.

623
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,869
There must be a garbage dump left
or something!

624
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,739
I'm going to suspend this place
if you don't give me anything.

625
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:09,770
How many times do I need
to tell you?

626
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,239
There's really no more land left.

627
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,380
That's why we're pleading you.

628
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,880
Talk to the landlords, Mr. Hwang.

629
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,449
You can't call him Mr. Hwang.

630
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:24,259
Call him Sir Hwang Geum Bong.

631
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,420
Whatever.

632
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,089
I'm Red Pants.

633
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:31,860
I'm the queen who's turned...

634
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,130
a mulberry field into
a 15-story condo!

635
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,799
Everyone in this industry knows...

636
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,940
that my mother-in-law is
the big hand here!

637
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,869
If you give us something good,

638
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:42,770
we'll make sure to return the favor.

639
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,940
We'll triple the brokerage fee.
Please!

640
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,009
Yes, please!

641
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:50,380
I don't know what to do.

642
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:57,560
Don't you ever tell anyone this.

643
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:00,659
You're the only one I'm telling.

644
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,860
- What is it?
- Come closer.

645
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,199
They're going to build
a sports complex on this land.

646
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,110
Nobody saw, right?

647
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,940
Don't worry about it.

648
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,009
I came in through the back door.

649
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,610
So, what's this land
that's up for sale?

650
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,020
It's a golden spot. They're building
a high-end mall here.

651
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,250
You'll never see a listing
quite like this.

652
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:33,219
Why is the landlord putting
this land up for sale, then?

653
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:35,830
She took out a loan
from a loan shark...

654
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,529
and got caught by her husband.

655
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,469
Really? That's unfortunate.

656
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,069
I'll buy all of this. Okay?

657
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,110
I heard that there's some good land.

658
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,920
Here. These are
100-percent gold bars.

659
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,589
This is the letter of guarantee.

660
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,150
Sell the land to me.

661
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,389
(Golden Real Estate)

662
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:12,529
(Golden Real Estate)

663
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,009
I sealed the deal...

664
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,009
with the highest price.

665
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,179
Great work.

666
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:30,779
Please sell the rest
of the properties to them as well.

667
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,520
Everything under my name.

668
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,960
And please have them pay
upfront in cash.

669
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,130
(Gangnam Police Station)

670
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:54,440
Had she known that
her birth father killed her...

671
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:59,409
What are you saying?

672
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:05,080
Apologize to Ro Na sincerely
for just once.

673
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:08,449
I feel so bad for my daughter,
who never even got...

674
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,290
to be treated like your daughter.

675
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,319
You can do that much, can't you?

676
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,799
I found out after we broke up...

677
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:21,630
that I was pregnant with Ro Na.

678
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,299
You were already engaged to Seo Jin.

679
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:26,909
I couldn't go back to you.

680
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:30,339
I rushed to marry someone else.
Of course,

681
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
I told him I was pregnant.

682
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:35,509
He liked me a lot,

683
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,449
and promised to love my baby too.

684
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:41,750
But once he saw the baby
that wasn't like him at all,

685
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,920
he changed.

686
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,790
He never came home...

687
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,460
and wouldn't even look at her.

688
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,790
Poor Ro Na had a very sad childhood.

689
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,799
She never received any love.

690
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,610
No. It can't be.

691
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,020
Why... Why wouldn't I
recognize my own child?

692
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:14,690
She's lying.

693
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,719
She's lying. She's lying.
She's lying!

694
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,119
Hey, you.

695
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:22,529
Have some manners
for your cellmates.

696
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:24,029
- Hey.
- Have you gone crazy?

697
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:26,199
Stay down, will you?

698
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:27,869
Shut your own mouth!

699
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:29,469
- You jerk.
- Hey.

700
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:34,509
Do you have a death wish?

701
00:48:34,509 --> 00:48:35,739
Yes, kill me.

702
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:37,139
I want to die like crazy!

703
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:38,540
Why you...

704
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,049
You...

705
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,279
You jerk.

706
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:44,619
- Step on him.
- Okay.

707
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:46,020
You jerk.

708
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,920
You jerk.

709
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,619
Keep it down!

710
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:55,360
You jerk.

711
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,500
Hit me more.

712
00:48:57,759 --> 00:48:59,960
Hit me more, you jerks.

713
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:02,199
- You psycho!
- Hey.

714
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:04,000
Hey!

715
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,969
You jerk.

716
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:07,339
Hey.

717
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:08,509
Stop it.

718
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:09,710
- Separate.
- Let go!

719
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,239
Stop it.

720
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,639
Darn it.

721
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:15,250
You jerks.

722
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:19,619
Kill me.

723
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,819
Kill me!

724
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,830
Goodness.

725
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:37,839
Oh my gosh.

726
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,339
What's your problem?

727
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:40,639
Why are you here?

728
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,509
Don't you have a TV?

729
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:46,009
I'm too nervous to watch alone.

730
00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:47,679
Today's the day, right?

731
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:51,279
You acted like
you were Oh Yoon Hee's friend,

732
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,020
but it was all one-sided.

733
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,449
See? There's no friendship
when it comes to land and money.

734
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:59,389
Fine. I agree. You're right.

735
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:02,029
I learned a lot from this.

736
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:04,130
You shouldn't be nice
to just anyone.

737
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:07,270
That's why I came back
to my old stomping ground.

738
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,469
- Be quiet.
- Include me.

739
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:10,699
Sorry.

740
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,000
The news is about to start.

741
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:13,400
Raise the volume.

742
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:15,610
Okay.

743
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,239
They officially announced...

744
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:19,679
the plans to develop a new town...

745
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:21,449
in Cheonsoo District.

746
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:24,279
Here's the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport.

747
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,750
Hello.

748
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,150
I'm Minister Kim Ki Song.

749
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,089
Today...

750
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:39,600
- Kyu Jin! Well done!
- Oh my gosh!

751
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,770
Let's celebrate!

752
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:50,639
Let's go!

753
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,380
- Here we go.
- Oh my gosh!

754
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,779
Hey! Do you know what this is?

755
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:58,380
Russo-Baltique Vodka.

756
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,350
Vodka!

757
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,360
It costs
1.3 million dollars a bottle!

758
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,190
Mom! We should drink stuff like this
to say we're millionaires!

759
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,299
- Me too!
- Yes!

760
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:21,069
I'm rich now!

761
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,610
The related industries
can't hide their excitement...

762
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,549
about the unexpected announcement
regarding the development project.

763
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:30,679
Cheonsoo District, which was
selected for the development...

764
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:33,179
I own 70 percent
of Cheonsoo District.

765
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:36,589
There were many speculations
and expectations.

766
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:40,219
Everything is absolutely perfect.

767
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:43,589
It was more shocking
because it was a surprise.

768
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,000
The construction consulting results
came out today as well.

769
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,100
The government plans to change
the permitted use of the land...

770
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,199
and had the consulting firm
examine deregulation as well.

771
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,639
Cheonsoo District will undergo
major redevelopment...

772
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:58,940
and is predicted to become
the new center of Gangnam.

773
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,350
The government plans
to build a new city...

774
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,409
that includes residential
and commercial areas...

775
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:04,580
The person you have reached is
unavailable.

776
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,119
- Please leave a message...
- It will be at the forefront...

777
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:10,150
The value of the real estate
in the district is expected...

778
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,389
to skyrocket...

779
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:13,790
following the announcement.

780
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,529
We expect
many people will be interested,

781
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:19,659
so we will keep updating you
as we receive more information.

782
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:25,299
What is it?

783
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,040
We have no reason
to see each other anymore.

784
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:30,980
I never knew
there would come a day...

785
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,040
when you actually help me.

786
00:52:38,449 --> 00:52:40,850
What are you getting at?

787
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:43,489
I'm in a good mood.

788
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:44,889
I don't want to ruin it.

789
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:47,830
If you're bored
because you have no one to talk to,

790
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,500
your friend is in the kitchen.
Go talk to her.

791
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,199
I guess you weren't confident...

792
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:55,900
about the Cheonsoo District
development either.

793
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:58,799
How could you cancel the contract...

794
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:00,299
the day before the announcement?

795
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,639
I canceled the contract?

796
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:06,940
Didn't you know?

797
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,980
Na Ae Gyo suddenly
notified me last night...

798
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,520
that she was canceling the contract.

799
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:16,250
I know you wanted it for a while.

800
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,020
So I came to ask
why you changed your mind.

801
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,690
What are you talking about?

802
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,029
She said she needed the cash
urgently.

803
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:29,429
She seemed desperate,

804
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:31,299
so I didn't even charge her
the penalty.

805
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:35,009
Although it's for the best for me...

806
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:38,509
since they suddenly announced
the development plan.

807
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:40,909
No one can cancel the contract
without my permission.

808
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:42,549
I never canceled it.

809
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:47,119
Then did Na Ae Gyo deceive you?

(Golden Real Estate)

811
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,929
You must've trusted her
a great deal.

812
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:05,000
Enough to bet your all.

813
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:07,440
That was so unlike you.

How dare you take off with my money?

817
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,790
I'll kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

818
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:43,469
Did you locate her?

819
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,909
She is at the real estate agency
in Cheonsoo District.

820
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:47,909
I instructed the guards
to keep her there.

How dare you sell my land
without my permission?

They're in my name, so they're mine.

Are you finally
showing your true colors?

830
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,529
You really did try to betray me
since two years ago.

Have you lost your mind?

Why did you do this? Why?

833
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:43,529
I trusted you.

834
00:55:43,529 --> 00:55:45,639
I should be compensated for living
in Shim Su Ryeon's shadow...

898
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,369
I asked you to bring me drinks
ages ago.

899
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,540
Who are you
so desperately looking for?

900
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,380
Who is this Na Ae Gyo?

901
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:31,219
Why? Are you
going to find her for me?

902
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:37,020
Slow down. You'll get drunk.

903
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:39,960
Stop getting on my nerves
and get lost.

904
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:56,909
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

905
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:59,080
Darn it. Seriously.

906
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,310
Na Ae Gyo, that witch.

907
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,549
The cottage and the airport...

908
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:12,589
are being watched by Dan Tae's men.

909
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,429
I was prepared for that.

910
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:26,540
Bring the money to the storage
by 10 p.m. and I'll spare your life.

911
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,339
It's time.

912
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,690
Everything will be okay.

913
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,960
Don't worry.

914
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:34,469
Hello?

915
01:03:34,969 --> 01:03:37,509
Joo Dan Tae is trying to kill me.

916
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,179
Save me.

917
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:43,150
Where am I?

918
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,049
Let me see.

919
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,409

(Chamsarang Pet Funeral Home)

921
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,089
(Chamsarang Pet Funeral Home)

922
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:23,040
Gosh.

923
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,250
How are you feeling?

924
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:35,119
What happened yesterday?

925
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:37,920
You blacked out
because you drank too fast.

926
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:40,089
Should I make some soup?

927
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,190
No, you don't have to.

928
01:06:42,889 --> 01:06:44,360
My head is splitting.

929
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,429
Why can't I remember anything?

930
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:49,429
I didn't drink that much.

931
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,600
Where's my phone?
I couldn't find it in the room.

932
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,569
I haven't seen it.
Should I call it?

933
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,650
This is a search and
seizure warrant.

934
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:13,520
Dan Tae!

935
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,290
- Don't step on this.
- Dan Tae!

936
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,659
Dan Tae! Dan Tae!

937
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:20,960
Don't step on this either.

938
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,969
- Search the place.
- These people...

939
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,500
Joo Dan Tae, correct?

940
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,509
I am.

941
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:30,270
You are under arrest...

942
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,639
for murder and desecration
of a human corpse.

943
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:33,779
Cuff him.

944
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,350
What are you talking about?

945
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,719
- Whom did I kill?
- Stop it.

946
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:40,350
Are you people out of your minds?

947
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,219
Na Ae Gyo died last night.

948
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,159
Ae Gyo died?

949
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:49,389
Oh my gosh.

950
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:50,759
Let's talk at the station.

951
01:07:51,759 --> 01:07:52,759
Wait.

952
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,529
Dan Tae. What's going on?

953
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,100
You killed a person?

954
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,699
You didn't right? Talk to me!

955
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,710
He has a soft heart.
He can't even kill a bug.

956
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,639
- There must be a mistake.
- Let go!

957
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:08,509
Can you confirm where he was
last night?

958
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:10,449
You know...

959
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:12,279
I came home early and went to sleep.

960
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:13,480
Tell them.

961
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:17,719
We use separate rooms,
so I'm not positive.

962
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,089
I know he was drunk...

963
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:21,589
and very upset.
That's all I know...

964
01:08:21,589 --> 01:08:25,299
Wait. He kept calling someone.

965
01:08:25,699 --> 01:08:26,759
Who?

966
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:29,530
He said, "Na Ae Gyo."

967
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,329
Why you... Have you gone mad?

968
01:08:31,329 --> 01:08:32,339
Let go of me!

969
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,370
I did not kill her.

970
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,539
Show me proof!

971
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:37,169
I won't go anywhere until you do.

972
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:39,709
Call my secretary. Get my lawyer!

973
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,940
Darn it.

974
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,709
We found this in the chimney.

975
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:44,679
Oh my gosh.

976
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:47,079
A partially burned glove,
raincoat, and shoes.

977
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,690
- Take it as evidence.
- Yes, sir.

978
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:52,190
It wasn't me.
I've never even seen that before.

979
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,889
I saw muddy footprints...

980
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:56,030
by the door this morning,

981
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,690
so I thought it was strange.

982
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,129
Did you really kill that woman?

983
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,370
The kids' biological mom?

984
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:07,370
How do you know...

985
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,209
who Ae Gyo is?

986
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:11,410
Take him away.

987
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,919
Your car was clearly caught
on camera...

988
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,589
in front of the warehouse
and the crematorium.

989
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,789
You ran over the victim
and killed her,

990
01:09:59,789 --> 01:10:01,990
took her to the crematorium,
and burned her body, correct?

991
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:05,299
The owner of the crematorium
already confessed...

992
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,100
to taking money from you
and letting you use it anonymously.

993
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,639
I did no such thing.

994
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,740
This is insane.

995
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,070
I got drunk last night...

996
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,980
and slept in my room.

997
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,079
I never went outside.

998
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:22,079
How could I have killed someone?

999
01:10:22,249 --> 01:10:24,919
If you don't believe me,
ask my wife, Cheon Seo Jin.

1000
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:27,520
Cheon Seo Jin said
she can't confirm that.

1001
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,520
What?

1002
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:32,759
She's lying.

1003
01:10:32,759 --> 01:10:34,419
I am innocent.

1004
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:37,129
You're falling for
a ridiculous ploy.

1005
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:39,259
I swear I never went
to the warehouse...

1006
01:10:39,259 --> 01:10:40,959
or the crematorium.

1007
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,799
If you don't trust me,
check Hera Palace's cameras.

1008
01:10:43,799 --> 01:10:45,900
See if I left the building
last night.

1009
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,940
Around what time did you discover
the muddy footprints?

1010
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,579
I saw them when I went
to get the paper,

1011
01:10:53,009 --> 01:10:56,280
so it was probably around 5 a.m.

1012
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:59,150
Then he did leave
in the middle of the night.

1013
01:10:59,549 --> 01:11:00,719
The strange thing is,

1014
01:11:00,919 --> 01:11:03,520
there is no record
of him leaving the building...

1015
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:07,120
after 8 p.m. in any of
Hera Palace's security videos.

1016
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:11,700
Is there another way out?

1017
01:11:17,469 --> 01:11:18,669
It's a murder.

1018
01:11:19,469 --> 01:11:21,139
You have to tell us the truth.

1019
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,950
What did he do here?

1020
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:41,759
This is where he punished
his children.

1021
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,730
I only found out recently...

1022
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,030
after we got married.

1023
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:48,299
Photograph everything.

1024
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,700
Yes, sir.

1025
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:52,169
And here.

1026
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,600
This is a way out
of the building...

1027
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,539
without passing the fountain.

1028
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:00,039
There's an elevator
that leads directly to the garage.

1029
01:12:00,339 --> 01:12:04,209
Then he may have used this
to leave last night.

1030
01:12:07,879 --> 01:12:10,219
Call the captain. Tell him
we found the secret passage.

1031
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:11,219
Yes, sir.

1032
01:12:13,419 --> 01:12:15,929
He may have hidden important clues,

1033
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:17,030
so search everything.

1034
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:19,900
There's something in here.

1035
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:22,629
It's an urn.

1036
01:12:23,169 --> 01:12:25,539
Oh my gosh! It can't be!

1037
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:27,700
Send it to NFS right away.

1038
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,440
Find out if there's any DNA left.

1039
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,539
- Rush it.
- Yes, sir.

1040
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,980
Hey.

1041
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:37,810
Okay.

1042
01:12:40,879 --> 01:12:42,549
They found human ashes...

1043
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,919
in your study.

1044
01:12:46,419 --> 01:12:47,719
Ashes?

1045
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,589
What ridiculous gibberish is that?

1046
01:12:50,589 --> 01:12:52,900
Why would there be ashes in my home?

1047
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,200
I heard you said
you'd kill Na Ae Gyo.

1048
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,530
We have a witness.

1049
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:01,839
What witness?

1050
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:04,509
I slept all day. Who saw me? Where?

1051
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,209
I'm a witness.

1052
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:12,879
I heard you say
you'd kill Na Ae Gyo.

1053
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:14,219
I heard it clearly.

1054
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,919
Oh Yoon Hee.

1055
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:24,060
What is this gibberish?

1056
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:30,929
I met with him yesterday morning
in his penthouse.

1057
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,740
He was extremely angry at Na Ae Gyo.

1058
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:37,610
The look in his eyes was terrifying.

1059
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,240
So I recorded it just in case.

1060
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:45,120
My money...
How dare you take off with my money?

1061
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,480
I'll kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

1062
01:13:48,889 --> 01:13:50,520
You have a clear motive,

1063
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,459
and all the circumstances
point to you.

1064
01:13:52,459 --> 01:13:54,419
Will you still deny it?

1065
01:13:54,419 --> 01:13:56,990
Oh Yoon Hee. You...

1066
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,009
Search thoroughly.

1067
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:14,079
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1068
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:22,419
(Police)

1069
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,370
Hey. Move this.

1070
01:14:57,789 --> 01:14:58,789
Help me.

1071
01:15:01,389 --> 01:15:03,690
I'm sorry. Please don't kill me.

1072
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,730
It's okay. We're the police.

1073
01:15:06,129 --> 01:15:07,959
It's okay. We're the police.

1074
01:15:14,169 --> 01:15:15,410
What's your name?

1075
01:15:20,339 --> 01:15:22,110
I'm Shim Su Ryeon.

1076
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:26,419
Were you locked in here?

1077
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,450
Joo Dan Tae...

1078
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,389
locked us in here.

1079
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,660
How long have you been here?

1080
01:15:39,499 --> 01:15:41,100
What's today's date?

1081
01:16:09,759 --> 01:16:12,160
(The Penthouse 2)

1082
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:13,600
Who's alive?

1083
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,400
Shim Su Ryeon. She's back.

1084
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,700
- It's payback.
- Don't give me that.

1085
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,999
He lost his money, he was betrayed,
and he became a murderer.

1086
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:22,370
You won't rot in jail alone.

1087
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,009
What did we do wrong?

1088
01:16:24,009 --> 01:16:25,539
It's time to give back
what I received.

1089
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,339
I want a divorce.

1090
01:16:27,339 --> 01:16:28,549
I won't go down alone.

1091
01:16:28,549 --> 01:16:30,549
Don't leave me again.

1092
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:33,179
You must protect your child
at all costs.

1093
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:34,350
Since you're her mom.
