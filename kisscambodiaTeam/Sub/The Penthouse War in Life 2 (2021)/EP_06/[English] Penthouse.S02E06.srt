to the stage to announce the winner.

3
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,649
A round of applause, please.

4
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,195
Where's Eun Byeol?

5
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:24,265
She took a lot of pills earlier.
Did she pass out somewhere?

6
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,020
- I don't see Bae Ro Na, either.
- Classical singing. Bronze award.

Why isn't she picking up?

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,445
They're announcing the winners now.

11
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:39,840
Be quiet.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,440
Everything is fine without her.
Would you please just shut it?

13
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,319
You were so good today.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,349
It was amazing.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,620
Here.

16
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,319
Thank you.

17
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,105
Do you want to get pasta with me
tomorrow?

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,306
I can wait for you
by the entrance after class.

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,529
I'm busy tomorrow.

20
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,769
I can wait.

21
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,029
I missed you too, Ro Na.

The recipient of the grand prize,
given to the singer who has...

24
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,980
the most-divine voice, is...

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,219
What I want is
the grand prize trophy.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,990
So regardless of whose name
you find in the envelope,

27
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,460
just call my name.

28
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,869

There's a dead body outside!

Someone is dead!

I'm sorry...

39
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,540
for taking your place.

40
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,769
Please forgive...

my mother.

42
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,810
Don't be sorry.

43
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,845
Over there!

Oh, my!

What happened?

47
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,750
- What's going on?
- No way!

48
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,790
Ro Na! What happened?

49
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:25,329

What are you doing here?

- What are you doing?
- Honey!

54
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,610
Can you do something?
Ro Na isn't answering.

55
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,190
Ro Na, open your eyes!

56
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,760
Ro Na, can you hear me?
You have to stay with us.

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,495
What are you doing?
Call an ambulance!

58
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,490
- Quick!
- Okay.

59

Hello? Could we get
an ambulance here quick?

60
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,546
We're at Cheong A Arts High School.
There's a student injured.

Don't look this way.

She's not breathing either.

a murder.

So it's in your best interest
to cooperate.

I was in the auditorium
from the moment the festival began.

155
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,440
I went to the bathroom only once.

156

You can confirm
with the people here.

157
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,749
Me too. I was in the same row
as my husband the entire time.

158
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:08,349
Chairman Joo. You were
the first person on the scene?

159
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,690
Is it a crime to run well?

160
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:12,366
And strictly put,

161
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,530
the janitor was the one
who first discovered the scene.

162
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,435
I ran over when I heard him scream.

163
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:19,700
All of us...

164
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,876
saw each other in the auditorium.

165
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,475
- Am I right?
- You're right.

166
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,046
We had coffee together
while the judges deliberated. Right?

167
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,746
- Right.
- The entire time.

168
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,855
Jenny says Eun Byeol wasn't in
the dressing room.

169
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,979
Shouldn't you question her first?

170
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,780
Come to think of it,

171
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,280
I haven't seen Eun Byeol
this entire time.

172
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,719
She wasn't in the field either.

173
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:45,790
She wasn't feeling well,
so she went home early.

174
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,459
She went home?

175
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,935
She went home without hearing
the grand prize announcement?

176
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,136
Eun Byeol would never do that.

177
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,030
She was a strong contender
for the grand prize.

178
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,105
She'd faint before she'd leave.

179
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,239
Did Eun Byeol take
a drug again today too?

180
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,646
You all know, right?
That she relies on drugs...

181
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,286
whenever she performs.

182
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,780
She wasn't feeling well
because she was nervous.

183
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:12,195
Are you suspecting
Eun Byeol right now?

184
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,950
No one is excluded.

185
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:16,550
Not you, not Eun Byeol.

186
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,550
Don't worry.

187
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,259
I'll see how she's feeling
and have her go in for questioning.

188
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:28,900
Your daughter Eun Byeol too.

189
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,700
Satisfied?

190
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,469
Let's let people with
solid alibis leave first.

191
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,609
(Police Line Do Not Cross)

192
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,579
This is the wing of a trophy.
It looks like the weapon used.

193
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,150
Trophy?

194
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,256
There were two stab wounds from
the trophy on her head and shoulder.

195
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,550
She lost especially a lot of blood
from her head.

196
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,520
Where's the rest of the trophy?

197
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,205
We couldn't find it at the scene.

198
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,530
We plan to focus the investigation
on finding the missing weapon.

199
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,599
We'll have to shut down the school
for the time being.

200
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,369
I'll help you as much as I can
as the school director.

201
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,085
Is there anyone from the school...

202
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,055
who had a grudge against the victim?

203
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,916
Seeing how
they rang the fire alarm...

204
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,786
to eliminate the evidence,

205
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,579
it may be someone who knows
the school very well.

206
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:21,680
Can you think of anyone?

207
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,766
What do you take the great
Cheong A Arts High School for?

208
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,190
Are you saying we were behind it?

209
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,999
Well, that's not it, but...

210
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,629
Please cooperate with us.

211
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,829
We will.

212
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,170
Why are you so on edge?

213
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,345
Why are you doing this?

214
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:47,416
Are you a detective?
Are you Ro Na's real dad?

215
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,386
Fine, try and find
the culprit for Ro Na.

216
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,119
Search the whole place
all night if you want.

(Intensive Care Unit)

218
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,160
(Restricted Area)

219
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,229
This is Ro Na's.

220
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,969
How is she? Did she wake up?

221
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,526
(Intensive Care Unit)

222
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,225
Are you Bae Ro Na's guardian?

223
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:04,089
She just woke up.

224
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,009
Ro Na, it's Mom.

225
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,009
Open your eyes.

226
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,819
Ro Na, I'm here.

227
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,360
Do you recognize me?

228
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,529
Ro Na.

229
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,975
Who did this to you?

230
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,830
Who on earth did this to you?

231
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,600
Ro Na.

232
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,469
This is yours.
You won the grand prize.

233
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,380
Recover quickly
so we can celebrate together.

234
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,850
Hang in there, okay?

235
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,749
Hang in there.

236
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,690
The trophy is Seol A's.

237
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,489
Give it to her.

238
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,860
I know I've been mean to you.

239
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,969
I'm sorry.

240
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,170
Ro Na.

241
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,316
Ro Na, wake up.

242
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,685
Ro Na!

243
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,180
Help!

244
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,495
Ro Na! No!

245
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,935
Wake up. Please don't die.

246
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,695
- Please move.
- Ro Na, please.

247
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:51,406
Ro Na, please don't die!

248
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,275
Ro Na, I'm sorry. Please.

249
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,106
- Ro Na, please.
- We're ready.

250
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,275
I'm sorry. Please don't die.

251
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:01,515
- Please.
- Defibrillator!

252
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,069
- Yes!
- Yoon Hee.

253
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,009
- No!
- Defibrillator!

254
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,525
No! Ro Na!

255
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,025
Ro Na, please.

256
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,856
Ro Na, I'm sorry.

257
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,826
- 200 joules charged.
- Ro Na.

258
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,495
Ro Na, please.

259
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,989
No! Please!

260
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,410
Why are you still up?

261
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,690
I want to ask you something.

262
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,459
It's about Ro Na.

263
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,759
Did you do it?

264
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,435
What are you talking about?

265
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,900
Why would I do such a thing?

266
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,569
You're lying.

267
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,499
I know you have something
to do with it.

268
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,215
Both when Seol A and Mom died,

269
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,779
you were calm like now. But...

270
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,410
I know.

271
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,080
Both Mom and Seol A...

272
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,519
were killed by you.

273
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,566
You killed my mom!
Why did you do that?

274
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,896
To marry that horrible woman?

275
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,130
Or is it because my mom
gave birth to Seol A?

276
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:36,529
If you harmed Ro Na too...

277
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,700
I never imagined
my son would be so delusional.

278
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:44,386
What's this nonsense?

279
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,440
Let go of him!

280
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,009
We're not your possessions.
You have no right to hit us.

281
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,650
I'm glad you're here.

282
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,219
I need to ask you something.

283
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,330
Do you know whose necklace this is?

284
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,090
It's Eun Byeol's.

285
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,229
She was wearing it
during the festival.

286
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,330
Why do you have it?

287
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,170
I found it on the floor.

288
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,709
Go to your rooms now.

289
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,705
Don't touch it.

290
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,660
It may be evidence.

291
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,100
- Assemblyman Lee.
- Show some respect.

292
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:46,499
Do you even know how much
a bunch of spinach costs?

293
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,779
So this belongs to Eun Byeol?

294
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:04,890
Where did it go? I was sure
that I put it in my pocket.

295
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,059
Where is it?

296
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,529
You're back.

297
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,370
You came home pretty late.

298
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,700
Something came up.

299
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,640
Did Eun Byeol have dinner?

300
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,279
No. As soon as she came home,
she took a shower and went to bed.

301
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,880
She was probably too tired to eat.

302
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,556
It's late. You should go to bed.

303
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,650
By the way, I can't find
Eun Byeol's dress anywhere.

304
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:40,465
She was wearing it when she came
home, but it's not in her wardrobe.

305
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,289
It must be somewhere.

306
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,890
Why is that so important
at this hour?

307
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:48,160
I see. Good night then.

308
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,309
Could it be...

309
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,840
No way. Eun Byeol would never.

310
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,249
It can't be.

311
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,090
(Secretary Do)

312
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,630
Secretary Do, how is Ro Na doing?

313
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,130
What?

314
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,729
There's no chance that...

315
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,840
she'll wake up?

316
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,870
Did you...

317
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,410
really do it?

318
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
What are you talking about?

319
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,556
I was just upset that
I didn't win the grand prize.

320
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,380
Then what's that?
Why is there blood on the dress?

321
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Tell me everything that happened.

322
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,190
What did you do to Ro Na?

323
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,529
Ro Na didn't die, did she?

324
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,759
No way. That's impossible.

325
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,799
She's made of steel.

326
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,576
No way. I don't believe it.

327
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,269
Pull yourself together
and answer my question.

328
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,069
Did you do it?

329
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,910
Answer me, Eun Byeol!

330
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:20,249
She kept taking things away from me.

331
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,019
She kept getting in my way
and badmouthed you.

332
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,090
That you slit her mom's throat.

333
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,090
That you lost to her mom.

334
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:36,975
But I had no plans to kill her.

335
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,340
I'm telling you the truth.
Believe me!

336
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,116
It's okay.

337
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,539
Get it together.

338
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,209
Calm down.

339
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,350
It's all over.

340
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,959
I'm a criminal.

341
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,630
The police will
come for me soon, right?

342
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,005
No. I should just turn myself in.

343
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:12,499
I want to just come clean.

344
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:16,285
It's all over for me,

345
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,816
college and singing!

346
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,910
No!

347
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,015
Your life won't be done.

348
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,086
I won't let it!

349
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm going to protect you.

350
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,826
It doesn't matter...

351
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,525
whether Ro Na lives or not.

352
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,950
You don't need to get involved.

353
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,366
If anyone asks,

354
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,035
just say you don't know.

355
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,366
Do you understand me?

356
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,475
What if someone saw?

357
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,700
There are surveillance cameras
all around the school too!

358
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,670
I'll take care of it.

359
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,509
Don't you worry.

360
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:56,225
I can dispose of this dress too.

361
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:57,309
I can do that.

362
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,450
That way, there's no proof.

363
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
The trophy.

364
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,019
The trophy?

365
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:10,029
Your trophy from
Cheong A Arts Festival.

366
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,130
Where did you put it?

367
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,930
In my locker at school.

368
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
What?

369
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:03,955
Another unfortunate
incident occurred...

370
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,995
at the famous Cheong A
Arts High School.

371
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,525
During the Cheong A Arts Festival,

372
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:10,995
known to be one of the key events
happening at the school,

373
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:13,265
the student that won
the grand prize...

374
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,535
fell into a coma...

375
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,836
before she could even get
to hold the trophy in her hands.

376
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,775
The police think that this was
likely to be a hate crime...

377
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,275
by a fellow student who is
jealous of her.

378
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,275
They're going to investigate...

379
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,475
and go through each person
who was present during the incident.

380
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,775
Meanwhile, Director Cheon Seo Jin
of Cheong A Foundation...

381
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,386
announced that all classes will
be held virtually...

382
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,610
and that the school will comply
with the police investigation.

383
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,729
Her brain damage is severe.

384
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,059
It'll be difficult.

385
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,959
You should prepare yourselves.

386
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Yoon Hee.

387
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:11,910
You can't stay like this.

388
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,479
I'll get you a room. Get some rest.

389
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,719
It's fine.

390
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,690
I need to find whoever did this
to my daughter.

391
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,029
What did the police say?

392
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,930
Have they still not found
any evidence?

393
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,700
They're looking into it,
but nothing so far.

394
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,700
The murderer was at school!

395
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,600
How can they not find anything?

396
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,809
I find it odd that the fire alarms
malfunctioned and went off.

397
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,380
I don't trust the police anymore.

398
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,249
I need to drive myself there
and see for myself.

399
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,319
You're too weak right now.

400
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,896
Let's just trust them and wait.

401
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,495
I've contacted someone I know
in the police to look after this.

402
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,195
I'll get a call as soon as they find
any evidence.

403
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:57,489
I can't trust anyone!

404
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,459
I'm going to find that murderer.

405
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:03,100
You think I'll just let them live
after hurting my daughter?

406
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,239
Yoon Chul,

407
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,380
what if something goes wrong
with Ro Na?

408
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,586
What if something bad happens?

409
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,819
I feel like I'm going to go insane.

410
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,590
What do I do?

411
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,059
What's going to happen to my Ro Na?

412
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,660
Yoon Hee!

413
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,806
Yoon Hee!

414
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,170
Call a doctor!

415
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:41,600
- Are you okay?
- Get her an oxygen mask!

416
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:57,620
Su Ryeon, please don't take Ro Na.

417
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,819
You can kill me instead.
Please don't take Ro Na.

418
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,789
Please.

419
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,499
(Sleep aid)

420
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,769
Don't think about anything.
Just sleep.

421
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:24,969
Did you see my phone?

422
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,356
I destroyed it just in case.

423
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,309
I'll get you a new one.

424
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:33,620
Stay away from your friends
for a while.

425
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,059
Remember.

426
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,229
What's past is past.

427
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,860
Once you sleep, it'll all be past.

428
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,789
Eun Byeol had it all along.

429
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:23,029
The evidence
that you killed her grandfather.

430
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,900
Did you enjoy
the video I sent you,

431
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:28,900
Ms. Cheon?

432
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,440
Who is this jerk?

433
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:35,209
Stop hiding and just show yourself!

434
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,549
So, did it become nothing?

435
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,080
What happened to Grandfather.

436
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:42,680
What do you mean?

437
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:47,235
I missed him so much.
That's why I took pills.

438
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,319
What are you saying?
You're not making any sense!

439
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,769
(No SIM Card)

440
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,250
When did you come?

441
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,190
Today.

442
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,860
How's Ro Na?

443
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,559
Is she still unconscious?

444
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,900
Cheon Seo Jin and Eun Byeol are
acting suspiciously.

445
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:10,739
Please tell me what you know.

446
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:18,440
I took this at 5 a.m. today.

447
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,810
Where is she going this early
in the morning?

448
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:24,050
With a bag in her hands?

449
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:28,726
What's weirder is that
she came back empty-handed.

450
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,789
Not only that, she was with Seo Jin.

451
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,989
Could that be...

452
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,530
I need to get the trophy first.

453
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,900
If we get caught, that's the end.

454
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,510
The police have finished
the investigation of the site.

455
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,126
- Are you sure?
- The initial investigation failed,

456
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,896
so they're struggling to find
any evidence.

457
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,590
There's minimal manning
and most are gone.

458
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,659
Let's go.

459
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:32,119
- Cheon Seo Jin?
- Cheon Seo Jin?

460
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,409
(Ha Eun Byeol)

461
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,750
Right?

462
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,019
Ms. Cheon.

463
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,289
What brings you here?

464
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,659
What are you doing here
at this hour?

465
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:21,599
Are you looking for something...

466
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,745
in this dark classroom
with nobody here?

467
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,869
Right. Something is fishy.

468
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,445
What are you
rummaging through like a thief?

469
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:31,809
Rummaging through? What?

470
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,219
What?

471
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,449
Those lockers behind you.

472
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,289
They look perfect
for hiding something.

473
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,230
- Get out of my way.
- That's right.

474
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,300
Let's open them up.

475
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,206
You start from the left.

476
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,469
I'll break the doors open
from the right.

477
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,880
Hold on!

478
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,960
I'll open Eun Byeol's.

479
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,110
What? There's nothing.

480
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,820
There aren't many left.

481
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,510
It's here!

482
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,650
Whose is it?

483
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,186
(Joo Seok Kyung)

484
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,820
Joo Seok Kyung! I knew it.

485
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,465
We have to get her!

486
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,429
Let's go. Quick!

487
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,170
What are you doing here?

488
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,750
Let me go!

489
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:58,265
Do you know who my mother is?

490
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:59,936
I'm not leaving!

491
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Father, where are you?
Seok Kyung is...

492
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,429
being arrested!

493
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,170
What happened to your hand?

494
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,570
I was rushing to open the locker.

495
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,840
How did you know?

496
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,269
Eun Byeol called.

497
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:19,486
Were you the one who rang
the fire alarm too?

498
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,650
No.

499
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,019
I had no idea then.

500
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,889
Is it really Eun Byeol?

501
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,929
Did Eun Byeol really
do that to Ro Na?

502
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:37,699
No, right?

503
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,500
I don't want to believe it either.

504
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,876
Why didn't you tell me?
You should've told me first!

505
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,440
How was I supposed to tell you?

506
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:48,409
You're Oh Yoon Hee's husband now.

507
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,325
I don't believe this.

508
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,920
How could my Eun Byeol do this?

509
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,619
It already happened.

510
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:04,789
We need to accept reality.

511
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,559
No. This can't be.

512
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:10,329
This can't be true.

513
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:13,699
You're the one who put the trophy
in Seok Kyung's locker.

514
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:17,070
You didn't want Eun Byeol
to get arrested either.

515
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,269
You've always been
a disappointing father.

516
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:23,909
Are you really going to
watch her ruin her life?

517
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,856
It's going to be proven very soon
that Seok Kyung didn't do it.

518
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,949
So, get yourself together!

519
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,480
Yoon Hee won't give up.

520
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:36,650
She's going to keep digging
until she finds the murderer.

521
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:41,590
In the end, she'll find out
that it's Eun Byeol.

522
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,559
Then, Eun Byeol's life is over.

523
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,539
Save her.

524
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,170
You're the only one...

525
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,170
who can save our Eun Byeol.

526
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,210
You're Eun Byeol's dad.

527
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,760
What am I supposed to do?

528
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,230
I can't do this anymore.

529
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,630
I feel so bad for Yoon Hee.

530
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,106
I'm going to go crazy,
looking at Ro Na like that!

531
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,400
Ro Na...

532
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,969
has no hope, anyway.

533
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,469
I heard from Dr. Jung...

534
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,710
that everything should be
decided by tomorrow.

535
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,809
Shouldn't those who are alive, live?

536
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:39,726
What are you trying to say?

537
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,690
There's only one way to stop
Yoon Hee from keep digging.

538
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,260
While Seok Kyung
earns us some time,

539
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,965
we have to make someone else
the murderer.

540
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:49,460
Cheon Seo Jin!

541
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:53,500
Eun Byeol is the only person
on my mind right now.

542
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,800
I'll only think about her.

543
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:57,369
I'm her mom,

544
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:01,909
and a mother must protect her baby.

545
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,440
If anything happens to Eun Byeol,

546
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,309
my life is over.

547
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,650
Darn it!

548
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,739
Why did you do that to Ro Na?

549
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:33,300
Did you hate her that much?

550
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,115
You should've just hated me.

551
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:38,039
Why did you take it out on Ro Na?
She was innocent!

552
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,110
- Why?
- Are you insane?

553
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,385
Why would I do that?

554
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:45,726
- Why did you...
- What are you doing?

555
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,865
Who are you to accuse my daughter?

556
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:49,526
Stay out of it!

557
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,590
Seok Kyung tried to kill Ro Na.

558
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,336
The bloody trophy was found
in Joo Seok Kyung's locker.

559
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,635
We deduce it to be the weapon
used to assault the victim,

560
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,300
so we had to question her.

561
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,900
The trophy?

562
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:03,900
I heard...

563
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:08,070
there was bad blood between you.
That you bullied Bae Ro Na.

564
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,170
You threw paint on her too.

565
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,940
And you locked her in the bathroom.

566
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,155
- That was...
- They're completely unrelated.

567
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:18,995
Seok Kyung did not do it.

568
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:20,420
I can prove it.

569
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:21,489
Detective.

570
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:24,460
We got the fingerprint results
from the trophy.

571
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,606
(Analysis Report)

572
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,130
There were many prints on it,

573
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,500
but Joo Seok Kyung's prints
were not among them.

574
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,969
See? I said it wasn't me!

575
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:45,015
Someone put it
in my locker to set me up.

576
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,555
Who? Why?

577
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:48,449
Probably someone who's mad at me.

578
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:51,750
Seok Kyung isn't the culprit.

579
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,925
We took this picture
in the dressing room...

580
00:44:55,949 --> 00:44:57,889
just before
the grand prize announcement.

581
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:00,429
Look. Seok Kyung is there too.

582
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,690
Is this enough proof?

583
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,329
Who's missing?

584
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:05,960
Ro Na and Eun Byeol.

585
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,599
We deduce the time of the incident
to be just before the announcement,

586
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,186
so Joo Seok Kyung wasn't it.

587
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,110
What do you people
take our family for?

588
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:19,715
This is defamation.

589
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:23,380
You'll have to answer for this.

590
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,320
Let's go.

591
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,630
Eun Byeol wasn't there.

592
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:41,445
Come to think of it,
Ms. Cheon picked up a necklace...

593
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:43,500
at the crime scene.

594
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,599
A necklace? What did it look like?

595
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,510
It was very fancy with a huge stone.

596
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:51,880
I think it was a sapphire.

597
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,160
I only took a glance at it,
so I don't remember.

598
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,179
Sapphire?

599
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,470
(I hope you win the grand prize.
Good luck. Dad.)

600
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:03,320
Didn't you know?

601
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,829
I assumed she gave it
to the police as evidence.

602
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:16,929
Yoon Hee.

603
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:20,245
Why are you so jumpy?

604
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:23,239
I didn't know you were here.

605
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,870
Didn't you go to the hospital?

606
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,179
I came to get some things.

607
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,980
Where did you go?

608
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,495
To the office.
I have a lot of work piled up...

609
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:36,050
since I haven't been going in.

610
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,190
How did things go
at the police station?

611
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,789
Seok Kyung's fingerprints
weren't on the trophy.

612
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:46,360
I see.

613
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:49,599
Any other evidence?

614
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,039
It wasn't Seok Kyung.

615
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:58,110
I think someone tried
to frame her for it.

616
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,050
Who would do such a thing?

617
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,489
I know.

618
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,530
I'm going to Ro Na.

619
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:23,530
Rest at home.

620
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:24,869
Okay.

621
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,309
Yoon Hee. Tell me if you're tired.

622
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,909
I'll relieve you.

623
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:43,750
It isn't you, is it? Yoon Chul,

624
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,789
you can't do that to Ro Na.

625
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,190
You can't.

626
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,699
Eun Byeol. Why did you do it?

627
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,170
Why did you do that to me,
Eun Byeol?

628
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:05,210
Eun Byeol.
Why did you do that to me?

629
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,849
Go with me.

630
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:37,356
Ms. Cheon isn't home yet.

631
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,385
It doesn't matter.
I'm here to see Eun Byeol.

632
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:41,380
She isn't feeling well...

633
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:47,349
How do you feel?

634
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,590
I heard you were sick.

635
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,659
I guess you are. You look terrible.

636
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,659
I'm fine.

637
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:57,190
But... What brings you here?

638
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,900
You heard about Ro Na, right?

639
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,139
- Yes.
- I wanted to ask you something.

640
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,969
Did you see Ro Na...

641
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,940
just before the announcement?

642
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,679
No.

643
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,010
They said...

644
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:17,769
only the two of you
weren't in the dressing room.

645
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:20,849
Where were you?

646
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,219
I wasn't feeling well,
so I was in the infirmary.

647
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,590
Really?

648
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,500
You saw Ro Na, didn't you?

649
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,500
Tell me the truth.

650
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:40,646
What happened between you two?

651
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,369
Tell me the truth now!

652
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,039
What are you doing?

653
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,179
What are you doing to a sick girl?

654
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,119
Why is Eun Byeol sick?

655
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:55,365
- What?
- She used that as an excuse...

656
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:57,460
to avoid police questioning.

657
00:49:58,059 --> 00:49:59,920
That's why I came to ask her myself.

658
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,590
Ha Eun Byeol. Answer me.

659
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:05,000
You saw Ro Na that day, didn't you?

660
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:06,635
Tell me the truth.

661
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:08,305
What did you do to Ro Na?

662
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:09,500
Tell me now!

663
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:14,369
I don't know. I don't know anything.

664
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,570
Stop it!

665
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:17,686
Stop harassing my daughter
and get out of here now.

666
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,710
Get out!

667
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,856
- Get out!
- I know you're lying.

668
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,510
- Get out!
- Tell me what you did to Ro Na!

669
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,856
Get out!

670
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Get off!

671
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,789
Are you going down the list
and suspecting all the kids here?

672
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,635
First Seok Kyung, now Eun Byeol?

673
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,690
Seok Kyung has a solid alibi.

674
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,706
The only person without an alibi
is your daughter.

675
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,900
That's for the police to decide.

676
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:43,869
Right.

677
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:47,369
Why hasn't Eun Byeol
returned her dress?

678
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:49,909
What?

679
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:52,316
I went to the dress shop earlier.

680
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,740
Eun Byeol's dress was the only one
that hasn't been returned.

681
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:57,425
Can I see it?

682
00:50:57,449 --> 00:50:58,550
You're insane.

683
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,965
Why must I show that to you?

684
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:03,420
You're right. I'm insane.

685
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,019
My baby is lying in the hospital
like that. How could I not be?

686
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,460
I have to see that dress.

687
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,730
You have it, don't you?

688
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,969
Why? Do you think the dress
has blood on it or something?

689
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,699
You like being thorough.

690
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,686
Where's the dress?

691
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,840
Ms. Jin! Bring Eun Byeol's dress.

692
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,840
Yes, ma'am.

693
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,559
Here it is.

694
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,130
You're delusional and paranoid.

695
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,670
Why don't you spend this time
looking after your child?

696
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:51,840
Ms. Jin. Our guest is leaving.

697
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:28,070
(The 28th Cheong A Art Festival)

698
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:30,539
Make this exact same dress.

699
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,686
I need it by tonight no matter what.

700
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,940
Yes, ma'am.

701
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:46,736
Yoon Hee came to my house.

702
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,760
She even asked for
Eun Byeol's dress.

703
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:50,789
She suspects Eun Byeol.

704
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,960
What if she finds out the truth?

705
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,745
Please do something.

706
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:59,170
Find a way, okay?

707
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:32,015
The Cheong A Arts High School
incident is being investigated...

708
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:33,515
by Gangnam Police Station.

709
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:35,445
- The janitor turned himself in...
- Sang A.

710
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:38,015
- Sang A. Come here.
- And confessed to his crime.

711
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,515
- What is it?
- The janitor, Park, claims...

712
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:41,956
- Please stop yelling.
- That he had been insulted...

713
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,849
- I can't use the bathroom at night.
- By the victim continuously...

714
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,055
- The culprit has turned himself in.
- And committed the crime...

715
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:49,050
- I mean Ro Na's case.
- On impulse.

716
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:51,619
- What? Who is the culprit?
- Having worked for many years...

717
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,736
You know, the sharp-faced man
who is always smiling.

718
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,035
The janitor.

719
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:57,829
Do you mean Mr. Park?

720
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,429
No way. Why would a nice man
like him do such a thing?

721
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:04,840
This is why you can't judge
a book by its cover.

722
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:09,015
He probably has
multiple personality disorder.

723
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:10,940
Oh, I see.

724
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:14,139
I'm relieved that
the culprit has been caught.

725
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,486
Otherwise,

726
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,219
Yoon Hee and Yoon Chul
would have gone mad...

727
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:21,219
and grilled every kid
at Hera Palace.

728
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,760
The school really needs to be
more considerate of the seniors.

729
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:29,989
But it just can't be Mr. Park.

730
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,800
He was too scared
to even touch a dead bird.

731
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,130
He would never harm a person.

732
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,015
What was your motive? A grudge?

733
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:40,739
Or were you after money?

734
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,409
The kid looked down on me...

735
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:46,210
and insulted me continuously.

736
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,155
- So on the spur of the moment...
- Do you mean it was not planned?

737
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:50,880
What is going on?

738
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,155
Why is Mr. Park the culprit?

739
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:56,265
It's okay, Eun Byeol.
Don't worry about anything.

740
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,159
Why him, of all people?

741
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:01,929
He's always been so nice to us!

742
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,800
I feel terrible.

743
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,599
What am I going to do now?

744
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:15,445
According to Gangnam Police Station,

745
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:18,856
Park has confessed
to both his motive and method.

746
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,816
The investigation results...

747
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,150
- Mr. Park.
- Will be announced soon.

748
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,570
Stop drinking.

749
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,340
Leave me alone.

750
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:53,980
I can't stand being sober.

751
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,880
Why didn't you tell me
it was going to be Mr. Park?

752
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,250
I was closer to him...

753
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:04,659
than to my own father.

754
00:56:04,889 --> 00:56:07,460
I know. That's why
I'm doing my best...

755
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,760
to reduce his sentence.

756
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,400
I feel like a monster.

757
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,440
I feel like it's all my fault.
It's driving me crazy.

758
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:22,909
Criticize me if you want.

759
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:26,340
I know you want to ask me
why I hid away Eun Byeol...

760
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,280
if I was going to end up like this.

761
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,219
Fine.

762
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:38,260
You may be right.

763
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:42,760
I can't stand myself.

764
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,429
I said, stop drinking.
This isn't going to change anything.

765
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,309
Every night, in my dream,
Ro Na wakes up.

766
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,239
It makes me so anxious.

767
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,710
If Ro Na wakes up,

768
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,820
all my efforts come to nothing.

769
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,289
Eun Byeol will be arrested.

770
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:15,460
I'm scared. I'm horrified.

771
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,000
It's killing me.

772
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:21,099
Neither Eun Byeol nor I
will be able to handle it.

773
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,780
Pull yourself together.

774
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,780
We must protect Eun Byeol.

775
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,559
- What are you doing?
- Are you sure...

776
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:48,059
you can protect Eun Byeol?

777
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,239
I'm going to protect her
with my life.

778
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:12,750
Even if that means you have
to kill Bae Ro Na?

779
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:19,789
Promise me that
you'll protect Eun Byeol.

780
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,489
That you'll do whatever it takes...

781

- Seo Jin.

785
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,840
All this happened...

786
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:39,880
because of the things
we did in the past.

chance that Ro Na will wake up,

that chance might...

790
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,360
make both Yoon Hee and us miserable.

Yes.

to my daughter?

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

Everyone feels sorry
for the janitor...

and thinks that
he must have had a reason.

819

criticized even after she died.
