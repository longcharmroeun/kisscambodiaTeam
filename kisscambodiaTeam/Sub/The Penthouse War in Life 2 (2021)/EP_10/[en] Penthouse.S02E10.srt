00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,349
Amazing!

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,829
Seo Jin, you look beautiful.

3
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,829
You truly look like a newlywed!

4
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,459
How much did that dress cost?

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
The pink looks perfect on you.

6
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,198
Why did she blow
so much money on a dress?

7
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:42,559
Especially since who knows
how long this marriage will last?

8
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:45,909
Are you happy?

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,839
Extremely.

10
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,079
I hope it last forever.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,019
Thank you for coming, Yoon Hee.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,019
We have
such an unusual relationship.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,790
We worked together,

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,559
we're both Hera Club members,

15
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,189
you were classmates
with my wife, whom I love,

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,189
and Ro Na was friends with my kids.

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,170
Why are you bringing up Ro Na
on a day like this?

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,799
My mistake. I apologize.

19
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:16,210
I'm sure you're still distraught
over losing your precious child.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,279
It's fine.

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,949
Congratulations.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,520
(Gangnam Police Station)

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,918
Did you really pay him
to give a fake confession?

24
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,489
Are the accusations true?

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,959
Why did you do it?

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,399
Tell us!

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Give us a statement!

28
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,968
Thank you, members of Hera Club,

29
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,799
for coming to bless us
on our marriage.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,509
We will love, respect,
and cherish each other.

31
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,879
Ms. Cheon,
you should say something too.

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,679
Why do you look like that?

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,180
You look like you're
being dragged into slave labor.

34
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,880
I know. You're as pale as a ghost.

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,690
Are you feeling sick?

36
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:06,758
- Well...
- She was too nervous last night...

37
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,228
to sleep a wink.

38
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,960
She's too sensitive.

39
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,930
Are you okay?

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
Hang in there, it'll be over soon.

41
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,330
We should make
a toast together though.

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,170
Assemblyman Lee.
Would you do the honors?

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,339
- You're so cool.
- Shall I?

44
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,180
Actually, every couple for whom
I gave a toast...

45
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,149
ended up going to divorce court...

46
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,379
and became enemies.

47
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,050
Amazingly,

48
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,990
their marriages came to
a crashing halt within a year.

49
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,390
However,
these two will be different.

50
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:40,890
Let's drink to them.

51
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,529
To a beautiful...

52
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,599
It's my mom.

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,770
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,010
Ms. Mi Ja,
your man Kyu Jin is working.

55
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:00,480
What? Dr. Ha...

56
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,779
is Bae Ro Na's real killer?

57
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:07,819
What was that?

58
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,919
The real killer? Who?

59
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,089
He just said Dr. Ha killed Ro Na.

60
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,330
Dr. Ha is a murderer?

61
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,598
That gentle Dr. Ha that we know?

62
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,528
Hey! Turn on the TV.

63
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:21,800
Hurry!

64
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,029
What's going on?

65
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,139
A new suspect was arrested...

66
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,308
for the murder of Bae Ro Na.

67
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,468
This suspect was disclosed to be...

68
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,778
the victim's stepfather,
and has caused...

69
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,409
an outrage.

70
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,209
Ha, who is the Korean representative
of a famous...

71
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,549
foreign pharmaceutical company,

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,949
bribed someone to confess
to the murder...

73
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,849
- to cover up his crime.
- No.

74
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,419
- No!
- Gangnam Police state...

75
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,588
- Why are you so shocked?
- That he named the real killer.

76
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,359
- He has...
- They arrested Ha...

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,899
- nothing to do with you anymore.
- As he tried to flee the country.

78
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,699
The motive has yet to be determined.

79
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,300
You...

80
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,699
How do you like my wedding gift?

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,068
I wanted to surprise you.

82
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,739
He has not admitted the crime yet,

83
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,180
and has exercised his right
to remain silent.

84
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,799
(Residents Garage)

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,570
(Residents Garage)

86
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,109
Eun Byeol.

87
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,710
Eun Byeol!

88
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:44,849
Are you okay?

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm okay.

90
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,190
Take me to the police station. Now.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,260
Where's Mom? Where is she?

92
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,129
She's at her wedding.

93
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,699
It should be over soon.

94
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,070
Wedding? With whom?

95
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,239
Whom else? Seok Kyung's dad.

96
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,010
They really got married?

97
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,950
After kicking me out to the US?

98
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,010
You didn't know?

99
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,380
I shouldn't have said anything.

100
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,520
Eun Byeol. Don't cry.

101
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,419
You have me.

102
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:27,159
I won't abandon you.

103
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,960
It's Seok Hoon.

104
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,270
Don't let him in.

105
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,668
I don't want to see him.

106
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,270
Don't let him in here again.

107
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:41,940
Seok Hoon's here.

108
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,978
Get out.
I have nothing to say to you.

109
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,219
What are you doing? Did something
happen between you two?

110
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,289
You got your memory back,
didn't you?

111
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,179
You remember, don't you?

112
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,849
You jerk!

113
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,049
Was it all a lie?

114
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:58,719
When you asked me out...

115
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,460
and when you said you liked me?

116
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,529
What were you trying to get
out of me that you lied to me?

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,460
I want to hear the truth.

118
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,799
What did you do to Ro Na?

119
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,400
Tell me.

120
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:13,969
Tell me.

121
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,609
Tell me right now!

122
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,479
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

123
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,049
Stop talking about Ro Na!
I'm sick of it!

124
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,249
Ms. Jin. Kick him out! Now!

125
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,489
Get out.

126
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,559
She can't get upset.

127
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,390
Excuse me! Come help!

128
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,529
Eun Byeol. I'll uncover the truth.

129
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,830
I'll find out why Ro Na died!

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,099
Eun Byeol!

131
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,298
Why did Ro Na die?

132
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:47,039
- Eun Byeol.
- Ms. Jin.

133
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,010
What do I do?

134
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,109
I remember everything.

135
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,679
What I did...

136
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:58,679
during the festival.

137
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,319
How could he kill his stepdaughter?

138
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,750
And then he asks for a divorce
and moves out?

139
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,820
That rotten jerk.
That scum of the earth.

140
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,460
Are you okay, Yoon Hee?

141
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,999
I knew Yoon Chul was a jerk.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,528
Why did he have to
get involved with that jerk?

143
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,629
(Gangnam Police Station)

144
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,900
Yoon Hee. Divorce him right now.

145
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,309
I'll get you
100 million dollars in alimony.

146
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,139
I still can't believe it.

147
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,538
How could he do that
when he has Eun Byeol?

148
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,309
He probably did it for her.

149
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,278
They were rivals, you know that.

150
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,848
Was it to get Eun Byeol
the grand prize?

151
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,690
Is that why he did that to her?

152
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,620
That happened to Ro Na
during the Cheong A Art Festival.

153
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,658
That's what makes him frightening.

154
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,060
But seriously, poor Eun Byeol.

155
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,299
Her dad's a murderer
and her mom's a scammer.

156
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,599
Chairman Joo.
Did you really not know?

157
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,070
Not at all.

158
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,099
I'm in shock as well.

159
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,339
(Gangnam Police Station)

160
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,140
Is it true
that Ha Yoon Chul made you...

161
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,310
give a false confession?

162
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,479
Yes.

163
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,649
In exchange for
500,000 dollars in cash...

164
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,650
and his promise to provide
treatments to my sick child.

165
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,060
You didn't kill her, did you?

166
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,700
Who hired you?

167
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,630
Was it Ha Yoon Chul?

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,469
No. No one hired me.

169
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,440
I... I really did kill her.

170
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,750
You refuse to talk.

171
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,659
It was all...

172
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,590
because he made me do it.

173
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,798
He promised me...

174
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,119
money for my family to live on
for the rest of their lives.

175
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,400
I couldn't refuse...

176
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,939
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,079
Ha Yoon Chul. Do you admit
to murdering Bae Ro Na?

178
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,480
I do.

179
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,020
I killed...

180
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,819
Bae Ro Na.

181
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,458
I can't give you that much time...

182
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,230
since reporters are outside.

183
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,360
I know.

184
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,069
Thank you, chief.

185
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,240
Yoon Chul.

186
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,909
What... What happened to you?

187
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,318
Why did you come here?
People will get suspicious.

188
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,390
Go home.

189
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,318
I think Dan Tae threatened Mr. Park.

190
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,189
I thought he'd bury it
if I married him.

191
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,529
I really didn't know he'd do this.

192
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,260
I was expecting it.

193
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,659
Did Eun Byeol leave?

194
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,929
She came home.

195
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,969
Ms. Jin called and said
she was with her.

196
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,099
Send her to the US.
It's dangerous for her to be here.

197
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,809
Worry about yourself.

198
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,139
Just deny it.

199
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,439
I'll persuade Mr. Park somehow.

200
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,209
I admitted it already.

201
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:19,949
Are you mad?

202
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,319
Do you plan to live as a murderer?

203
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,689
It's true...

204
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:27,819
that I tried to kill her.

205
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,299
I decided to harm her...

206
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,799
and visited her in the hospital.

207
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,140
Even though I couldn't
bring myself to do it,

208
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,270
I've been tormented by guilt.

209
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,039
I'm relieved that
things turned out this way.

210
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,980
This is not what I wanted...

211
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,549
when I married Dan Tae.

212
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,260
Don't worry about me.
Pull yourself together.

213
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,528
Dan Tae, that jerk,
wouldn't stop here.

214
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,900
He'll drag Eun Byeol
into this any moment.

215
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm going to kill that jerk.

216
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,140
I'll take the fall.

217
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,079
You protect Eun Byeol.

218
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,510
Can you do that?

219
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,990
(Gangnam Police Station)

220
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,299
How do you feel?

221
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,870
Your ex-husband
has turned into a criminal.

222
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,010
I've been curious.

223
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,980
You were having feelings
for Yoon Chul again.

224
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,309
So what made you
still marry Dan Tae?

225
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,069
Who says I was having
feelings for him?

226
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,720
That's not true.

227
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,120
I guess I don't have to get blood
on my hands anymore.

228
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,229
Dan Tae is going to destroy...

229
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,230
your family himself.

230
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,329
What?

231
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,970
Do you think
your daughter can be safe...

232
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,970
if Yoon Chul goes to prison?

233
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:27,109
It'll only tear you apart.

234
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,179
The truth doesn't change.

235
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,919
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,049
I have to go and
meet with the detective now.

237
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,630
He is going to hold a briefing
about who really killed Ro Na.

238
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,860
I wonder how many more times
the culprit will change.

239
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,199
No way.

240
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,740
Does she know?

241
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,720
You're back.

242
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:11,350
I heard that Dr. Ha
is at the police station.

243
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,958
How's Eun Byeol?

244
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,860
She's not coming out of her room.

245
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,999
She's in shock after hearing
about your wedding.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,629
Why did you tell her?

247
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,729
She already had a lot to deal with.

248
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,970
It seems like her memories
have come back.

249
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,109
What did you just say?

250
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,208
She remembers
what happened that day.

251
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,140
The day of Cheong A Art Festival.

252
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,548
She came back home early...

253
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,279
wearing a dress covered in blood.

254
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,390
How do you know that?

255
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:46,620
There are no secrets
between me and Eun Byeol.

256
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,659
You didn't know?

257
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,490
She feels closer to me than to you.

258
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,669
But don't worry.

259
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm on Eyn Byeol's side.

260
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,169
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

261
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,760
Eun Byeol.

262
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,529
About my wedding...

263
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,899
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
beforehand. I...

264
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,360
I don't want to hear it.

265
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,969
I need to study. I need to get into
Seoul National University.

266
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,569
That's what you want, right?

267
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,199
Look at me when I talk to you!

268
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,470
Why aren't you asking about Dad?

269
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:40,938
Don't you want to know?

270
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,549
He killed Ro Na, right?

271
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,949
He should pay for what he did.

272
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,220
What?

273
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:50,590
Say that again.

274
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,929
I saw everything on the news.

275
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,558
He confessed.

276
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,860
Isn't that what
you and Dad wanted all along?

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,230
That's why you erased
all my memories.

278
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,600
Have your memories...

279
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,568
really come back?

280
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,039
Did you think you could
get rid of my memories?

281
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,879
You should have done it
more properly.

282
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,250
You should have erased
everything completely!

283
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,379
Now that Dad is
taking the fall for me,

284
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,720
am I supposed to feel grateful?

285
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,760
Is that all you have to say?

286
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,089
After everything your dad
and I have done for you?

287
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,158
Did I ask you to do that?

288
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,889
I never wanted that!

289
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,799
It was what you wanted,
so why do you hit me?

290
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,198
I'm a lot stronger...

291
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,870
than you think.

292
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,308
Why did you even give me
all these medications?

293
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:47,380
I would have forgotten everything
if you had just told me to.

294
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,880
- Eun Byeol!
- What?

295
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,480
Didn't you know I was a monster?

296
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,489
The day you abandoned Grandpa
and ran away,

297
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,620
I'm the one who left him
dying alone in the rain.

298
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,689
I'm the one who memorized
English words at his funeral.

299
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,759
So how could I possibly stay sane?

300
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,829
You're the one who did this to me!

301
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,140
Still, I didn't tell anyone.

302
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,510
I hated you for making Grandpa die.

303
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,880
But you're still my mom.

304
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,610
I should protect you.
That's why I've kept my mouth shut.

305
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,650
So how could you go
and marry Seok Hoon's dad?

306
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,389
You didn't know
I have feelings for Seok Hoon?

307
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,990
What are you talking about?
You have feelings for Seok Hoon?

308
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,860
Is there anything you know about me?

309
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,669
Other than my grades
and penalty points,

310
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,770
you know absolutely
nothing about me.

311
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,669
Get out. Get out right now!

312
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,809
Get out!

313
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,789
Eun Byeol! Stop!

314
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,319
Stop! What are you doing?

315
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:09,229
- Eun Byeol, no! Stop!
- I'm going to kill myself.

316
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,658
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

317
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,800
- Please don't do this, Eun Byeol.
- Mom.

318
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,469
Honestly, I'm scared.

319
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:24,640
What if I get arrested?

320
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,580
Is my life over?

321
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,478
No. We'll find a way.

322
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,918
Do you think I can't protect you?

323
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,150
I won't let anything happen
to you and Dad.

324
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,649
Trust me.

325
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,918
I didn't mean to kill her.

326
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,159
I swear.

327
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,829
I remember what happened clearly.

328
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,659
I got upset and swung the trophy.

329
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,600
But then Ro Na fell down the stairs.

330
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,070
That's when I heard a phone ring...

331
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,070
and came to my senses.

332
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:05,079
You heard a phone ring?

333
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,350
I still hear it in my ear.
It's driving me crazy.

334
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,658
Mi fa sol fa mi mi

335
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,929
Mi re ti re mi

336
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,890
Do you mean...

337
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,299
there was someone else there?

338
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,729
I don't know.

339
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,640
I panicked and ran away.

340
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:30,109
If Ro Na had been transported
to the hospital immediately,

341
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,169
she wouldn't have died.

342
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,238
I only hurt her shoulder.

343
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,409
I still can't believe that she died.

344
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,019
Her shoulder? Are you sure
it was her shoulder, not her head?

345
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,248
It was definitely her shoulder.

346
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:46,089
Ro Na died after getting hit
in the head with the trophy.

347
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,890
No. I never hit her in the head.

348
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,299
- I'm sure of it.
- Do you remember it clearly?

349
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,099
I remember it so clearly
that it horrifies me!

350
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,140
Why can't you trust me?

351
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,509
Can you tell me...

352
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,609
everything in detail?

353
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,248
Everything that happened that day,
from beginning to end.

354
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,550
Take your time.
Don't leave anything out.

355
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:58,958
Na Ae Gyo and Jung Doo Man...

356
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,428
aren't just business partners.

357
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,830
There's more to it.

358
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,509
What key is this?

359
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,688
Have you been waiting long?

360
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,419
What took you so long?

361
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,590
The traffic was terrible.

362
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,800
I heard Oh Yoon Hee
put her property up for sale.

363
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,070
I'm going to start the bid tomorrow.

364
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,409
I have a question for you.

365
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,280
When did you quit smoking?

366
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,949
Did I not tell you?

367
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,620
I quit because I couldn't stop
coughing.

368
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,050
Is that right?

369
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,620
Good for you.

370
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,429
Maybe it's because I haven't
seen you in a while.

371
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,540
You feel...

372
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,769
a little different.

373
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,040
The way you hold your glass.

374
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,909
You always held your glass
with your left hand,

375
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,719
but you're holding it
with your right.

376
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,448
You got angry at me when I asked you
to change yourself...

377
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:32,836
to be right-handed just so that you
can be like Shim Su Ryeon.

378
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,890
Having had to pretend
I'm Shim Su Ryeon my whole life,

379
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,859
I guess I got used to using
my right hand.

380
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,929
Right.

381
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,159
I see.

382
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,149
Does it make you feel better
if you check?

383
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,380
Sorry. I've just been on edge.

384
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,679
You know how paranoid I get.

385
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,050
I check and double-check.

386
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,919
Your butterfly looks
especially attractive today.

387
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,429
Should I sleep here tonight?

388
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,999
Don't get on Seo Jin's nerves
from the first night.

389
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:16,569
If you want Cheong A Group
in your hands,

390
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,600
you need to have some self-control.

391
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,329
Spending a night out
on the first night of our marriage?

392
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,629
Don't you think that's too mean?

393
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,739
Isn't the wedding
just a formality?

394
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,340
What do you mean?

395
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,938
I'm ready to live with you
happily ever after.

396
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:01,509
Don't touch me.

397
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:03,908
Thanks to your surprise,

398
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:05,749
Eun Byeol couldn't leave for the US.

399
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,919
I'm going to stay at my home
with Eun Byeol for a while.

400
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,079
That's what I've come to tell you.

401
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,790
"My home"?

402
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,130
That's heartbreaking.

403
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,928
We've signed the papers.

404
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,899
We're legally married.

405
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,299
This is your home.

406
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,630
Where do you think you're going?

407
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,140
I'll give you...

408
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,570
Cheong A Constructions
as you wanted.

409
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,479
I can just think of it like I got
into a marriage fraud.

410
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,650
In return, I want
Eun Byeol's necklace back.

411
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,518
I think you're getting it all wrong.

412
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,949
I'm the upper hand here.

413
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,119
You're not in the place to be
barking like a crazy dog.

414
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,860
You lunatic. Give me the necklace!

415
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,070
This is our marriage manual.

416
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,630
Read it and follow along well.

417
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,268
(Marriage Manual)

418
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:06,679
I'm going to leave
all the house duties to you.

419
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,209
Of course, I've fired
all the housemaids already.

420
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,448
- What?
- To be a good stepmother...

421
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:16,219
to Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung,

422
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,349
I figured you'd be better off
without the helpers.

423
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,929
Of course, you can't meet
Eun Byeol without my permission.

424
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,300
Have you gone insane?
Eun Byeol is my daughter.

425
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,399
I'm the only one who can
take care of her right now!

426
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,399
I don't care about any of that!

427
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,839
Why should I be worried
about Ha Yoon Chul's kid?

428
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,610
Don't you remember what happened
to Su Ryeon?

429
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,509
I'm sorry. I guess...

430
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,120
I guess I got a little upset.

431
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,790
See? You should've just listened.

432
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,919
I've given it some thought,

433
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,900
and the Cheong A Medical Center
looks like a solid deal.

434
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,968
Why don't you hand that over too?

435
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,249
Are you a gangster or something?

436
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,339
You'll never have the Medical Center
or the Foundation!

437
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,569
Don't get so mad.

438
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,070
You're scaring me, lady.

439
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,209
What are you?

440
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,050
Was your goal to take
my money from the start?

441
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,219
Maybe you underestimated me,

442
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,989
but I'm Cheon Seo Jin,
Cheong A Group's eldest daughter.

443
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,790
I won't give anything else
other than Cheong A Constructions.

444
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,229
Be thankful and stop dreaming.

445
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,099
Where are your manners?

446
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,269
This is a warning, ma'am.

447
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,129
Let's get a divorce.

448
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,799
I can't live a single day
with a man like you.

449
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,139
Get the papers ready right now.

450
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,309
You idiot, how many times
need I tell you...

451
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,938
that I get to start and end
the relationship?

452
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:48,810
You're the idiot here!

453
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,279
I'm Cheon Seo Jin.
You think I'll go down by myself?

454
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,079
I'm going to let the world know
that you killed Shim Su Ryeon.

455
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,689
You piece of garbage
and a murderer!

456
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,360
You need a good lesson, ma'am.

457
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,870
Let me go!

458
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:14,400
You garbage! Let me go!

459
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
Let go!

460
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,040
Let go of me!

461
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,429
What?

462
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,900
Are you surprised?

463
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,669
You should've watched
what you were saying.

464
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,668
Shim Su Ryeon also died
because she didn't know her place...

465
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:52,239
and acted like a lunatic.

466
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,209
But you're going to be
another type of fun than her.

I'd like to buy that.

477
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:45,060
There are a lot of people
eyeing that property.

478
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,199
There are dozens who have paid
provisional deposits.

479
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,228
Why don't I show you something else?

480
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:54,070
I don't need anything else.

481
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,780
It has to be lot 27.

Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

485
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,689
You know that 70 percent
of the properties are ours.

486
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,459

where we can both win.

I don't plan on betraying
Joo Dan Tae,

495
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,560
so stop stalking me.

If I see you one more time,

497
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,599
I'm taking you to Joo Dan Tae.

498

There's no way you can do that.

If you were going to do that,

500
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,099
you would've exposed me
to Joo Dan Tae already.

502
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,039
Should I go and do that?

503

You don't trust Joo Dan Tae
right now either.

He abused your children...

506

and killed his wife.

507
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,049
Do you want to end up dead
like Shim Su Ryeon?

508
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,320
Mind your own business!
Why do you care if I die or not?

509
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,820
That's none of your business.

Yes.

539
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,239
and side with that Ha Yoon Chul?

540
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:22,679
I'll make sure to get revenge...

541
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,650
on everything you've done.

542
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,719
You better get excited.

543
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,019
Open the door, Joo Dan Tae!

544
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,659
Joo Dan Tae!

545
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,909
Shim Su Ryeon,

546
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,820
is this your revenge on me?

547
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,290
Handing me a trashy man
like Joo Dan Tae over?

548
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,128
(Seoul Gangnam Police Station)

549
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,529
(Silence)

550
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,000
I won't take long.

551
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,409
We're married on paper,

552
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,170
so it only makes sense
that I visit once at least.

553
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,809
Did you hate Ro Na that much?

554
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:38,119
So much that you wanted to kill her?

555
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,730
I have nothing to say.

556
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,829
It was all for Eun Byeol.

557
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,829
There's nothing bad in trying
to protect your own child.

558
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,069
You would've done the same
if you were me.

559
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,000
Yes, I was like that.

560
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:02,510
I did everything...

561
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,780
if it was for Ro Na.

562
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:08,379
But later, I learned...

563
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,079
that if you do something bad,

564
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,848
you reap the consequences.

565
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,260
No matter how much you try
to run away, it'll haunt you.

566
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,389
Don't you ever think...

567
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,529
that what you've done for Eun Byeol
was the best you could've done.

568
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,869
What about my Eun Byeol?
She did nothing wrong.

569
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:38,540
This is the divorce paper.
I'm submitting it today.

570
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,750
It seems...

571
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,720
like we're really over.

572
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,159
Even for a short period of time,

573
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,530
I'd hoped that Ro Na, you, and I
would live a happy life.

574
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,700
I was stupid.

575
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:03,540
My Ro Na...

576
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,440
was so full of love,

577
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,839
just like you.

578
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:17,250
What?

579
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,350
I'm going to do my absolute best...

580
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:25,959
to make sure that you suffer
the worst consequences.

581
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,199
I'll make you regret so much
that your heart will tear apart.

582
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,769
You deserve that.

583
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,740
You killed your own child.

584
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:45,339
What are you saying?

585
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
I'm sorry for not having told you
any earlier.

586
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:50,979
But...

587
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,919
what a relief.

588
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:57,589
Thank goodness Ro Na didn't know
any of this before she left.

589
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,760
Had she known that
her birth father killed her,

590
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,100
imagine how heartbroken
she would've been.

591
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:09,499
Oh Yoon Hee!

592
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:13,069
What are you saying?

593
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,950
Let me make my final request.

594
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:25,519
Apologize...

595
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:30,490
to Ro Na sincerely for just once.

596
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,489
I feel so bad for my daughter,
who never even got...

597
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,430
to be treated like your daughter.

598
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,560
You can do that much, can't you?

599
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:42,330
Yoon Hee. Tell me right now.

600
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:43,938
You're lying, right?

601
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:46,310
You're lying to make me suffer!

602
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,839
Please.

603
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,239
Don't go, Yoon Hee!
What are you saying?

604
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,179
What do you mean?

605
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,518
Yoon Hee! That's not true, is it?

606
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,188
Yoon Hee, tell me right now!

607
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:01,918
Tell me the truth!

608
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:04,759
Yoon Hee! Don't go!

609
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,728
Yoon Hee, please!

610
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:10,059
Don't go!

611
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,259
What are you saying?

612
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,200
What do you mean?

613
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,339
(Silence)

614
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,740
Get the smartest lawyers
at the firm.

615
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,708
Get the press ready.

616
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,580
Be on standby.

617
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:31,049
You really never know people.

618
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,288
How could Dr. Ha do that?

619
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,619
He killed Yoon Hee's daughter...

620
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,818
and tried to divorce her
because he felt guilty?

621
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,688
I'm getting goosebumps.

622
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:41,989
There's no way that nerd killed her.

623
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,559
He's a complete chicken.

624
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,159
What made you change your mind?

625
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,998
You were the one who was
most angered by the news.

626
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,398
That's because my Yoon Hee
was there too.

627
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:55,339
Anyway, he doesn't have the guts
to kill someone.

628
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,108
I'm putting together a team
of lawyers for Yoon Chul...

629
00:36:58,109 --> 00:36:59,878
with the best lawyers
at my father's firm.

630
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,180
Are you insane?

631
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,449
If people hear that
you've helped a murderer,

632
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,918
you'll lose the election for sure!

633
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,489
Did you not see yesterday...

634
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,059
how Seo Jin raced out of the hall
as soon as she heard the news?

635
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,119
What does that mean?

636
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,329
She can give up all of her money
for Ha Yoon Chul.

637
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,358
And my firm needs to take
advantage of that.

638
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,299
You think Ms. Cheon was shot
in her head or something?

639
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,199
Why would she give her everything
for her ex-husband?

640
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,899
I just get a feeling...

641
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:25,398
that this one case will make me...

642
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:29,010
a filthy rich man. I just know it.

643
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:31,339
Such nonsense.

644
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:34,479
Just drink this.

645
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:38,748
Our home is the only home
without maids in Hera Palace.

646
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:41,389
That's why I'm planning
all of this to get money.

647
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,719
Once Cheonsoo District's prices
skyrocket,

648
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,459
we'll move to the penthouse
on the 130th floor.

649
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,489
The penthouse? Really?

650
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,129
If we get about 5 to 6 units,

651
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:53,069
The rent there alone
would be almost 300,000 dollars.

652
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Kyu Jin.

653
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,240
Cheers.

654
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:06,010
That's why we need to
put our all into this.

655
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,909
I need money.

656
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,648
The price keeps going up every day,

657
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:11,350
but I don't have the money.

658
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,050
Why are you so lovable?

659
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,830
Is this a trend?

660
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:28,300
So this is the furniture company
that Shim Su Ryeon ran?

661
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,370
The famous lot 27
in Cheonsoo District.

662
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,810
It's quite large.

663
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,410
I've wanted to see it myself.

664
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,050
I kind of want it.

665
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,950
I want to run it.

666
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,619
It does well in sales.

667
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,319
There's a reason
everyone wants this lot.

668
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,019
Did something good happen?

669
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:52,689
Why did you bring me here?

670
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:56,089
It's to apologize
for being irritable yesterday.

671
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,339
Everything is going perfectly
according to my plan.

672
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,039
Cheong A Constructions is
already mine.

673
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,939
And I should get
Cheong A Medical Center easily too.

674
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,640
The purchase of this lot
going smoothly, right?

675
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,478
I plan to raise the price
a little now.

676
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:15,479
How?

677
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,318
I played a little game
so that people will smell money...

678
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,390
and gather like bees to honey.

679
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,659
The value of land isn't determined.

680
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,390
It's made.

681
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:27,458
As we've always done.

682
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,859
You never disappoint, Ae Gyo.

683
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,700
Congrats, babe.

684
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,568
Joo Dan Tae Village,
your lifelong dream,

685
00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:37,769
is finally coming to fruition.

686
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,109
And you won't have to live
in hiding anymore.

687
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,709
You can stand beside me publicly.

688
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,350
I have something for you.

689
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,550
Here.

690
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:52,950
What is it?

691
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,649
A gift?

692
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,859
Oh my gosh. What is this?

693
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,430
It's Seo Jin's lifeline.

694
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,399
You hold onto it
until the stock matter is finished.

695
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,629
She's searching for it
like a madwoman.

696
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:15,010
Is this that necklace? The evidence?

697
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:20,010
Does Cheon Seo Jin know?

698
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:21,249
What?

699
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,979
That her daughter didn't kill her.

700
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:28,390
What do you mean?

701
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,789
Don't be so shocked.

702
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,959
You can't fool me.

703
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,330
Cheon Seo Jin is more naive
than I gave her credit for.

704
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:42,628
Right when you were going after
Cheong A Group,

705
00:40:42,629 --> 00:40:45,069
Cheon Seo Jin's daughter
killed a person.

706
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,569
Was that really a coincidence?

707
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,439
Who gained the most from that?

708
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,410
You did.

709
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,289
Did you kill her?

710
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,649
Ae Gyo!

711
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:14,899
(Mr. Ma Doo Ki)

712
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Excuse me.

713
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:21,510
How did it go?

714
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,010
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,938
The judges were too adamant.

716
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:27,878
I couldn't influence them.

717
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:29,879

00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:31,419
Who wins the grand prize?

719
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,519
The grand prize is going to
Bae Ro Na.

720
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:35,819
Bae Ro Na?

721
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:38,720
Why her of all people?

722
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,990
Hey, you. Doo Ki.
Can't you do anything right?

723
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:43,659
Seok Kyung is getting the gold...

724
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,530
She can get that easily
without your help.

725
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:49,870
Our deal ends here. Got that?

726
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,708
She's just as annoying as her mom.

727
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,810

Seriously.

731
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,789

741
00:42:49,189 --> 00:42:53,260
Why must a loser like you
win the grand prize?

742

If not for you,

743
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,910
the free pass to Seoul University
would be Seok Kyung's.

What are you saying?

745
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:11,919
Can't you give in a little
for Seok Kyung?

746
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:15,689
I really love my daughter...

747
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,560
a lot.

748
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:26,729

749
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,129
Don't kill me.

750
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:32,470
Don't kill me.

751
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:49,419
It always annoyed me
whenever I saw you.

752
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,060
But...

753
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:56,160

755

Who knew you'd
actually help me like this?

756
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,539
If I play my cards right,

757
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:15,609
I can get rid of
two annoying witches at once.

758
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,180

What gave you that misconception?

777
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,879
Is it really a misconception?

778

Does anyone know Joo Dan Tae
better than I do?

Regardless,

00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:06,789
Ro Na was very useful.

Just as much as Seol A.

right at the most opportune times,

00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,949
33 million.

896
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,789
Is that woman out of her mind?

897
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:41,288
Mother, we should give up.
We're already over budget.

898
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:44,358
Don't be greedy, okay?

899
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,430
We're not at 33 million.
Can anyone give me more?

900
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,199
Is it being sold for 33 million?

901
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,899
It's not like me to give up here.

902
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,370
I can sell it to Chairman Joo
for double the price later.

903
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:57,439
40 million.

904
00:56:58,479 --> 00:57:00,608
- 40 million?
- Honey.

905
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:02,850
Has he lost his mind?

906
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:07,349
Sell it to me. I'll pay 40 million.

907
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,550
We're now at 40 million.

908
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:12,059
Is everyone else giving up?

909
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,929
All right. 40 million, it is.

910
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,429
The property is sold...

911
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,729
50 million.

912
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,370
Now 50 million.

913
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:28,339
I mean, what about the market price?

914
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,108
The difference is getting
too big now!

915
00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:35,108
It's a superb location,
but this is ridiculous.

916
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:36,878
You'll lose money
when you sell it later.

917
00:57:36,879 --> 00:57:38,518
Don't be an amateur.

918
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:40,449
I get to decide
what I do with my money.

919
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,390
Worry about yourselves.

920
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,990
Well?

921
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,228
If no one else is bidding,
why don't we stop here?

922
00:57:48,229 --> 00:57:49,958
I have bills to pay.

923
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:51,530
Where would I get
50 million dollars?

924
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:54,160
I give up.

925
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,530
Mom.

926
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:58,069
(Cheonsoo District
Starting bid: 10 million dollars)

927
00:57:58,669 --> 00:58:00,769
Anyway, who are you?

928
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,650
Are you an individual investor?

929
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,039
I'm with Cheong A Group's
Investment and Development Team.

930
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,010
Cheong A Group?

931
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,280
Chairman Joo sent you?

932
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:15,120
What? Are you toying with us
with your money?

933
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,430
Here's the five million dollars
for the deposit.

934
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:21,588
(Bank check for 1,000 dollars)

935
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:24,129
I'll sign the contract tomorrow
with the owner.

936
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,999
I'll bring the remaining
45 million dollars tomorrow as well.

937
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,269
Sold for 50 million dollars.

938
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,310
Who is that woman?

939
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,939
She's from Cheong A Group.

940
00:58:39,479 --> 00:58:43,009
Chairman Joo is going to get
all the good land again.

941
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,279
This stinks.

942
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,579
I wanted to crush that jerk
Joo Dan Tae...

943
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:50,149
so that I wouldn't have to put up
with his arrogance anymore.

944
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,890
I'm so angry.

945
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:55,560
But does that woman seem familiar?

946
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:59,999
She has a cold air about her.
It's very familiar.

947
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,870
But I can't remember
where I saw her before.

948
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,470
Right?

949
00:59:05,899 --> 00:59:06,899
Yes...

950
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:32,959
Hey.

951
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,899
Finally, lot 27 is ours.

952
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:39,269
I think 50 million dollars is
too high.

953
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:41,919
I feel like Oh Yoon Hee
came out the only winner.

954
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,609
Starting tomorrow, the lands we own
will shoot up in value.

955
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:48,509
Cheonsoo District will blow up.

956
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,810
I guarantee it.

957
00:59:56,149 --> 00:59:58,560
My car's here. Talk to you later.

958
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,300
Do you still have something to say?

959
01:00:10,129 --> 01:00:11,339
I keep...

960
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:14,939
I keep getting a feeling
that you're not a bad person.

961
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,779
But seeing how money-crazy you are,

962
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,810
you really are one of
Joo Dan Tae's people.

963
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,649
I won't hope for anything
from you...

964
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,878
or try to talk to you again.

965
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:26,850
I hope I will never...

966
01:00:26,979 --> 01:00:29,589
see you again.

967
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,560
I feel so sorry for Su Ryeon.

968
01:00:32,419 --> 01:00:35,629
She was too sweet
to be used by someone like you...

969
01:00:36,959 --> 01:00:38,600
until she died.

970
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,539
Live in guilt toward Su Ryeon
for the rest of your life.

971
01:01:55,539 --> 01:01:56,640
What is this?

972
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,209
You said you wanted to see her.

973
01:01:58,810 --> 01:01:59,810
Come with me.

974
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,050
Get it.

975
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:38,949
Will you be okay?

976
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,748
Father doesn't know
that I know the secret passage.

977
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:41,850
Don't worry.

978
01:02:42,149 --> 01:02:43,950
I'm helping you because of Ms. Oh.

979
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,819
Get in already.

980
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:47,789
Get in.

981
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,859
Why did you want to see me?

982
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,329
Yoon Hee. Please save me.

983
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:27,629
I'm begging you.

984
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,430
Yoon Hee.

985
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:30,800
What are you talking about?

986
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,499
You're making no sense.

987
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,709
It really was Eun Byeol...

988
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,510
who killed Ro Na.

989
01:03:37,269 --> 01:03:38,879
Eun Byeol did it.

990
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:42,410
I've done a heinous thing
to you and to Ro Na.

991
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:43,950
But...

992
01:03:44,649 --> 01:03:46,120
there's a trap here.

993
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,189
Joo Dan Tae was involved.

994
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,490
I need you in order to find...

995
01:03:51,019 --> 01:03:52,260
Ro Na's real murderer.

996
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:54,189
Help me.

997
01:03:55,629 --> 01:03:56,859
Yoon Hee.

1000
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:35,499
It's me.

1001
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,780
These are photos of Na Ae Gyo
from the past few days.

1002
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:50,550
She didn't go anywhere unusual
other than restaurants.

1003
01:04:54,379 --> 01:04:56,589
There's no need
to monitor her anymore.

1004
01:04:57,789 --> 01:04:58,919
Yes, sir.

1005
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,100
Wait.

1006
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,220
I feel so sorry for Su Ryeon.

1007
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:38,100
She was too sweet
to be used by someone like you...

1008
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,060
until she died.

1009
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,300
Thank you...

1010
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:50,810
for remembering me.

1011
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:25,978
What are you doing?

1012
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:27,339
You're Su Ryeon.

1013
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,249
I know you're Su Ryeon.

1014
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,850
Don't try to run away.

1015
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,289
I'm sorry...

1016
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,089
it took me so long to recognize you.

1018
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:29,338
How beautiful is it to admit defeat?

Shim Su Ryeon's dead.

1020
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:32,739
I couldn't forgive myself
for going to the airport first.

1021
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,239
I will never forgive you.

1022
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,449
I can't guarantee
Eun Byeol's safety.

1023
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,248
Let me kill him myself.

1024
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:40,079
Maybe Shim Su Ryeon knew
before she died.

1025
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,588
The game's over.

1026
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:44,248
You can put the penthouse up
as collateral and get a loan.

1027
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:46,659
Did Na Ae Gyo deceive Chairman Joo?

1028
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,330
I'll kill you, Ae Gyo.

1029
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:50,990
Na Ae Gyo died last night.
